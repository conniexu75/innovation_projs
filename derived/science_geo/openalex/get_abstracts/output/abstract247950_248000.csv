https://openalex.org/W2153985161,"We review Phanerozoic sea-level changes [543 million years ago (Ma) to the present] on various time scales and present a new sea-level record for the past 100 million years (My). Long-term sea level peaked at 100 ± 50 meters during the Cretaceous, implying that ocean-crust production rates were much lower than previously inferred. Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 10 4 - to 10 6 -year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 10 7 -year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present)."
https://openalex.org/W2010238890,"The Peutz-Jegher syndrome tumor-suppressor gene encodes a protein-threonine kinase, LKB1, which phosphorylates and activates AMPK [adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase]. The deletion of LKB1 in the liver of adult mice resulted in a nearly complete loss of AMPK activity. Loss of LKB1 function resulted in hyperglycemia with increased gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. In LKB1-deficient livers, TORC2, a transcriptional coactivator of CREB (cAMP response element–binding protein), was dephosphorylated and entered the nucleus, driving the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), which in turn drives gluconeogenesis. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for TORC2 reduced PGC-1α expression and normalized blood glucose levels in mice with deleted liver LKB1, indicating that TORC2 is a critical target of LKB1/AMPK signals in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Finally, we show that metformin, one of the most widely prescribed type 2 diabetes therapeutics, requires LKB1 in the liver to lower blood glucose levels."
https://openalex.org/W1990868443,"Thousands of mammalian messenger RNAs are under selective pressure to maintain 7-nucleotide sites matching microRNAs (miRNAs). We found that these conserved targets are often highly expressed at developmental stages before miRNA expression and that their levels tend to fall as the miRNA that targets them begins to accumulate. Nonconserved sites, which outnumber the conserved sites 10 to 1, also mediate repression. As a consequence, genes preferentially expressed at the same time and place as a miRNA have evolved to selectively avoid sites matching the miRNA. This phenomenon of selective avoidance extends to thousands of genes and enables spatial and temporal specificities of miRNAs to be revealed by finding tissues and developmental stages in which messages with corresponding sites are expressed at lower levels."

Before 430,000 yr B.P., partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 lies within the range of 260 and 180 parts per million by volume. This range is almost 30% smaller than that of the last four glacial cycles; however, the apparent sensitivity between deuterium and CO2 remains stable throughout the six glacial cycles, suggesting that the relationship between CO2 and Antarctic climate remained rather constant over this interval."
https://openalex.org/W2111922856,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns to induce innate immune responses and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferons and anti-inflammatory cytokines. TLRs activate downstream effectors through adaptors that contain Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, but the mechanisms accounting for diversification of TLR effector functions are unclear. To dissect biochemically TLR signalling, we established a system for isolating signalling complexes assembled by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 as a prototypical adaptor, we identified TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) as a new component of TIR signalling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6. Using myeloid cells from TRAF3- and TRAF6-deficient mice, we show that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I interferons (IFN) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), but is dispensable for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In fact, TRAF3-deficient cells overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to defective IL-10 production. Despite their structural similarity, the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also recruited to the adaptor TRIF (Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta) and is required for marshalling the protein kinase TBK1 (also called NAK) into TIR signalling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of the IFN response."

To elucidate the role of the basal ganglia in this process, we recorded striatal neurons of monkeys who chose between left and right handle turns, based on the estimated reward probabilities of the actions. During a delay period before the choices, the activity of more than one-third of striatal projection neurons was selective to the values of one of the two actions. Fewer neurons were tuned to relative values or action choice. These results suggest representation of action values in the striatum, which can guide action selection in the basal ganglia circuit."

Under compression, the nanotubes collectively form zigzag buckles that can fully unfold to their original length upon load release. Compared with conventional low-density flexible foams, the nanotube films show much higher compressive strength, recovery rate, and sag factor, and the open-cell nature of the nanotube arrays gives excellent breathability. The nanotube films present a class of open-cell foam structures, consisting of well-arranged one-dimensional units (nanotube struts). The lightweight, highly resilient nanotube films may be useful as compliant and energy-absorbing coatings."

https://openalex.org/W2074658822,"We have identified two genes, smedwi-1 and smedwi-2 , expressed in the dividing adult stem cells (neoblasts) of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea . Both genes encode proteins that belong to the Argonaute/PIWI protein family and that share highest homology with those proteins defined by Drosophila PIWI. RNA interference (RNAi) of smedwi-2 blocks regeneration, even though neoblasts are present, irradiation-sensitive, and capable of proliferating in response to wounding; smedwi-2(RNAi) neoblast progeny migrate to sites of cell turnover but, unlike normal cells, fail at replacing aged tissue. We suggest that SMEDWI-2 functions within dividing neoblasts to support the generation of cells that promote regeneration and homeostasis."

A combined record of CH4 measured along the Dome C and the Vostok ice cores demonstrates, within the resolution of our measurements, that preindustrial concentrations over Antarctica have not exceeded 773 +/- 15 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) during the past 650,000 years. Before 420,000 years ago, when interglacials were cooler, maximum CH4 concentrations were only about 600 ppbv, similar to lower Holocene values. In contrast, the N2O record shows maximum concentrations of 278 +/- 7 ppbv, slightly higher than early Holocene values."

https://openalex.org/W1985149691,"Ronald Ross won the 1902 Nobel prize for discovering the role of the mosquito in the parasite life cycle, but his later work on mathematical models for the study of its epidemiology was perhaps even more impressive. The Ross malaria model, still referred to, assumes that humans have an equal chance of a mosquito bite, and that infection clearance is unaltered by re-infection. We now know that some people are bitten more often than others, and that repeat infections slow parasite clearance. These and other new data have been incorporated in a mathematical framework to update the Ross model for the twenty-first century. Combined with data on over 90 communities infected by malaria, this reveals that variations in biting and/or susceptibility to infection are key factors determining the prevalence of infection: 20% of people receive 80% of all infections. This finding can be used to direct malaria controls at those most likely to benefit. Malaria is an important cause of global morbidity and mortality. The fact that some people are bitten more often than others has a large effect on the relationship between risk factors and prevalence of vector-borne diseases1,2,3. Here we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to estimate the heterogeneity of infection rates from the relationship between rates of infectious bites and community prevalence. We apply this framework to a large, published data set that combines malaria measurements from more than 90 communities4. We find strong evidence that heterogeneous biting or heterogeneous susceptibility to infection are important and pervasive factors determining the prevalence of infection: 20% of people receive 80% of all infections. We also find that individual infections last about six months on average, per infectious bite, and children who clear infections are not immune to new infections. The results have important implications for public health interventions: the success of malaria control will depend heavily on whether efforts are targeted at those who are most at risk of infection."

Scanning gate microscopy shows that the key properties of the modulated structures-including the number, size, and period of the differentially doped regions-are defined in a controllable manner during synthesis, and moreover, that feature sizes to less than 50 nanometers are possible. Electronic devices fabricated with designed modulation-doped nanowire structures demonstrate their potential for lithography-independent address decoders and tunable, coupled quantum dots in which changes in electronic properties are encoded by synthesis rather than created by conventional lithography-based techniques."

https://openalex.org/W1977077283,"Drug-dependent neural plasticity related to drug addiction and schizophrenia can be modeled in animals as behavioral sensitization, which is induced by repeated noncontingent or self-administration of many drugs of abuse. Molecular mechanisms that are critical for behavioral sensitization have yet to be specified. Long-term depression (LTD) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in the brain has been proposed as a cellular substrate for learning and memory. The expression of LTD in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) required clathrin-dependent endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPARs. NAc LTD was blocked by a dynamin-derived peptide that inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis or by a GluR2-derived peptide that blocked regulated AMPAR endocytosis. Systemic or intra-NAc infusion of the membrane-permeable GluR2 peptide prevented the expression of amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in the rat."

By using genomic data and expressed sequence tags from the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii , we provide direct evidence that about two-thirds of human introns predate the bilaterian radiation but were lost from insect and nematode genomes to a large extent. A comparison of coding exon sequences confirms the ancestral nature of Platynereis and human genes. Thus, the urbilaterian ancestor had complex, intron-rich genes that have been retained in Platynereis and human."
https://openalex.org/W2143749697,"Complexes between CD1 molecules and self or microbial glycolipids represent important immunogenic ligands for specific subsets of T cells. However, the function of one of the CD1 family members, CD1e, has yet to be determined. Here, we show that the mycobacterial antigens hexamannosylated phosphatidyl- myo -inositols (PIM 6 ) stimulate CD1b-restricted T cells only after partial digestion of the oligomannose moiety by lysosomal α-mannosidase and that soluble CD1e is required for this processing. Furthermore, recombinant CD1e was able to bind glycolipids and assist in the digestion of PIM 6 . We propose that, through this form of glycolipid editing, CD1e helps expand the repertoire of glycolipidic T cell antigens to optimize antimicrobial immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1991010290,Structured water molecules near redox cofactors were found recently to accelerate electron-transfer (ET) kinetics in several systems. Theoretical study of interprotein electron transfer across an aqueous interface reveals three distinctive electronic coupling mechanisms that we describe here: (i) a protein-mediated regime when the two proteins are in van der Waals contact; (ii) a structured water-mediated regime featuring anomalously weak distance decay at relatively close protein-protein contact distances; and (iii) a bulk water–mediated regime at large distances. Our analysis explains a range of otherwise puzzling biological ET kinetic data and provides a framework for including explicit water-mediated tunneling effects on ET kinetics.
https://openalex.org/W2148902507,"A characteristic feature of the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors is the dichotomy between the electronic excitations along the nodal (diagonal) and antinodal (parallel to the Cu-O bonds) directions in momentum space, generally assumed to be linked to the 'd-wave' symmetry of the superconducting state. Angle-resolved photoemission measurements in the superconducting state have revealed a quasiparticle spectrum with a d-wave gap structure that exhibits a maximum along the antinodal direction and vanishes along the nodal direction. Subsequent measurements have shown that, at low doping levels, this gap structure persists even in the high-temperature metallic state, although the nodal points of the superconducting state spread out in finite 'Fermi arcs'. This is the so-called pseudogap phase, and it has been assumed that it is closely linked to the superconducting state, either by assigning it to fluctuating superconductivity or by invoking orders which are natural competitors of d-wave superconductors. Here we report experimental evidence that a very similar pseudogap state with a nodal-antinodal dichotomous character exists in a system that is markedly different from a superconductor: the ferromagnetic metallic groundstate of the colossal magnetoresistive bilayer manganite La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7. Our findings therefore cast doubt on the assumption that the pseudogap state in the copper oxides and the nodal-antinodal dichotomy are hallmarks of the superconductivity state."

https://openalex.org/W1978406586,"Histocompatibility--the ability of an organism to distinguish its own cells and tissue from those of another--is a universal phenomenon in the Metazoa. In vertebrates, histocompatibility is a function of the immune system controlled by a highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which encodes proteins that target foreign molecules for immune cell recognition. The association of the MHC and immune function suggests an evolutionary relationship between metazoan histocompatibility and the origins of vertebrate immunity. However, the MHC of vertebrates is the only functionally characterized histocompatibility system; the mechanisms underlying this process in non-vertebrates are unknown. A primitive chordate, the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, also undergoes a histocompatibility reaction controlled by a highly polymorphic locus. Here we describe the isolation of a candidate gene encoding an immunoglobulin superfamily member that, by itself, predicts the outcome of histocompatibility reactions. This is the first non-vertebrate histocompatibility gene described, and may provide insights into the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1994227710,"Wingless secretion provides pivotal signals during development by activating transcription of target genes. At Drosophila synapses, Wingless is secreted from presynaptic terminals and is required for synaptic growth and differentiation. Wingless binds the seven-pass transmembrane DFrizzled2 receptor, but the ensuing events at synapses are not known. We show that DFrizzled2 is endocytosed from the postsynaptic membrane and transported to the nucleus. The C terminus of DFrizzled2 is cleaved and translocated into the nucleus; the N-terminal region remains just outside the nucleus. Translocation of DFrizzled2-C into the nucleus, but not its cleavage and transport, depends on Wingless signaling. We conclude that, at synapses, Wingless signal transduction occurs through the nuclear localization of DFrizzled2-C for potential transcriptional regulation of synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W2105462685,"The interaction of endothelial cells with extracellular matrix proteins at focal adhesions sites contributes to the integrity of vascular endothelial barrier. Although focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation is required for the recovery of the barrier function after increased endothelial junctional permeability, the basis for the recovery remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that FAK activates p190RhoGAP and, thus, negatively regulates RhoA activity and promotes endothelial barrier restoration in response to the permeability-increasing mediator thrombin. We observed that thrombin caused a transient activation of RhoA but a more prolonged FAK activation temporally coupled to the recovery of barrier function. Thrombin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, which coincided with decrease in RhoA activity. We further showed that FAK was associated with p190RhoGAP, and importantly, recombinant FAK phosphorylated p190RhoGAP <i>in vitro</i>. Inhibition of FAK by adenoviral expression of FRNK (a dominant negative FAK construct) in monolayers prevented p190RhoGAP phosphorylation, increased RhoA activity, induced actin stress fiber formation, and produced an irreversible increase in endothelial permeability in response to thrombin. We also observed that p190RhoGAP was unable to attenuate RhoA activation in the absence of FAK activation induced by FRNK. The inhibition of RhoA by the C3 toxin (<i>Clostridium botulinum</i> toxin) restored endothelial barrier function in the FRNK-expressing cells. These findings in endothelial cells were recapitulated in the lung microcirculation in which FRNK expression in microvessel endothelia increased vascular permeability. Our studies demonstrate that FAK-induced down-modulation of RhoA activity via p190RhoGAP is a crucial step in signaling endothelial barrier restoration after increased endothelial permeability."

https://openalex.org/W2045051594,"The counter-intuitive properties of quantum mechanics have the potential to revolutionize information processing by enabling the development of efficient algorithms with no known classical counterparts. Harnessing this power requires the development of a set of building blocks, one of which is a method to initialize the set of quantum bits (qubits) to a known state. Additionally, fresh ancillary qubits must be available during the course of computation to achieve fault tolerance. In any physical system used to implement quantum computation, one must therefore be able to selectively and dynamically remove entropy from the part of the system that is to be mapped to qubits. One such method is an 'open-system' cooling protocol in which a subset of qubits can be brought into contact with an external system of large heat capacity. Theoretical efforts have led to an implementation-independent cooling procedure, namely heat-bath algorithmic cooling. These efforts have culminated with the proposal of an optimal algorithm, the partner-pairing algorithm, which was used to compute the physical limits of heat-bath algorithmic cooling. Here we report the experimental realization of multi-step cooling of a quantum system via heat-bath algorithmic cooling. The experiment was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance of a solid-state ensemble three-qubit system. We demonstrate the repeated repolarization of a particular qubit to an effective spin-bath temperature, and alternating logical operations within the three-qubit subspace to ultimately cool a second qubit below this temperature. Demonstration of the control necessary for these operations represents an important step forward in the manipulation of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance qubits."

Two CF mutants, G551D and G1349D, affect equivalent residues in the highly conserved LSGGQ motifs that are essential components of the ATP-binding sites of CFTR. Both mutants severely disrupt CFTR channel gating by decreasing mean burst duration (MBD) and prolonging greatly the interburst interval (IBI). To identify small molecules that rescue the gating defects of G551D- and G1349D-CFTR and understand better how these agents work, we used the patch clamp technique to study the effects on G551D- and G1349D-CFTR of phloxine B, pyrophosphate (PPi), and 2′-deoxy ATP (2′-dATP), three agents that strongly enhance CFTR channel gating. Phloxine B (5 μm) potentiated robustly G551D-CFTR Cl– channels by altering both MBD and IBI. In contrast, phloxine B (5 μm) decreased the IBI of G1349D-CFTR, but this effect was insufficient to rescue G1349D-CFTR channel gating. PPi (5 mm) potentiated weakly G551D-CFTR and was without effect on the G1349D-CFTR Cl– channel. However, by altering both MBD and IBI, albeit with different efficacies, 2′-dATP (1 mm) potentiated both G551D- and G1349D-CFTR Cl– channels. Using the ATP-driven nucleotide-binding domain dimerization model of CFTR channel gating, we suggest that phloxine B, PPi and 2′-dATP alter channel gating by distinct mechanisms.

CFTR is composed of two membrane-spanning domain (MSD) nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) motifs linked by a unique regulatory (R) domain. The membrane-spanning domains assemble to form a transmembrane pore with deep intracellular and shallow extracellular vestibules that funnel anions toward a selectivity filter, which determines the permeation properties of CFTR (3Sheppard D.N.

Anion flow through the CFTR pore is controlled by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis at two ATP-binding sites located at the interface of the two NBDs (4Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K.

Stable ATP binding occurs at one ATP-binding site (site 1; formed by the Walker A and B motifs of NBD1 and the LSGGQ motif of NBD2), whereas rapid ATP turnover occurs at the other ATP-binding site (site 2; formed by the Walker A and B motifs of NBD2 and the LSGGQ motif of NBD1) (5Vergani P.

The importance of CFTR for transepithelial ion transport is dramatically highlighted by its malfunction in human disease. The genetic disease CF is caused by mutations that abolish the function of CFTR (2Welsh M.J. Ramsey B.W. Accurso F. Cutting G.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 5121-5188Google Scholar). Other diseases, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and secretory diarrhea, involve inappropriate activity of CFTR (8Sullivan L.P. Wallace D.P. Grantham J.J. J. Am. Soc.

In the search for rational new therapies for diseases caused by CFTR malfunction, a variety of agents have been identified that interact directly with CFTR. Agents that rescue the cell surface expression of CFTR (CFTR correctors) and/or potentiate channel activity (CFTR potentiators) might be used to treat CF. In contrast, agents that inhibit channel activity by pore occlusion or allosteric mechanisms might be used to treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and secretory diarrhea (10Sheppard D.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With ∼1,400 unique disease-causing mutations identified in the CFTR gene (the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database), a crucial issue for therapy development is the specificity of different drugs. For example, will one CFTR potentiator rescue all CF mutants that disrupt CFTR channel gating, or will specific CFTR potentiators need to be tailored to individual CF mutants? To explore the mutation specificity of CFTR potentiators and to understand better their mechanism of action, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the CFTR potentiators phloxine B, pyrophosphate (PPi), and 2′-deoxy-ATP (2′-dATP) on the CF mutants G551D and G1349D.

Conversely, we selected the CF mutants G551D and G1349D because these mutants profoundly disrupt channel gating by affecting equivalent residues in the LSGGQ motifs of the two ATP-binding sites of CFTR (G551D, site 2, and G1349D, site 1) (4Lewis H.A.

To quantify the efficacy with which the different CFTR potentiators restore normal channel gating to G551D- and G1349D-CFTR, we employed high resolution single-channel recording and kinetic analyses of channel gating. Then using the ATP-driven NBD dimerization model of CFTR channel gating (5Vergani P. Lockless S.W. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Nature. 2005; 433: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Vergani P. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 120: 17-36Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we explain how the different CFTR potentiators alter CFTR channel gating. Cells and Cell Culture—For this study, we used mouse mammary epithelial cells (C127 cells) stably expressing either wild-type human CFTR or the CF mutant G1349D and Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells stably expressing the CF mutant G551D. 3To verify that the single-channel behavior of CFTR in FRT and C127 cells is equivalent, we measured i, Po, and the response to phloxine B of CFTR Cl– channels in excised inside-out membrane patches clamped at –50 mV using solutions identical to those employed in the present study with the exception that Bis-Tris (5 mM) + Trizma (Tris base) (5 mM) replaced TES (10 mM) in the intracellular solution to which was added ATP (1 mM) and PKA (75 nM). Neither i (C127 cells, –0.88 ± 0.06 pA (n = 18); FRT cells, –0.86 ± 0.03 pA (n = 4); p = 0.64) nor Po (C127 cells, 0.52 ± 0.04 (n = 18); FRT cells, 0.50 ± 0.05 (n = 4); p = 0.40) differed between the two cell lines (J.-H. Chen, Z. Cai, and D. N. Sheppard, unpublished data). Similarly, the response of wild-type CFTR to phloxine B was equivalent in the two cell lines (C127, Fig. 2B; FRT, n = 3 (Z. Cai and D. N. Sheppard, unpublished data)). C127 cells were generous gifts of Professor M. J. Welsh (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and Dr C. R. O'Riordan (Genzyme, Framingham, MA), whereas FRT cells were a generous gift of Drs. L. J. V. Galietta and O. Zegarra-Moran (Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy). C127 and FRT cells were cultured and used as described previously (21Sheppard D.N. Robinson K.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 333-346Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Zegarra-Moran O.

Electrophysiology—CFTR Cl– channels were recorded in excised inside-out membrane patches using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) and pCLAMP data acquisition and analysis software (version 6.03, Axon Instruments Inc.) as described previously (21Sheppard D.N.

The established sign convention was used throughout; currents produced by positive charge moving from intra- to extracellular solutions (anions moving in the opposite direction) are shown as positive currents. The pipette (extracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 140 aspartic acid, 5 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, and 10 TES, adjusted to pH 7.3 with Tris ([Cl–], 10 mm). The bath (intracellular) solution contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 3 MgCl2, 1 Cs-EGTA, and 10 TES, adjusted to pH 7.3 with HCl ([Cl–], 147 mm; free [Ca2+], <10–8 m) and was maintained at 37 °C using a temperature-controlled microscope stage (Brook Industries, Lake Villa, IL). After excision of inside-out membrane patches, we added the catalytic subunit of PKA (75 nm) and ATP (1 mm) to the intracellular solution within 5 min of patch excision to activate CFTR Cl– channels. To prevent channel rundown in excised membrane patches, we added PKA to all intracellular solutions, maintained the ATP concentration at 1 mm, and clamped voltage at –50 mV. Under these conditions, CFTR rundown in excised membrane patches from either C127 or FRT cells is minimal (21Sheppard D.N. Robinson K.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 333-346Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 4Z. Cai, J.-H. Chen, and D. N. Sheppard, data not shown With the exception of 2′-dATP, which replaced ATP in the intracellular solution, the effects of CFTR potentiators on wild-type and mutant CFTRs were tested by adding agents to the intracellular solution in the continuous presence of ATP (1 mm) and PKA (75 nm). Because the effects of phloxine B on the CFTR Cl– channel are only partially reversible (11Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), specific interventions were not bracketed by control periods made with the same concentrations of ATP and PKA but without the test agent. To determine the relationship between phloxine B concentration and channel activity for G551D- and G1349D-CFTR, we used membrane patches containing multiple active channels. For all other studies, we used membrane patches containing small numbers of active channels (wild-type and G1349D-CFTR, ≤4; G551D-CFTR, ≤6). We determined the number of channels in a membrane patch from the maximum number of simultaneous channel openings observed during the course of an experiment. To minimize errors when counting the number of active channels, we employed two strategies. First, we recorded channel activity for prolonged periods (30–60 min) and verified that recordings were of sufficient length to ascertain the correct number of active channels (24Venglarik C.J. Schultz B.D. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 123-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Lansdell K.A. Delaney S.J. Lunn D.P. Thomson S.A. Sheppard D.N. Wainwright B.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 379-392Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, we used experimental conditions that robustly potentiate channel activity to determine the number of active channels in a membrane patch. For wild-type and G1349D-CFTR Cl– channels, channel numbers were counted in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and PKA (75 nm) alone. In contrast, the presence of the CFTR potentiators phloxine B or 2′-dATP were required to determine the number of G551D-CFTR Cl– channels in a membrane patch. Despite our precautions, we cannot exclude the possibility of unobserved G551D- and G1349D-CFTR Cl– channels in membrane patches. Therefore, values of Po for G551D- and G1349D-CFTR might possibly be overestimated. CFTR Cl– currents were initially recorded on digital audio tape using a digital tape recorder (Biologic Scientific Instruments, model DTR-1204; Intracel Ltd., Royston, UK) at a bandwidth of 10 kHz. On playback, records were filtered with an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices™, model 902LPF2; SCENSYS Ltd., Aylesbury, UK) at a corner frequency of 500 Hz and acquired using a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and pCLAMP at a sampling rate of 5 kHz. For the purpose of illustration, single-channel records were filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz. For concentration-response studies, average current (I) for a specific intervention was determined as the average of all the data points collected during the intervention. To plot the relationship between drug concentration and CFTR Cl– current, current values were expressed as a percentage of the control CFTR Cl– current recorded in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and PKA (75 nm) but in the absence of drug. To measure single-channel current amplitude (i), Gaussian distributions were fit to current amplitude histograms. nPo was calculated by dividing I by i. For Po and burst analyses, lists of open and closed times were created and analyzed as described previously (26Lansdell K.A. Cai Z. Kidd J.F. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 317-330Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Burst analysis was performed as described by Carson et al. (27Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), using a tc (the time that separates interburst closures from intraburst closures) of 15 ms. The mean interburst interval (TIBI) was calculated by using the equation (28Cai Z. Scott-Ward T.S. Sheppard D.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) Po=Tb/(TMBD+TIBI)(Eq. 1) where Tb = (mean burst duration) × (open probability within a burst). Mean burst duration (TMBD) and open probability within a burst (Po (burst)) were determined directly from experimental data using pCLAMP software. Po was calculated from either open- and closed-times, as described previously (26Lansdell K.A. Cai Z. Kidd J.F. Sheppard D.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 317-330Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or by using the equation: Po=I/(n×i)(Eq. 2) where n represents the number of active channels in the membrane patch. For wild-type CFTR, only membrane patches that contained a single active channel were used for burst analysis, whereas for G551D- and G1349D-CFTRs, we used membrane patches containing no more than four active channels. As described by Carson et al. (27Carson M.R. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1711-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we analyzed only bursts of single-channel openings with no super imposed openings that were separated from one another by a minimum of 15 ms. Similar values of MBD and IBI were acquired using membrane patches containing either one or between two and four active channels. For example, for G1349D-CFTR, when n = 1, MBD = 34.4 ± 7. 8 ms and IBI = 3, 873 ± 1, 239 ms (n = 5), and when n = 2–4, MBD = 36.8 ± 6.5 ms and IBI = 2,090 ± 481 ms (n = 12) (p > 0.1 for both sets of data). Comparable values of MBD were also obtained using a tc of 30 ms. 5Z. Cai and D. N. Sheppard, data not shown. To perform maximum likelihood analysis and develop kinetic models of CFTR channel gating, we used the QuB software suite as described previously (11Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Qin F. Li L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1657-1671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For consistency with analyses using pCLAMP software, transitions <1 ms were excluded. Only membrane patches that contained a single active channel were used for maximum likelihood analysis and kinetic modeling. Reagents—PKA was purchased from Promega Corp. (Southampton, UK). ATP (disodium salt), 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate disodium salt (2′-dATP), phloxine B (2′,4′,5′,7′-tetrabromo-4,5,6,7-tetrachlorofluorescein), PPi (tetrasodium salt), and TES were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Stock solutions of phloxine B were prepared in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. Immediately before use, stock solutions were diluted to achieve final concentrations. Me2SO did not affect the activity of CFTR (21Sheppard D.N. Robinson K.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 333-346Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of PPi were prepared as described by Carson et al. (13Carson M.R. Winter M.C. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), while those for ATP and 2′-dATP were prepared immediately before each experiment. Statistics—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n observations. To compare sets of data, we used either Student's paired or unpaired t test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. All tests were performed using SigmaStat™ (version 2.03, Jandel Scientific GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). The Single-channel Activity of Wild-type, G551D-, and G1349D-CFTRs—Before investigating the rescue of the CF mutants G551D and G1349D by CFTR potentiators, we quantified their single-channel activity. Fig. 1A shows representative single-channel recordings of wild-type, G551D-, and G1349D-CFTR. Like other NBD mutants (3Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), G551D- and G1349D-CFTR were without effect on i but perturbed severely channel gating (Fig. 1, A and B). The gating behavior of wild-type CFTR is characterized by bursts of channel openings, interrupted by brief flickery closures and separated by longer closures between bursts. In contrast, G551D- and G1349D-CFTR both attenuated the duration of bursts and prolonged dramatically the interburst interval (Fig. 1A). As a result, the Po of G551D- and G1349D-CFTR were reduced markedly when compared with that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1C). To explain the marked differences in Po between wild-type CFTR and the CF mutants, we performed an analysis of bursts. Based on analyses of closed-time histograms (wild-type CFTR, τc = 14.87 ± 0.51 ms (n = 10); G1349D-CFTR, τc = 17.41 ± 1.49 ms (n = 5); p > 0.05), we used a burst delimiter (τc) of 15 ms to discriminate inter- and intraburst closures. 6For G551D-CFTR, no membrane patches containing a single active CFTR Cl– channel were obtained. However, given the very large difference in the duration of intra- and interburst closures for G551D-CFTR, misclassification errors when defining bursts should be rare. The MBD of G551D- and G1349D-CFTR were similar and both about one-third that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the IBI of G551D- and G1349D-CFTR were prolonged strikingly when compared with that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1E). Phloxine B Rescues the Gating Defect of G551D-CFTR but Not That of G1349D-CFTR—The fluorescein derivative phloxine B potentiates efficaciously wild-type and ΔF508-CFTR Cl– currents (11Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Like its effects on wild-type CFTR (11Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), phloxine B (0.1–5 μm) potentiated greatly G551D-CFTR Cl– currents, whereas phloxine B (10–40 μm) inhibited channel activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, for both wild-type and G551D-CFTR, phloxine B (5 μm) potentiated the maximum Cl– current (Fig. 2B). However, because under control conditions the activity of G551D-CFTR is much lower than that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1), the potentiation of G551D-CFTR by phloxine B exceeded greatly that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 2B). Phloxine B potentiates wild-type CFTR Cl– currents by prolonging MBD, and thus, increasing Po (11Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine how phloxine B potentiates G551D-CFTR Cl– currents, we measured i, Po, MBD, and IBI in the absence and presence of the drug. Phloxine B (0.1–40 μm) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in i equivalent to that observed with wild-type CFTR (Fig. 2C), suggesting that phloxine B does not potentiate G551D-CFTR by increasing current flow through the channel. Instead, phloxine B (1–5 μm) potentiated G551D-CFTR by enhancing dramatically channel gating, and thus, Po (Fig. 2, A and D, p < 0.01). Moreover, as a result of the effects of the drug on channel gating, the number of active channels increased (n = 7; Fig. 2A). Importantly, phloxine B (5 μm) prolonged the MBD of G551D-CFTR Cl– channels to a length equivalent to that of wild-type CFTR in the absence of drugs (Figs. 1D and 2E; p > 0.05). However, although phloxine B (5 μm) decreased the IBI of G551D-CFTR by 62%, it was still over 11-fold longer than that of wild-type CFTR in the absence of the drug (Figs. 1E and 2F; p < 0.001). Phloxine B (1–20 μm) also had biphasic effects on G1349D-CFTR Cl– currents with phloxine B (5 μm) potentiating the maximum current (Fig. 3, A and B) (11Cai Z. Sheppard D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19546-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Of note, the magnitude of G1349D-CFTR Cl– current potentiated by phloxine B (5 μm) was much smaller than that of G551D-CFTR but equivalent to that of wild-type CFTR (Figs. 2B and 3B). Because the single-channel activity of G1349D-CFTR is greatly diminished when compared with that of wild-type CFTR (Fig. 1), these results indicate that phloxine B fails to rescue the gating defect of G1349D-CFTR. Phloxine B caused a concentration-dependent reduction in i (Fig. 3C) but no change in the number of active G1349D-CFTR Cl– channels (n = 8, Fig. 3A). Interestingly, G1349D-CFTR Cl– channels tended to open more frequently in the presence of phloxine B (Fig. 3A). For example, phloxine B (5 μm) caused a small but significant increase in Po (Fig. 3D; p < 0.05) by reducing IBI 42% (p < 0.05) without altering MBD (p > 0.05; Fig. 3, E and F). However, the IBI of G1349D-CFTR in the presence of phloxine B (5 μm) was over 5-fold longer than that of wild-type CFTR in the absence of drug. Thus, our data demonstrate that phloxine B rescues the gating defect of G551D-CFTR but not that of G1349D-CFTR. Effects of PPi on the Single-channel Activity of G551D- and G1349D-CFTR—The non-hydrolyzable inorganic phosphate analogue, PPi, enhances robustly wild-type CFTR Cl– currents by (i) increasing the rate of channel opening and (ii) decreasing markedly the rate of channel closure (12Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19349-19353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Carson M.R. Winter M.C. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A demonstrates that PPi (5 mm) augmented the single-channel activity of G551D-CFTR. However, the potentiation achieved by PPi (5 mm) was much weaker than that of phloxine B (5 μm; Figs. 2A and 4A) and not increased at higher PPi concentrations (as described in the legend for Fig. 4). PPi (5 mm) caused a small but significant reduction in i (Fig. 4B) but was without effect on the number of active channels (n = 10; Fig. 4A). PPi (5 mm) increased, but not significantly, the Po of G551D-CFTR by enhancing slightly MBD and curtailing weakly IBI (Fig. 4, C–E). Like phloxine B (5 μm), PPi (5 mm) failed to potentiate the single-channel activity of G1349D-CFTR (Fig. 5). There was (i) a small decrease in i (Fig. 5B, p < 0.05), (ii) no change in the number of active channels (n = 6, Fig. 5A), (iii) no significant increase in Po (Fig. 5C), (iv) no prolongation of MBD (Fig. 5D), and (v) a small, but not significant, decrease in IBI (Fig. 5E). Higher concentrations of PPi (10 mm) were also ineffective (n = 2, data not shown). 2′-Deoxy-ATP Activates Both G551D- and G1349D-CFTR Cl– Channels—Because both phloxine B and PPi failed to potentiate G1349D-CFTR, we searched for other agents that might rescue this CF mutant. A particularly attractive candidate for study was the hydrolyzable ATP analogue 2′-dATP, which gates wild-type CFTR more effectively than ATP in planar lipid bilayers (14Aleksandrov A.A. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A demonstrates that substitution of ATP (1 mm) by 2′-dATP ("

We have previously reported the molecular architecture of an 11-MDa subcomplex comprising the 60-mer icosahedral dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) decorated with 60 copies of the heterotetrameric (α2β2) 153-kDa pyruvate decarboxylase (E1) from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Milne, J.

An annular gap of ∼90 Å separates the acetyltransferase catalytic domains of the E2 from an outer shell formed of E1 tetramers. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we present here a three-dimensional reconstruction of the E2 core decorated with 60 copies of the homodimeric 100-kDa dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). The E2E3 complex has a similar annular gap of ∼75 Å between the inner icosahedral assembly of acetyltransferase domains and the outer shell of E3 homodimers. Automated fitting of the E3 coordinates into the map suggests excellent correspondence between the density of the outer shell map and the positions of the two best fitting orientations of E3. As in the case of E1 in the E1E2 complex, the central 2-fold axis of the E3 homodimer is roughly oriented along the periphery of the shell, making the active sites of the enzyme accessible from the annular gap between the E2 core and the outer shell. The similarities in architecture of the E1E2 and E2E3 complexes indicate fundamental similarities in the mechanism of active site coupling involved in the two key stages requiring motion of the swinging lipoyl domain across the annular gap, namely the synthesis of acetyl CoA and regeneration of the dithiolane ring of the lipoyl domain.

The similarities in architecture of the E1E2 and E2E3 complexes indicate fundamental similarities in the mechanism of active site coupling involved in the two key stages requiring motion of the swinging lipoyl domain across the annular gap, namely the synthesis of acetyl CoA and regeneration of the dithiolane ring of the lipoyl domain. The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) 2The abbreviations used are: PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E1, pyruvate decarboxylase; E2, dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase; E3, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase; PSBD, peripheral subunit-binding domain. multienzyme complexes play a central role in cellular metabolism, catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, to link glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

These systems are ideal paradigms for the structural study of highly dynamic macromolecular machines because they mediate efficient transport of reaction intermediates between the active sites of component enzymes that can be spatially separated by as much as 100 Å (10.Zhou Z.H.

PDH complexes based on icosahedral symmetry are among the largest of cellular machines and are found in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and in Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus stearothermophilus. These complexes, like the octahedral PDH complexes present in Gram-negative bacteria, contain a dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), a pyruvate decarboxylase (E1), a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), and, in the case of the mammalian enzymes, an E3-binding protein and regulatory kinases and phosphatases (reviewed in Ref. 5.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The E2 component of the B. stearothermophilus PDH complex, characteristically of the family, is composed of a 28-kDa catalytic (acetyltransferase) domain, a 4-kDa peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD), and a 9-kDa lipoyl domain (15.Dardel F.

In the native PDH complex, 60 copies of the E2 self-associate through the interactions of their catalytic domains to form an icosahedral assembly, to which 42-48 copies of an α2β2 E1 (153 kDa) and 6-12 copies of a homodimeric E3 (100 kDa) bind tightly around the outside (19.Domingo G.J. Chauhan H.J. Lessard I.A.D. Fuller C. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural evidence indicates that E1 and E3 bind competitively to mutually exclusive, but partly overlapping, sites on the PSBD (20.Lessard I.A.D. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21.Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G.J.

During the synthesis of acetyl CoA, E1 catalyzes the thiamine diphosphate-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvate and the reductive acetylation of a lipoyl group attached to a specific lysine residue in the lipoyl domain of the E2 component. The E1 active site (specifically the thiazole ring of the thiamine diphosphate cofactor) is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped cleft ∼20-Å deep (Ref. 7.Frank R.A. Titman C.M. Pratap J.V. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and references therein and Ref. 25.Ævarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The lipoyl domain must then migrate to the active site in the acetyltransferase domain of E2 where the acetyl group is transferred to CoA, and finally to the active site of E3 where the pendant dihydrolipoyl group is oxidized at the expense of NAD+ to regenerate its dithiolane ring, preparing it to re-enter the active site of E1 to initiate a new cycle of catalytic events (4.Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5.Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy studies of a fully assembled E1E2 PDH subcomplex from B. stearothermophilus reveal the general architecture as an inner core of 60 E2 acetyltransferase domains surrounded by an outer shell of 60 E1 tetramers, characterized by an annular gap as wide as ∼90 Å (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The orientation of the E1 tetramers is such that the E1 active sites can be accessed efficiently from the annular space by lipoyl domains that are clearly required to move back and forth across the annular gap. This unexpectedly organized architecture could promote highly efficient active site coupling by confining the trajectories of the lipoyl domains as they shuttle between the successive active sites. A somewhat similar architecture has been reported for the PDH complexes from bovine kidney (10.Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. O'Conner C.M. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14802-14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11.Gu Y. Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we extend our previous studies with the report of the architecture of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex containing 60 copies each of the E2 and E3 enzymes. We present a cryoelectron microscopic analysis of the reconstructed three-dimensional structure of the purified E2E3 complex and use automated docking methods to interpret the density map in terms of the probable localization of the E2 and E3 molecules. Our findings show that the arrangement of E1 and E3 molecules in the outer shell of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are remarkably similar and indicate that the design of the annular gap allows the lipoyl domain to have access to the active sites of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes from within the annular gap. Sample Preparation—E2E3 complexes containing 60 copies of full-length E2 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase and 60 copies of the E3 dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase homodimer were prepared as described (26.Lessard I.A.D. Domingo G.J. Borges A. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) by individually expressing the full-length recombinant genes in Escherichia coli and purifying the protein products, which were then reconstituted together in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and isolated from unbound E3 by size exclusion chromatography. Aliquots of the complex at ∼2 mg/ml were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Electron Microscopy—Frozen hydrated specimens of E2E3 were obtained by applying 5 μl of 200-300 μg of protein/ml to homemade holey carbon grids, blotting for typically 2-5 s at room temperature, and plunging into a slurry of liquid ethane using a manually operated cryoplunge apparatus. Images were collected under cryo conditions on a FEI Tecnai 30 microscope operating at 300 kV on film, using an electron dose of 10 electrons/Å2, a nominal magnification of 39,000× and underfocus values of 3.0-4.0 μm. Film images were assessed for quality using an optical diffractometer, and those displaying negligible astigmatism and minimal drift were scanned on a flat-bed Zeiss SCAI scanner using a pixel step size of 7 μm. Under-focus values for film images were computationally determined using algorithms implemented in the MRC image processing package (27.Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Construction of a Three-dimensional Model of E2E3—A set of 6054 molecular images the E2E3 complex was manually selected using Ximdisp (28.Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from 74 films binned 2-fold to give a final pixel size of 3.59 Å pixel at the level of the specimen. The boxed images (210 × 210 pixels) were filtered to retain information between 200 and 30 Å and used to construct an initial three-dimensional model using the image processing package IMAGIC (29.van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) in multiple rounds of iterative alignment and classification, essentially as described for the E1E2 subcomplex (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To obtain representative classes with a range of orientations that had both low internal variance and that corresponded well to the projections of the resultant three-dimensional model, images were grouped into subgroups that contained images extracted from classes of ∼2-fold, 3-fold, or 5-fold symmetry or from two other distinct views of the complex. Each subgroup was processed individually to identify appropriate class averages. These class averages were used as references for the entire data set for multi-reference alignment, which then was partitioned to identify class average views. Following determination of the Eulerian angles between pairs of the most representative class average projections using angular reconstitution with imposed icosahedral symmetry and refinement of these angles, the oriented class averages with the lowest error in the angular parameters were used to calculate a three-dimensional model. A set of 172 reprojections from the model that uniformly sampled the icosahedral asymmetric triangle were calculated and used for multireference alignment of the data set, which was followed by classification, Euler angle determination and refinement, and calculation of a new three-dimensional map. These steps were repeated three more times to generate the three-dimensional map that was refined using the complete data set and the program FREALIGN (30.Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), which determines the orientation and center of individual particles, corrects for the contrast transfer function of each input image, and calculates a three-dimensional reconstruction. The map and images were padded to create a box size of 256, binned 2 × 2, and alignment was performed using data between 200 and 25 Å. The map was reconstructed to include Fourier components up to 15 Å using a B-factor of 3000 Å2. Docking of the coordinates for the E3 homodimer from B. stearothermophilus complexed to the E2 PSBD (Ref. 21.Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank entry 1EBD) was performed using a core-weighted Monte Carlo grid-searching algorithm as described previously (31.Wu X. Milne J.L.S. Borgnia M.J. Rostapshov A.V. Subramaniam S. Brooks B.R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, the coordinates of the Cα atoms of the E3·PSBD complex were used to generate a density map at 25 Å resolution using the Gaussian blurring procedure implemented in the program CHARMM (32.Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Jaun B. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13963) Google Scholar). A grid of 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 in six-dimensional translational and rotational space was then used to initiate 729 Monte Carlo searches, each of 1000 steps, to identify local maximum positions. Estimation of the relative contributions of the two best fit positions of E3 to the overall density map was determined by calculating the density correlation between the experimentally determined map and a series of theoretically generated maps in which the proportion of the two contributing fitted positions was progressively varied. Visualization of maps was performed either in the environment of the program O (33.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) using the associated program Molray (34.Harris M. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1201-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), or using the program VMD (35.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38924) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of the fully occupied E2E3 subcomplex was constructed from 6054 individual molecular images computationally selected from cryoelectron micrographs, which contained well separated and randomly oriented complexes that are considerably larger and more intricate (Fig. 1, A and B) than those formed by the undecorated E2 core alone (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Inspection of the three-dimensional model shows that the complex is ∼450 Å across. Representative class average images correspond well to projection views both of the original filtered particles and of the initial reconstruction generated using IMAGIC (29.van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B-D). Refinement of this model using FREALIGN (30.Grigorieff N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) sharpened features of the central icosahedral feature arising from the E2 catalytic core more than the outer E3 densities, suggesting a greater degree of disorder in the outer protein shell of the complex (Fig. 1E). A very similar situation occurs in the E1E2 complex, with greater disorder observed in the outer shell of E1 tetramers. A surface representation of the structure is shown in Fig. 2A. A central slice through the model (Fig. 2B) indicates the presence of the central E2 catalytic core, the outer shell of E3 enzymes, and an annular gap as wide as ∼75 Å between the core and the outer shell.FIGURE 2A, surface representation of the refined three-dimensional model of E2E3 viewed along a 3-fold axis of symmetry.

Inspection of the distribution of the 6054 images in the icosahedral asymmetric triangle demonstrates that they are uniformly distributed throughout the entire angular space, thus eliminating the potential of sampling or orientation bias in selection of particles used to construct the map. A plot of the resolution dependence of the correlation coefficient between two maps constructed from two randomly divided halves of the data is shown in Fig. 3B. The correlation coefficient falls to 0.5 at ∼27 Å, which we denote as the nominal resolution (36.van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 95-100Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) of the map presented here, even though the plot indicates that there is significant information in the map well beyond this resolution. The nominal resolution of the map obtained for the E2E3 complex is about the same as that previously obtained for the E1E2 complex (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of the B. stearothermophilus E3 homodimer bound to the PSBD of E2 were automatically fitted using a grid-threading Monte Carlo approach into the density map. As described previously (31.Wu X. Milne J.L.S. Borgnia M.J. Rostapshov A.V. Subramaniam S. Brooks B.R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the identification of the best fits involves a search in six-dimensional space. The search resulted in two clearly defined best fit positions with very similar values (0.738 and 0.724) for correlation coefficients (Fig. 4A). A section of the landscape showing these peaks is shown as a contour plot (Fig. 4B). The positions of these two fits, viewed from the 3-fold vertex, is shown in Fig. 5, A and B. Taken together, these two fits occupy most regions of the space defined by the outer shell of the density map. Inspection of a central section of the map clearly shows the annular gap and the locations of E3 dimers in the two best fit orientations (Fig. 5, C and D). In both positions, the orientation of each E3 dimer is such that the 2-fold axis lies roughly along the surface of the outer shell. In this orientation, the PSBD faces the annular gap, and the active site of the E3 enzyme is easily accessible to the lipoyl domain located in the gap between the outer shell and the catalytic core, in the same way as previously discussed for the E1 enzyme in the E1E2 complex (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the identification of the best fits assumes that all 60 copies are in one or the other preferred position. A more realistic interpretation of these results is that they represent the two most likely locations of a given E3 dimer at any given time. We have derived a quantitative estimate of the relative probabilities by calculating the density correlation between the experimentally determined map and a series of theoretically generated maps in which the proportion of the two contributing fitted positions was systematically varied (Fig. 4C). The peak correlation is observed with fractional occupancies of 0.33 from the first best fit (Fig. 5, A and C) and 0.67 from the second best fit (Fig. 5, B and D), respectively. We therefore conclude that on average, each E3 dimer is likely to spend about twice as long in the second best than in the first best fit. This is not a surprising result because the core-weighted correlation coefficients for the two fits are very similar and also because the value may be influenced to some extent by the overall relative E3 proximities in the entire complex, which are different in the two positions (Fig. 5, compare A with B).FIGURE 5Superposition of the atomic coordinates of the homodimeric E3·PSBD complex into the E2E3 density map generated by electron microscopy (blue mesh). Visualization of the map from the 3-fold axis sectioned to include density contributed by only one layer of the outer E3 protein shell (A and C) or the central section of density from the E2 core and the E3 protein shell (B and D). The complementary locations of the E3·PSBD complex present in the best fitting (A and C) and second-best fitting (B and D) orientations identified by the core-weighted Monte Carlo search are illustrated. The E3 dimers and PSBD are represented as red and black ribbons, respectively. For visual clarity, a thicker ribbon is used to represent the PSBD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the overall sizes of the E2E3 and E1E2 subcomplexes are similar (450 and 475 Å, respectively), one might expect the E3 homodimers (100 kDa) to occupy a smaller proportion of the surface area of the outer shell in comparison to the E1 tetramers (153 kDa) in the E1E2 complex (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Inspection of the fitted coordinates in Fig. 5 confirms this expectation. A simulated model (Fig. 6) of a native complex with 50 copies of the E1 tetramer and 10 copies of the E3 dimer, shows that even at this maximal occupancy of the outer shell, there are no steric constraints that prevent the placement of the E1 and E3 enzymes in the outer shell at the locations deduced form the fitted coordinates. A schematic view of a single E1 trimer and a single E3 trimer positioned above the E2 core is presented in Fig. 7 to illustrate both the similarities in the location of E1 and E3 relative to the core and to highlight the point that the extended reach of the lipoyl domain is likely to allow access of a given domain to the active sites of multiple enzymes in the outer shell.FIGURE 7Model for active-site coupling in a hypothetical E1E2E3 complex. Three E1 tetramers (purple) and three E3 dimers (yellow) are shown located in the outer protein shell above the inner icosahedron (gray) formed by 60 E2 catalytic domains. Six full-length E2 molecules are highlighted in red, green, or yellow, to illustrate in each the catalytic domain, PSBD, and lipoyl domain that are separated by interdomain linkers. The E1 and E3 densities are shown as separate trimers to facilitate comparison; under physiological conditions, the E1 and E3 molecules are expected to be randomly distributed around the core. The inner linkers are shown to originate from the region of the density map that is near residue 204, as deduced from the map derived using cryoelectron microscopy by Borgnia et al. (44.Borgnia M.J. Shi D. Zhang P. Milne J.L.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The lipoyl domains are shown in a range of possible positions inside the annular gap. Selected active sites of E1, E2, and E3 are depicted in white. The lipoyl domain of each E2 molecule is expected to shuttle between the active sites of E3 and E1 molecules located in the outer shell and those of E2 located in the inner core and are long enough to reach across one trimer in the outer shell to another, as indicated schematically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PDH complex of B. stearothermophilus self-assembles from a mixture of E1 heterotetramers and E3 dimers in the presence of the icosahedrally symmetric core formed by 60 E2 polypeptide chains. Typically a complex of ∼42-48 E1 heterotetramers and 6-12 E3 dimers around one 60-mer E2 can be generated, but these values represent averages and the precise E1:E2:E3 stoichiometry is likely to vary from one complex to another (19.Domingo G.J. Chauhan H.J. Lessard I.A.D. Fuller C. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). E1 and E3 both bind tightly to the PSBD of the E2 chain (Kds of 0.33 and 0.58 nm, respectively) (37.Lessard I.A.D. Fuller C. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16863-16870Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the binding is mutually exclusive, and the distribution of these components about the E2 core is thus likely to have a major element of randomness to it. This intrinsic heterogeneity restricts the utility of approaches that involve averaging the structure of individual PDH complex assemblies that contain all of the constituent enzymes. A key finding from the cryoelectron microscopic analysis of fully assembled E1E2 (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and E2E3 subcomplexes is that the E1 and E3 components are located as well defined radial shells with a clear gap of 75-90 Å separating them from the icosahedral inner core constructed of 60 E2 acetyltransferase domains (Figs. 2 and 5 and Ref. 14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The gap in the E2E3 subcomplex appears to be slightly smaller than that in the E1E2 subcomplex but that may be because of differences in the overall shapes of the E3-PSBD (21.Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and E1-PSBD (7.Frank R.A. Titman C.M. Pratap J.V. Luisi B.F. Perham R.N. Science. 2004; 306: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) structures. Three sections of the E2 polypeptide must be located in this gap, although none of them makes any apparent contribution to the density map: the N-terminal lipoyl domain, which shuttles between the catalytic core and the outer shell, the linker region connecting the lipoyl domain to the binding domain, and the linker region connecting the binding domain to the catalytic core domain. The structural mechanisms that contribute to the presence of the gap and maintain the size of the E1E2 and E2E3 subcomplexes and native PDH complexes are not yet clear. One possibility is that steric interactions between neighboring molecules reduce the possibility of large inward movements of the E1 tetramers and/or of the E3 dimers. It also seems plausible that the extended inner linker region (approximately between Ala167 and Gly204 may play a critical role in determining the distance of closest approach between the catalytic domain and the bound E1 and E3 enzyme complexes. No apparent secondary structure was detected in this stretch of amino acids by the program PredictProtein (38.Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although all of the known secondary structure elements of E2 were correctly determined (data not shown). However, most of the X-Pro peptide bonds present in the inner linker appear to occupy the all-trans rather than cis configuration (39.Radford S.E. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. Martin S.R. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 767-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could provide a certain level of rigidity to the chain of amino acids. Inspection of the structure of the assembled E2 core of 60 acetyltransferase domains (17.Izard T. Ævarsson A. Allen M.D. Westphal A.H. Perham R.N. de Kok A. Hol W.G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggests that the Gly204 residues of each of the three monomers that constitute a trimer at each vertex of the icosahedral core are separated by 42 Å, and the Gly204 residues in adjacent trimers are even further apart, making it unlikely that neighboring linker regions can form close associations to form a higher order structure. Further work by means of NMR spectroscopy and other techniques will be needed to analyze the structure and mechanistic relevance of the linker region in more detail. The architecture of the B. stearothermophilus PDH complex is likely to be broadly similar to that of the icosahedral PDH complexes of its eukaryotic counterparts. Thus cryoelectron microscopy of the PDH complex from bovine kidney (10.Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. O'Conner C.M. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14802-14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae (11.Gu Y. Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicates that the E1 components form a radial shell ∼50 Å above the central E2 core, although it is reported in the former paper that a high occupancy of the E1 binding sites can lead to an extension of the linker region from 50 to ∼75 Å. Moreover, in these complexes, the E3 homodimers are bound to the E2 core by association with an additional component, an E3-binding protein. This appears to lead to the E3 being more intimately associated with the inner E2 core in the openings on the 12 5-fold faces of the dodecahedron (8.Stoops J.K. Cheng R.H. Yazdi M.A. Maaeng C.-Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 6921-6933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicate a more exterior positioning of the E3 in the mammalian PDH complex. Thus, while following the same general pattern, the molecular architecture of PDH complexes from different sources may differ in detail. We had previously suggested that the presence of a high surface concentration of the E1 heterotetramers limits the search space required for active site coupling, by allowing the lipoyl domain to shuttle back and forth across and within the gap between the E1 and E2 active sites (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A complete turnover of the complex requires the successive participation of an E1, E2, and E3 active site working on a given lipoyl domain. Given the high ratio (∼4-8:1) of E1 to E3 in the assembled B. stearothermophilus PDH complex (19.Domingo G.J. Chauhan H.J. Lessard I.A.D. Fuller C. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the apparently random placement of E1 and E3 over the surface of E2, it would clearly be desirable for the lipoyl domain to easily access the more limited number of E3 active sites. The positioning of E3 in an annular shell at about the same level as E1, rather than outside of the E1 protein layer, and with active sites accessible from the annular gap, is therefore likely to be important for the effective regeneration of the lipoyl moiety (Fig. 5). The lack of E1 and E3 protein density in the annular gap could also facilitate movement of the lipoyl domain that may have to sweep through considerable annular space before reaching an available E3 homodimer, especially in native PDH complexes with only a few E3 enzymes per complex. An individual lipoyl domain is predicted to migrate up to 140 Å away from its PSBD given the ∼50 amino acid linker that separates the two domains (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In a native PDH complex, this movement would enable it to interact with at least nine peripherally bound enzymes. A hypothetical model of a native pyruvate dehydrogenase complex containing 60 E2, 50 E1, and 10 E3 (Fig. 6) positioned about the E2 core using the best fitting coordinates derived from models of the E1E2 (14.Milne J.L.S. Shi D. Rosenthal P.B. Sunshine J.S. Domingo G.J. Wu X. Brooks B.R. Perham R.N. Henderson R. Subramaniam S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and E2E3 subcomplexes (Fig. 5) indicates that there are no apparent steric constraints that might prevent the formation of such a complex. The arrangement of the enzymes is consistent with the hypothesis that the lipoyl domain primarily resides and functions inside the annular gap. The possibility that the movement of the lipoyl domain is not completely free but instead may occur via constrained trajectories has been suggested previously (41.Chauhan H.J. Domingo G.J. Jung H.-I. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 7158-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 42.Fries M. Chauhan H.J. Domingo G.J. Jung H.-I. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Inspection of the outer surface of the icosahedral inner core of E2 reveals it to be predominantly positively charged, with a ring of positive charges near the entrance to each active site. In contrast, the lipoyl domain is predominantly negatively charged. Although the lysine residue to which the lipoyl group is attached is positively charged, this charge is neutralized by the amide bond formation that occurs upon attachment of the terminal amino group to the lipoyl domain. Thus, the movement of the lipoyl domain may not be random and could be guided, in part, by simple electrostatic interactions in the interior of this elegant molecular machine.

Site-directed mutagenesis implicated Cys210 in the LKB1 activation loop as the residue modified. Notably, ERK, JNK, and AKT serine/threonine kinases with leucine or methionine, instead of cysteine, in their activation loop did not form a covalent lipid adduct. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal, 4-oxo-2-nonenal, and cyclopentenone prostaglandin A and J, which all contain α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, inhibited the AMP-kinase kinase activity of cellular LKB1. In turn, this attenuated signals throughout the LKB1 → AMP kinase pathway and disrupted its restraint of ribosomal S6 kinases. The electrophilic β-carbon in these lipids appears to be critical for inhibition because unreactive lipids, e.g. PGB1, PGE2, PGF2α, and TxB2, did not inhibit LKB1 activity (p > 0.05). Ectopic expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and endogenous biosynthesis of eicosanoids also inhibited LKB1 activity in MCF-7 cells.

In certain experiments cells were treated with 60 μm PG for 4 h, and 50 nm rapamycin for 2 h prior to AICAR treatment. The cells were lysed as described above; 15 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies directed against phospho-Thr172-AMPKα (1:1000), total AMPKα (1:1000), phospho-Ser79-ACC (1:1000), phospho-Thr389-p70 S6K (1:1000), and total p70 S6K (1:1000), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000). Protein bands were detected with Western Lighting™. The bands were analyzed using a Kodak Image Station 440™, and the net band intensity was converted to a percentage of the control. Experiments were repeated 3–10 times, and data depict the mean ± S.E. Prostaglandin E2 and D2 Formation—Enzyme immunoassays were performed to assess PGE2 and PGD2 metabolite formation. COX-2 was transfected into MCF-7 cells using 1 μg/μl DNA, 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ for 24 h following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with 10 μm COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (Cayman Chemical) or vehicle control for 1 h followed by treatment with 100 μm of arachidonic acid for 4 h. PGE2 Express EIA kit and PGD2-MOX Express kits (Cayman Chemical) were used following the manufacturer's protocol. Medium from cell culture was sampled and analyzed at 30 m. Experiments were repeated three times, and results depict the mean ± S.E. Statistics—Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's or Newman-Keul's post-hoc test for comparisons among groups. Covalent Modification of Cellular LKB1 by Electrophilic Lipids—Cyclopentenone PG and 4-HNE react covalently with IKK (16Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 17Ji C. Kozak K.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18223-18228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, these lipids may modify other serine/threonine kinases with homology to the Cys179 residue in IKK. LKB1, a unique serine/threonine kinase tumor suppressor, has a nucleophilic Cys210 that aligns with the Cys179 residue in the activation loop of IKKα and IKKβ. In contrast, ERK, JNK, p38, and AKT kinases have Met or Leu residues in the corresponding position (Fig. 2A). To determine whether electrophilic PGs could react directly with LKB1 and other kinases, we used PGA1 amidopentylbiotin (PGA1-APB). This PG analog has the characteristic α,β-unsaturated ketone of PGA1 but a C-1 biotin amide instead of a C-1 carboxyl group. Proteins that react with PGA1-APB will subsequently contain a biotin epitope, which binds to neutravidin beads, thereby enabling their isolation and identification (15Moos P.J. Edes K. Cassidy P. Massuda E. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 745-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PGA1-amidopentylbiotin reacted covalently with cellular LKB1 and IKKα but not with ERK1/2, JNK2, AKT, or IKKγ (Fig. 2B). These inert kinases lack the distinctive Cys residue corresponding to Cys179 in IKKα or Cys210 in LKB1. However, these kinases do have Cys residues at other positions. Thus, cellular serine/threonine kinases do not react indiscriminately with PGA1-amidopentylbiotin under these experimental conditions. We obtained similar results for Δ12-PGJ2-amidopentylbiotin (data not shown). Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Cys210 in the activation loop of LKB1 is required for lipid adduct formation. RKO cells express negligible amounts of LKB1; therefore, we transfected them with plasmids encoding LKB1 or the corresponding C210S mutant. PGA1-amidopentylbiotin formed a covalent adduct with wild type LKB1 protein but not with the LKB1-C210S mutant protein (Fig. 3A). Adduct formation with LKB1 was not dependent on ectopic overexpression of the LKB1 protein. PGA1-amidopentylbiotin formed adducts with wild type LKB1 expressed physiologically in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Additionally, adduct formation is not unique to PGA1 as both PGA1-amidopentylbiotin and Δ12-PGJ2-amidopentylbiotin formed adducts with LKB1 in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of Cellular LKB1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Activity by Reactive Lipid Species—The AMP-kinase kinase activity of LKB1 can be determined by measuring the cellular conversion of AMPKα into phospho-Thr172-AMPKα. Basal levels of phospho-Thr172-AMPKα were low but detectable in MCF-7 cells grown in 10% FCS (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Phospho-Thr172-AMPKα levels rose in cells incubated with the AMP mimetic, AICAR (Fig. 4A, lane 3), and in cells placed in 1% FCS for 6 h (Fig. 4A, lane 5). PGA1 inhibited the formation of phospho-Thr172-AMPKα by these stimuli (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Several different reactive lipid species that have electrophilic β-carbons, including 4-HNE, 4-ONE, 15-deoxy-Δ12, Δ14-PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and PGA1, inhibited the AMP-kinase kinase activity of LKB1 in MCF-7 cells stimulated with AICAR (Fig. 4B). Inhibition was concentration-dependent (Fig. 4C) with IC50 (half-maximal inhibition, mean ± S.E.) of 26.8 ± 4.3 μm PGA1 (n = 10), 12 ± 2.0 μm Δ12-PGJ2 (n = 8), 3.0 ± 1.4 μm 4-HNE (n = 4), and 2.5 ± 1.0 μm 4-ONE (n = 3). The electrophilic β-carbon appeared to be critical for inhibition, because unreactive lipids, including cyclopentenone PGB1, PGE2, PGF2α, 15-keto-PGF2α, and TxB2 at concentrations of 60–100 μm did not inhibit LKB1 activity (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of the LKB1-AMPKα-mTOR-S6 Kinase Signaling Pathway by Reactive Lipid Species—Inhibition of LKB1 by reactive lipids affected proximal and distal components in its signaling pathway downstream from AMPKα. For instance, PGA1, Δ12-PGJ2, and 4-HNE inhibited the phosphorylation of ACC, a substrate for phospho-Thr172-AMPKα, whereas PGB1 did not (Fig. 5A). Likewise, signaling through the S6 kinase pathway was affected. The basal level of phospho-Thr389-S6 kinase was readily detectable in MCF-7 cells, which must be grown in media containing 0.01 mg/ml insulin (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 1). Activation of the cellular LKB1-AMPKα pathway with 2 mm AICAR reduced the level of phospho-Thr389-S6K, the active form of S6K (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 3). Δ12-PGJ2, alone, enhanced S6K activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 2 versus lane 1). Δ12-PGJ2 antagonized the effect of AICAR on cellular LKB1 activity and restored the content of phospho-Thr389-S6K to the control, tonic level (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 1). Finally, rapamycin, which interacts directly with mTOR, overrode the inactivation of LKB1 by Δ12-PGJ2 and blocked phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, by inactivating cellular LKB1 at the apex of the AMPKα pathway, Δ12-PGJ2 enhanced the distal formation of anabolically active phospho-Thr389-S6K, consistent with the scheme shown in Fig. 1. Inhibition of LKB1 Activity by Ectopic Expression of Cyclooxygenase-2—COX-2 expression and activity are increased in inflammation and in tumors (25Thun M.J. Henley S.J. Gansler T. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 256: 6-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fitzpatrick F.A. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1651-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This exposes cells to autocoid mediators and related, reactive lipid species. To extend our investigation, we tested whether or not transfection of MCF7 cells with a plasmid encoding COX-2 would inhibit LKB1 kinase activity by enabling biosynthesis of endogenous eicosanoids. Ectopic expression of COX-2 in the presence of its substrate, arachidonic acid, inhibited the kinase activity of LKB1. LKB1 activity, measured as phospho-Thr172-AMPKα formation, was designated 100% in mock-transfected MCF-7 cells stimulated with 2 mm AICAR (Fig. 6A). LKB1 activity remained comparable with control in MCF-7 cells transfected with COX-2 and stimulated with 2 mm AICAR. The phospho-Thr172-AMPKα content fell (p < 0.01) in MCF-7 cells transfected with COX-2 and supplemented with 100 μm arachidonic acid (Fig. 6B, lane 5). In mock-transfected MCF-7 cells incubated with 100 μm arachidonic acid, the phospho-Thr172-AMPKα levels were indistinguishable from the control (p > 0.05) (Fig. 6A). Ibuprofen, a known inhibitor of COX-2, restored the kinase activity of LKB1 demonstrated by phospho-Thr172-AMPKα content (Fig. 6B, lane 6). These data are consistent with the inhibition of LKB1 by endogenously generated reactive lipid species. We verified that MCF-7 cells transfected with COX-2 made more PGE2 and PGD2 than mock-transfected cells when incubated with 100 μm arachidonic acid (Table 1). NS-398, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, lowered PGE2 and PGD2 formation by cells transfected with COX-2 but not mock-transfected cells. MCF-7 cells constitutively express COX-1 (28Liu X.H. Rose D.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5125-5127PubMed Google Scholar), which accounts for PGE2 and PGD2 biosynthesis by mock-transfected cells.TABLE 1Prostaglandin formation by MCF-7 cellsTreatmentMockCOX-2 transfection PGE2pg/mlVehicle9.5 ± 2.118.7 ± 9.2100 μm AA173.0 ± 66.2368.7 ± 101.7100 μm AA plus NS-398136.7 ± 14.388.3 ± 36.8TreatmentMockCOX-2 transfection PGD2pg/mlVehicle13.7 ± 3.316.7 ± 2.4100 μm AA649.7 ± 139.1892.7 ± 128.6100 μm AA plus NS-398540.3 ± 21.1534.7 ± 153.8 Open table in a new tab Recently, LKB1 was identified as the gene responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (18Jenne D.E.

The cellular substrates and biological roles of LKB1 were unknown until 2003–2004, when investigators discovered that it phosphorylated AMPK and functioned as a unique AMP-kinase kinase (20Woods A.

Biol. 2003. 2003; : 2/26Google Scholar). LKB1 has two vital cellular roles as follows: tumor suppressor and regulator of anabolic/catabolic homeostasis. LKB1 achieves its purpose by negatively regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway (Fig. 1). When activated by their respective stimuli, LKB1 and AKT send opposing signals that determine the ratio of the active/inactive forms of TSC1/2, mTOR, and ribosomal S6K. This, in turn, balances anabolic and catabolic processes in order to maintain cellular energy homeostasis (ATP levels) (23Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Our data show that exogenous electrophilic lipids, as well as endogenous catalysis by cellular COX-2, can inhibit LKB1 activity and shift the equilibrium in the pathway toward phosphorylation and activation of ribosomal S6K. If this should occur when cells have too little ATP to support proper translation of RNA into proteins, it might facilitate tumor progression. Dysregulation of protein translation is important in several cancers (30Watkins S.J. Norbury C.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 86: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Brugarolas J.

Shao Z.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 2085-2090PubMed Google Scholar) and with the transition from pre-malignant to malignant tumor growth in lung cancer (34Ghaffar H. Sahin F. Sanchez-Cepedes M.

Although speculative at this point, our results suggest that inhibition of LKB1 because of its chemical inactivation by reactive lipid species or overexpression of COX-2, such as in Fig. 6, may have consequences similar to loss of expression of LKB1 or mutational inactivation. LKB1 is a tumor suppressor that often retains one wild type allele, deviating from Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. This suggests that LKB1 is a potential candidate for inactivating processes that are distinct from genetic or epigenetic lesions. Furthermore, we reasoned that LKB1 would be covalently modified and inactivated by cyclopentenone PG and 4-HNE as follows. PGA1 and 15-deoxy-PGJ2 inhibit some serine/threonine kinases but not others. For example, they inhibit IKK but not ERK1, ERK2, p38, or JNK (16Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 39Hortelano S. Castrillo A. Alvarez A.M. Bosca L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6525-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological experiments with inert and reactive eicosanoids, Rossi et al. (16Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) proposed a Michael addition at the Cys179 residue in the activation loop as the molecular basis for inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ. Because LKB1 is a rare example of a tumor suppressor, which functions as a serine/threonine kinase (18Jenne D.E. Reimann H. Nezu J. Friedel W. Loff S. Jeschke R. Muller O. Back W. Zimmer M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 19Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G. Warren W. Aminoff M. Hoglund P. Jarvinen H.

Nature. 1998; 391: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), we compared the amino acid sequence of LKB1 flanking its activation loop with those for IKK, ERK, JNK, AKT, and p38. This sequence alignment revealed a Cys210 residue in LKB1 that corresponded to the Cys179 residue in IKK. These Cys residues are distinct to LKB1, IKKα, and IKKβ but not ERK, JNK, and p38 kinases, which have Met or Leu in comparable positions (Fig. 2). Our results show that cyclopentenone PGs of the A- and J-series covalently modify LKB1 and IKKα but not ERK1/2, JNK2, IKKγ, AKT, or an LKB1 mutant with Cys210 replaced by Ser210. Thus, these cellular serine/threonine kinases do not react indiscriminately with PGA1-amidopentylbiotin under our experimental conditions. The results in Figs. 2 and 3 are compatible with the following: (i) the pharmacological data mentioned above (16Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 39Hortelano S. Castrillo A. Alvarez A.M. Bosca L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6525-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); (ii) the known chemical reactivity between thiols (–SH) and α,β-unsaturated carbonyls (Michael reaction); and (iii) the influence of other amino acids on steric accessibility of the thiol and the chemical reactivity of cysteine. Interactions between cysteine and other amino acids determine the pKa and nucleophilic character of its thiol (RSH ⇆ RS–). Virtually all lipids bind to cellular proteins by reversible, low affinity interactions (Kd ∼ 10–6 liter/mol). For some lipids with an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, this low affinity interaction with proteins seems to position their electrophilic β-carbon near a nucleophilic substituent that is favorably disposed for Michael addition, i.e. Cys179 in IKK (16Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar), Cys210 in LKB1, Cys38 in the p65 subunit of NFκB (40Straus D.S.

The chemistry of nucleophilic Michael addition reactions argues against any individual α,β-unsaturated carbonyl acting as a regulatory molecule via specific, covalent reaction with any individual protein receptor. If these reactive lipids modulate biological processes, they probably do so with less specificity than classical autocoids. For example, multiple lipids with α,β-unsaturated ketones can react with a particular protein, e.g. thioredoxin reductase (15Moos P.J. Edes K. Cassidy P. Massuda E. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol.

During oxidative stress, inflammation, or overexpression of COX-2, the biological milieu may contain multiple electrophilic species. Consequently, each species with an α,β-unsaturated ketone will contribute, stoichiometrically, to any pathophysiological effect. 4-HNE, cyclopentenone PGs, and 8-iso-cyclopentenone PGs, have been detected in vivo within cellular proteins at sites of inflammation (46Chen Y.

Such an unconventional mechanism of action for resolving inflammation may confer inevitable risks, such as the impairment of other proteins and tumors suppressors. Disruption of tumor suppressors by inflammatory mediators seems especially relevant to cancers associated with chronic inflammation or overexpression of cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase (25Thun M.J.

Here we reported a systematic study of the effects of base pair size in T7 DNA polymerase (pol), the replicative enzyme for bacteriophage T7. We varied base pair size in very small (0.25 Å) increments by use of a series of nonpolar thymidine shape mimics having gradually increasing size. Steady-state kinetics were evaluated for the 5A7A exonuclease-deficient mutant in a 1:1 complex with thioredoxin. For T7 pol, we studied insertion of natural nucleotides opposite variably sized T analogs in the template and, conversely, for variably sized dTTP analogs opposite natural template bases. The enzyme displayed extremely high selectivity for a specific base pair size, with drops in efficiency of as much as 280-fold for increases of 0.4 Å beyond an optimum size approximating the size of a natural pair. The enzyme also strongly rejected pairs that were smaller than the optimum by as little as 0.3 Å. The size preferences with T7 DNA pol were generally smaller, and the steric rejection was greater than DNA pol I Klenow fragment, correlating with the higher fidelity of the former.

The DNA polymerase encoded by gene 5 of the T7 phage has long been studied as a model for DNA replication in general (1Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol.

The T7 polymerase works together with primase-helicase and single-stranded binding protein to replicate the circular 40-kb genome of the phage. To replicate a genome of this size, the polymerase recruits an Escherichia coli protein, thioredoxin, which forms a tight 1:1 complex with the polymerase (pol) 4The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; B, 2,4-dibromo-5-toluene; H, 5-toluene; F, 2,4,-difluoro-5-toluene; L, 2,4,-dichloro-5-toluene; I, 2,4,-diiodo-5-toluene; dH, 5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dHTP, 5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside 5′-triphosphate; dF, 2,4-difluoro-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dFTP, 2,4-difluoro-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside-5′-triphosphate; dL, 2,4-dichloro-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dLTP, 2,4-dichloro-5-toluene-1-deoxyribo-side-5′-triphosphate; dB, 2,4-dibromo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dBTP, 2,4-dibromo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside-5′-triphosphate; dI, 2,4-diiodo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dITP, 2,4-diiodo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside-5′-triphosphate. 4The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; B, 2,4-dibromo-5-toluene; H, 5-toluene; F, 2,4,-difluoro-5-toluene; L, 2,4,-dichloro-5-toluene; I, 2,4,-diiodo-5-toluene; dH, 5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dHTP, 5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside 5′-triphosphate; dF, 2,4-difluoro-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dFTP, 2,4-difluoro-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside-5′-triphosphate; dL, 2,4-dichloro-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dLTP, 2,4-dichloro-5-toluene-1-deoxyribo-side-5′-triphosphate; dB, 2,4-dibromo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dBTP, 2,4-dibromo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside-5′-triphosphate; dI, 2,4-diiodo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside; dITP, 2,4-diiodo-5-toluene-1-deoxyriboside-5′-triphosphate.

Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T7 pol-thioredoxin complex (abbreviated as T7 pol here) is a high efficiency and high fidelity polymerase of the A family, sharing homology and structural features with other enzymes of this family such as DNA pol I and Taq polymerase (6Jung G.H. Leavitt M.C. Hsieh J.C. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8287-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The polymerase synthesizes DNA processively at a rate of ∼500 nucleotides/s, and typically proceeds several thousand nucleotides before dissociating (5Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another important feature of T7 DNA polymerase is its high fidelity, which is necessary for conservation of the phage genome as it is copied. Crystal structures of the enzyme bound to DNA and dNTP substrates have shown a high packing density of the protein around the DNA being synthesized (7Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), resembling other A family enzyme structures (8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G.

In general, it has been hypothesized that a “tight” fit by high fidelity polymerases around the incipient base pair might help enforce a correct Watson-Crick geometry and aid in rejecting geometrically incorrect mismatches (10Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 11Moran S. Ren R.X. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, testing this geometric and steric concept with standard DNA bases and their close analogs can be complicated by the fact that they have widely varying sizes, shapes, and functional groups. We recently developed a set of nucleoside analogs that are designed to test steric effects in a systematic way, with incremental size differences over a 1.0 Å range (15Kim T.W. Kool E.T. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 3949-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These molecules are all thymidine analogs (Fig. 1), and their bases retain the general shape of natural thymine, but all are nonpolar and lack hydrogen bonding ability (16Kim T.W. Kool E.T. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 2048-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The sizes of the analogs are varied in sub-angstrom increments by use of the atomic series H, F, Cl, Br, and I. Of these five, the F-substituted analog (difluorotoluene (17Schweitzer B.A. Kool E.T. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 7238-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Rumney S. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar)) is a nearly exact shape and size mimic for natural thymine, whereas the H analog is smaller, and the others are progressively larger. An initial study testing these analogs with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA pol I (Kf exo-) showed that that enzyme was highly sensitive to size changes across this series (19Kim T.W. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the most efficiently processed analog was the dichloro compound (L), which forms base pairs with adenine that are larger than a natural pair by ∼0.6 Å. It was suggested that tightness, as defined by active site rigidity, plays a strong role in determining the fidelity of that enzyme. However, it is unknown whether other polymerases use this same mechanism. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether enzymes with higher or lower fidelity than Kf would exhibit correspondingly different active site steric responses in association with these differences in fidelity. Finally, it remains unclear what the best definition of polymerase “tightness” should be: should it refer to active site rigidity (i.e. ability to move (or to resist moving) in response to steric properties of a substrate), or should it refer to a static size (i.e. larger or smaller) preference for its optimum substrate? The present study is aimed at addressing these issues. Here we investigate the effects of varied DNA substrate size on the synthesis of DNA by the high fidelity T7 DNA polymerase. We find that, like Kf exo-, the T7 enzyme is highly sensitive in kinetic efficiency to size changes across this analog series. However, distinct from Kf, the T7 enzyme shows an even stronger dependence on substrate size and also shows a preference for smaller substrates. We discuss the functional mechanism by which this enzyme achieves high fidelity, and we also introduce an experimental strategy to measure individual contributions of the two chief parameters of polymerase tightness, namely active site rigidity and active site size. Thymidine Analogs—The dNTP derivatives of the thymidine analogs were prepared as described (19Kim T.W. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Phosphoramidite derivatives of dH, dL, dB, and dI were prepared as described previously (18Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Rumney S. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The phosphoramidite derivative of analog dF was purchased from Glen Research. Oligodeoxynucleotides—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 394 synthesizer using standard β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry. Oligomers were synthesized in DMT-off mode, deprotected in concentrated NH4OH (55 °C, 8 h), purified by preparative 20% denaturing PAGE, isolated by the crush and soak method, and quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. Molar extinction coefficients were calculated by the nearest neighbor method (20Cavaluzzi M.J. Borer P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Values for oligonucleotides containing non-natural residues were obtained in the following way. The molar extinction coefficients at 260 nm for dH, dF, dL, dB, and dI were taken as 250, 1000, 250, 500, and 3900 m-1 cm-1, respectively. The individual extinction coefficients for all the bases in a given oligomer were summed and compared with the sum from the corresponding sequence in which the non-natural residues were replaced by T. Because in most cases the content of non-natural residues in the sequences is low, this estimation method is unlikely to generate large errors in concentration. Steady-state Kinetics Studies—Primer (final concentration, ∼100 nm) was labeled with 5′-[γ-32P]ATP (catalog number PB10218 from Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (catalog number 18004-010 from Invitrogen) and purified using ethanol precipitation (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Woodbury, NY2001: 10.17-10.20Google Scholar). Labeled primer (final concentration, ∼20 nm), template, and unlabeled primer were mixed in 5× reaction buffer and gave a final total concentration of primer-template of ∼200 nm. The primer-template duplexes were annealed by heating to 95 °C and slow cooling to 4 °C over 1 h. Steady-state kinetics for single-nucleotide insertions were carried out as described (22Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Briefly, insertion reactions were carried out in 10-μl volumes in the reaction buffer: 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol for exonuclease-free T7 5A7A DNA polymerase (3Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). A 1× stock solution of duplex was mixed with 1× T7 5A7A DNA polymerase for 2 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by adding a 1× solution of the appropriate dNTP. Concentrations of dNTP ranged from 1 to 50 nm for efficient pairings with a template base and 50-500 nm for inefficient pairings. Enzyme concentration and reaction time were adjusted in different dNTP reactions to give 1-20% incorporation in time periods ≤50 min. The following enzyme concentrations (nm) and times (min) were used (N → M denotes dNTP inserted across from base M in the template strand): H→A, 40, 30; F→A, 2, 3; L → A, 2, 0.5; B→A, 2, 1.67; I → A, 2, 30; T → A, 2, 0.67; T → G, 40, 1; H → T, 160, 15; F → T, 40, 30; L → T, 40, 4; B → T, 40, 4; I → A, 40, 2; A → H, 2, 5; A → F, 2, 0.83; A → L, 2, 2; A → B, 2, 8; A → I, 40, 2; A → T, 2, 0.67; T → H, 40, 1; T → F, 2, 10; T → L, 40, 3; T → B, 40, 3; T→I, 40, 50; G → T, 40, 3. Reactions were quenched with 15 μl of loading buffer I (80% formamide, 1× TBE (89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA), 0.05% xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). Extents of reaction were determined by running quenched reaction samples on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to separate unreacted primer from insertion products. Radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and the ImageQuant program. Relative velocity v was measured as the ratio of the extended product (Iext) to remaining primer (Iprim) as follows v = Iext/Iprim × t, where t represents the reaction time, and normalized for the lowest enzyme concentration used. The apparent Km and Vmax values were obtained from Hanes-Woolf plots. To test the effects of small size differences in the incipient base pair on the functioning of T7 DNA polymerase, we employed the series of thymidine analogs shown in Fig. 1. Base pairing studies of these compounds in DNA (in the absence of enzymes) have shown that they all behave similarly, and their pairing properties are consistent with their nonpolar character (16Kim T.W. Kool E.T. J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 2048-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All five compounds are somewhat destabilizing (compared with a native base pair) when placed opposite adenine in the center of an oligonucleotide duplex, and they show little pairing selectivity with any of the four possible natural partners, with a slight preference for adenine among the four. This preference has been attributed to the stronger stacking ability of adenine among the natural bases. The general lack of selectivity and the similar behavior of these compounds in DNA alone serves as a base line for enzymatic studies; any observed polymerase selectivity in choosing among natural partners, and any differences among the five analogs, would necessarily arise from the influence of the enzyme rather than from the energetics of base pairing alone. Our initial experiments were carried out qualitatively and were aimed at surveying the effects of the different analogs with all possible natural partners. We employed the 5A7A mutant of T7 DNA polymerase, which has extremely low exonuclease activity (3Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), in 1:1 complex with thioredoxin. We tested the analogs as both incoming nucleotide (dNTP) derivatives (Fig. 2A) and as template bases (Fig. 2B), and we evaluated single nucleotide additions by gel electrophoresis. All five analogs were active as dNTP or template substrates for the enzyme but clearly required different conditions (see Fig. 2 legend), indicating a wide variation in reaction efficiency. Also clear from the relative intensities of the product bands was that there were clear preferences among natural partners for pairing with the analogs in the polymerase active site. Adenine was by far the preferred replication partner, and this was true whether the thymidine analogs were dNTP derivatives or were present in the template. The second most prevalent products resulted from mispairing of the analogs with thymine. This is different from the natural base thymine, which is commonly mispaired with guanine during enzymatic synthesis of DNA. Overall, the data show considerable symmetry, in that the selectivities for analogs as incoming dNTP derivatives closely resemble those with insertion of natural dNTPs opposite the analogs in the template strand. To quantify the effects of small size variations in the incipient base pair on efficiency of this enzyme, we carried out steady-state kinetics measurements for single nucleotide insertion reactions with these analogs. The data are assembled in Tables 1 and 2. We measured the kinetics for insertion of the thymidine analogs opposite adenine in the template DNA and for insertion of dATP opposite the variably sized thymine analogs in the template. The corresponding natural base pairings (dTTP opposite A and dATP opposite T) were also measured for comparison.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetics for single nucleotide insertions with T7 DNA polymerase (exo-) The conditions used are as follows: 200 nm 23-mer/28-mer primer-template duplex, 2, 40, or 160 nm T7(exo-), 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 30 s to 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 10 μl.

As an incoming nucleotide, the most efficient analog was the dichloro derivative dLTP. Its efficiency (as Vmax/Km) was only 4-fold below that of the natural congener dTTP. The dLTP analog was 17-fold more efficient than previously reported for dFTP, which is the closest size mimic of the natural nucleotide. Activity fell off steeply for larger and smaller analogs, with the largest (dITP) being 320-fold less efficient than the optimum, and the smallest (dHTP) being 6700-fold less efficient than the optimum. For the converse experiments with analogs in the template strand, the most efficient template base was the F analog, which was 14-fold less efficient than T. The smallest analog (H) was 48-fold less efficient than the optimum, whereas the largest (I) was less efficient by 280-fold. These size versus efficiency data are presented as plots in Fig. 3, A and B. The data were further analyzed by plotting Vmax and Km values as a function of size (see supplemental Fig. S1). Results showed that varying the size either of the incoming nucleotide or of the template base had a similar effect on both parameters. Vmax values varied strongly and were much greater for the optimally sized analogs (F or L) and dropped off precipitously for smaller and larger analogs. The Km values stayed relatively constant but showed a clear optimum (minimal Km) for F or L, consistent with more favorable interactions in the active site for those cases. We also evaluated size effects on selectivity and fidelity in the active site by measuring the kinetics of the most efficient misinsertions, in which the analogs are paired with thymine. We used the most efficient mismatch to measure minimum fidelity (rather than averaging all mismatches) because the most frequent mismatch defines the majority of mutations in DNA replication. The numerical data are given in Tables 1 and 2. Results with varying dNTP sizes showed that mismatching efficiency increased with size (see plot in supplemental Fig. S2), but there was a broad maximum efficiency with the largest analogs. The selectivity for an adenine-containing template over a thymine template is plotted in Fig. 3C; the maximum is found at the difluoro compound (dFTP). Data for fidelity in the converse situation, with thymidine analogs in the template, are given in Table 2 and are plotted in Fig. 3D. The experiments showed that efficiencies for misinsertion of dTTP opposite the analogs increased generally with increasing size (supplemental Fig. S2). Fidelity (defined as the preference for dATP insertion over dTTP insertion) reached a maximum at the F template (Fig. 3D), which was shown (above) to have the optimal size with this enzyme. The current data shed light on the functional basis for the high fidelity of T7 DNA polymerase. Our data confirm the high selectivity for insertion of natural nucleotides; the insertion of dGTP opposite T is less favorable than dATP opposite T by a large factor of 67,000. By comparison, the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA pol I (Kf) has a fidelity of 1,800 against G → T mismatch synthesis (18Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Rumney S. Kool E.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2056-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the T7 enzyme, this high fidelity is accompanied by a high rate of processive synthesis (∼500 nucleotides/s, compared with ∼10 nucleotides/s for Kf) and high processivity (>1000 versus ∼10 nucleotides for Kf), due in large part to the thioredoxin component (5Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current experiments show that the T7 enzyme has a strong preference for specifically sized partners for a given template base. When the incoming nucleotide was varied in size, the optimum (dLTP) was considerably more efficient than analogs only slightly larger or smaller. For example, dFTP (with bond lengths only 0.28 Å shorter) was 16-fold less efficient; dBTP (with bond lengths 0.16 Å longer) was 8-fold less efficient. Further expansion or reduction in size led to even more dramatic differences; decreasing the size from dFTP to dHTP (0.28 Å difference) led to a 400-fold efficiency drop, and increasing it from dBTP to dITP (0.20 Å difference) led to a 41-fold drop. The magnitude of this steric sensitivity is significantly greater than that observed previously for the Kf polymerase (19Kim T.W. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For example, a decrease in size from dFTP to dHTP caused a 58-fold decrease in the efficiency of Kf, and increasing size from dBTP to dITP led to a 11-fold drop. A general comparison of the response to varying thymidine analog sizes between T7 pol and Kf polymerases reveals two significant differences in these enzymes (see supplemental Fig. S3 for overlaid plots). First is the somewhat steeper drop in efficiency for substrates that are slightly too large or too small, as mentioned above. We propose that this is best explained by greater rigidity of the T7 polymerase active site in the closed, catalytically active conformation; this is discussed below. The second difference is that the T7 enzyme has a smaller optimum size for an analog in the templating position (supplemental Figs. S3, B and D). This high fidelity enzyme prefers difluorotoluene as a substrate, yielding both higher efficiency and fidelity with this size than the Kf enzyme, which shows a kinetic preference for the larger dichloro analog (19Kim T.W. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The difference in bond lengths for these two substrates is 0.38 Å. Thus, the effective active site size for the T7 enzyme appears to be ∼0.3-0.4 Å smaller than for Kf. High fidelity DNA polymerases undergo an induced fit conformation change prior to forming the new phosphodiester bond (24Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 25Doublie S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that, on closing of the fingers domain, high fidelity polymerases tightly surround the incipient base pair to closely enforce base pair selectivity, whereas low fidelity repair and lesion bypass polymerases may have more “open” active sites (13Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Yang W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P.K. Yadav P.N. Pandey V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33624-33634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that can accept varied geometries of mismatched or damaged pairs with less energetic cost. However, such general descriptions do not make clear how fidelity is enforced in the steric sense. We hypothesize that there are two chief parameters that might affect the kinetics of base pairing and dNTP insertion, the preferred size of an active site and its rigidity. We illustrate these concepts with two hypothetical plots in which these parameters are varied (Fig. 4). First we address the effects of different active site sizes on the insertion kinetics for variably sized analogs (Fig. 4A). Here we define “active site” as both the residues that come in contact with the incipient base pair, as well as those parts of the protein that are structurally affected by motions in those residues. One might envision a highly rigid active site that could not easily flex outward or compress inward around different-sized substrates once the polymerase closed around an incipient base pair. A close structural correspondence between the active site and canonical Watson-Crick pairs would then strongly disfavor mispairing of the incoming dNTP in the closed conformation of the polymerase, particularly if DNA substrates projected beyond the boundaries of the binding pocket in any direction. Note that there must also be a mechanism for rejecting base pairs that are too small, such as T-T. Such small pairs might be rejected by the high thermodynamic cost of the void (loss of favorable contacts) left by the too-small substrate. Alternatively, if the nucleobases carried water of solvation (28Gao J. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 51: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), such pairing might be sterically rejected as too large (13Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Now we imagine what would be the result if different polymerases, in their closed or most active form, had active sites fixed to different sizes (Fig. 4A). First, using the present series of size-varied analogs, we might see distinctive peaks at different optimal substrate sizes corresponding to more or less room in the active site of each polymerase. This is in fact what we have observed in a comparison of the very high fidelity T7 enzyme with the somewhat lower fidelity Kf enzyme (supplemental Fig. S3 B and D). We also predict that an enzyme with an active site size that is larger than natural Watson-Crick base pairs would show less tendency to reject sterically larger mismatches. Thus polymerases with similar rigidities, but distinct optimal size preferences, could in principle show very different fidelities of templated DNA synthesis with natural bases. A second factor contributing to the variable fidelities of different polymerases might also be envisioned (Fig. 4B), namely varied rigidity. In this mechanism, different polymerases might exhibit the same active site size preferences, as shown by the similar optima in Fig. 4B. For these polymerases, the active site structure surrounding the incipient pair might look the same in a crystallographic snapshot of the closed conformation, with similarly close contacts to the incipient base pair in both high fidelity and low fidelity enzymes. However, if active site rigidity plays a role in substrate selection, a high fidelity enzyme might be more rigid and produce large energetic penalties for flexing outward to relieve a clash or inward to fill a void while maintaining other interactions with the substrate that contribute to catalysis in the closed conformation of the polymerase. Conversely, a low fidelity enzyme might be relatively “loose” or flexible in the region of the base binding pocket, moving outward or inward with much lower energetic cost, thus accepting the varied shapes and sizes of mismatches more readily. Note that differences in rigidity between two or more enzymes (Fig. 4B) would be clearly distinguishable from differences in substrate size preference (Fig. 4A) in plots of size versus kinetic efficiency. Both mechanisms, active site size and rigidity, may contribute substantially to the fidelity of templated DNA synthesis by T7 pol and other enzymes. The steady-state kinetics data show both a smaller size preference of T7 pol relative to Kf (supplemental Figs. S3, B and D) in the template strand, and larger energetic penalties for increasing size and decreasing size for the larger and smaller substrates. Thus size-varied analogs provide functional evidence that the T7 polymerase:thioredoxin holoenzyme has both a somewhat smaller and more rigid active site than the Kf enzyme. Most interestingly, both the T7 enzyme and Kf show surprisingly high efficiency for base pairs that are larger than canonical T-A pairs. For example, the L-A pair, which has nearly wild-type efficiency with Kf (19Kim T.W. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and reasonably high efficiency with T7, is larger than a T-A pair by ∼0.5-0.6 Å, due to both the longer bond lengths and the lack of a hydrogen bonding contraction. We have hypothesized (19Kim T.W. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) that for Kf, this larger active site size may be a mechanism by which Kf (as pol I) contributes to the evolution of E. coli, by allowing a rare but finite mutation rate so that the bacteria can adapt to changing environments. However, the cost of this mechanistic and structural adaptation is that this larger active site size would yield lower efficiency with natural DNA than would be possible if the active site were smaller. DNA polymerase I and its derivative Kf primarily function in short gap synthesis during DNA repair, so the need for rapid synthesis and high processivity may not be pressing. However, as a replicative polymerase, the T7 pol must function in a highly accurate and efficient manner to copy the phage genome (29Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We suggest that the smaller active site size preference of T7 pol is a mechanism by which this can be achieved, and this also results in the lower frequency of mismatched base pairings. The kinetics experiments with the varied size probes provide data that are complementary to that from structural studies. The current probe series offers functional information at a resolution (∼0.2 Å) that exceeds that available for published x-ray crystal structures, which have typically been determined at 2 Å resolution or lower. In addition, the kinetic data directly relate to the rate-limiting transition state of the polymerase reaction, whereas structural studies yield information about the ground state and do not directly give measures of energetics. However, published crystal structures of DNA polymerases give important information about the protein-DNA contacts that are likely to be involved in maintaining steric control over matched versus mismatched (or damaged) pairs. Most interestingly, enzyme-DNA co-crystal structures of A family polymerases and error-prone Y family polymerases show essentially the same DNA C-1′-C-1′ interstrand distances (7Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Johnson S.J. Beese L.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 26Yang W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and similarly close protein-DNA contacts on opposite sides of the two DNA strands. One of the chief differences between the A and Y family polymerases is the appearance of more space around the incipient base pair in a Y family enzyme (23Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Yang W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We and others have hypothesized that more space might provide for adjustments to the differences in size at lower energetic cost, by allowing some freedom of motion without strong steric penalties. By contrast, the greater density in the closed form of the T7 enzyme (7Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) may be consistent with the notion of greater rigidity by providing closer packing of chains. Future kinetics studies with size-varied probes, such as those used here, would be useful in determining whether the low fidelity of Y family polymerases is associated with a larger active site functional size preference, or greater flexibility, or both.

New Cassini observations show that these strands, initially interpreted as concentric ring segments, are in fact connected and form a single one-arm trailing spiral winding at least three times around Saturn. The spiral rotates around Saturn with the orbital motion of its constituent particles. This structure is likely the result of differential orbital motion stretching an initial cloud of particles scattered from the dense core of the F ring. Different scenarios of formation, implying ringlet-satellite interactions, are explored. A recently discovered moon candidate, S/2004 S6, is on an orbit that crosses the F-ring core at the intersection of the spiral with the ring, which suggests a dynamical connection between S/2004 S6 and the spiral."

Identifying cis- and trans-regulators of tau exon 10 splicing is therefore crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. We previously identified several splicing enhancers and silencers within exon 10 and intron 10. Here, we show that splicing factors SF2/ASF, Tra2β, and a 50-kDa nuclear protein bind in vitro to the polypurine enhancer at the 5′ end of exon 10. Disease splicing mutations N279K and Δ280K disrupt the enhancer and alter associations with these factors. N279K targets robustly bind Tra2β compared with the normal enhancer, which may explain why N279K enhances exon 10 splicing in vivo. In contrast, factor associations with Δ280K targets are nearly undetectable, explaining why Δ280K almost abolishes exon 10 splicing in vivo. Small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of endogenous SF2/ASF and Tra2β significantly reduces exon 10 splicing. Exogenous SF2/ASF dramatically enhances normal exon 10 splicing and efficiently rescues the Δ280K splicing defect. Domain deletion analyses show that the C-terminal RS domains of SF2/ASF and Tra2β are required for normal exon 10 splicing in vivo. In contrast to Tra2β, the SF2/ASF RS domain remains essential in the presence of a strengthened enhancer or when either weak splice site is strengthened.

In the central nervous system, the microtubule-associated protein tau is highly expressed in neuronal axons and at lower levels in glial cells. Tau functions in microtubule assembly, influences microtubule stability and is important for neurogenesis, axonal maintenance, and axonal transport (1Lee V.M.Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

In the human tau gene (MAPT), exons 9–12 each encode a 31–32-amino acid imperfect repeat that comprises the microtubule-binding domain of tau. In adult human brain, exons 2, 3, and 10 are alternatively spliced to produce six different tau isoforms (3Andreadis A. Brown W.M. Kosik K.S.

When E10 is skipped, the result is 3R tau isoforms. The 4R/3R ratio in normal adult brain is ∼1. In fetal brain, only the shortest 3R tau isoform is expressed because of constitutive exclusion of exons 2, 3, and 10 (6Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L.

Brain Res. 1999; 68: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA splicing regulation is complex requiring multiple interactions between small ribonucleoprotein particles and non-small ribonucleoprotein particle splicing factors with conserved and nonconserved splicing elements in the unprocessed RNA transcript (8Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Conserved elements are the 3′ and 5′ splice site signals that demarcate the exonintron boundary. Nonconserved sequences that promote splicing are called exon splicing enhancers (ESE) and intron splicing enhancers (ISE) (9Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins usually bind to enhancer elements and are essential at multiple steps in the splicing pathway (10Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Most alternatively spliced exons contain a weak splice site, whose recognition requires SR factor associations with ESEs and ISEs (11Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is also influenced by splicing inhibitory sequences called exon splicing silencers and intron splicing silencers. An additional function of some enhancers is to counteract the inhibitory effects of neighboring silencer elements (12Kan J.L.C. Green M/R.

E10 sequences include three nonredundant, weak ESEs in the first half of the exon that include an SC35-like ESE, a polypurine enhancer (PPE), and an A/C-rich enhancer separated by a central exon splicing silencer from additional ESE sequences at the 3′ end of E10. Intronic sequences immediately downstream of the E10 5′ splice site include an intron splicing silencer and an adjacent intron splicing modulator, which counteracts the intron splicing silencer.

However, mutations Δ280K and E10+19, which decrease E10 inclusion in splicing assays, are expected to reduce the 4R/3R ratio to as low as 0.33. Silent and intronic mutations do not change the protein sequence of tau but affect E10 splicing and ultimately tau function. Thus, subtle changes in the ratio of normal tau isoforms cause severe neurodegeneration. Identifying proteins that associate with cis-elements is necessary to elucidate how E10 splicing is regulated. Here we focus on identifying protein interactions with the E10 PPE, a 9-nucleotide purine-rich ESE sequence between E10 positions +16 and +24 (see Fig. 1A). The PPE sequence contains two copies of an AAG motif and one copy of a GAR (where R is a purine) motif that occur frequently in natural, purine-rich ESEs. These motifs are often high affinity binding sites for SR and SR-related proteins. FTDP-17 mutations N279K and Δ280K alter the normal PPE sequence by adding or removing an AAG copy, respectively (see Fig. 1A). Consequently these mutations have opposite effects on E10 splicing, where N279K increases and Δ280K decreases E10 inclusion. Our earlier work predicted that the normal PPE function requires SR factor interactions, which are altered by disease mutations Δ280K and N279K (26D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y.

Indeed, the SR-like splicing factor Tra2β is essential for E10 inclusion in splicing assays and associates in vitro with both normal and mutant PPE templates (31Jiang Z.H. Tang H. Havlioglu N. Zhang X.C. Stamm S. Yan R.Q. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we show specific in vitro associations of a trio of factors with the normal and strengthened (mutation N279K) PPE but not with a disrupted PPE (mutation Δ280K) and identify two of these proteins as the SR domain-containing factors SF2/ASF and Tra2β. We corroborate their specific effects on E10 splicing by gene knock-down assays and present in vivo mechanisms for their varied effects on E10 splicing. Overexpression of SF2/ASF rescues the splicing defect in mutation Δ280K. Domain deletion assays in non-neuronal and neuronal cells show that the C-terminal protein-interacting domains of both SF2/ASF and Tra2β are required for E10 splicing. Our data reveal PPE-dependent and PPE-independent roles for SF2/ASF for use of the weak 3′ and 5′ splice sites, respectively. Thus, SF2/ASF has complex essential and regulatory roles on E10 splicing, whereas the role of Tra2β appears secondary to SF2/ASF. Plasmid Construction and DNA Mutagenesis—Splicing vector hN has been described (18D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and contains the entire 93-bp MAPT E10 sequence with 33 and 51 bp of flanking introns (see Fig. 3A). Minigene construct E10AH (see Fig. 2) contains entire MAPT exons 9, 10, and 11 as well as 324 and 559 bp of intron 9 and I10 sequences, respectively, inserted into expression vector pRcRSV (Invitrogen). Intron 9 in E10AH contains 224 bp of sequence immediately 5′ of E9 and 100 bp of sequence immediately 3′ of E10. I10 in E10AH contains 100 bp of sequence immediately 5′ of E10 and 459 bp of sequence immediately 5′ of E11. FTDP-17 mutations Δ280K and N279K were introduced into hN (18D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D.

A, immunoblots of HeLa cells treated with increasing concentrations of siR-NAs show reduction of endogenous SF2/ASF (si-SF2/ASF, left panel) and Tra2β (si-Tra2β, middle panel) compared with β-tubulin expression. The siRNA concentrations used per lane are 25, 50, 75, and 100 nmol for si-SF2/ASF and 50, 75, and 100 nmol for si-Tra2β. si-SF2/ASF and si-Tra2β show gene specificity (right panel, lanes 3 and 4). The control siRNA (siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA number 1; Dharmacon, Inc.) lacks identity to known gene targets and controls for possible nonspecific effects of siRNA treatment. si-SF2/ASF and si-Tra2β cotreatment (50 nmol each) decreases the levels of both factors (right panel, lane 5) less efficiently than treatments with 100 nmol of individual siRNAs. Monoclonal antibodies αSF2/ASF and E7 (β-tubulin) and the polyclonal antibody Rb3505 (Tra2β) were used for detection. B, E10AH minigene splicing construct containing E10 separated from flanking tau exons E9 and E11 by 0.35 and 0.55 kilobase pairs of total intronic sequences, respectively. C, bar graph showing E10+ levels from triplicate transfections. The error bars represent the standard deviations. A corrected significance criteria of p < 0.0125 was used, and p values comparing E10 inclusion in siRNA-treated samples to control samples within the same cell line are represented by symbols: ‡, p < 1 × 10–3; δ, p < 1 × 10–4; and †, p < 1 × 10–5. D, autoradiograph of E10+ and E10– products from representative RT-PCRs obtained by transient transfection of minigene splicing vector E10AH in mock or siCON-TROL-treated HeLa and PC12 cells (left panel) as well as in individual or combined (si-SF2/ASF + si-Tra2β) gene-specific siRNA-treated HeLa (middle panel) and PC12 cells (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SF2/ASF, Tra2β, and hnRNP G Expression Constructs—SF2/ASF cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from HeLa RNA using primers ASF5′F (5′-AGCTGGATCCATGTCGGGAGGTGGTG-3′) and ASF3′R (5′-CGATCTCGAGTTATGTACGAGAGCGAGATCTGC-3′). The PCR product was digested at BamHI and XhoI sites in the primer sequences and inserted into vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen) to generate expression construct SF2/ASF. The Tra2β expression vector contains a cDNA sequence obtained by PCR amplification from vector Htra2-β1-V5 (32Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using primers Tra2b5′F (5′-AGCTGGATCCATGAGCGACAGCGGCGGCAG-3′) and Tra2b3′R (5′-CGATCTCGAGTTAATAGCGACGAGGTGAGTATGATCG-3′). The BamHI/XhoI-digested product was inserted into pcDNA3.1/Zeo+. We generated domain deletion constructs by PCR mutagenesis of full-length SF2/ASF and Tra2β expression vectors (see Fig. 4A). Primers used to delete the N-terminal RRM domains from SF2/ASF (construct SF2/ASF-ΔRRM) were SF2dRRMF (5′-AGCTGGATCCATGCGTGAAGCAGGTGATGTA-3′) and SF23′R. For RS domain deletion construct SF2/ASF-ΔRS, the primer pair SF25′F and SF2dRS (5′-GCGCTCGAGTTATGGGCCCATCAACTTTAACC-3′) was used. The N-terminal RS domain in construct Tra2β-ΔRS1 (see Fig. 4A) was deleted using primers Tra2dRS1 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGCATGTTGGGAATCGGGCAAATCC-3′) and Tra2b3′R. The central RRM domain in Tra2β-ΔRRM (see Fig. 4A) was deleted using primers Tra2b5′F and Tra2b3′R with expression construct pCMVhtl1 + 5′ as template (kind gift from William Mattox). In Tra2β-ΔRS2 (see Fig. 4A) the C-terminal RS domain was deleted using primers Tra2b5′F and Tra2bdRS2 (5′-GCGCTCGAGTTATCCTGGTGTTGGCGTATGTGG-3′). Construct hnRNP-G-V5 is described elsewhere (32Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfections, and RNA Isolation—Maintenance and transfection of PC12 cells is described elsewhere (14D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26587-26599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). All of the transfections were performed in triplicate with Lipfectamine (Invitrogen) in six-well plates. HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of Lipofectamine in 1 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) for 5 h at 37 °C (5% CO2), after which 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum was added. For coexpression experiments in PC12 cells, 2.5 μg of total plasmid containing 0.5 μgof an E10 splicing vector and 2 μg (4-fold excess) of either pSKII control vector (Stratagene) or individual splicing factor expression constructs were used with 6 μl of Lipofectamine. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (26D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). siRNA Synthesis and Transfection—Commercially synthesized (Dharmacon Inc.) siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA number 1 and gene-specific siRNA pools were used for endogenous suppression of SF2/ASF and Tra2β. siRNA transfections were optimized in 24-well plates containing cells at 70% confluency using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with 25, 50, 75, and 100 nmol of each siRNA in the pool (see Fig. 2A). Maximal inhibition was observed with 100 nmol of each siRNA. Protein was harvested 48–72 h post-transfection, and expression of targeted factors was tested by immunoblot analyses (described below). To test the effects of siRNA treatment on E10 splicing vectors, the cells were seeded into 12-well plates, and siRNA transfections were scaled up. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fed 450 μl of antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. One μg of normal or mutant splicing vector E10AH was mixed with 3 μl of Lipofectamine in 50 μlof OptiMEM and added to each well. Total RNA was isolated 48 h later for RT-PCR analyses with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitation of Tau E10 Splicing by RT-PCR—Tau E10 splicing from transiently transfected splicing vectors was analyzed by RT-PCR assays as described previously (26D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.Y. Bird T.D. Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). E10+ and E10– transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR using vector-specific primer pairs SD6/SA2 for hN and pREP/BGHPA2 for E10AH as previously reported (18D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Poorkaj P. Kas A. D'Souza I. Zhou Y. Pham O. Olson M.V. Schellenberg G.D. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 700-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Amplified products from hN are 261 bp (E10–) and 354 bp (E10+) and from E10AH are 447 bp (E10–) and 540 bp (E10+). The products were resolved on 5–7.5% acrylamide gels and quantitated using a Molecular Imager® system (Bio-Rad). For each mutant construct, the values presented are the averages of at least three different transfection experiments with the normal E10 construct transfected in parallel. Statistical comparisons were made using a two-tailed Student's t test. Criteria for significance were calculated using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. In Vitro RNA Synthesis—A primer-based strategy was used to in vitro synthesize short, radiolabeled RNAs containing normal or mutant PPE sequences. Forward and reverse primers were designed such that on annealing they form a double-stranded T7 promoter region upstream of the RNA target to be transcribed. A universal forward primer, T7F3 (5′-CGCTCTAGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGTAT-3′) containing the core T7 promoter sequence (italics) was used. Nine additional nucleotides upstream of the T7 promoter sequence maximize transcription efficiency, and five additional nucleotides downstream of the promoter serve as a linker that overlaps with the RNA target. The reverse primer contains the reverse complement of the core T7 promoter (underlined) with tau sequences (italics) that include the normal or mutant PPE element (bold type). The reverse primers used were: T7PPE (5′-GCCTCCTGGATCCAGCTTCTTATTATACTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGCG-3′), T7279K (5′-GCCTCCTGGATCCAGCTTCTTCTTATACTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGCG-3′), and T7Δ280K (5′-GCCTCCTGGATCCAGCTTATTATACTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGCG-3′). To anneal universal and reverse primers, 100 ng of each in 0.1 m NaCl was heated to 94 °C for 3 min and cooled at room temperature for 10 min. For in vitro transcription, 1 μlof the annealed primer reaction was added to 19 μl of a transcription mixture containing 1× T7 polymerase buffer (Invitrogen), 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 5 μm [32P]αATP or [32P]αGTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.5 mm each of the remaining three NTPs and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase. The reactions were incubated at 31 °C for 2 h, heat-denatured at 75 °C for 2 min, quenched on ice for 2 min, and treated with 10 units of DNase I at 37 °C for 20 min to remove primers. 7 μl of formamide loading dye was added to samples, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved on 12% urea-PAGE gels. Full-length transcripts were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and eluted in 400 μl of elution mix (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature. The eluate was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 100 μl of RNase-free H2O, and 1 μl was used for quantitation in a scintillation counter. HeLa Nuclear Extract Preparation, UV Cross-linking, and Affinity Purification—HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared as described (34Dignam JD Lebovitz RM Roeder RG Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were obtained from HeLa-S3 spinner cultures grown at the National Cell Culture Center, a research resource facility established by the National Center of Resources for Research, National Institutes of Health. For UV cross-linking, radiolabeled (30–100 × 105 cpm) gel-purified, full-length RNA targets were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract in 10-μl reactions under splicing-permissive conditions (0.6 mm ATP, 0.1 m creatinine phosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50–75 μg of HeLa extract, 4 μg each of tRNA and heparin, and 2 μlof10× binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 m potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, exposed to UV light (0.2 J for 12 min) at a distance of 4 cm on ice to form covalent RNA-protein complexes before treating with RNase A to remove unbound RNA sequences. 11 μlof2× SDS protein loading buffer was added to the samples before boiling for 5 min. The bound proteins were resolved on 10–15% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by autoradiography. For RNA affinity purification, 5′-Ome-modified normal PPE and mutant (Δ280K,279K) RNA target sequences were commercially synthesized (Dharmacon Inc.) and are identical in sequence to in vitro transcribed templates used in UV cross-linking assays. RNA-agarose affinity columns were prepared according to methods described before (35Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and incubated with 200 μl of HeLa nuclear extract under splicing conditions at 30 °C for 20 min to allow binding of splicing factors. Protein-RNA-agarose complexes were collected without exposure to UV light and washed extensively in Dignam Buffer D before eluting bound factors in 2× SDS gel loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved on 10–12% SDS-PAGE gels, and electroblotted for immunodetection assays. Immunoblotting—Monoclonal antibody mAb104 (1:100) was used to detect the SR family of splicing factors that range in size from 20 to 85 kDa (36Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). SF2/ASF was detected by a monoclonal antibody (1:5000) (37Hanamura A. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 430-444PubMed Google Scholar). Tra2β was detected using a polyclonal antibody Rb3505 (1:1500) raised against a synthetic peptide containing the N-terminal 15 amino acids (MSDSGEQNYGERESR) (Invitrogen Antibody Services). Anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody E7 was obtained from the NICHD Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by The University of Iowa (Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA) and was used at dilution 1:3000 as an internal protein control. Rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) used at 1:2500 dilution were anti-mouse IgM for mAb104 and anti-mouse IgG for both SF2/ASF and β-tubulin. Chemiluminescent immunodetection was achieved with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to protein A (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:3000 and the ECL plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The following experiments were designed to identify the trans-acting proteins that recognize the normal PPE, to determine whether this protein-RNA interaction is di"

Biologists use it to test models of natural systems, as discussed by David Sprinzak and Michael B. Elowitz. Drew Endy takes the engineer's approach, seeing it as an extension of technologies such as genetic engineering and biotechnology. Examples of what synthetic biology can do were on view at the first international Inter collegiate Genetically Engineered Machine competition. Synthetic biology promises much but there are risks too. In a Commentary, George Church urges the synthetic biology community to learn from mistakes made by nuclear physicists and geneticists, and to act now to develop safeguards that satisfy public concerns.

https://openalex.org/W2005223178,"DNA lesions that escape excision repair pathways can cause arrested DNA replication. This replication block can be processed by translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), which is carried out by a number of specialized DNA polymerases. A sequential lesion bypass model has been proposed; one of the lesion-specific polymerases inserts nucleotide(s) opposite the damaged template, followed by extension from the inserted nucleotide by the same or another polymerase. Polζ and Polκ have been proposed as candidates for executing the extension step in eukaryotic cells. We previously disrupted separately Rev3, the catalytic subunit of Polζ, and Polκ in chicken B lymphocyte DT40 cells. We found that each cell line showed significant UV sensitivity, implying that both contribute to UV radiation damage repair. In the present studies we generated REV3–/–POLK/– double knock-out cells to determine whether they participate in the same or different pathways. The double mutant was viable and proliferated with the same kinetics as parental REV3–/– cells. The cells showed the same sensitivity as REV3–/– cells to UV, ionizing radiation, and chemical cross-linking agents. In contrast, they were more sensitive than REV3–/– cells to monofunctional alkylating agents, even though POLK/– cells barely exhibited increased sensitivity to those. Moreover Polk-deficient mouse embryonic stem and fibroblast cells, both of which have previously been shown to be sensitive to UV radiation, also showed moderate sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate, a monofunctional alkylating agent. These data imply that Polκ has a function in TLS past alkylated base adducts as well as UV radiation DNA damage in vertebrates."

Finally, the present structure reveals that the deaminase and the reductase are separate functional domains and that domain fusion is crucial for the enzyme activities through formation of a stable tetrameric structure. Flavin coenzymes are ubiquitous in all organisms because of their involvements in central metabolic pathways. Plants and many microorganisms obtain the precursor riboflavin by biosynthesis, whereas animals depend on nutritional sources. Numerous pathogenic microorganisms are unable to take up flavins from the environment and hence are absolutely dependent on their endogenous production. Therefore, the enzymes involved in riboflavin biosynthesis have the potential to become attractive candidates for the design of new defenses against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. During riboflavin biosynthesis (1Bacher A. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Kis K. Richter G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), GTP cyclohydrolase II first catalyzes the hydrolytic C-8 release of GTP to yield formate and pyrophosphate as side products. The product, 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate (compound 1) is converted into 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5′-phosphate (compound 4) by deamination of the pyrimidine ring and NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of the ribose (Fig. 1). The deamination and reduction steps have been shown to proceed in the opposite order in yeast and Escherichia coli (2Oltmanns O. Bacher A. J.

Fischer M. Krieger C. Eberhardt S. Lüttgen H. Gerstenschläger I. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2022-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in fungi, plants and most archaea, these two enzymes are separate (5Baur A. Schaaff-Gerstenschlager I. Boles E. Miosga T. Rose M. Zimmermann F.K.

In yeast, Rib7 is the corresponding reductase, whereas the C-terminal domain of Rib2 is responsible for deamination, in addition to N-terminal pseudouridine synthase activity. The D domain of bacterial RibG was expected to belong to the cytidine deaminase (CDA) superfamily because of the two conserved signatures, H(C)XE and PCX8-9C. The CDA superfamily consists of the mononucleotide deaminases involved in nucleotide metabolism, and the RNA/DNA-editing deaminases involved in gene diversity and in antivirus defense (8Keegan L.P.

The RNA/DNA-editing deaminases include A- to -I tRNA-specific adenosine deaminases (TADs), A- to -I adenosine deaminases acting on RNA, and C- to -U cytidine deaminases acting on RNA/DNA. These deaminases catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of cytosine, guanine, and adenine moieties and several of their therapeutically useful analogues.

However, the question of how nature has evolved the CDA fold into these various deaminases requires additional study. Furthermore, the structural fold of the R domain was predicted by 3D-PSSM (15Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) to be similar to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR catalyzes the NADPH-utilizing reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Many DHFR inhibitors, such as methotrexate, pyrimethamine, and trimethoprim, have long been used clinically in the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, and bacterial and fungal infection (16Kompis I.M. Islam K Then R.L. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, the R domain may become an important target for new drug design. To gain structural insights into the inhibitor design, substrate specificity, and evolution, we have solved the BsRibG structure at 2.41-Å resolution. Protein Preparation—The His-tagged BsRibG was expressed using the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) in E. coli BL21 pLysS. The recombinant protein contains 12 additional vector residues (MRGSH6GS) at the N terminus. One-liter Luria broth (LB) cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were grown for another 5 h at 37°C before harvest. Cell pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and lysed by French press. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation at 39,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). The resin was washed with 40 mm imidazole in buffer A, and the protein was eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The protein fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), and loaded onto a Sepharose™ Q column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 230 mm NaCl in buffer B, the BsRibG was eluted with 260 mm NaCl and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Protein Characterization—The enzyme activity assay was carried out as described previously (4Richter G. Fischer M. Krieger C. Eberhardt S. Lüttgen H. Gerstenschläger I. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2022-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate was prepared by GTP hydrolysis using the recombinant E. coli GTP cyclohydrolase II. The molecular mass in solution was estimated by a Beckman-Coulter XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor. Sedimentation velocity was performed at 20 °C and 40,000 rpm with standard double sector centerpieces. The UV absorption of the cells was scanned every 5 min for 2 h, and the data were analyzed using the SedFit program (17Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization—The initial crystallization screening was performed with screening kits using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. The hanging drops were mixtures of 2 μl of reservoir solution and 2 μl of protein solution. Protein crystals could be obtained under several reservoir solutions, and the best crystals were grown in 26.6% polyethylene glycol 400, 190 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 95 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) with a protein solution of 20-25 mg/ml. Crystals appeared and reached their final dimensions in 1 week at 15 °C. The NADPH derivative was prepared by soaking crystals for 4 days in reservoir solution containing 10 mm NADPH. X-ray diffraction data were collected and processed at beamlines BL12B2 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and NW12 at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The crystals belong to the P212121 space group with 1 tetramer/asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—The BsRibG structure was determined using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) of the endogenous zinc ion. Four Zn2+ positions were identified and refined with SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The initial phase was improved by direct-method phasing refinement using OASIS (19Wang J.W. Chen J.R. Gu Y.X. Zheng C.D. Jiang F. Fan H.F. Terwilliger T.C. Hao Q. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) before density modification. The initial electron density map showed an interpretable density of ∼70% of the tetramer. About 60% of the initial tetrameric model was automatically built using RESOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Because the structural fold was predicted to be similar to yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) and Thermotoga maritima DHFR (TmDHFR) (10Ko T.P. Lin J.J. Hu C.Y. Hsu Y.H. Wang A.H.J. Liaw S.H. J. Biol.

The current tetrameric model contains residues 1-359 for each subunit. Each monomer is composed of two separate functional domains (Fig. 3b). The N-terminal D domain (residues 1-143) consists of a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1-β5) with β1 running antiparallel to the others. The β-sheet is sandwiched by two helices (αA and αE) on one side and by three helices (αB, αC, and αD) on the other side. The C-terminal helix αF extends away from the D domain and connects to the R domain. The R domain (residues 146-359) is composed of a large nine-stranded β-sheet (βA-βH and βD′) with the C-terminal strand βH running antiparallel to the others. The β-sheet is flanked by five α-helices (αB, αC, αD′, αE, and αF). The secondary structure elements of the R domain are numbered as for DHFRs (28Schnell J.R. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The four subunits in the crystal asymmetric unit did not show significant differences between each individual domain except for several loops (root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of 0.38-0.46 and 0.59-0.73 Å for the backbones of residues 2-139 and residues 146-359, respectively). However, the relative orientations between the D and R domains are slightly different, resulting in a weak noncrystallographic symmetry. Molecules A and B interact with each other through their D domains with a buried surface area of ∼650 Å2 per D domain (the D interface) (Fig. 4A), whereas molecule A makes extensive contacts with molecule C through their respective R domains with a buried area of ∼1750 Å2 per R domain (the R interface) (Fig. 4B). There are no contacts between molecules A and D in the tetramer. The D interface is made up mainly of the N-terminal two helices αA and αB, the β2 strand, and the connected loops (residues 4-19 and 35-61). There are 14 direct hydrogen bonds between the protein atoms across the interface and hydrophobic patches formed by Leu8, Leu12, Ile36, Met39, Leu43, and Met57. The anti-parallel disposition of the two pseudodyad-related αA helices also contributes to the interface by dipole-dipole interactions. Interestingly, the side chains of His56 from the two D domains stack very well, with a distance of 3.3-3.4 Å between the aromatic rings. The R interface mainly is made up of: the two large loops, LβA-αB (residues 156-169) and LβF-αG (residues 314-338); and the C-terminal residues 339-358. There are 18 direct hydrogen bonds between the protein atoms across the interface, and extensive hydrophobic patches are by Try169 formed, Pro314, Lys315, Leu316, Ile317, Leu325, Phe331, Met334, Val337, Leu339, Leu340, Phe342, Ile345, Ile352, and Leu354. Structural Conservation in the CDA Superfamily—As expected, the D domain displays high structural homology to the available structures of the CDA members including yCD, B. subtilis guanine deaminse (BsGD), CDAs, T4 bacteriophage dCMP deaminse (T4dCMPD), and Aquifex aeolicus TADA (AaTADA), and subdomains 2 and 4 of the chicken AICAR transformylase domain (10Ko T.P.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15505-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The TADAs in prokaryotes and the TAD2/TAD3 heterodimers in eukaryotes are responsible for the I34 alteration at the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, whereas TAD1 creates the unique 1-methyl-I37 in eukaryotic tRNAAla (8Keegan L.P. Leroy A. Sproul D. O'Connell M.A. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Detailed structural comparisons reveal a common three-layer α/β/α structure, in which five β-strands (β1-β5) and three helices (αA-αC) correspond closely, whereas the remainder varies across the different deaminases (Fig. 5A). The main chain atoms of the 65-70 structurally equivalent residues are overlaid with an r.m.s.d. of 0.75 to 1.35 Å and with 8-24% sequence identity. These structural elements in the CDA fold form a conservative hydrophobic core, which is also preserved in the AICAR transformylase domain, implying that the hydrophobic core has been highly conserved throughout evolution. The active site of the D domain contains one tightly bound endogenous zinc ion, for which the anomalous data provided sufficient phase information for structure determination. The zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by His49 Nϵ1 (2.0 Å), Cys74 Sγ (2.4 Å), Cys83 Sγ (2.3 Å), and a water molecule (2.0 Å).The zinc-bound water molecule interacts with Glu51 Oϵ2 (2.5 Å). The active-site architecture resembles those of the CDA members, which share a similar zinc-assisted deamination mechanism with a virtually identical interaction network between the common moiety of the pyrimidine ring of the substrate, the zinc ion, the zinc-bound water molecule, the zinc ligands, and the base glutamate (Fig. 5B). In addition, the active-site cavities of these deaminases are mainly made up of the C-terminal tail and the loops connecting the αA-β1, β2-αB, β3-αC, and β4-αD (Fig. 5C). Based on the structural comparison of the active-site cavities, the substrate of the D domain was modeled into the active site through superposition of the nucleobase rings because of the highly conserved interaction networks surrounding the target amino group (Fig. 5B). The model was then subjected to energy minimization with crystallography NMR software. Simulation of the complex structure suggested that the nucleophilic OH-2 group of the pyrimidine ring coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion and interacts with Glu51Oϵ2 and Cys74 N. The NH-3 group hydrogen bonds with Glu51 Oϵ1, the O-4 atom with Ala50 N and His42 Nδ, and the NH2-5 with Asn23 Oδ1 and His42 Nδ1. The two hydroxyl groups of the ribose have close contacts with the side chains of Asp101 and Asn103. The phosphate moiety forms salt bridges with His76 and Lys79, located in the unique insertion between the two zinc ligand cysteines, and these interactions are essential for the deamination activity because the enzyme cannot utilize the dephosphorylated form as substrate (3Burrows R.B. Brown G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 657-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These predicted substrate-binding residues are all highly conserved in the eubacterial RibGs. However, the fungal deaminases such as yeast Rib2 (yRib2) apparently contain different substrate-interacting residues because of their distinct substrate, which has an open ribityl group instead of a cyclic ribose (Figs. 1 and 5C). Structural Divergence in the CDA Superfamily—The CDA members exist as an oligomer. All of the available member structures except for BsRibG utilize helices αB-αD and surrounding loops for oligomerization. BsGD, yCD, and AaTADA display similar dimeric structures (10Ko T.P. Lin J.J.

The swapping of the C-terminal segment in BsGD causes additional dimeric contacts including the β5 strand and helices αA and αE. CDAs form tetramers in which one subunit interacts with the other three subunits (12Johansson E. Mejlhede N. Neuhard J. Larsen S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The hexameric T4dCMPD contains two types of intersubunit interfaces (13Almog R. Maley F. Maley G.F. Maccoll R. Van Roey P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13715-13723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, the D interface of BsRibG is very distinct from the others and possesses the fewest contacts, with a total buried area of ∼1300 Å2 (Fig. 4A). In addition to the loops and helices αA and αB, RibG includes the β2 strand in the D interface. The distinct intersubunit orientation in the D interface also separates the active sites away from each other with an inter-zinc distance of 30 Å. Notably, the shortest inter-zinc distance in the other five deaminases is about 14-15 Å. The C-t"

Integral to NRS function is the binding of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), but its binding is controlled by U11 snRNP that binds to an overlapping site. U11 snRNP, the U1 counterpart for splicing of U12-dependent introns, binds the NRS remarkably well and requires G-rich elements just downstream of the consensus U11 binding site. We present evidence that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H binds to the NRS G-rich elements and that hnRNP H is required for optimal U11 binding in vitro. It is further shown that hnRNP H (but not hnRNP F) can promote U11 binding and splicing from the NRS in vivo when tethered to the RNA as an MS2 fusion protein. Interestingly, 17% of the naturally occurring U12-dependent introns have at least two potential hnRNP H binding sites positioned similarly to the NRS. For two such introns from the SCN4A and P120 genes, we show that hnRNP H binds to each in a G-tract-dependent manner, that G-tract mutations strongly reduce splicing of minigene RNA, and that tethered hnRNP H restores splicing to mutant RNA. In support of a role for hnRNP H in both splicing pathways, hnRNP H antibodies co-precipitate U1 and U11 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. These results indicate that hnRNP H is an auxiliary factor for U11 binding to the NRS and that, more generally, hnRNP H is a splicing factor for a subset of U12-dependent introns that harbor G-rich elements.

The genes of higher eukaryotes are normally interrupted by noncoding sequences (introns) that are transcribed into the primary transcript, generating a precursor-mRNA. These pre-RNAs are then matured through the process of RNA splicing whereby a large multicomponent machine termed the spliceosome recognizes and excises the introns (1Burge C.B. Tushchl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The vast majority of introns are recognized by a spliceosome that contains U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) 2The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; 3′ss and 5′ss, 3′ and 5′ splice site, respectively; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; NRS, negative regulator of splicing; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; nt, nucleotide(s); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription. and a large number of accessory factors (1Burge C.B.

These are referred to as major class or U2-dependent introns. More recently, a lower abundance spliceosome was described that excises a rare class of introns (<1% of human introns) whose consensus sequences deviate from those of conventional introns (2Levine A.

Understanding the similarities and differences between the two splicing machines should lend insight into the mechanism of RNA splicing and evolutionary links between the two. Despite the different snRNP compositions of the two spliceosomes, the assembly pathways and catalytic mechanisms are remarkably similar. Both pathways utilize a two-step mechanism in vitro that proceeds through a lariat intermediate, and each spliceosome assembles stepwise through the successive addition of snRNPs (1Burge C.B. Tushchl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar, 5Patel A.A. Steitz J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 960-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 6Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). U11 and U12 perform the early, analogous roles of U1 and U2 of the major pathway and interact by RNA base pairing with the 5′ss and branch point sequence, respectively, to form a prespliceosome (7Tarn W.Y. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Yu Y.T. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RNA. 1997; 3: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, as in the major pathway, the U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri-snRNP is integrated to form the mature spliceosome, at which time the extensive base pairing between U4atac and U6atac is disrupted and U6atac snRNA interacts with the 5′ss and with U12 snRNA to form the catalytic spliceosome (8Yu Y.T. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6030-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Tarn W.Y. Steitz J.A.

A similar architecture between the active sites of the two spliceosomes was suggested by the functional replacement of a critical U6atac stem-loop with the analogous region from U6 (15Shukla G.C. Padgett R.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The model of stepwise assembly of spliceosomes is contrasted with the detection of a functional penta-snRNP in yeast extracts, which favors the action of a preassembled spliceosome (16Stevens S.W. Ryan D.E. Ge H.Y. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Nilsen T.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 8-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further highlighting the similarity between the two spliceosomes, a surprisingly large number of proteins are shared between the two. For example, several subunits of SF3b, originally described as an essential U2-associated factor, are associated with the U11/U12 di-snRNP but not with the U11 mono-snRNP (18Will C.L. Schneider C. Reed R. Luhrmann R. Science. 1999; 284: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Additionally, the protein composition of the U4/U6.U5 and U4atac/U6atac.U5 particles is very similar if not identical (19Luo H.R. Moreau G.A. Levin N. Moore M.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 893-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Schneider C. Will C.L. Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Luhrmann R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3219-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that the splicing mechanism is conserved between the two systems, although splice site-bridging interactions are likely to be different (21Will C.L. Schneider C. Hossbach M. Urlaub H. Rauhut R. Elbashir S. Tuschl T. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2004; 10: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite the numerous similarities between the U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes, there are significant differences. First, the 5′ss and branch point sequence consensus sequences are strictly adhered to in U12-dependent introns, and these introns lack the polypyrimidine tract that is an important feature of major class introns (3Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Hall S.L. Padgett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that there are significant differences in the early events of splice site recognition. In the U2-dependent system, U1 snRNP can recognize 5′ splice sites as a mono-snRNP and initially interacts with SF1/mBBP and U2AF (probably bridged by SR proteins) at the far end of the intron. Subsequently, U2 is recruited, and a different set of interactions is formed between U1 and U2 (1Burge C.B. Tushchl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). It was recently reported that hPrp5 is the bridging protein between U1 and U2 (22Xu Y.Z. Newnham C.M. Kameoka S. Huang T. Konarska M.M. Query C.C. EMBO J. 2004; Google Scholar). This contrasts with the minor pathway in which U11 and U12 exist as a di-snRNP that binds to the 5′ss and branch point sequence simultaneously and cooperatively (23Wassarman K.M. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Frilander M.J. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Presumably, protein components other than hPrp5 constitute the bridging factors, since hPrp5 was not found in the U11/U12 particle (21Will C.L. Schneider C. Hossbach M. Urlaub H. Rauhut R. Elbashir S. Tuschl T. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2004; 10: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although a large number of auxiliary cis sites and trans-acting factors are known to influence U1 binding to 5′ splice sites and splice site choice (25Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar), much less is known about factors that influence U11 binding to its respective 5′ splice sites. Members of the SR protein family of splicing factors were shown to be required for basal and enhancer-stimulated minor-class splicing in vitro for two different substrates (26Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. RNA. 2001; 7: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and for enhancer effects on alternative splicing of model U12-dependent RNAs in vivo (27Dietrich R.C. Shukla G.C. Fuller J.D. Padgett R.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1378-1388PubMed Google Scholar). An intronic purine-rich element was recently described in the Drosophila prospero“twintron” gene that influenced both the major and minor pathways; the trans-acting factor(s) that binds to and mediates the effect of the enhancer awaits identification (28Scamborova P. Wong A. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1855-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An RNA-processing control element from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the negative regulator of splicing or NRS, harbors overlapping U1 and U11 binding sites and very efficiently binds U11 snRNP as well as U1 (29Gontarek R.R. McNally M.T. Beemon K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30McNally L.M. Yee L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38201-38208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This element represses viral splicing and splicing of heterologous introns in vitro and in vivo (29Gontarek R.R. McNally M.T. Beemon K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1926-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Arrigo S. Beemon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4858-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Stoltzfus C.M.

Biol. 2005; 25: 4397-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and it is required for efficient viral RNA polyadenylation (34Fogel B.L. McNally L.M. McNally M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35O'Sullivan C.T. Polony T.S. Paca R.E. Beemon K.L. Virology. 2002; 302: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The NRS acts as a U1-type pseudo-5′ss that nonproductively interacts with and sequesters 3′ splice sites from interacting with authentic 5′ splice sites to accomplish splicing control (33Giles K.E. Beemon K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4397-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Cook C.R. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is thought that the stalled spliceosome-like complex that assembles on the NRS/3′ss promotes polyadenylation of unspliced RNA (34Fogel B.L. McNally L.M. McNally M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). U11 binding is thought to antagonize the activity of U1. We have used the NRS as a tool to study novel aspects of U11 binding. It was recently shown that a G-rich sequence downstream of the U11 consensus site is required for optimal U11 binding to the NRS in vitro and in vivo (30McNally L.M. Yee L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38201-38208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the G-rich element specifically interacts with hnRNP H, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of RNA-binding proteins (37Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Mutations that abolished hnRNP H binding reduced U11 binding to the NRS in vitro and in vivo as assessed by U12-dependent splicing from the NRS U11 site. A direct role for hnRNP H in U11 binding to and splicing from the NRS was demonstrated in vivo with tethering assays using an MS2-hnRNP H fusion protein. Interestingly, a number of authentic U12-dependent introns harbor potential hnRNP H binding sites, and we demonstrate that hnRNP H binds to intronic sites in the SCN4A and P120 minor class introns, that mutations in the sites decrease hnRNP H binding and splicing of minigenes, and that tethered hnRNP H stimulates SCN4A and P120 minigene splicing. Collectively, our data support a broader role of hnRNP H as an accessory factor for splicing of a subclass of U12-dependent introns that harbor hnRNP H binding sites. Plasmid Constructs—RSV sequences are from the PrC strain (38Meric C. Spahr P.F. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 450-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with sequence coordinates as described by Schwartz et al. (39Schwartz D.E. Tizard R. Gilbert W. Cell. 1983; 32: 853-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Plasmids described previously are p3ZMSxma (to generate full-length NRS RNA, nt 701–1011) and the G-tract mutations made in this background and described in the legend to Fig. 1A (30McNally L.M. Yee L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38201-38208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and pP120, pNRS-P120, and p67-P120 (40McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2385-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids containing just the NRS G-rich region (wild-type p3ZG1–4 and mutants p3ZmG1, etc.) were generated from the mutation series plasmids in the p3ZMSxma background by digestion with KpnI and XmaI to remove upstream NRS sequences 701–927, and the vectors were recircularized. p3ZMS/MS2 was made by replacing the XmaI-XbaI fragment containing the NRS G-rich region with a PCR fragment harboring two MS2 binding sites. All primer sequences are available upon request. A pNRS-P120 chimera harboring the NRS mG1+2 mutation was made by overlap PCR between p3ZMSmG1+2 NRS sequences and the P120 region from pNRS-P120; the P120 intronic Bsu36I site was also converted to XhoI. Another chimera, pNRS-MS2, had the XmaI-XhoI NRS G-tract fragment replaced by a PCR product containing two MS2 binding sites. pP120 plasmids harboring mutations in the G-tracts (Fig. 9) were generated by overlap PCR. The MS2 binding sites were inserted into pP120mG1–3 by introducing an XhoI site just downstream of mG3 by overlap PCR, and blunt end insertion of a PCR product harboring two MS2 binding sites. The pSP64-SCN4A plasmid was a gift of Adrian Krainer. pCMV-SCN4A was made by moving a HindIII-BamHI fragment from pSP64-SCN4A into the same sites in p3×FLAG-CMV7.1 (Sigma). Mutations in or deletion of the G-tracts of the SCN4A intron (Fig. 6) were made by overlap PCR. These were cloned as HindIII-BamHI fragments to generate pCMV-SCN4AmG1–3, pCMV-SCN4AmG4–6, pCMV-SCN4AmG1–6, and pCMV-SCN4AΔG. To replace the G-tracts in pCMV-SCN4A with the MS2 binding sites, overlap PCR was used to remove the G-tracts and introduce MroI and SalI sites. An XmaI-HindIII MS2 fragment from p3ZMS/MS2 was then cloned into the MroI-SalI intron sites. An hnRNP H expression vector (pcDNA-H) was made by PCR-amplifying the hnRNP H coding region with XhoI and BamHI ends from pET15b-H (gift of Douglas Black) and insertion into the same sites of pcDNA3.1(–)/myc-HisA (Invitrogen). To make pcDNA-F, which expresses hnRNP F, the hnRNP F reading frame from pET15b-F (from D. Black) was amplified by PCR and cloned as an XhoI/BamHI fragment into pcDNA. pcDNA-MS2 was made by inserting a PCR product containing the MS2 coat protein reading frame into the XbaI/XhoI sites of pcDNA. pcDNA-MS2-H and pcDNA-MS2-F were made by inserting the MS2 coat protein reading frame into the XhoI/XbaI sites in pcDNA-H and -F. pcDNA-MS2-GFP was made by replacing the hnRNP H portion of pcDNA-MS2-H with a GFP PCR product.FIGURE 9hnRNP H promotes splicing of the P120 U12-dependent intron.

Nuclear extracts were made as described (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). For depletions, a 65-nt RNA containing five high affinity hnRNP H binding sites from the rat β-tropomyosin gene (or the antisense RNA, which was used as a negative control) (42Chen C.D. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was attached to adipic acid dihydrazide beads as described below. Alternatively, the 106-nt NRS G-tract RNA was used. The beads were added to 50 μl of nuclear extract, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min, and then the beads were sedimented, and two additional incubations with fresh beads were performed. The amount of hnRNP H remaining in extracts was determined by Western blot on an aliquot of extract; bead-associated hnRNP H was determined by Western blot after elution from the beads with SDS sample buffer and SDS-PAGE. Recombinant hnRNP H was generated in Escherichia coli as described (43Fogel B.L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32371-32378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). UV Cross-linking/Immunoprecipitation—For UV cross-linking, plasmids harboring the wild-type and mutant NRS G-tracts (indicated in Fig. 3) were linearized with XbaI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and [32P]UTP (44McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 106-nt-long RNAs contained 84 nt of RSV sequence (nt 928–1011) and 22 nt of vector sequence. SCN4A constructs were linearized with BamHI and transcribed into 374-nt RNAs with Sp6 RNA polymerase. pP120 constructs were linearized with EcoRI and transcribed into 518-nt RNAs with Sp6 RNA polymerase. Nonspecific RNA was generated from PvuII-digested pGEM-3Z DNA and Sp6 RNA polymerase. Approximately 200,000 cpm of RNA was incubated in HeLa nuclear extract for 20 min under splicing conditions (44McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the samples were irradiated with 260 nm light for 30 min at 4 °C, treated with 0.6 mg/ml RNase A, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the UV cross-link/immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads prebound with affinity-purified anti-hnRNP H antibodies or preimmune serum was added to standard cross-linking reactions and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Affinity-purified, polyclonal rabbit anti-hnRNP H antibodies were generated by Bethyl Laboratories against a C-terminal peptide of hnRNP H (45Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For snRNP co-precipitation, Protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with buffer, preimmune serum, or hnRNP H antibodies, and 10 μl of beads were added to 50 μl of nuclear extract under splicing conditions for 1 h. Samples were washed as above, treated with Proteinase K to release nucleic acids, and then phenol-extracted and subjected to Northern blotting with U1 and U11 riboprobes as described (30McNally L.M. Yee L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38201-38208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Affinity Selection—For protein analysis, scaled up in vitro transcription reactions were performed to produce unlabeled RNA from p3ZG1–4, p3ZmG1, and p3ZmG1+3 (linearized with XbaI) or PvuII-linearized pGEM-3Z. RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. RNA (250 pmol) was then covalently linked to adipic acid dihydrazide beads (Sigma) using the procedure described by Caputi et al. (46Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The beads were then incubated under splicing conditions in a 325-μl reaction mixture containing 130 μl of HeLa nuclear extract for 20 min at 30 °C and then washed three times in 1 ml of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 4 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted from the beads in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The proteins of interest were cut from the gel and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis by Dr. Bassam Wakim at the Protein/DNA Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The ∼50-kDa band shown in Fig. 2 was identified as hnRNP H. The two proteins of ∼36 kDa were cut from a different gel and identified as hnRNP A2/B1 and hnRNP A1. In independent affinity selection experiments, proteins were eluted and subjected to Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibody to hnRNP H. For analysis of U11 snRNP binding to the NRS, p3ZMSxma was linearized with XbaI and transcribed in the presence of biotin-11-UTP (20% of total UTP). RNAs were incubated in complete or depleted HeLa nuclear extract under splicing conditions (47Cook C.R. McNally M.T. Virology. 1998; 242: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with ATP for 30 min at 30 °C and affinity-selected as described (30McNally L.M. Yee L. McNally M.T. J. Biol.

Add-back assays utilized 200 ng of recombinant hnRNP H, which was the amount of hnRNP H found in a standard reaction. Data were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blots—Proteins eluted from affinity selection beads in 1× SDS buffer or aliquots of nuclear extract mixed with 2× SDS buffer were boiled and subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose. The filters were blocked in 5% dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), probed with anti-hnRNP H antibody, and, after several washes in TBST, incubated with a Protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and finally developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce Supersignal) by exposure to x-ray film or capture on a ChemiImager digital imager (Alpha Innotech) Transfection and RNA Analysis—293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

Chlorobium tepidum SR (cSR) generates a distinct BH4 product, l-threo-BH4 (6R-(1′S,2′S)-5,6,7,8-BH4), whereas animal enzymes produce l-erythro-BH4 (6R-(1′R,2′S)-5,6,7,8-BH4) although it has high amino acid sequence similarities to the other animal enzymes. To elucidate the structural basis for the different reaction stereospecificities, we have determined the three-dimensional structures of cSR alone and complexed with NADP and sepiapterin at 2.1 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. The overall folding of the cSR, the binding site for the cofactor NADP(H), and the positions of active site residues were quite similar to the mouse and the human SR. However, significant differences were found in the substrate binding region of the cSR. In comparison to the mouse SR complex, the sepiapterin in the cSR is rotated about 180° around the active site and bound between two aromatic side chains of Trp-196 and Phe-99 so that its pterin ring is shifted to the opposite side, but its side chain position is not changed. The swiveled sepiapterin binding results in the conversion of the side chain configuration, exposing the opposite face for hydride transfer from NADPH. The different sepiapterin binding mode within the conserved catalytic architecture presents a novel strategy of switching the reaction stereospecificities in the same protein fold.

BH4 is a well known essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (1Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and nitric-oxide synthase (2Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) in humans and other higher organisms (3Thöny B.

Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). BH4 deficiency in human results in severe neurological disorders like atypical phenylketonuria and monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency and is also implicated in Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and depression (3Thöny B.

Metab. 2001; 74: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).The pathway of the de novo biosynthesis of BH4 from GTP involves only three enzymes, GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16), 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (PPH4) synthase (EC 4.2.3.12), and SR. SR catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of the di-keto group in the C6 side chain of PPH4 to BH4 (6Katoh S. Sueoka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Biochemical and crystallographic analyses of murine SR suggest that SR has both reductase and isomerase activities; SR reduces first the C1′ carbonyl group and subsequently catalyzes an isomerization reaction shifting the C2′ carbonyl group to the C1′ position and then the second reduction of the carbonyl group to produce l-erythro-BH4 (7Katoh S. Sueoka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Gutlich M. Fischer M. Jacob U. Bacher A. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although SR is the only enzyme completing the step alone, other enzymes such as aldose reductase or carbonyl reductase also participate in the terminal step of BH4 synthesis (9Milstien S. Kaufman S.

Aldose reductase catalyzes C2′-specific reduction of PPH4 to produce 1′-oxo-2′-hydroxytetrahydropterin, which is then oxidized nonenzymatically to sepiapterin (6-lactoyl-dihydropterin) (10Park Y.S.

Sepiapterin is catalyzed in vivo by SR to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, which is further reduced to BH4 by dihydrofolate reductase, constituting an alternative pathway of BH4 synthesis (10Park Y.S.

Thiery R. Tatischeff I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). d-threo-Form (dictyopterin) was isolated from Dictyostelium (12Klein R. Thiery R. Tatischeff I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and l-threo stereoisomer was isolated from Chlorobium tepidum as a glycoside (tepidopterin, l-threo-BH4-N-acetylglucosamine) (13Cho S.H. Na J.U. Youn H. Hwang C.S. Lee C.H. Kang S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1379: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was shown that C. tepidum SR (cSR) catalyzes the reduction of not only sepiapterin to l-threo-H2-biopterin (14Cho S.H. Na J.U. Youn H. Hwang C.S. Lee C.H. Kang S.O. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but also PPH4 to l-threo-BH4 (15Choi Y.K. Jun S.R. Cha E.Y. Park J.S. Park Y.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 242: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, d-threo-BH4 was not produced by SR alone but by a collaborative work of SR and aldose reductase-like protein in Dictyostelium (16Kim Y.A. Chung H.J. Kim Y.J. Choi Y.K. Hwang Y.K.

Bacher A. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). It was, therefore, a question how the structurally similar enzymes catalyze the synthesis of different isomeric forms of BH4. Thus, we have determined the crystal structures of cSR alone and in complex with NADP and sepiapterin at 2.1 and 1.7 Å of resolution, respectively. The overall structure of cSR is quite similar to that of mSR. However, significant structural differences are observed in the substrate binding site of the two enzymes. Here, we report a novel ligand binding mode that determines the stereospecific catalysis of cSR in the production of l-threo-BH4.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of SRs from Chlorobium and mammals. The amino acid sequence alignment of SRs from C. tepidum, Dictyostelium discoideum, human, rat, mouse, Takifugu rubripes, and Drosophila melanogaster is shown. A column is framed in red when residues are identical and boxed when at least four of its residues (red) are homologues. Residues for cofactor binding are marked with a plus (+), central residues for substrate binding in the Chlorobium are marked with an asterisk (*), and catalytic triad residues are marked with a number sign (#).

Briefly, cSRs were cloned into pET-28b and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for free cSR and B834(DE3)PLysS for selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative, respectively. The soluble protein was purified by nickel-agarose affinity, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.Crystallization and Data Collection—Free cSR and the SeMet-derivative proteins of cSR were crystallized following the protocols described previously (18Supangat S. Choi Y.K. Young S.P. Son D. Han C.D. Lee K.H. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2005; 61: 202-204Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To prepare crystals of cSR-NADP-sepiapterin complex, protein was mixed with NADP and sepiapterin to final concentrations of 10 mm and incubated for 3 h before set-up. Crystals of free, SeMet-derivative protein and cSR-NADP-sepiapterin complex were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C in a drop containing 4 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of a mixture of 4 μl of reservoir solution (0.2 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 34% polyethylene glycol 400) and 1 μl of additive (1 m guanidine hydrochloride).X-ray diffraction data for free cSR and cSR-NADP-sepiapterin complex were collected from a single crystal to 2.1- and 1.7-Å resolution using x-ray of wavelength 1.1273 Å and a Bruker CCD detector at station 6B of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Republic of Korea, respectively. Diffraction data for SeMet derivative was collected from a single crystal to 2.1 Å of resolution at station 6A at the Photon Factory at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan. All diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar).

Diffraction was recorded at peak, inflection, and high energy remote points for multiple wave-length anomalous diffraction phasing. 33 selenium sites were located, and phases were calculated using SOLVE/RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The atomic model was built into the electron density with the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS (24Brünger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For free cSR, in the Ramachandran plot, 88.3% of all the residues are in most favored region, and for cSR-NADP-sepiapterin complex, 92.1% of all the residues are in most favored region. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (26DeLano W.L. The pyMol Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2001Google Scholar). The statistics of the structure refinement are presented in Table 1.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure Determination—The crystal structure of the free enzyme of cSR was solved at 2.1 Å of resolution using the selenomethionyl multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction method. There are four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, and 33 of the expected 40 selenium positions were located from the anomalous difference data. The current atomic model has an R value of 20%, and most of the residues (91%) are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot (data not shown). The crystallographic data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.The structure of cSR in complex with NADP and sepiapterin has been determined at 1.7 Å of resolution (Table 1) from a co-crystal obtained from the mixture of protein, NADP, and sepiapterin. The complex was packed in space group P212121 different from the free enzyme in space group R32. There are four molecules in the asymmetric unit and one NADP per molecule and one sepiapterin molecule modeled in the tetramer. The other three sepiapterin molecules have weak electron densities and are not included in the model. In both free enzyme and NADP-sepiapterin complex, the N-terminal hexahistidine tag and residue 1 are disordered. In addition, residues 194–203 of the free enzyme are disordered and not included in the atomic model. Also, residues 198–202 in the complex have weak electron densities for side chains and are modeled as alanines.Overall Structure of cSR—In the cSR crystal structure, each monomer (244 residues) folds into a single domain α/β-structure. A seven-stranded parallel β-sheet in the center of the molecule is sandwiched by two layers of three α-helices (αA, αB, αF and αC, αD, αE), homologous to those found in other short chain dehydrogenase/reductase including mSR and hSR (8Auerbach G.

Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) search for structurally similar proteins showed that the cSR chain topology matches most closely other short chain dehydrogenase/reductases (PDB codes 1YBV, 1FDS, 1CYD, 1GZ6, 1E6W, 1OAA, 1BDB, 1E7W) with Z scores greater than 24. The overall folding of cSR is similar to mSR and hSR, sharing a common tertiary structure with an NADP(H) cofactor binding site and a conserved YXXXLYS sequence motif with root mean square deviations of 0.90 and 1.16 Å to hSR and mSR among Cα atoms in the central β-sheet, respectively (calculated with lsqkab in CCP4 Suite) (21CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Overall structure of cSR. A, stereoview of ribbon representation of the cSR monomer. β-Strands and α-helices are labeled in alphabetical order from the N terminus. NADP (gray, carbon; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen; orange, phosphate) and sepiapterin (yellow, carbon; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen) are shown as sticks. B, ribbon representation of a cSR tetramer formed by two dimers in the asymmetric unit (chain A is in orange, B is in green, C is in cyan, and D is in magenta). There are two different dimer interfaces, one between the orange and green monomers and the other between the orange and cyan monomers. C, superposition of the SR monomers from Chlorobium (magenta), mouse (green; PDB code 1SEP) and human (cyan; PDB code 1Z6Z) with NADP (magenta) and sepiapterin (magenta) bound in the cSR. The largest differences from the three structures are marked with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, significant differences between cSR and mSR or hSR molecules were observed in the substrate binding region around the active site. The loop between βF and αF (residues Val-191 to Met-207; 17 amino acids) in cSR is much shorter than that in mSR (residues Leu-202 to Leu-232; 31 amino acids) and in hSR (residues Leu-198 to Leu-228; 30 amino acids) (Fig. 3C). Also, the residues in the loop between βF and αF show low sequence similarities among these enzymes. The residues at the C-terminal region from Arg-235 to Ile-241 in the cSR extend longer so that it covers up the side of the cavity that is open in the mSR and hSR (Fig. 3C). Therefore, the short loop and the long C-terminal extension in the cSR make changes in the shape and the size of the substrate binding cavity. These changes around the binding cavity may explain the different stereospecific catalysis of the enzyme.Structure of the cSR Tetramer—cSR is a tetramer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal formed by two homodimers, although cSR exists as a homodimer in solution, confirmed by gel filtration and cross-linking experiment (data not shown). The four cSR molecules in the asymmetric unit have essentially the same conformation, with average root mean square distances of 0.21 Å between equivalent Cα atoms for the free enzyme and 0.27 Å for the NADP-sepiapterin complex (calculated with lsqkab for all Cα pairs). In the tetramer there are two different monomer-monomer interactions by the associations of two cSR monomers, each monomer contacting with two neighboring monomers in a head-to-tail fashion related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 3B). The interface between chain A and B is formed by a four-helix bundle consisting of helices αD and αE of each chain. A number of hydrophobic interactions are found in this interface area, involving Phe-110, Phe-122, Phe-123, and Phe-163 from each monomer together with a salt bridge between Asp-111 of monomer A and Lys-119 of monomer B. Another dimer interface is formed between chain A and C by contacts between strand βG and helix αF from each monomer. In this dimer the β-sheet of each monomer is connected by strand βG in an antiparallel manner to each other, forming a central 14-stranded β-sheet. There is an additional salt bridge at the interface formed between Asp-212 and Arg-226 of helix αF from each monomer. No interactions are found between chain A and D, leaving a hole in the center of the tetramer filled with many solvent molecules.Active Site in cSR—In the cSR-NADP-sepiapterin complex structure, the active site can be identified from the positions of the bound NADP and sepiapterin (Fig. 4B). The pocket for substrate is located around at the C terminus formed by the three long loops between strand βD and helix αD, between βE and αE, and between βF and αF and also by a C-terminal extension of strand βG. The loop between βF and αF has two additional short helices αFG1 and αFG2 that are partially disordered in the absence of substrate (Fig. 3A). The substrate binding site is at the C-terminal end of the β-strands above the nicotinamide ring of the NADP. The active site cavity in the NADP-sepiapterin complex is formed by hydrophobic and polar residues Val-146, Ala-147, Phe-99, Arg-150, Phe-152, Ser-145, Tyr-158, Met-195, Arg-235, Asp-240, and Ile-241.FIGURE 4The sepiapterin binding mode.

The sepiapterin in cSR and the sepiapterin in mSR (cyan, carbon; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen) are shown as sticks. The central residues for substrate binding and catalysis are shown as sticks; that is, residues Phe-99, Tyr-158, Ser-145, and Trp-196 from cSR and residues Tyr-171 and Ser-158 from mSR (cyan, carbon; red, oxygen; blue, nitrogen). The shifts of loops in cSR from the positions in mSR are marked as arrows in red. Because of these shifts, sepiapterin in cSR cannot bind to the site in which sepiapterin in mSR is bound. D, stereographic diagram of substrate binding mode. Rotation of the sepiapterin is represented by the rotation axis, and the direction of the rotation is marked as an arrow in black. Sepiapterin in cSR, sepiapterin in mSR (white blue), NADP, and residues are shown as sticks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Enzymes of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family contain a highly conserved Ser-Tyr-Lys triad at the active site (32Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). In the cSR crystal structures three residues forming a Ser-Tyr-Lys triad at the active site are well conserved as in other SRs (Fig. 4C). The tyrosine residue Tyr-158 is oriented for optimal hydride transfer from NADPH to the carbonyl functional group of the sepiapterin and plays a central role in the active site for the catalysis. The basic residue Lys-162, positioned close to Tyr-158, may stabilize the resulting tyrosinate. The Ser-145, which is located in hydrogen bond distance to the C1′-side chain oxygen, is also involved in proton transfer and stabilization for the carbonyl group (33Fujimoto K. Hara M. Yamada H. Sakurai M. Inaba A. Tomomura A. Katoh S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C).The substrate acceptor site in the cSR structure is different from that found in mSR (Fig. 4C). In the mSR-NADP-sepiapterin complex structure, the substrate binding site is located at the end of strands βD and βE between residues Leu-159 and Pro-199. However, the site is not accessible any more in the cSR structure for the substrate because it is occupied and blocked by the side chains of Val-146 and Arg-235. In addition, the strand βE shifted closer by 3.1 Å toward the βD strand from the position in the mSR structure, which leaves no space enough for the substrate binding around this region (Fig. 4C). As a result, the substrate binding site in the cSR has a 10-Å deep pocket shallower than a 15-Å deep pocket in the mSR and is open toward the C-terminal bottom of the molecule.Conformational changes by substrate binding occur in the cSR structure as seen in a substrate binding loop in the structure of 7α-HSDH (31Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure. 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), although no changes were observed in the mSR structure. Without the substrate binding, the loop region of residues Val-191 to Met-207 in helices αFG1 and αFG2 is not defined well and has high temperature factors. Upon substrate binding, the side chains of residues 193–197 have clear electron densities, and the side chain of Trp-196 in the loop specifically interacts with the pterin moiety of the substrate (Fig. 3C).NADP Binding Mode—In the cSR complex the cofactor NADP is well ordered and has well defined electron density. The bound NADP molecule has an extended conformation with the adenine ring in anti and the nicotinamide ring in syn conformations and binds at the C-terminal side of the parallel β-sheet in a similar way as seen in mSR (8Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Gutlich M. Fischer M. Jacob U. Bacher A. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both the ribose rings in the NADP have C2-endo puckering conformations. Most of the residues in direct contact with the NADP in the cSR complex structure ar"
