https://openalex.org/W2042584499,"Human MOF (MYST1), a member of the MYST (Moz-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60) family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), is the human ortholog of the Drosophila males absent on the first (MOF) protein. MOF is the catalytic subunit of the male-specific lethal (MSL) HAT complex, which plays a key role in dosage compensation in the fly and is responsible for a large fraction of histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation in vivo. MOF was recently reported to be a component of a second HAT complex, designated the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex (Mendjan, S., Taipale, M., Kind, J., Holz, H., Gebhardt, P., Schelder, M., Vermeulen, M., Buscaino, A., Duncan, K., Mueller, J., Wilm, M., Stunnenberg, H. G., Saumweber, H., and Akhtar, A. (2006) Mol. Cell 21, 811–823). Here we report an analysis of the subunit composition and substrate specificity of the NSL complex. Proteomic analyses of complexes purified through multiple candidate subunits reveal that NSL is composed of nine subunits. Two of its subunits, WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) and host cell factor 1 (HCF1), are shared with members of the MLL/SET family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, and a third subunit, MCRS1, is shared with the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex. In addition, we show that assembly of the MOF HAT into MSL or NSL complexes controls its substrate specificity. Although MSL-associated MOF acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 almost exclusively on lysine 16, NSL-associated MOF exhibits a relaxed specificity and also acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 on lysines 5 and 8.

IntroductionIn eukaryotic cells, chromosomal DNA is packaged with histones and other proteins into chromatin. Alterations in chromatin structure affect the accessibility of chromosomal DNA to enzymes involved in transcription, replication, and repair. Changes in chromatin structure are regulated in at least three different ways: by ATP-dependent remodeling of nucleosomes, by the incorporation of variants of histones H2A and H3 into nucleosomes, and by post-translational modifications of histones (1Clapier C.R.

Based on the nature of their catalytic domains, HATs can be grouped into two distinct families: the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family, which includes GCN5 and p300/CBP-associating factor (8Dyda F. Klein D.C. Hickman A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and the Moz-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60 (MYST) family, which is characterized by a highly conserved MYST domain composed of an acetyl-CoA binding motif and a zinc finger (9Pillus L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Avvakumov N. Côté J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5395-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Some MYST family members also have additional structural features such as chromodomains (MOF, Esa1, and Tip60), plant homeodomain-linked zinc fingers (Moz and MORF), and other domains that bind specifically to modified histones or participate in other protein-protein interactions (10Avvakumov N. Côté J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5395-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).Human MOF is an ortholog of the Drosophila MOF HAT. MOF is one of the key components of the dosage compensation or male-specific lethal (MSL) complex. The Drosophila MSL complex is composed of at least five proteins (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MLE, and MOF) and two non-coding RNAs (roX1 and roX2). Human cells express an evolutionarily conserved MSL complex that is composed of MOF and at least three additional subunits, including orthologs of MSL1, MSL2, and MSL3. The MOF HAT is believed to be responsible for the majority of histone H4 acetylation at lysine 16 in both Drosophila and human cells (4Rea S. Xouri G. Akhtar A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5385-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Smith E.R. Pannuti A. Gu W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol. Cell.

Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G.

Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Also present in their MOF- and MLL1-containing preparations were several TATA box-binding protein-associated factor (TAF) proteins, RING2 and other proteins thought to function in the E2F6 repressive complex, and the forkhead domain-containing MCRS1 protein, which we previously identified as a subunit of the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex (15Jin J. Cai Y. Yao T. Gottschalk A.J. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Gutiérrez J.L. Coleman M.K. Workman J.L. Mushegian A. Washburn M.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol.

Holz H. Gebhardt P. Schelder M. Vermeulen M. Buscaino A. Duncan K. Mueller J. Wilm M. Stunnenberg H.G. Saumweber H. Akhtar A. Mol.

Although they did not determine whether these MOF-associated proteins were present in one or several discrete protein complexes, they proposed that some or all of them were components of a MOF-containing complex they named the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex. Importantly, Akhtar and co-workers (16Mendjan S. Taipale M. Kind J. Holz H. Gebhardt P. Schelder M. Vermeulen M. Buscaino A. Duncan K. Mueller J. Wilm M. Stunnenberg H.G. Saumweber H. Akhtar A. Mol.

As we describe below, our findings are most consistent with those of Akhtar and co-workers (16Mendjan S. Taipale M. Kind J. Holz H. Gebhardt P. Schelder M. Vermeulen M. Buscaino A. Duncan K. Mueller J. Wilm M. Stunnenberg H.G. Saumweber H. Akhtar A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 811-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and establish that MOF is present in at least two discrete multiprotein complexes, the MSL complex and a second complex, which we refer to as the NSL complex in keeping with their nomenclature. In addition, by comparing the substrate specificities of the MSL and NSL complexes, we obtain evidence that MOF HAT activity is differentially regulated by assembly into the MSL complex, where it acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 on lysine 16, and the NSL complex, where it also acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 on lysines 5 and 8.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have exploited a MudPIT-based proteomics approach to define the subunit composition of the NSL complex, a MOF-containing HAT complex distinct from the well characterized MSL complex. In addition, we present evidence that the activity and substrate specificity of the MOF HAT is differentially regulated by its assembly into the NSL or MSL complexes. We observe that in contrast to the MSL-associated MOF, which acetylates almost exclusively nucleosomal histone H4 on lysine 16, NSL-associated MOF is capable of catalyzing substantial acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 on lysines 5, 8, and 16. In this respect, the NSL HAT complex resembles the NuA4 HAT complex, which also specifically acetylates multiple lysines in the H4 N-terminal tail (32Berndsen C.E. Selleck W. McBryant S.J. Hansen J.C. Tan S. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Berndsen C.E. Denu J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Prior investigations of the mechanism underlying regulation of MOF HAT activity by subunits of the MSL complex have revealed that association of Drosophila MOF with an MSL1-MSL3 heterodimer leads to strong activation of MOF HAT activity and narrowing of its substrate specificity to just lysine 16 of nucleosomal histone H4 (31Morales V. Straub T. Neumann M.F. Mengus G. Akhtar A. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2258-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although it is presently not known how subunits of the NSL complex regulate MOF HAT activity, it was shown previously that the NSL1 protein can bind directly to MOF (16Mendjan S. Taipale M. Kind J. Holz H. Gebhardt P. Schelder M. Vermeulen M. Buscaino A. Duncan K. Mueller J. Wilm M. Stunnenberg H.G. Saumweber H. Akhtar A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 811-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and, while our manuscript was in preparation, Dou and co-workers (17Li X. Wu L. Corsa C.A. Kunkel S. Dou Y. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 290-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reported that binding of NSL1 to MOF enhances MOF acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 and of the DNA binding transcription factor p53. Our definition of an apparently complete set of NSL complex subunits should enable a more thorough analysis of the roles of individual NSL complex subunits in allosteric regulation of MOF HAT activity.It is noteworthy that the NSL complex shares subunits with other chromatin-regulating complexes. The MCRS1 protein is an integral component of both the NSL complex and the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex. The WDR5 protein is a subunit not only of the NSL complex but also of the MLL/SET1-containing histone H3K4 methyltransferase complexes (34Cho Y.W. Hong T. Hong S. Guo H. Yu H. Kim D. Guszczynski T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 20395-20406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and of the ATAC (ADA2-containing) HAT complex, which includes as catalytic subunits both the GCN5/KAT2 and the ATAC2/KAT14 HATs (35Suganuma T. Gutiérrez J.L. Li B. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 36Wang Y.L. Faiola F. Xu M. Pan S. Martinez E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33808-33815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The degree to which the presence of these shared subunits argues for functional links between the NSL, INO80, ATAC, and MLL/SET1-containing histone H3K4 methyltransferase complexes remains to be determined. It has been proposed that WDR5 might serve as a physical link between different chromatin regulatory complexes (14Dou Y. Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Wu L. Corsa C.A. Kunkel S. Dou Y. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 290-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, others argue that WDR5 most likely functions as a platform on which different chromatin regulatory complexes assemble independently (27Trievel R.C. Shilatifard A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 678-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with this latter possibility, we find no evidence for copurification or stable assembly of the NSL complex with either the INO80 or the MLL/SET1-containing histone H3K4 methyltransferase complexes; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the NSL complex might interact with these other chromatin regulatory complexes transiently or too weakly to be detected under the stringent washing conditions that we have used in their purifications.Finally, it is intriguing that the NSL subunit OGT has been shown to be encoded by the Drosophila Polycomb group gene super sex combs (sxc), and evidence suggests that OGT activity helps to regulate Polycomb-mediated repression (37Sinclair D.A. Syrzycka M. Macauley M.S. Rastgardani T. Komljenovic I. Vocadlo D.J. Brock H.W. Honda B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13427-13432Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 38Gambetta M.C. Oktaba K. Müller J. Science. 2009; 325: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the future, it will be of interest to investigate the possibility of cross-talk between the NSL and Polycomb complexes in mammalian cells.

As we describe below, our findings are most consistent with those of Akhtar and co-workers (16Mendjan S. Taipale M. Kind J. Holz H. Gebhardt P. Schelder M. Vermeulen M. Buscaino A. Duncan K.

In addition, by comparing the substrate specificities of the MSL and NSL complexes, we obtain evidence that MOF HAT activity is differentially regulated by assembly into the MSL complex, where it acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 on lysine 16, and the NSL complex, where it also acetylates nucleosomal histone H4 on lysines 5 and 8."
https://openalex.org/W2015703878,"p62, also known as sequestosome1 (SQSTM1), A170, or ZIP, is a multifunctional protein implicated in several signal transduction pathways. p62 is induced by various forms of cellular stress, is degraded by autophagy, and acts as a cargo receptor for autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated targets. It is also suggested to shuttle ubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation. p62 is commonly found in cytosolic protein inclusions in patients with protein aggregopathies, it is up-regulated in several forms of human tumors, and mutations in the gene are linked to classical adult onset Paget disease of the bone. To this end, p62 has generally been considered to be a cytosolic protein, and little attention has been paid to possible nuclear roles of this protein. Here, we present evidence that p62 shuttles continuously between nuclear and cytosolic compartments at a high rate. The protein is also found in nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies. We show that p62 contains two nuclear localization signals and a nuclear export signal. Our data suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p62 is modulated by phosphorylations at or near the most important nuclear localization signal, NLS2. The aggregation of p62 in cytosolic bodies also regulates the transport of p62 between the compartments. We found p62 to be essential for accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in promyelocytic leukemia bodies upon inhibition of nuclear protein export. Furthermore, p62 contributed to the assembly of proteasome-containing degradative compartments in the vicinity of nuclear aggregates containing polyglutamine-expanded Ataxin1Q84 and to the degradation of Ataxin1Q84."
https://openalex.org/W2080972425,"The ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is the most recently discovered ubiquitin-like modifier whose conjugation (ufmylation) system is conserved in multicellular organisms. Ufm1 is known to covalently attach with cellular protein(s) via a specific E1-activating enzyme (Uba5) and an E2-conjugating enzyme (Ufc1), but its E3-ligating enzyme(s) as well as the target protein(s) remain unknown. Herein, we report both a novel E3 ligase for Ufm1, designated Ufl1, and an Ufm1-specific substrate ligated by Ufl1, C20orf116. Ufm1 was covalently conjugated with C20orf116. Although Ufl1 has no obvious sequence homology to any other known E3s for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers, the C20orf116·Ufm1 formation was greatly accelerated by Ufl1. The C20orf116·Ufm1 conjugate was cleaved by Ufm1-specific proteases, implying the reversibility of ufmylation. The conjugation was abundant in the liver and lungs of Ufm1-transgenic mice, fractionated into membrane fraction, and impaired in Uba5 knock-out cells. Intriguingly, immunological analysis revealed localizations of Ufl1 and C20orf116 mainly to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Our results provide novel insights into the Ufm1 system involved in cellular regulation of multicellular organisms. Protein-modifying systems contribute to functional changes in target proteins and/or to amplification of genetic information. Ubiquitylation is an example of the protein modification systems in which ubiquitin, composed of 76 amino acids, is covalently conjugated with target proteins (1.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). The covalent modification of cellular proteins with ubiquitin regulates a diverse array of biological processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle control, DNA repair, signal/transcriptional regulation, and stress response (1.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2.Mukhopadhyay D. Riezman H. Science. 2007; 315: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 3.Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation is carried out by an elaborate enzymatic reaction consisting of three sequential steps. In the initial step, ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, which forms a high energy thioester bond with ubiquitin via adenylation in an ATP-dependent manner. In the second step, the E1-activated ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2, in a thioester linkage. In some cases, E2 can directly transfer the ubiquitin to substrate proteins in an isopeptide linkage; however, E2 mostly requires the participation of a ubiquitin-ligating enzyme, E3, to achieve substrate-specific ubiquitylation reaction in the cells. Although only one E1 had been thought to activate ubiquitin, another novel E1, such as Uba6/E1-L2, was discovered recently in higher eukaryotes (4.Groettrup M. Pelzer C. Schmidtke G. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 230-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5.Jin J. Li X. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Nature. 2007; 447: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Compared with the two E1s, E2 forms relatively large families. Whereas there are 13 E2s in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the human genome encodes ∼30 E2s containing a core Ubc domain composed of about 150 amino acids in addition to several E2 variants (6.Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), indicating evolutional variability. E3 has unexpectedly enormous diversity for strict attachment of ubiquitin to the target proteins, ensuring a variety of roles in ubiquitylation. Indeed, the number of E3s, which contain a core domain such as RING, HECT, and U-box domain, is estimated to exceed 1,000 in humans (7.Rotin D. Kumar S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Similar to E3s, deubiquitylating enzymes, in which about 100 genes are encoded in the human genome, also regulate the ubiquitylation because deubiquitylating enzymes remove ubiquitin from the target protein (8.Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 9.D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitylation for protein degradation, it is generally considered that protein modification by UBLs serves many proteolysis-independent events, such as molecule assembly and functional conversion of proteins. The UBLs include SUMO, NEDD8, UCRP/ISG15, FAT10, Urm1, and Ufm1 as well as Atg8 and Atg12 proteins, which are involved in autophagy. These UBLs possess the C-terminal conserved glycine residue and are covalently attached to the target proteins or phospholipids through reaction cascades in a manner analogous to the ubiquitylation pathway. The E1 and E2 involved in UBL reactions have been identified. Although the E3s for small ubiquitin-related modifier, such as protein inhibitor of activated STATs, were also discovered recently (12.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K.

Among the UBLs, the most recently identified, Ufm1 (ubiquitin fold modifier 1), conjugates to target protein(s) via unique E1- and E2-like enzymes (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S.

Ufm1 is synthesized as a pro-form and cleaved at the C terminus by the specific cysteine proteases, UfSP1 and UfSP2, to expose the conserved glycine residue (19.Kang S.H. Kim G.R. Seong M. Baek S.H.

Thereafter, the mature Ufm1 is activated by a specific E1-like enzyme, Uba5, forming a high energy thioester bond. The activated Ufm1 is then transferred to an E2-like enzyme, Ufc1, in a similar thioester linkage. Although Ufm1 forms covalent complexes with cellular proteins in HEK293 cells and mouse tissues (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), to date, it is still puzzling whether a specific E3 is required for the Ufm1-conjugated reaction (ufmylation). In addition, the biological roles of the Ufm1-modifying system are largely unknown. To unravel these two issues, identification of the target protein(s) for ufmylation is essential. In the present study, we identified and characterized C20orf116 as the substrate for Ufm1. Subsequently, we found an E3-ligating enzyme for Ufm1, Ufl1, by proteomics using C20orf116 as bait and finally revealed the reversibility of the C20orf116·Ufm1 conjugate via UfSPs. Furthermore, we generated Ufm1-transgenic (tg) mice and examined the dynamic nature of Ufm1 conjugation profiles in different cell compartments and tissues. The cDNA encoding human C20orf116 was obtained by PCR from human liver cDNA with the C20orf116-s5′ primer (5′-TGGGATCCATGTGGCGCCTGTGTGGTA-3′) and the C20orf116-r3′ primer (5′-GTGCGGCCGCTCAGGCTGGGGCTTGGGCAG-3′). It was then subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The FLAG, Myc, and GFP tags were introduced at the C terminus of C20orf116. C20orf116ΔN50 (amino acids 51–314) was generated by PCR and then subcloned into pGEX-6p-1 vector (GE Healthcare) to express GST-fused C20orf116ΔN50 in Escherichia coli. The cDNA encoding human Ufl1 (KIAA0776) was purchased from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute and subcloned into pIRESpuro3 vector (Clontech). The 3× FLAG and GFP tags were introduced at the N terminus of Ufl1. The deletion mutants of Ufl1, named Ufl1 M1 (aa 1–212), Ufl1 M2 (aa 213–794), Ufl1 M3 (aa 453–794), Ufl1 M4 (aa 1–452), and Ufl1 M5 (aa 1–654), were generated by PCR. These cDNAs were subcloned into pIRESpuro3. To express maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fused Ufl1 and Ufl1 mutants in E. coli, these cDNAs were subcloned into pMAL vector (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). All mutations mentioned above were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs encoding Ufm1 and UfSPs have been described previously (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N.

The media and reagents for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK293 and MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293 cells at subconfluence were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the Neon™ transfection system (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed at 48 h after transfection. Uba5+/+ and Uba5−/− MEFs prepared from day 10.5 embryos were transfected with pMESVts vector, a SV40 large T antigen expression vector (20.Lee G.H. Ogawa K. Drinkwater N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1811-1822PubMed Google Scholar), to establish immortalized MEFs. The immortalized cells were further transfected with C20orf116-FLAG and/or GFP-Ufm1 using the retrovirus vector system (21.Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and then cultured in medium containing 10 μg/ml puromycin and/or 5 μg/ml blasticidin to select stable transformants. For plasmid-based RNA interference against HsUfl1, two oligonucleotides, siTop (5′-GATCCGAAAGTGGTCAGGTCACCATTCAAGAGATGGTGACCTGACCACTTTCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′) and siBottom (5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGAAAGTGGTCAGGTCACCATCTCTTGAATGGTGACCTGACCACTTTCG-3′), were synthesized. A fragment made by annealing these oligonucleotides was inserted into pSilencer H1 3.0 (Ambion, Austin, TX) via BamHI and HindIII restriction sites, and the resulting vector was transfected to knock down endogenous Ufl1. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described previously (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation analyses for Ufm1-conjugated proteins were carried out as described below. The cell lysates were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS-containing TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and then diluted by the addition of 10-fold volume TNE buffer without SDS followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP or anti-FLAG antibody. 5% of total lysates used for immunoprecipitation and 20% of the immunoprecipitants were applied on each lane. The anti-C20orf116, anti-Ufl1, and anti-Uba5 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using the purified recombinant C20orf116ΔN50, MBP-Ufl1, and Uba5, respectively, as an antigen. The antibodies for Ufm1 and Ufc1 were described previously (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The antibodies for lamin B (M-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), LDH (ab2101; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), cytochrome c (7H8.2C12; BD Biosciences), Bip (Affinity BioReagents, Inc., Golden, CO), actin (MAB1501R; Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), FLAG (M2; Sigma), and GFP (Invitrogen) were purchased. Recombinant GST-Ufm1ΔC2, GST-Ufm1ΔC3, GST-Uba5, GST-Ufc1, GST-C20orf116ΔN50, GST-UfSP1, GST-UfSP2, and GST-LC3 were produced in E. coli, and recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and PreScission protease according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant MBP-Ufl1 and the deletion mutants were expressed in E. coli, and these recombinant proteins were purified using amylose resin according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs). Recombinant purified MBP-Ufl1 or MBP-Ufl1 mutants and Ufc1 were mixed in TN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) for 3 h at 4 °C and subsequently precipitated with amylose resin. The mixtures were washed three times with ice-cold TNE buffer. The bound proteins were eluted using 10 mm maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-Ufc1 antibody and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (reaction buffer). The purified Ufm1ΔC2 (0.1 μm), Uba5 (0.1 μm), Ufc1 (0.1 μm), C20orf116ΔN50 (0.1 μm), and MBP-Ufl1 (0.1 μm) were mixed in a reaction buffer containing 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. For the deconjugation assay, the reconstitution reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 units apyrase (Sigma), followed by incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. UfSP1 (0.1–10 nm) or UfSP2 (0.1–10 nm) was added to the reaction mixture and then incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. FLAG- and His-tagged Ufm1 (FLAGHis-Ufm1) cDNA was introduced into the expression vector, pBsCAG2, which contains cytomegalovirus enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter, β-actin intron, and rabbit β-globin poly(A) signal (CAG) (22.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). The resulting construct (designated CAG-FLAGHis-Ufm1) was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA and then stored at 4 °C until use. Sperm suspension (1 × 106/29 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of the DNA solution (30 ng/μl) and incubated at ambient temperature for 2 min. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was carried out according to the method of Kimura and Yanagimachi (23.Kimura Y. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The oocytes were examined ∼6 h after ICSI for survival and activation. Oocytes with two well developed pronuclei were recorded at 7 h after ICSI to assess the fertilization ability. Two-cell stage embryos, cultured for ∼24 h and developed from oocytes fertilized by ICSI, were transferred to the oviducts of recipient females. 193 oocytes were microinjected, 157 (81.3%) survived injection, and 144 (91.7%) cleaved to the two-cell stage. Transfer of 144 embryos produced 49 offspring (34.0%). Of the 49 offspring generated by ICSI, four (8.2%) carried transgene DNA. To assess germ line transmission, four founder mice were mated with C57BL/6J mice. The transmission rate of the transgene to the F1 progeny, determined by PCR, was 46.7% (7 of 15), 47.4% (9 of 19), 54.5% (6 of 11), and 47.1% (8 of 17) in four founder mice (208, 503, 603, and 609 lines), respectively. These rates were within the variation range of the expected value, 50%, based on the Mendelian pattern. One of the tg lines, FLAGHis-Ufm1#503, was used in this study. Genotyping was carried out by PCR analysis. Mice were fed ad libitum a standard diet and maintained in an air-conditioned and light-controlled room (23 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 5%, 12/12 h light/dark). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines for the laboratory animal experimentation at Juntendo University School of Medicine. Fresh mouse livers were homogenized in the homogenate buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm dithiothreitol) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant precipitate was used as the mitochondria-lysosome fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant and precipitate were used as the cytosol and microsome fractions, respectively. The nuclear fraction was prepared as described previously (24.Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 25.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S.

At 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and immunostained with anti-calreticulin (Affinity BioReagents) and anti-β-COP antibodies (Affinity BioReagents). All fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Q550FV; Leica) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CTR MIC; Leica). Pictures were taken using Leica Qfluoro software (Leica). When the C-terminal conserved glycine residue in ubiquitin and Ufm1, essential for conjugation, is substituted with alanine residue, ubiquitin and Ufm1 form stable conjugates with the target proteins, which acquire resistance against attacks of deconjugating enzymes (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this property, the FLAG-tagged Ufm1G82A mutant was constructed. The mutant, in which the C-terminal glycine residue was substituted with an alanine residue, was expressed in HEK293 cells. Thereafter, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitants were then subjected to direct nanoflow LC-MS/MS analysis (26.Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) in order to isolate the interacting protein(s), including target protein(s) (supplemental Table 1). A new uncharacterized protein, C20orf116, was identified as a Ufm1-interacting protein. C20orf116 is composed of 314 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼38 kDa and has a C-terminal proteasome-COP9-initiation factor (PCI) domain (Fig. 1A), which is found in proteins known to be involved in the formation of very large protein complexes like the proteasome and signalosome (27.Aravind L.

This protein is conserved in multicellular organisms but not in yeasts, like Ufm1, Uba5, Ufc1, and UfSPs (16.Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E.

Immunoblot analysis with anti-C20orf116 antibody showed ubiquitous expression although with tissue-specific differences (e.g. specifically highly expressed in the liver) (Fig. 1B). Because C20orf116 was identified as both a Ufm1- and Ufc1-interacting protein, we first examined whether C20orf116 is a substrate for Ufm1 in vivo. To do this, GFP-tagged Ufm1 (GFP-Ufm1) was expressed alone and co-expressed with C-terminal FLAG-tagged C20orf116 (C20orf116-FLAG) in HEK293 cells. Each cell lysate was prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-GFP antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP and anti-C20of116 antibodies. Expression of GFP-Ufm1 resulted in the appearance of several bands that shifted to higher molecular weight (see the band shown by asterisks in Fig. 1C, top, lane 8). Because we did not detect any higher bands when Ufm1ΔC3 lacking the C-terminal glycine 83 of mature Ufm1 (GFP-Ufm1ΔC3) was expressed (Fig. 1C, lane 10), these higher size bands were thought to be conjugates between GFP-Ufm1 and endogenous proteins. By co-expression of GFP-Ufm1 with C20orf116-FLAG, an additional band with a molecular mass of 80 kDa (see the band shown by an arrowhead) was detected (Fig. 1C, top, lane 9). The band was also clearly recognized by anti-C20orf116 antibody (Fig. 1C, bottom, lane 9), suggesting the presence of C20orf116-FLAG·GFP-Ufm1 conjugate. To further confirm this result, C20orf116-FLAG was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-GFP and anti-C20orf116 antibodies. Consistent with the above data, a higher sized band (see the band shown by an arrowhead) was observed when C20orf116-FLAG was co-expressed with GFP-Ufm1 but not alone or with GFP-Ufm1ΔC3 (Fig. 1C, bottom, lanes 12, 14, and 15). The band was also recognized by anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1C, top, lane 14). These results indicate the existence of the C20orf116-FLAG·GFP-Ufm1 complex. Because the conjugate had an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa, it could be composed of one GFP-Ufm1 (40 kDa) and one C20orf116-FLAG (40 kDa). Next, to determine the lysine residue of C20orf116 for Ufm1 conjugation, we prepared several point mutants in which each lysine residue of C20orf116 conserved across species was substituted with an arginine residue (K116R, K121R, K124R, K128R, K193R, K224R, K227R, and K267R) and a lysineless mutant in which all conserved lysine residues were substituted with arginine residues (K-less in Fig. 1D). Then we examined the effect of each mutant on the conjugate formation. As shown in Fig. 1D, immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the K267R mutant was less likely to form a conjugate with GFP-Ufm1 than the wild-type C20orf116 and other mutants (Fig. 1D, lane 12), although some conjugate formation was still observed. In contrast, the lysineless mutant completely abolished the conjugation formation (Fig. 1D, lane 13). These results suggest that Lys-267 is the main lysine residue for Ufm1 conjugation, although other lysine residue(s) could become the site when Lys-267 was mutated. There is also a possibility that K267R mutation causes a conformational change of the PCI domain and subsequently disrupts the protein-protein interaction, leading to loss of the ufmylation. In the next step, we tested whether Ufm1 can conjugate with C20orf116 in vitro. The in vitro reconstitution assay was performed by using recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. Due to insolubilization of the full-length C20orf116, we used C20orf116 with the N-terminal 50 amino acids deleted, whose region is rich in hydrophobic residues (C20orf116ΔN50). Recombinant Uba5, Ufc1, mature Ufm1 (i.e. Ufm1ΔC2) with an exposed C-terminal glycine 83 residue, and C20orf116ΔN50 were purified, mixed, and incubated in the presence or absence of ATP, and then they were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Ufm1ΔC3 was used as a negative control. A ∼40 kDa band, corresponding to the C20orf116ΔN50·Ufm1ΔC2 complex, was observed, which was dependent on Uba5 and Ufc1 (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 4, and 5). This complex was not observed when the reaction mixture was ATP-free (Fig. 1E, lane 1). Moreover, Ufm1ΔC3 could not form the complex in this reaction (Fig. 1E, lane 3). Furthermore, Ufm1 did not form a conjugate with the unrelated protein LC3 in these assay conditions (Fig. 1E, lane 6), implying substrate specificity of Ufm1. Taken together, these results indicate that C20orf116 is a real substrate for Ufm1. To identify the proteins that regulate C20orf116 conjugation with Ufm1, we carried out direct nanoflow LC-MS/MS analysis using C20orf116-FLAG as bait. The analysis identified an uncharacterized protein, KIAA0776, that was named Ufl1 (Ufm1-ligase 1) (supplemental Table 1; for explanation, see below). Ufl1 is composed of 794 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼90 kDa (Fig. 2A) and has no typical functional domain or homology with other known proteins. This protein was also identified as an Ufc1-interacting protein by the LC-MS/MS analysis using Ufc1 as bait (data not shown; see Fig. 2E). Like C20orf116, this protein is conserved in multicellular organisms but not in yeasts (supplemental Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis with anti-Ufl1 antibody showed ubiquitous expression in tissues, with exceptionally high expression in the liver (Fig. 2B). Next, to determine the C20orf116-interacting domain of Ufl1, we constructed a series of FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of Ufl1 (Fig. 2C), and they were expressed in HEK293 cells. Each cell lysate was prepared and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with anti- FLAG and anti-C20orf116 antibodies. As predicted, the wild-type Ufl1 (aa 1–794) efficiently interacted with endogenous C20orf116 (Fig. 2D, lane 9). Similarly, the C-terminal deleted mutants of Ufl1, such as M4 (aa 1–452) and M5 (aa 1–654), also interacted with C20orf116 (Fig. 2D, lanes 13 and 14). The interaction with C20orf116 was still noted in the N-terminal region of Ufl1 named M1 (aa 1–212), although the immunoblot signal was very weak (Fig. 2D, lane 10). In contrast, the N-terminal deleted mutants of Ufl1, including M2 (aa 213–794) and M3 (aa 453–794), did not interact with C20orf116 (Fig. 2D, lanes 11 and 12). We also confirmed the interaction between recombinant C20orf116 and Ufl1 M1 (supplemental Fig. 2), indicating direct interaction via the N-terminal region of Ufl1. In contrast to C20orf116 interaction with Ufl1, there was hardly any in vivo interaction between Ufl1 and Ufc1 (data not shown). However, an in vitro pull-down assay with recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli revealed a direct interaction between Ufl1 and Ufc1 (Fig. 2E, lane 9). Furthermore, the pull-down assay with mutant recombinant Ufl1 proteins showed clearly that the N-terminal region (aa 1–212) is sufficient for the interaction with Ufc1 (Fig. 2E, lane 10). Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to the presence of the intracellular stable com"

Therapeutics and diagnostics built on IgG, Fc, and albumin fusions are frequently evaluated in rodents regarding biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Thus, it is important to address cross-species ligand reactivity with FcRn, because in vivo testing of such molecules is done in the presence of competing murine ligands, both in wild type (WT) and human FcRn (hFcRn) transgenic mice. Here, binding studies were performed in vitro using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance with recombinant soluble forms of human (shFcRn(WT)) and mouse (smFcRn(WT)) receptors. No binding of albumin from either species was observed at physiological pH to either receptor. At acidic pH, a 100-fold difference in binding affinity was observed. Specifically, smFcRn(WT) bound human serum albumin with a K(D) of approximately 90 microM, whereas shFcRn(WT) bound mouse serum albumin with a K(D) of 0.8 microM. shFcRn(WT) ignored mouse IgG1, and smFcRn(WT) bound strongly to human IgG1. The latter pair also interacted at physiological pH with calculated affinity in the micromolar range. In all cases, binding of albumin and IgG from either species to both receptors were additive. Cross-species albumin binding differences could partly be explained by non-conserved amino acids found within the alpha2-domain of the receptor. Such distinct cross-species FcRn binding differences must be taken into consideration when IgG- and albumin-based therapeutics and diagnostics are evaluated in rodents for their pharmacokinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2080821312,"Soluble amyloid oligomers are potent neurotoxins that are involved in a wide range of human degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease. In Alzheimer disease, amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers bind to neuronal synapses, inhibit long term potentiation, and induce cell death. Recent evidence indicates that several immunologically distinct structural variants exist as follows: prefibrillar oligomers (PFOs), fibrillar oligomers (FOs), and annular protofibrils. Despite widespread interest, amyloid oligomers are poorly characterized in terms of structural differences and pathological significance. FOs are immunologically related to fibrils because they react with OC, a conformation-dependent, fibril-specific antibody and do not react with antibodies specific for other types of oligomers. However, fibrillar oligomers are much smaller than fibrils. FOs are soluble at 100,000 x g, rich in beta-sheet structures, but yet bind weakly to thioflavin T. EPR spectroscopy indicates that FOs display significantly more spin-spin interaction at multiple labeled sites than PFOs and are more structurally similar to fibrils. Atomic force microscopy indicates that FOs are approximately one-half to one-third the height of mature fibrils. We found that Abeta FOs do not seed the formation of thioflavin T-positive fibrils from Abeta monomers but instead seed the formation of FOs from Abeta monomers that are positive for the OC anti-fibril antibody. These results indicate that the lattice of FOs is distinct from the fibril lattice even though the polypeptide chains are organized in an immunologically identical conformation. The FOs resulting from seeded reactions have the same dimensions and morphology as the initial seeds, suggesting that the seeds replicate by growing to a limiting size and then splitting, indicating that their lattice is less stable than fibrils. We suggest that FOs may represent small pieces of single fibril protofilament and that the addition of monomers to the ends of FOs is kinetically more favorable than the assembly of the oligomers into fibrils via sheet stacking interaction. These studies provide novel structural insight into the relationship between fibrils and FOs and suggest that the increased toxicity of FOs may be due to their ability to replicate and the exposure of hydrophobic sheet surfaces that are otherwise obscured by sheet-sheet interactions between protofilaments in a fibril."

Upon insulin treatment of insulin-responsive adipocytes, O-GlcNAcylation of several proteins is increased.

To elucidate the roles of O-GlcNAc in dampening insulin signaling (Vosseller, K., Wells, L., Lane, M. D., and Hart, G. W. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Elevated O-GlcNAc also reduces phosphorylation of the PI3K p85 binding motifs (YXXM) of IRS-1 and results in a concomitant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of Y608XXM in IRS-1, one of the two main PI3K p85 binding motifs. Additionally, insulin signaling stimulates the interaction of OGT with PDK1. We conclude that one of the steps at which O-GlcNAc contributes to insulin resistance is by inhibiting phosphorylation at the Y608XXM PI3K p85 binding motif in IRS-1 and possibly at PDK1 as well.

It is hypothesized that abnormal increases in O-GlcNAc disrupt phosphorylation-mediated insulin signaling by direct competition at the same or adjacent serine and threonine residues. A few studies have shown that increased O-GlcNAc dampens AKT activity in response to insulin stimulation of insulin target tissues, such as adipocytes and muscle and endothelial cells (15.Yki-Järvinen H.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a specific increase in global O-GlcNAc levels, induced by inhibiting O-GlcNAcase, in the absence of hyperglycemia, causes insulin resistance directly (16.Vosseller K.

However, another study in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suggests that increased O-GlcNAc is not required for insulin resistance, supporting the long held view that many different independent mechanisms can lead to insulin resistance (21.Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1-E8Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently, O-GlcNAc sites were mapped to a number of key residues on IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) that are involved in different cell signaling events (22.Ball L.E. Berkaw M.N. Buse M.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 313-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, insulin resistance in adipocytes is attributed to postinsulin receptor defects (23.Lima F.B. Thies R.S. Garvey W.T. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), making IRS-1 and IRS-2 excellent candidates to study early steps in the pathway that might explain how O-GlcNAc inhibits insulin signaling. In addition, OGT has been shown to play an important role in nematode insulin signaling (24.Forsythe M.E. Love D.C. Lazarus B.D. Kim E.J. Prinz W.A. Ashwell G. Krause M.W. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl.

Therefore, one of the primary goals of our studies is to understand the impact of O-GlcNAcylation on the function of proteins in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Binding of insulin to its receptor initiates a well studied signaling cascade; activated insulin receptor phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4) (26.White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S2-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). IRS proteins bind to the regulatory subunit (p85) of PI3K via its Src homology 2 domains, binding predominantly to two YXXM motifs, Y612XXM and Y632XXM (mouse Y608XXM and Y628XXM) (27.Esposito D.L.

Activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphoinositides on the inositol ring, thus activating PDK1 (phosphoatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate/phosphoatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent kinase 1) (29.Storz P.

In this study, we show that increased O-GlcNAcylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and on IRS-1 correlates with the down-regulation of phosphorylation at the Y608XXM PI3K p85 binding motif, which in turn is responsible for the decrease in AKT activation and GLUT-4 glucose uptake. Additionally, IRS-1, IRS-2, and PDK1 are excellent in vitro substrates for OGT. Insulin signaling stimulates interaction of OGT with PDK1 and increases its O-GlcNAc modification.

All other reagents used were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown and differentiated into adipocytes, as described (39.Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (13.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preadipocytes were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum containing penicillin/streptomycin and biotin; were differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum with dexamethasone (390 ng/ml), insulin (1 μg/ml), and methylisobutylxanthine (115 μg/ml) for 48 h; and then treated with insulin (1 μg/ml) for an additional 48 h. Adipocytes were used for experiments between 8 and 11 days after differentiation. Whole cell lysates were harvested by washing 3T3-L1 three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraping into Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture 1, 40 mm GlcNAc (GlcNAc prevents O-GlcNAcase from removing O-GlcNAc from proteins during cell lysis), and 1 mm NaVO4 as described (13.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21411-21417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In most cases, the whole cell extract was sonicated two times for 10 s each with a 30-s pause between on ice. Lipids were removed by adding an equal volume (1:1) of ice-cold Freon (1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane), centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein reagent. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 2 h to gently lyse cells and solubilize proteins in cell membranes before treating samples in a manner similar to that stated above. Immunoprecipitations were then performed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C, captured with Protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and washed gently four times in phosphate-buffered saline (shorter incubations in some instances were necessary when trying to preserve post-translational modifications of proteins). Sepharose beads were boiled with modified Laemmli buffer to solubilize protein. Precast Criterion gels (Bio-Rad) were used for SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and probed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated with the blots, and ECL (Pierce) detection was used according to the manufacturer's directions. When necessary, blots were stripped with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, for 30 min at room temperature, washed with TBST, and reprobed with antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then twice with 1× GalT1 (galactosyltransferase) labeling buffer (10×: 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm galactose, 50 mm MnCl2) and then incubated in GalT1 buffer with 1 μCi/reaction of UDP-[3H]galactose, 1 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase at 4 °C overnight (40.Whelan S.A. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 113-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by boiling samples with modified Laemmli buffer. The immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was labeled with N-azidogalactosamine and tagged with biotin as described previously (41.Dias W.B. Cheung W.D. Wang Z. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21327-21337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reactions were eluted with Laemmli buffer for Western blot analysis using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Insulin receptor substrate was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and labeled in vitro with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc by incubating with or without OGT (bacterially expressed (42.Gross B.J. Kraybill B.C. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14588-14589Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)), Sepharose A/G beads were washed extensively, and then 1 μm insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (Sigma I9266 protocol followed) was added for 20 min in kinase buffer (20 μm ATP, 5 mm Mn(CH3CO2)2, 50 mm HEPES, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.9) (13.Whelan S.A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 12272-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation of the phospho-Tyr608 IRS-1 YXXM site was measured by Western blot analysis. To determine which proteins in the insulin signaling cascade might be substrates of OGT, we immunopurified several proteins in the pathway, including IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3K p85, PDK1, AKT, PKCζ, and GSK3β from 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated or not with 100 nm insulin. Each immunopurified protein was then incubated for 4 h with recombinant OGT and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. All seven insulin signaling proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, treated with EnHance, dried, and subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 1). IRS-1 is a good substrate of OGT and became highly modified with O-GlcNAc in both control and insulin-activated samples. Several groups have shown that IRS-1 is modified by O-GlcNAc in vivo (17.Federici M. Menghini R. Mauriello A. Hribal M.L. Ferrelli F. Lauro D. Sbraccia P. Spagnoli L.G. Sesti G. Lauro R. Circulation. 2002; 106: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 18.Patti M.E. Virkamäki A. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. Yki-Järvinen H.

Proteomics. 2006; 5: 313-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IRS-2 is also a substrate for OGT. However, IRS-2 isolated from cells not treated with insulin was a better substrate in vitro than that isolated from insulin-treated cells, suggesting that insulin-induced modification of IRS-2 by phosphate or another modification (like O-GlcNAc) may be blocking in vitro O-GlcNAcylation. PDK1 was also a good substrate for OGT and was modified in a pattern similar to that of IRS-2, with the non-activated PDK1 from control cells undergoing higher incorporation of O-GlcNAc than PDK1 from insulin-activated cells. In the insulin-stimulated PI3K p85 immunoprecipitation, IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitated and was also modified in vitro with O-GlcNAc, suggesting that the O-GlcNAc modification site is not modified by either O-GlcNAc or phosphorylation when IRS-1 is interacting with PI3K p85. OGT did not appear to modify PI3K, AKT, PKCζ, or GSK3β while slightly modifying the insulin receptor (data not shown) in vitro. Western blot analysis was conducted on all insulin-signaling proteins to confirm their presence in the immunoprecipitations. Previously, Vosseller et al. (16.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) showed that increasing O-GlcNAc levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, by using a selective inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, dampened insulin-induced AKT Thr308 phosphorylation, an indicator of AKT activity, and concomitantly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Multiple groups have demonstrated that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are modified by O-GlcNAc, suggesting that this may play a role in the downstream AKT activity. However, Vosseller et al. (16.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, did not detect O-GlcNAc-modulated changes in insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2. Because IRS-1 and IRS-2 contain over 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, it is unlikely that the two key tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the YXXM PI3K p85 binding motif, which are responsible for greater than 80% of PI3K p85 activation (27.Esposito D.L. Li Y. Cama A. Quon M.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), would be seen by probing with a pan-specific phosphotyrosine antibody. Thus, to further examine the point at which O-GlcNAc plays a role upstream of the dampened AKT activity, we specifically looked at the phosphorylation of one of the key YXXM motifs of IRS-1 Tyr(P)608 in whole cell extracts of mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2). 3T3-L1 cells were treated with 100 μm PUGNAc overnight for 12 h and then retreated with PUGNAc for 4 h before insulin stimulation with 5 nm insulin for 10 min. The retreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PUGNAc insured increased global O-GlcNAc and significantly dampened the response of AKT activation by insulin (Fig. 2). Quantification of the Thr(P)308 AKT phosphorylation indicated that O-GlcNAc had reduced AKT activity by about 45%. Quantification of Tyr(P)608 IRS-1 indicated that O-GlcNAc reduced this key YXXM phosphorylation site by about 25%. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a general PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, had no effect on Tyr(P)608 IRS-1 insulin-induced phosphorylation, whereas blocking Thr(P)308 AKT phosphorylation. The biological significance of the reduction in Tyr(P)608 and Thr(P)308 AKT phosphorylation was determined by the reduction in GLUT-4 glucose uptake (data not shown), consistent with earlier findings by Vosseller et al. (16.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). We then demonstrated that immunoprecipitated IRS-1 from whole cell extracts of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with PUGNAc had increased levels of O-GlcNAc modification (Fig. 3A) compared with controls. It is important to point out that the RL2 antibody is more immunoreactive to the O-GlcNAc-modified IRS-1 than the 110.6 O-GlcNAc antibody. In addition, we also used a far more sensitive GalT1, UDP-N-azidogalactosamine, biotin tag, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase method to identify the O-GlcNAc modification on IRS-1 (Fig. 3B). This method clearly allows us to see that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PUGNAc significantly increases O-GlcNAc modification on IRS-1. Western blot analysis of the IRS-1 with both a general phospho-YXXM motif antibody and the specific Tyr(P)608 IRS-1 antibody revealed that increased O-GlcNAc reduced insulin-induced phosphorylation of this motif in IRS-1 (Fig. 3A). All Western blots were also conducted with total cell extracts as controls (Fig. 3A, right panels). IRS-2 does not appear to be immunoreactive with either the general phospho-YXXM motif or Tyr(P)608 IRS-1 antibody (data not shown). Increased O-GlcNAc on IRS-1 reduced insulin induced interaction of PI3K p85 with IRS-1 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3C) and reduced IRS-1 interaction with PI3K p85 immunoprecipitations, strongly suggesting that O-GlcNAc modification of IRS-1 dampens its interaction with PI3K p85. We were unable to detect O-GlcNAc on IRS-2, the level of IRS-2 protein or stoichiometry of O-GlcNAc may be too low (data not shown). However, PUGNAc treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes also resulted in reduced insulin-stimulated binding of PI3K p85 to IRS-2 (supplemental Fig. 1). To further test the hypothesis that O-GlcNAc interferes with IRS-1 activity, we O-GlcNAcylated IRS-1 immunoprecipitates in vitro with recombinant OGT and UDP-GlcNAc. Untreated and O-GlcNAcylated IRS-1 were then mixed with insulin receptor stimulated or not with insulin, allowed to react, and immunoblotted for phospho-Y608IRS-1 (Fig. 3D). We found that modifying IRS-1 with O-GlcNAc substantially reduced insulin-stimulated insulin receptor phosphorylation of IRS-1 Tyr608 by about 50%. Interestingly, when the PI3K p85 immunoprecipitations were probed for O-GlcNAc at the molecular weight of IRS-1, no signal was found (Fig. 4A). When we probed PI3K p85 immunoprecipitations with Tyr(P)608 IRS-1 antibody, as expected, we saw that insulin induced an increase in phosphorylated Tyr608 IRS-1 interaction with PI3K p85 (Fig. 4B). We also saw that pretreating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with PUGNAc reduced the amount of phosphorylated Tyr608 IRS-1 associated with PI3K p85 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, when the PI3K p85 immunoprecipitations were probed for O-GlcNAc at the molecular weight of IRS-1, no signal was found (Fig. 4B). Previously, we documented that insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes induces insulin receptor interaction and activation of OGT activity (13.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21411-21417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, Yang et al. (25.Yang X. Ongusaha P.P. Miles P.D. Havstad J.C. Zhang F. So W.V. Kudlow J.E. Michell R.H. Olefsky J.M. Field S.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) also showed that OGT was responsive to the insulin signaling. We therefore wanted to test if OGT interacts with any other major insulin signaling proteins that would affect downstream AKT activity. IRS-1, IRS-2, PI3K p85, PDK1, and AKT were each immunoprecipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed by Western blotting to determine if OGT interacts with any of the proteins in the insulin signaling pathway besides the insulin receptor. We found that OGT interacts with PDK1 upon insulin treatment and that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with PUGNAc, the PDK1-OGT association is significantly reduced (Fig. 5A; whole Western blot is shown in supplemental Fig. 2). The effect of PUGNAc on whole cell O-GlcNAc levels is displayed in Fig. 5B. Interestingly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with PUGNAc significantly elevated O-GlcNAc on PDK1 (Fig. 5C). In addition, insulin treatment of these cells slightly increased O-GlcNAc modification on PDK1. PUGNAc may be dampening the interaction of OGT with PDK1 by a multitude of potential mechanisms. One possible mechanism of protein-protein interaction may be that the O-GlcNAc modification on PDK1 is inhibiting OGT interaction. Insulin stimulation of OGT activity (13.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21411-21417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) may feed back and down-regulate PDK1 activity and hence AKT activity. We did not detect any O-GlcNAc modification on AKT; nor did we see any OGT interaction with AKT (supplemental Fig. 3). The two anti-O-GlcNAc immunoblot bands in the PUGNAc-treated AKT immunoprecipitation do not line up with the anti-AKT immunoblot bands. We also did not detect OGT interacting with other O-GlcNAc-modified insulin signaling proteins (data not shown). Perhaps the on/off rate is too quick, or interactions with these substrates may occur transiently at time points different from those studied here. However, identification of elevated O-GlcNAc on PDK1 may, in addition to the dampening of Tyr(P)608 IRS-1 phosphorylation, have an effect on dampening AKT activity and GLUT-4 glucose transport. The effect of O-GlcNAc on protein phosphorylation in cell signaling, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, cellular stress, and protein degradation, as well as many other cellular processes, is just beginning to be revealed (1.Whelan S.A.

Several groups have shown that O-GlcNAc directly inhibits insulin signaling in several cell lines (16.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, there are a number of other publications that suggest that the role of O-GlcNAc in Type II diabetes may be cell and protein cell signaling specific to adipocytes (16.Vosseller K.

Interestingly, OGT itself, the enzyme responsible for mediating the addition of O-GlcNAc, is known to be involved in insulin signaling (13.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

The significant increase of O-GlcNAc modification on IRS-1, IRS-2, and PDK1 in vitro when incubated with OGT suggests that this modification may play a role in insulin resistance with these proteins. Interestingly, IRS-2 and PDK1 from insulin-stimulated samples were poorer substrates for OGT then the same proteins from control samples, suggesting that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation or other modification may be inhibiting the O-GlcNAc modification of these proteins. AKT, PKCζ, PI3K, and GSK3β were not good substrates for OGT in vitro. In addition, analyses of immunoprecipitations of AKT (supplemental Fig. 3) and PKCζ (data not shown) were unable to detect O-GlcNAc on these proteins. We not only found that IRS-2, and especially IRS-1, are excellent substrates for OGT, but we also found that elevation of O-GlcNAc in whole cell extracts and on IRS-1 correlated with inhibition of PI3K p85 binding to the YXXM motif, inhibition of the phosphorylation of the YXXM motifs, and prevention of phosphorylation of Y608IRS-1. Elevations of O-GlcNAc modification on IRS-1 may play a direct role in the decreased phosphorylation of the YXXM motifs. Both sites Tyr608 and Tyr628 are necessary for full activation of PI3K p85 (27.Esposito D.L. Li Y. Cama A. Quon M.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), so reduced phosphorylation of either site would result in down-regulation of insulin-stimulated AKT activity. Interestingly, there is an O-GlcNAc consensus PVPS site between the two YXXM motifs (608ympmspgvapvpsgrkgsgd628ympms) in IRS-1 that may be a site of regulation for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the YXXM motifs. Recently, it has been shown that an IRS-1 Ser1011 site close to one of nine putative YXXM PI3K p85 sites is modified with O-GlcNAc (53.Klein A.L. Berkaw M.N. Buse M.G. Ball L.E. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 2733-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the putative YXXM PI3K p85 binding site adjacent to the O-GlcNAc-modified IRS-1 Ser1011 site would not be expected to have much of a role in PI3K interaction and activity because PI3K is predominantly activated by sites Tyr608 and Tyr628 in adipocytes. Although a number of O-GlcNAc modifications were site-mapped on IRS-1 (22.Ball L.E. Berkaw M.N. Buse M.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 313-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 53.Klein A.L. Berkaw M.N. Buse M.G. Ball L.E. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 2733-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), none were close to the Tyr608 IRS-1 site. Therefore, we hypothesize that there may also be other potential serine O-GlcNAc sites in the vicinity of the major YXXM motifs, Tyr608 and Tyr628, that have not been site-mapped. Further analyses of IRS-1 and IRS-2 serine/threonine residues near the Tyr608 and Tyr628 sites, especially at the PVPS620 site, are necessary to determine if O-GlcNAc plays a role in their phosphorylation. Because insulin is capable of stimulating OGT activity and increases O-GlcNAc modification, it is plausible that hyperinsulemia, in conjunction with hyperglycemia, which increases UDP-GlcNAc pools, may be synergistically activating OGT, leading to abnormally increased O-GlcNAc levels in cells and contributing to insulin resistance (Fig. 6). Consistent with this model, IRS-1, IRS-2, and PDK1 are all substrates of OGT, and increased O-GlcNAc specifically inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Tyr608 of the YXXM PI3K p85 binding motif, leading to downstream inactivation of AKT and dampened GLUT-4-mediated glucose uptake (data not shown). In addition, insulin stimulation of OGT and/or inhibition of O-GlcNAcase may also be regulating PDK1 regulation of AKT activity by elevation of O-GlcNAc on PDK1. OGT interaction with PDK1 was found to increase upon insulin stimulation, and PDK1 appears to become modified with O-GlcNAc. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of insulin-stimulated OGT interaction with PDK1. There could be many potential mechanisms for elevated O-GlcNAc blocking OGT and PDK1 interaction, such as modification of phosphatases, scaffolding proteins, or modification of sites on OGT and PDK1 themselves. A growing number of publications are beginning to elucidate the role that O-GlcNAc plays in the cellular function of Type II diabetes (13.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Here we have shown that elevations of O-GlcNAc in 3T3-L1 cells inhibit phosphorylation of Tyr608 of IRS-1, hence down-regulating AKT activity, and that insulin stimulates OGT interaction with PDK1 as well as its O-GlcNAc modification in adipocytes. This study further documents that O-GlcNAc is an important post-translational modification in insulin signaling and probably plays a key role in the etiology of diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2043093139,"To study the metabolic activity of NF-kappaB, we investigated phenotypes of two different mouse models with elevated NF-kappaB activities. The transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB is enhanced either by overexpression of NF-kappaB p65 (RelA) in aP2-p65 mice or inactivation of NF-kappaB p50 (NF-kappaB1) through gene knock-out. In these models, energy expenditure was elevated in day and night time without a change in locomotion. The mice were resistant to adulthood obesity and diet-induced obesity without reduction in food intake. The adipose tissue growth and adipogenesis were inhibited by the elevated NF-kappaB activity. Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma expression was reduced by NF-kappaB at the transcriptional level. The two models exhibited elevated inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) in adipose tissue and serum. However, insulin sensitivity was not reduced by the inflammation in the mice on a chow diet. On a high fat diet, the mice were protected from insulin resistance. The glucose infusion rate was increased more than 30% in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp test. Our data suggest that the transcription factor NF-kappaB promotes energy expenditure and inhibits adipose tissue growth. The two effects lead to prevention of adulthood obesity and dietary obesity. The energy expenditure may lead to disassociation of inflammation with insulin resistance. The study indicates that inflammation may prevent insulin resistance by eliminating lipid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1966430836,"The high glucose consumption of tumor cells even in an oxygen-rich environment, referred to as the Warburg effect, has been noted as a nearly universal biochemical characteristic of cancer cells. Targeting the glycolysis pathway has been explored as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy to eradicate cancer based on this fundamental biochemical property of cancer cells. Oncoproteins such as Akt and c-Myc regulate cell metabolism. Accumulating studies have uncovered various molecular mechanisms by which oncoproteins affect cellular metabolism, raising a concern as to whether targeting glycolysis will be equally effective in treating cancers arising from different oncogenic activities. Here, we established a dual-regulatable FL5.12 pre-B cell line in which myristoylated Akt is expressed under the control of doxycycline, and c-Myc, fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor, is activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Using this system, we directly compared the effect of these oncoproteins on cell metabolism in an isogenic background. Activation of either Akt or c-Myc leads to the Warburg effect as indicated by increased cellular glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate generation. When cells are treated with glycolysis inhibitors, Akt sensitizes cells to apoptosis, whereas c-Myc does not. In contrast, c-Myc but not Akt sensitizes cells to the inhibition of mitochondrial function. This is correlated with enhanced mitochondrial activities in c-Myc cells.

IntroductionDuring tumorigenesis, cancer cells rewire their metabolic programs to benefit their growth, proliferation, and survival (1.DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). One of the most drastically altered metabolic pathways in tumor cells is glycolysis. As first documented by Warburg (2.Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9331) Google Scholar), cancerous cells exhibit higher glycolytic activity even when oxygen is abundant as compared with nonmalignant cells. This phenomenon is referred to as the “Warburg effect” or “aerobic glycolysis,” which serves as the foundation for the positron emission tomography that is widely used in clinical cancer diagnosis. The use of positron emission tomography has in turn confirmed the Warburg effect as a universal property of cancer cells (3.Wechalekar K. Sharma B. Cook G. Clin. Radiol. 2005; 60: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An abnormal glucose metabolism fulfills the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of cancer cells and is tightly associated with cell death evasion, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis of various cancers (1.DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar, 4.Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J.

Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9807) Google Scholar). Targeting the glycolysis pathway thus provides a reasonable therapeutic opportunity.Recent studies on tumor metabolism have revealed complex mechanisms that underlie the Warburg effect. Besides mitochondrial dysfunction, which was suspected by Warburg himself, other factors, including hypoxia, redox stress, oncogene activation, as well as loss of tumor suppressor genes, can all contribute to the high rate of glycolysis. The connection of genetic alterations in cancers to glucose metabolic regulation suggests that cancer cells not only passively adapt to their environment but can actively manipulate metabolic programs to promote tumorigenesis. This is with particular significance in hematopoietic cancers where oxygen and other nutrient supplies are often abundant (1.DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar, 4.Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J.

Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (9807) Google Scholar).Akt and c-Myc are two frequently dysregulated oncoproteins in various cancers. Both proteins are involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and death/survival (6.Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4620) Google Scholar, 7.Dang C.V. O'Donnell K.A. Zeller K.I. Nguyen T. Osthus R.C. Li F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, has been found to promote anabolic metabolism, support cell survival, and suppress apoptosis through various mechanisms, including the regulation of glucose metabolism (8.Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 9.Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J.

Akt promotes the translocation of glucose transporter 1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, thus increasing glucose uptake (12.Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Akt can also promote the association of hexokinase I and II, the most abundant isoforms of glucose kinase in cancer cells, with the mitochondrial outer membrane. This association increases the enzymatic efficiency of the kinase and stabilizes mitochondria, hence rendering the cell resistant to various cell death stimuli (8.Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 11.Majewski N. Nogueira V. Bhaskar P. Coy P.E. Skeen J.E. Gottlob K. Chandel N.S. Thompson C.B.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4683-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar).c-Myc, a transcriptional regulator, has also been found to directly regulate the glycolytic pathway (7.Dang C.V. O'Donnell K.A. Zeller K.I. Nguyen T. Osthus R.C. Li F. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In Rat1a fibroblasts and murine livers overexpressing c-Myc, the mRNA levels of the glucose transporter 1, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase are elevated (14.Osthus R.C. Shim H. Kim S. Li Q. Reddy R. Mukherjee M. Xu Y. Wonsey D. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21797-21800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). c-Myc also up-regulates the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, which diverges pyruvate to lactate, and contributes to the Warburg effect (15.Lewis B.C. Prescott J.E. Campbell S.E. Shim H. Orlowski R.Z. Dang C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6178-6183PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in addition to these glycolysis-related enzymes, c-Myc has been found to regulate mitochondrial function. Induction of c-Myc in cells results in increased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial mass, whereas Myc-null cells have decreased mitochondrial mass and fewer normal mitochondria (16.Kim J. Lee J.H. Iyer V.R. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17.Li F. Wang Y. Zeller K.I. Potter J.J. Wonsey D.R. O'Donnell K.A. Kim J.W. Yustein J.T. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6225-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). cDNA microarray analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter microarray analysis reveal a number of genes involved in mitochondrial DNA replication, transcription, and biogenesis are direct transcriptional targets of c-Myc. These include mitochondrial transcription factor A, DNA polymerase subunit γ-1, and DNA polymerase subunit γ-2, as well as nuclear respiratory factor 1 (16.Kim J. Lee J.H. Iyer V.R. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17.Li F. Wang Y. Zeller K.I. Potter J.J. Wonsey D.R. O'Donnell K.A. Kim J.W. Yustein J.T. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6225-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 18.Morrish F. Neretti N. Sedivy J.M. Hockenbery D.M. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These studies support a direct role for c-Myc on mitochondrial biogenesis, pointing to the possibility that c-Myc not only promotes glycolysis but also enhances the ability of cells to utilize non-glucose substrates to fuel mitochondria. Thus, although both Akt and c-Myc can drive the Warburg effect, they may render cells differentially susceptible to the inhibition of glycolysis. In this work, we establish an isogenic hematopoietic cell culture system to study the effects of Akt and c-Myc on cellular metabolism and to determine how these oncoproteins may influence cell sensitivity to metabolic perturbation.DISCUSSIONThe alteration of tumor cell metabolism is signified by two coupled events, enhanced glycolysis and altered mitochondrial function. Evidence exists indicating that in addition to passive adaptation to the tumor microenvironment, i.e. the low oxygen tension often encountered during tumor development, the aberrant tumor cell metabolism can be actively regulated by oncoproteins and tumor suppressors (4.Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 472-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 38.Jones R.G. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Many if not all prominent oncoproteins, including c-Myc, Ras, Src, and Akt, stimulate aerobic glycolysis in transformed cells (4.Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 472-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 39.Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 40.Elstrom R.L. Bauer D.E. Buzzai M. Karnauskas R. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Zhuang H. Cinalli R.M. Alavi A. Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3892-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). This warrants the molecular basis for targeting cell metabolism as an anti-cancer strategy, which is intended to target the fundamental property of cancer cells and bypass the complex proliferation and pro-survival signaling pathways in tumors that are almost always heterogeneous. In this study, we attempt to compare how tumor cells with elevated glycolytic activity, driven by different oncoproteins, respond to metabolic perturbation. To this end, we established a dual-regulatable FL5.12 cell line to control the activation of Akt and c-Myc and to compare their responses to glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration inhibitors. Our results show that although Akt cells are highly dependent on glycolysis for survival and are sensitive to glycolysis inhibition, c-Myc cells, which also display an enhanced glycolytic activity, are more susceptible to perturbation of mitochondrial function.Akt has been shown to protect cells from numerous causes of death through its ability to up-regulate glucose metabolism. This ironically makes malignant cells with high Akt activity more susceptible to limited glucose supply (40.Elstrom R.L. Bauer D.E. Buzzai M. Karnauskas R. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Zhuang H. Cinalli R.M. Alavi A. Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3892-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glucose metabolism has been shown to induce apoptosis via up-regulation of Puma and degradation of Mcl-1 (21.Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 41.Zhao Y. Coloff J.L. Ferguson E.C. Jacobs S.R. Cui K. Rathmell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36344-36353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to directly up-regulating glycolysis, Akt has been found to drive synthesis pathways to promote cell growth, which requires a constant supply of substrates for biosynthetic building blocks. Under this condition, amino acids and lipids, instead of being used as alternative bioenergetic fuel, may be channeled into cell growth, and their catabolism is reciprocally suppressed (40.Elstrom R.L. Bauer D.E. Buzzai M. Karnauskas R. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Zhuang H. Cinalli R.M. Alavi A. Rudin C.M. Thompson C.B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3892-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Indeed, constitutive Akt activation blunts fatty acid β-oxidation by suppressing expression of CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) that is required for the entry of fatty acid into mitochondria (28.Deberardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37372-37380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Pharmacological activation of fatty acid β-oxidation can reverse glucose dependence of Akt-transformed cells (42.Buzzai M. Bauer D.E. Jones R.G. Deberardinis R.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Elstrom R.L. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).The c-Myc proto-oncoprotein is a potent regulator of multiple metabolic pathways essential for cancer cell growth (43.Dang C.V. Kim J.W. Gao P. Yustein J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Oncogenic c-Myc promotes increased aerobic glycolysis through the constitutive elevation of glycolytic enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase A (14.Osthus R.C. Shim H. Kim S. Li Q. Reddy R. Mukherjee M. Xu Y. Wonsey D. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21797-21800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 44.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Induction of lactate dehydrogenase A by c-Myc is required for Myc-dependent transformation (15.Lewis B.C. Prescott J.E. Campbell S.E. Shim H. Orlowski R.Z. Dang C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6178-6183PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Shim H. Dolde C. Lewis B.C. Wu C.S. Dang G. Jungmann R.A. Dalla-Favera R. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase A diverts glucose-derived pyruvate into lactate, thereby depleting the mitochondrial oxidation substrate. Despite this, Myc-transformed cells display increased mitochondrial mass and O2 consumption, consistent with the findings that a number of c-Myc targets are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (16.Kim J. Lee J.H. Iyer V.R. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17.Li F. Wang Y. Zeller K.I. Potter J.J. Wonsey D.R. O'Donnell K.A. Kim J.W. Yustein J.T. Lee L.A. Dang C.V.

Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a recent report that c-Myc cells are sensitive to the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (18.Morrish F. Neretti N. Sedivy J.M. Hockenbery D.M. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In c-Myc cells, mitochondrial respiration can be maintained by catabolizing non-glucose substrates, especially when glucose supply is limited. In glioblastoma cells, fatty acid β-oxidation can be quickly switched on to sustain ATP generation during glucose deprivation (45.Jelluma N. Yang X. Stokoe D. Evan G.I. Dansen T.B. Haas-Kogan D.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Myc can directly or indirectly up-regulate the glutaminolysis pathway and promote catabolism of glutamine (35.Wise D.R. DeBerardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Sayed N. Zhang X.Y. Pfeiffer H.K. Nissim I. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. McMahon S.B. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18782-18787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 36.Gao P. Tchernyshyov I. Chang T.C.

Although glutamine may not be used by tumor cells for ATP generation when the glucose supply is abundant, it is critical for biosynthesis and can be used as an energy substrate when glucose supply is limited (37.Yuneva M. Zamboni N. Oefner P. Sachidanandam R. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed here that c-Myc, but not Akt, sensitized cells to the inhibition of fatty acid and glutamine metabolism (Fig. 5C and Fig. 6).Inhibition of glycolysis has been evaluated as an anti-cancer approach. The application of glycolysis inhibitors has produced encouraging antineoplastic results in vitro and in vivo (25.Xu R.H. Pelicano H. Zhou Y. Carew J.S. Feng L. Bhalla K.N. Keating M.J. Huang P. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 46.Geschwind J.F. Georgiades C.S. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Expert Rev.

However, little work has gone into the development of drugs that target mitochondrial function in tumor cells. It was recently reported that in a xenograft tumor model, tumor cells growing in oxygenated regions can use lactate for oxidative energy production, suggesting that tumor cells are bioenergetically heterogeneous. Although some cells have compromised mitochondrial activities, some cells retain their mitochondrial function (50.Sonveaux P. Végran F. Schroeder T. Wergin M.C. Verrax J. Rabbani Z.N. De Saedeleer C.J. Kennedy K.M. Diepart C. Jordan B.F. Kelley M.J. Gallez B. Wahl M.L. Feron O. Dewhirst M.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3930-3942PubMed Google Scholar). These tumor cells can form symbiotic relationships with hypoxic cells that can be advantageous for tumor development. Hence, targeting mitochondrial bioenergetic function may also be a reasonable therapeutic strategy (51.Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2009; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 52.Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 624-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that variable oncogenic activities may dictate cell susceptibility to the perturbation of cellular metabolic programs. This may explain why therapeutic agents that target glycolysis do not always provide satisfying outcomes and points to the importance of understanding cancer cell etiology and the complexity of their metabolic processes when designing strategies to interfere with their bioenergetic supply. IntroductionDuring tumorigenesis, cancer cells rewire their metabolic programs to benefit their growth, proliferation, and survival (1.DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B.

An abnormal glucose metabolism fulfills the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of cancer cells and is tightly associated with cell death evasion, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis of various cancers (1.DeBerardinis R.J.

Targeting the glycolysis pathway thus provides a reasonable therapeutic opportunity.Recent studies on tumor metabolism have revealed complex mechanisms that underlie the Warburg effect. Besides mitochondrial dysfunction, which was suspected by Warburg himself, other factors, including hypoxia, redox stress, oncogene activation, as well as loss of tumor suppressor genes, can all contribute to the high rate of glycolysis. The connection of genetic alterations in cancers to glucose metabolic regulation suggests that cancer cells not only passively adapt to their environment but can actively manipulate metabolic programs to promote tumorigenesis. This is with particular significance in hematopoietic cancers where oxygen and other nutrient supplies are often abundant (1.DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B.

Akt can also promote the association of hexokinase I and II, the most abundant isoforms of glucose kinase in cancer cells, with the mitochondrial outer membrane. This association increases the enzymatic efficiency of the kinase and stabilizes mitochondria, hence rendering the cell resistant to various cell death stimuli (8.Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S.

Moreover, in addition to these glycolysis-related enzymes, c-Myc has been found to regulate mitochondrial function. Induction of c-Myc in cells results in increased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial mass, whereas Myc-null cells have decreased mitochondrial mass and fewer normal mitochondria (16.Kim J. Lee J.H.

To determine the role of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/Ser23 in PKD-mediated regulation of cardiac myofilament function, we used transgenic mice that express cTnI in which Ser22/Ser23 are substituted by nonphosphorylatable Ala (cTnI-Ala2). In skinned myocardium from wild-type (WT) mice, PKD increased cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/Ser23 and decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force. In contrast, PKD had no effect on the Ca2+ sensitivity of force in myocardium from cTnI-Ala2 mice, in which Ser22/Ser23 were unavailable for phosphorylation. Surprisingly, PKD accelerated cross-bridge cycle kinetics similarly in myocardium from WT and cTnI-Ala2 mice.

https://openalex.org/W2057893902,"A mediating role of the reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme Nox1 has been suggested for Ras oncogene transformation phenotypes including anchorage-independent cell growth, augmented angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about whether Nox1 signaling regulates cell invasiveness. Here, we report that the cell invasion activity was augmented in K-Ras-transformed normal rat kidney cells and attenuated by transfection of Nox1 small interference RNAs (siRNAs) into the cells. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or Nox1 siRNAs blocked up-regulation of matrix metalloprotease-9 at both protein and mRNA levels in K-Ras-transformed normal rat kidney cells. Furthermore, DPI and Nox1 siRNAs inhibited the activation of IKKalpha kinase and the degradation of IkappaB alpha, suppressing the NFkappaB-dependent matrix metalloprotease-9 promoter activity. Additionally, epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration of CaCO-2 cells was abolished by DPI and Nox1 siRNAs, indicating the requirement of Nox1 activity for the motogenic effect of epidermal growth factor. This Nox1 action was mediated by down-regulation of the Rho activity through the low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase-p190RhoGAP-dependent mechanism. Taken together, our findings define a mediating role of Nox1-generated reactive oxygen species in cell invasion processes, most notably metalloprotease production and cell motile activity."

The active component of LPS is lipid A, a partially conserved glycolipid that anchors LPS into the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Stimulatory lipid As, such as Escherichia coli lipid A, usually have 6–8 acyl chains covalently linked to the diglucosamine bis-phosphorylated backbone. The phosphate groups at the 1,4′-position are essential for the agonist activity of lipid A, because monophosphorylated lipid A is greatly reduced in its proinflammatory activity (4.Qureshi N.

In contrast to commonly held notions that the MD-2 pocket would expand to accommodate additional acyl chains from stimulatory lipid A, the resolution of a co-crystal structure of human TLR4 (hTLR4), human MD-2 (hMD-2), and LPS (12.Park, B. S., Song, D. H., Kim, H. M., Choi, B. S., Lee, H., Lee, J. O.

Several studies have been dedicated to understanding the molecular determinants of this species specificity. The results of these studies, however, are contradictory. Our group (16.Lien E. Means T.K.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), proposed that TLR4 is responsible for the species specificity of lipid IVA. Yet, based on similar approaches, Miyake and co-workers (14.Akashi S. Nagai Y. Ogata H. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Hayashi S. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Int.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) reported that MD-2 is responsible for the species-specific responses to lipid IVA. A full interpretation of these studies was not possible because neither group could ever characterize the activity of human TLR4 with mouse MD-2 (mMD-2), probably because the latter protein is so poorly expressed in transfected cell lines. Using a slightly different system, i.e. comparing human versus equine genes, Bryant and co-workers (19.Walsh C. Gangloff M. Monie T. Smyth T. Wei B. McKinley T.J. Maskell D. Gay N. Bryant C. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) demonstrated that under defined conditions, MD-2 and TLR4 were both required for the species-specific activation of lipid IVA, partially reconciling the contradiction between the two theories. The present study addresses both the molecular determinants and the underlying mechanism of the species-specific activation of lipid IVA in an attempt to truly understand the mystery of lipid IVA activity and to extend our knowledge on the mechanism of lipid A activation. We found that both mouse TLR4 (mTLR4) and mMD-2 are required to confer LPS agonist activity to lipid IVA, both in HEK293 cell lines that stably express hTLR4 or mTLR4 and in MD-2-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). We used computational docking and modeling to generate a dimeric mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA model to understand the underlying mechanism. We found that unique ionic interactions exist between lipid IVA and TLR4 in the mouse complex only. When these ionic interactions were disrupted by mutagenesis, lipid IVA responsiveness was severely impaired. In contrast, hTLR4 gained lipid IVA responsiveness when ionic interactions were enabled by charge reversal at the dimerization interface, defining the basis for lipid IVA species specificity. Because lipid A also lacks the core polysaccharide, ionic interactions between the phosphates on the lipid A diglucosamine backbone and the positively charged residues on TLR4 at the dimerization interface are likely to play a key role in receptor dimerization and activation. Thus, we provide direct evidence that ionic interactions between the lipids and TLR4, especially at the dimerization interface, play an essential role in triggering the dimerization and activation of the LPS receptor. The MD-2 constructs expressing hMD-2 and mMD-2 with a C-terminal protein A tag were gifts from Dr. Jie-Oh Lee (11.Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H.

The E. coli precursor, lipid IVA, was synthesized as described (22.Liu W.C. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Suda Y. Kusumoto S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1999; 72: 1377-1385Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The synthetic compound, Eritoran, was a gift from the Eisai Research Institute (Andover, MA). LPS from E. coli strain O111:B4 (Sigma) was repurified by a repeat phenol chloroform extraction (23.Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). HEK293/hTLR4YFP and HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells were plated in 96-well dishes at a density of 10,000 cells/well. The next day, the cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding for an NF-κB-luciferase gene and a control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase. After overnight transfection, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with serum-free medium consisting of DMEM only. The cells were stimulated with 1) the indicated concentrations of LPS or lipid IVA and 2) increasing concentrations of purified monomeric MD-2. After overnight stimulation, the supernatants were removed, and the luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. Renilla luciferase was used for normalization. The single, double, and triple mutants that swap surface charges between hTLR4 and mTLR4 at the dimerization interface were created by site-directed mutagenesis per the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange). All of the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Genewiz, Inc., South Plainfield, NJ). The effects of these mutations on LPS and lipid IVA signaling were tested in HEK293 cells by transient transfection. HEK293 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well. The next day, the cells were transfected with 1) one of the hTLR4YFP or mTLR4YFP mutants (1 ng/well), 2) an NF-κB-luciferase plasmid (24.Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G.

Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), and 3) the Renilla luciferase plasmid. After overnight transfection, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with complete DMEM without serum. The cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of mMD-2 and LPS·lipid IVA overnight prior to the determination of luciferase activity. Mice deficient in MD-2 were a gift from Dr. Kensuke Miyake (25.Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). BMDMs were differentiated in the presence of 20% L929 conditioned medium for 10 days. The cells were then plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 50,000/well in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After attachment, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with serum-free DMEM. The cells were then stimulated with 1) a fixed concentration of lipid IVA or LPS, 2) decreasing concentrations of purified, monomeric MD-2, and 3) 1 μg of CD14/ml (26.Meng J. Parroche P. Golenbock D.T. McKnight C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3376-3384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After overnight stimulation, the supernatants were saved, and the tumor necrosis factor α levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Docking studies were performed using AutoDock 4.0.1 (27.Huey R. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. Goodsell D.S. J. Comput. Chem. 2007; 28: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 28.Morris G.M.

Graph Model. 1999; 17: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). The coordinates of lipid IVA were subtracted from the co-crystal structure of hMD-2 and lipid IVA (Protein Data Bank code 2E59) (13.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To reduce expectation bias, the crystal structure of hMD-2 alone (Protein Data Bank code 2E56) (13.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) instead of from the hMD-2·lipid IVA co-crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2E59) (13.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) was used for docking with lipid IVA. The coordinates of mMD-2 were subtracted from the co-crystal structure of mMD-2 and mTLR4 (Protein Data Bank code 2Z64) (11.Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Lee J.O. Cell. 2007; 130: 906-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Both hMD-2 and mMD-2 were treated as rigid, and lipid IVA was treated as flexible with 30 torsions during docking. The AutoGrid parameters are illustrated in detail in supplemental Table S1. Twenty structures were generated using genetic algorithm searches. A default protocol was applied, with an initial population of 150 randomly placed individuals, a maximum number of 2.5 × 106 energy evaluations, and a maximum number of 2.7 × 104 generations. A mutation rate of 0.02 and a cross-over rate of 0.8 were used. The coordinates of the docked mMD-2·lipid IVA complex were combined with the coordinates of mTLR4 extracted from the mTLR4/mMD-2 co-crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2Z64) (11.Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Lee J.O. Cell. 2007; 130: 906-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) to generate a monomeric mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex. Two copies of mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complexes were then aligned to the hTLR4·hMD-2·LPS co-crystal structure to generate a dimeric mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex. The detailed alignment procedure is as follows: the mTLR4 sequences from the first mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex were aligned to one hTLR4 sequences in the dimeric hTLR4·hMD-2·LPS co-crystal structure, and the mTLR4 sequences from the second mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex were aligned to the other hTLR4 sequences in the co-crystal structure. The sequences of MD-2 and lipids were not used for the alignment. A dimeric mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex was readily observed after the alignment. To clarify the contradictions among different studies concerning lipid IVA species specificity, we developed stable cell line systems in which hTLR4 (21.Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) or mTLR4 was stably expressed on the cell surface, allowing us to study each component separately and consistently. Monomeric soluble MD-2 of both human and mouse origin were purified (supplemental Fig. S1) and used as the source for MD-2. We examined the inducible luciferase activity using an NF-κB reporter construct transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. Both HEK293/hTLR4YFP (Fig. 1a) and HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells (Fig. 1b) responded to LPS stimulation in an MD-2 dose-dependent manner, regardless of the species of MD-2 included. A peak response was observed at the MD-2 concentration of 40 ng/ml (1.3 nm), which likely reflects the optimal concentration of MD-2 to interact with TLR4 in HEK293 cells to activate intracellular signaling. Note that we have consistently observed that HEK293/hTLR4YFP cells responded to LPS more vigorously with hMD-2 than with mMD-2, whereas HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells responded to LPS similarly with hMD-2 and mMD-2. When lipid IVA was used as the stimulant, HEK293/hTLR4YFP cells did not respond to lipid IVA in the presence of either hMD-2 or mMD-2 at all of the tested concentrations (Fig. 1a); under these conditions, lipid IVA functioned as an LPS antagonist (supplemental Fig. S2). This is consistent with our previously reported data that lipid IVA acts as an antagonist in the presence of hTLR4 (16.Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In comparison, HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells (Fig. 1b) responded to lipid IVA stimulation (gray diamond and open square) in a (mMD-2) dose-dependent manner that peaked at the mMD-2 concentration of 200 ng/ml (6.7 nm). This suggests that when both mMD-2 and mTLR4 are present, lipid IVA functions as an LPS agonist. The titration experiments with hMD-2 in HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells (Fig. 1b) show that at low concentrations of hMD-2 (<1.6 ng/ml or 53 pm), lipid IVA did not activate HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells. At higher concentrations of hMD-2 (>40 ng/ml, or 1.3 nm), lipid IVA activated HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells ∼3–4-fold, about half of the response in comparison with LPS stimulation. This indicates that lipid IVA can function as a partial agonist in HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells and that under the right conditions, both MD-2 and TLR4 seem to be qualitatively dictating the biological responses. HEK293/hTLRYFP and HEK293/mTLRYFP cell lines provide a stable environment to quantitatively assess the activity of MD-2. However, these lines are immortalized and genetically engineered; furthermore, they express levels of TLR4 that are higher than true immune cells (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, HEK293 cells are not professional phagocytes and have a limited profile of inducible proinflammatory cytokines. BMDMs from MD-2 knock-out mice were therefore tested for their responsiveness to lipid IVA in the presence of purified mMD-2 or hMD-2. MD-2-null BMDMs responded to LPS stimulation in an hMD-2 dose-dependent manner, which reached a plateau at the hMD-2 concentration of 40 ng/ml (Fig. 1c). This concentration likely reflects the amount of MD-2 necessary to saturate TLR4 on the cell surface and to activate intracellular signaling under physiological conditions. Similarly, MD-2-null BMDMs responded to lipid IVA stimulation in the presence of mMD-2 in a dose-dependent manner until the maximally assessed mMD-2 concentration (Fig. 1c) but did not respond to lipid IVA stimulation when hMD-2 was included regardless of the hMD-2 concentration added (Fig. 1c). This indicates that with hMD-2, lipid IVA does not function as an LPS agonist toward the mouse cells. The partial activation seen in HEK293/mTLR4YFP cells by lipid IVA at high concentrations of hMD-2 was not observed, which is perhaps a reflection of the physiological levels of mouse TLR4 expression. Thus, both mMD-2 and mTLR4 are required for the species-specific activation of lipid IVA under physiological conditions. In summary, it appears that when mouse TLR4 was expressed, the activity of lipid IVA depended upon the species of MD-2. That is, when mouse TLR4 was matched with mouse MD-2, lipid IVA was an agonist; when mouse TLR4 was matched with human MD-2, lipid IVA had no activity (except of at higher levels of mTLR4 in HEK293 cells) and hence functioned as an antagonist. Thus, in the presence of mouse TLR4, the species from which MD-2 was derived determined the character of the response. In contrast, when human TLR4 was expressed, lipid IVA was not an LPS agonist regardless of the species of MD-2. Hence, both TLR4 and MD-2 appear to be responsible for the species-specific response to lipid IVA, with the dominance of one over the other depending on the specific combination and expression levels of TLR4·MD-2 examined. Computational docking was performed between lipid IVA and mMD-2 to understand the essential role of mMD-2 in the species-specific activation of lipid IVA. Mouse TLR4 was omitted from initial docking because only MD-2, but not TLR4, has been demonstrated to bind LPS or its analogs directly (13.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We used the AutoDock docking software, because this approach produces ligand·receptor complexes that closely resemble co-crystal structures (30.Moitessier N. Henry C. Maigret B. Chapleur Y. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In a quality control experiment (supplemental Fig. S4), AutoDock reproduced an hMD-2·lipid IVA complex highly similar to the co-crystal structure (13.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), with a root mean square deviation of 0.74 Å and an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 144.85 pm. This Ki is very close to the experimental Kd value between MD-2 and LPS (31.Prohinar P. Re F. Widstrom R. Zhang D. Teghanemt A. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1010-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the docked lipid IVA·mMD-2 complex, lipid IVA packs well into the hydrophobic pocket of mMD-2 (Fig. 2a). The acyl chains of lipid IVA interact extensively with residues lining the hydrophobic pocket, especially residues adjacent to the Phe126 loop that has been implicated essential for receptor dimerization (12.Park, B. S., Song, D. H., Kim, H. M., Choi, B. S., Lee, H., Lee, J. O. (2009) NatureGoogle Scholar). The 1,4′-phosphates of lipid IVA interact weakly with charged residues (e.g. Arg90 and Glu122) at the pocket entrance (Fig. 2a), thus restraining the diglucosamine backbone of lipid IVA to the pocket entrance. In comparison, none of the β4 strand residues, which have been suggested to be essential for the species-specific recognition of lipid IVA (19.Walsh C. Gangloff M. Monie T. Smyth T. Wei B. McKinley T.J. Maskell D. Gay N. Bryant C. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), are directly involved in lipid IVA interaction (Fig. 2a). Compared with the hMD-2·lipid IVA co-crystal structure (13.Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), lipid IVA packs more superficially in the hydrophobic pocket of mMD-2, with the diglucosamine backbone of lipid IVA tilted toward the Cys95–Cys105 loop (Fig. 2b). Consequently, in the docked mMD-2·lipid IVA complex, the 1-PO3 and 4′-PO3 of lipid IVA are shifted 6.6 and 8.3 Å closer, respectively, to the Cys95–Cys105 loop that directly binds mTLR4 (11.Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Lee J.O. Cell. 2007; 130: 906-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). In addition, the fourth acyl chain (L4) of lipid IVA moves toward the surface (Fig. 2b) and hence is more exposed to the solvent. The binding kinetics generated by AutoDock between mMD-2 and lipid IVA was −2.12 kcal mol−1 for the expected binding energy (ΔGbin) and 28.05 mm for the expected inhibitory constant (Ki, 298 K). The coordinates of the mMD-2·lipid IVA complex were then combined with the crystal structure of mTLR4 to generate an mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex. This complex is very similar to the monomeric hTLR4·hMD-2·LPS complex isolated from the co-crystal structure (see supplemental Fig. S5a for the comparison) (12.Park, B. S., Song, D. H., Kim, H. M., Choi, B. S., Lee, H., Lee, J. O. (2009) NatureGoogle Scholar). Except for the opposite orientation of the lipids, the diglucosamine backbone and the two phosphates on the lipids are in very similar positions in the two complexes (supplemental Fig. S5b). Thus, the docked mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex is in a favorable conformation to interact with another copy of mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex (denoted as mTLR4′/mMD-2′/lipid IVA′ from this point on, to differentiate from the original mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex) to form a dimer. Indeed, when the sequences of mTLR4 from the predicted mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA dimer were superimposed onto the crystal structure of hTLR4 that was defined in the published hTLR4·hMD-2·LPS (see details under “Experimental Procedures”), a dimeric mTLR4·mMD-2·lipid IVA complex was readily observed (Fig. 3a). Close proximity was observed between the 4′-PO3 on lipid IVA and the positively charged residues on mTLR4′ composed of Lys367′ and Arg434′ at the dimerization interface (Fig. 3b). The distances between the phosphorous atom on the 4′-PO3 of lipid IVA and the nitrogen atoms on Lys367′ and Arg434′ (of mTLR4′)"

We previously showed that GlcNAc6ST-2 is expressed not only in lymph node HEVs but also in the colonic epithelial cells in mice. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism and physiological significance of colonic expression of GlcNAc6ST-2 in mice. Treatment of a mouse colonic epithelial cell line with butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by anaerobic bacteria, induced GlcNAc6ST-2 expression in the presence of epidermal growth factor. Administration of butyrate in the drinking water stimulated GlcNAc6ST-2 expression in the mouse intestine, indicating that butyrate could serve as a regulatory molecule for the GlcNAc6ST-2 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the sulfation of colonic mucins was greatly diminished in GlcNAc6ST-2-deficient mice. Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of the colonic-mucin O-glycans from wild-type and GlcNAc6ST-2-deficient mice showed that GlcNAc-6-O-sulfation was the predominant sulfate modification of these mucins, and it was exclusively mediated by GlcNAc6ST-2. After colitis induction by dextran sulfate sodium, significantly more leukocyte infiltration was observed in the colon of GlcNAc6ST-2-deficient mice than in that of wild-type mice, indicating that the sulfation of colonic mucins by GlcNAc6ST-2 has a protective function in experimental colitis. These findings indicate that GlcNAc6ST-2, whose expression is regulated by butyrate, is a major sulfotransferase in the biosynthesis of sulfomucins in the mouse colon, where they serve as a mucosal barrier against colonic inflammation."

HDL promotes the process of cholesterol transport from arterial and other peripheral cells to the liver and excretes it as bile acids. The so-called reverse cholesterol transport is thought to be important for antiatherogenic properties of HDL (1Assmann G. Gotto Jr., A.M.

HDL also exerts a variety of actions that are independent of reverse cholesterol transport; for example, HDL protects endothelium from its dysfunction, which is composed of several responses in endothelial cells (ECs), including proliferation, migration, nitric oxide (NO) production, and inhibition of adhesion molecule expression (3Nofer J.R.

In ECs, AMPK has been shown to regulate the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and NO synthesis evoked by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including HDL (8Drew B.G. Fidge N.H.

AMPK has also been suggested to be involved in the inhibition of monocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in ECs, although the role of eNOS in the regulation of cell adhesion is controversial (13Hattori Y.

Sato K. Kimura T. Endocr. J. 2009; 56: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HDL induced eNOS activation through lipoprotein-associated apoA-I and/or S1P, although the roles of dual receptors, i.e. scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and S1P receptors, are still controversial (4Okajima F.

Mineo C. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, several independent reports have shown that HDL and S1P stimulate AMPK and eNOS in ECs. However, roles of SR-BI and S1P receptors and their signaling mechanism in HDL-induced AMPK activation have not been fully characterized. Moreover, roles of AMPK in HDL-regulated functions related to the protection of endothelial dysfunctions other than eNOS activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined these unanswered questions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and mouse aorta in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we obtained the following important new findings with respect to the mechanism and role of HDL-induced activation of AMPK in ECs. First, HDL stimulated AMPK activation through both S1P receptors/Gi proteins and SR-BI/PDZK1. Second, CaMKK plays a role in the activation of AMPK by both receptor systems, but LKB1 may be involved in SR-BI signaling but not in S1P receptor signaling. Third, the HDL-induced activation of AMPK resulted in eNOS activation, through PI3K/Akt, and the subsequent inhibition of expression of the adhesion molecule, VCAM-1, thereby inhibiting monocyte adhesion to ECs. The role of AMPK in adhesion molecule expression was confirmed by in vivo and ex vivo experiments of mouse aorta with AICAR, an AMPK activator. Finally, HDL-induced antiatherogenic actions seem to be regulated by two independent signaling molecules, i.e. AMPK and Ras. Postulated scheme for signaling pathways for HDL-induced protection of endothelial dysfunction is shown in Fig. 10.Although previous studies have shown that HDL (8Drew B.G. Fidge N.H. Gallon-Beaumier G. Kemp B.E. Kingwell B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6999-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and S1P (9Levine Y.C. Li G.K. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20351-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) activate AMPK and eNOS in ECs, the action mechanism of HDL is controversial. Yuhanna et al. (38Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) first reported that HDL activates eNOS through SR-BI; however, they failed to detect eNOS activation by lipid-free apoA-I in ECs. Their group later reported that reconstituted apoA-I with phosphatidylcholine but without or with low concentrations of cholesterol can stimulate eNOS activation (18Assanasen C. Mineo C. Seetharam D. Yuhanna I.S. Marcel Y.L. Connelly M.A. Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Shaul P.W. Silver D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Drew et al. (8Drew B.G. Fidge N.H. Gallon-Beaumier G. Kemp B.E. Kingwell B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6999-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported that lipid-free apoA-I stimulated eNOS by their interaction, in association with AMPK activation. The present results (Fig. 1A) and the results of the previous study (19Kimura T. Tomura H. Mogi C. Kuwabara A. Damirin A. Ishizuka T. Sekiguchi A. Ishiwara M. Im D.S. Sato K. Murakami M. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37457-37467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) are consistent with those from Assanasen et al. (18Assanasen C. Mineo C. Seetharam D. Yuhanna I.S. Marcel Y.L. Connelly M.A. Williams D.L. de la Llera-Moya M. Shaul P.W. Silver D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), who suggested that cholesterol movement through SR-BI is critical for eNOS activation by HDL. Thus, there are many reports as to HDL-induced activation of eNOS; however, the participation of HDL receptors, i.e. SR-BI and S1P receptors, in HDL-induced AMPK activation has not yet been investigated. This study showed that the SR-BI/PZDK1 system and S1P receptor/Gi protein system contribute equally to the HDL-induced activation of AMPK in ECs. Whether internalization of apoA-I is essential, as suggested by the previous study (8Drew B.G. Fidge N.H. Gallon-Beaumier G. Kemp B.E. Kingwell B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6999-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), remains unknown. It should be noted, however, that the internalization of apoA-I was examined by lipid-free apoA-I but not by native HDL (8Drew B.G. Fidge N.H. Gallon-Beaumier G. Kemp B.E. Kingwell B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6999-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The role of CaMKK in calcium-mobilizing G protein-coupled receptors, including S1P receptors (9Levine Y.C. Li G.K. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20351-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), in AMPK activation has been reported (39Hutchinson D.S. Summers R.J. Bengtsson T. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 119: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, S1P has been shown to remarkably elevate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in ECs (4Okajima F. Sato K. Kimura T. Endocr. J. 2009; 56: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, we failed to detect a significant increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by rHDL, an SR-BI ligand (data not shown). The participation of CaMKK in the SR-BI-mediated AMPK signaling, however, was suggested by the finding that knockdown of CaMKKβ and inhibition of the enzyme by STO-609 remarkably attenuated either S1P- or rHDL-induced activation of AMPK, Akt, and eNOS. It should be noted, however, that CaMKKβ is known to be substantially activated at the resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration, although the enzyme activity is further stimulated by the increase in its concentration (40Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The components of the SR-BI-mediated eNOS regulatory system seem to be localized in caveolae, the cholesterol-rich microdomain of the plasma membrane (36Mineo C. Shaul P.W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which are also known to be a critical platform for signaling molecules involved in a variety of signal transduction systems, including intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (41Isshiki M. Anderson R.G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that calcium/calmodulin-sensitive eNOS and CaMKK are activated without global increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to SR-BI stimulation, as is the case for the estrogen activation of eNOS (42Caulin-Glaser T. García-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).In addition, LKB1 also appears to be involved in the AMPK activation through SR-BI. Similarly to CaMKK, LKB1 is also reported to be constitutively active (43Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Fogarty and Hardie (44Fogarty S. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 77-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have recently shown that even though LKB1 is phosphorylated at Ser-431 (Ser-428 in human), its phosphorylation does not change the enzyme activity. Xie et al. (32Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have also shown that phosphorylation of Ser-428/431 resulted in only a marginal increase in the enzyme activity. Interestingly, however, they observed that Ser-428/431 phosphorylation by metformin is necessary for LKB1 nuclear export to cytosol, where LKB1 interacts with AMPK in ECs (32Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, Ser-428/431 phosphorylation is essential for the LKB1 nuclear export and hence LKB1 activation of AMPK at least in ECs. The export of LKB1 into cytosol has also been shown to be associated with adiponectin activation of AMPK in muscle cells (45Zhou L. Deepa S.S. Etzler J.C. Ryu J. Mao X. Fang Q. Liu D.D. Torres J.M. Jia W. Lechleiter J.D. Liu F. Dong L.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22426-22435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and breast cancer cells (46Taliaferro-Smith L. Nagalingam A. Zhong D. Zhou W. Saxena N.K. Sharma D. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2621-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, HDL, S1P, and rHDL stimulated LKB1 nuclear export in association with phosphorylation of Ser-428 in HUVECs in this study. Thus, stimulation of either S1P receptors or SR-BI causes the translocation of LKB1 and hence potentially activates AMPK.Nevertheless, LKB1 was unable to activate AMPK when CaMKK was inhibited by a specific inhibitor or down-regulated by CaMKK-siRNA. The peculiar observation may be deeply related to the regulatory mechanism of AMPK activity. It is well known that AMPK activity is regulated by the balance of phosphorylation by kinases, such as LKB1 and CaMKK, and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase, possibly PP2Cα (7Witczak C.A. Sharoff C.G. Goodyear L.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3737-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 43Sanders M.J. Grondin P.O. Hegarty B.D. Snowden M.A. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Under the low CaMKK activity status, phosphorylation activity by LKB1 may be too low to overcome the dephosphorylation activity when either S1P receptors or SR-BI was stimulated. Similarly, under the low LKB1 activity status, CaMKK activity is too low to overcome the phosphatase activity in the case of SR-BI stimulation. Thus, SR-BI-mediated AMPK activation requires simultaneous activation of both CaMKK and LKB1. In the case of S1P receptor stimulation, however, strong activation of CaMKK by high Ca2+ supply may cause the AMPK activation without the aid of LKB1. In relation to this, it is interesting that AICAR can stimulate AMPK in association with LKB1 phosphorylation and nuclear export even under the low CaMKK activity status (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3, A and B). AMP binds to the γ-subunit of AMPK and thereby inhibits dephosphorylation by phosphatase. Thus, although LKB1 is not the AMP-binding site, the phosphorylation enzyme is necessary for the activation of AMPK by AMP. In the case of AICAR, the ribonucleoside is transported into cells by the adenosine transporter and metabolized by adenosine kinase into ZMP, an AMP analogue. ZMP then functions like endogenous AMP. Thus, similar to endogenous AMP, ZMP would prevent dephosphorylation of AMPK by phosphatase, such as PP2Cα (7Witczak C.A. Sharoff C.G. Goodyear L.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3737-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Under the condition of inhibiting dephosphorylation of AMPK, LKB1 may be able to phosphorylate and activate AMPK without the aid of other phosphorylation enzymes. It remains unknown, however, how AICAR stimulates LKB1 phosphorylation and nuclear export.This study showed that wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, inhibited HDL- and S1P-induced phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS without any significant change in AMPK phosphorylation. Knockdown of AMPK almost completely inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, suggesting that AMPK is an upstream signaling molecule of PI3K/Akt, which regulates the eNOS activity. The finding that an AMPK activator, AICAR, stimulated Akt and eNOS further supports this conclusion. The signaling pathway of AMPK/PI3K/Akt/eNOS is consistent with those suggested for adiponectin-induced eNOS activation in HUVECs (12Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and S1P- and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced eNOS activation in bovine aortic ECs (9Levine Y.C. Li G.K. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20351-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the eNOS activation mechanism in ECs is complex. Thors et al. (10Thors B. Halldórsson H. Thorgeirsson G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that thrombin and histamine stimulate eNOS via the AMPK-mediated pathway independent of PI3K/Akt in HUVECs. On the other hand, it was reported that AMPK is not involved in eNOS activation by insulin (33Morrow V.A. Foufelle F. Connell J.M. Petrie J.R. Gould G.W. Salt I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31629-31639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial growth factor (34Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Further complicating the issue, PI3K works as an upstream regulator of AMPK as indicated by the finding that PI3K inhibitors inactivated AMPK (11Youn J.Y. Wang T. Cai H. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling pathways of AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and eNOS seem to be differentially regulated depending on the differences in sources (or sites) or species, even in vascular ECs. The differences in time and stimuli employed may also partly explain the different regulatory mechanism of eNOS activation (35Hu Z. Chen J. Wei Q. Xia Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25256-25263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further experiments are required to determine the relationship of the regulation of these important signaling enzyme activities.ATP-consuming proliferation is expected to be inhibited by AMPK activation (5Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Towler M.C. Hardie D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 7Witczak C.A. Sharoff C.G. Goodyear L.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3737-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent studies have shown that AMPK (34Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and LKB1, an upstream regulator of AMPK (47Londesborough A. Vaahtomeri K. Tiainen M. Katajisto P. Ekman N. Vallenius T. Mäkelä T.P. Development. 2008; 135: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), are essential for angiogenesis, which must be associated with migration and proliferation of ECs. Moreover, AICAR, an AMPK stimulator, has been shown to activate ERK in osteoblasts (48Kim J.E. Ahn M.W. Baek S.H. Lee I.K. Kim Y.W. Kim J.Y. Dan J.M. Park S.Y. Bone. 2008; 43: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 49Kanazawa I. Yamaguchi T. Yano S. Yamauchi M. Sugimoto T. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E139-E146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of AMPK potentially acts on ERK and proliferation in an inhibitory or stimulatory manner. Our results showed that HDL-induced ERK activation and proliferation were independent of AMPK, whereas migration response to HDL was depending on AMPK, in ECs. Instead, HDL utilizes the Ras system, which is an independent signaling molecule from AMPK, to induce proliferation. This signaling cascade resembles the insulin signaling pathways; insulin stimulates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which usually regulates a variety of differentiated functions of the cells, and the Ras/ERK pathway, which regulates proliferation (50Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In conclusion, HDL activates AMPK through the apoA-I/SR-BI/PDZK1 and the S1P/S1P receptor/Gi protein systems, thereby stimulating PI3K/Akt and the subsequent eNOS activation, cell migration, and the inhibition of adhesion molecule expression. Both systems seem to be regulated by CaMKK and, for the SR-BI system, additionally by LKB1. HDL also stimulates ERK and proliferation, which are mediated by Ras but not by AMPK. Thus, HDL exerts antiatherogenic actions through dual systems involving AMPK and Ras.

Gotto Jr., A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: III8-III13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). HDL promotes the process of cholesterol transport from arterial and other peripheral cells to the liver and excretes it as bile acids. The so-called reverse cholesterol transport is thought to be important for antiatherogenic properties of HDL (1Assmann G. Gotto Jr., A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: III8-III13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). HDL also exerts a variety of actions that are independent of reverse cholesterol transport; for example, HDL protects endothelium from its dysfunction, which is composed of several responses in endothelial cells (ECs), including proliferation, migration, nitric oxide (NO) production, and inhibition of adhesion molecule expression (3Nofer J.R. Walter M. Assmann G. Expert Rev. Cardiovasc. Ther. 2005; 3: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Okajima F. Sato K. Kimura T. Endocr. J. 2009; 56: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The adhesion of monocytes and leukocytes on endothelium is thought to be an early event of atherogenic or inflammatory responses (4Okajima F. Sato K. Kimura T. Endocr. J. 2009; 56: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to be involved in energy homeostasis and the regulation of a variety of cell functions (5Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Towler M.C. Hardie D.G. Circ.

In ECs, AMPK has been shown to regulate the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and NO synthesis evoked by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including HDL (8Drew B.G. Fidge N.H.

AMPK has also been suggested to be involved in the inhibition of monocyte adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in ECs, although the role of eNOS in the regulation of cell adhesion is controversial (13Hattori Y.

However, roles of SR-BI and S1P receptors and their signaling mechanism in HDL-induced AMPK activation have not been fully characterized. Moreover, roles of AMPK in HDL-regulated functions related to the protection of endothelial dysfunctions other than eNOS activation remain poorly understood.

In this study, we perform the first purification and signaling analysis of Wnt2 and define the function of Wnt2 in ventral midbrain precursor cultures, as well as in Wnt2-null mice in vivo. We found that purified Wnt2 induces the phosphorylation of both Lrp5/6 and Dvl-2/3, and activates β-catenin in SN4741 dopaminergic cells. Moreover, purified Wnt2 increases progenitor proliferation, and the number of dopaminergic neurons in ventral midbrain precursor cultures. In agreement with these findings, analysis of the ventral midbrain of developing Wnt2-null mice revealed a decrease in progenitor proliferation and neurogenesis that lead to a decrease in the number of postmitotic precursors and dopaminergic neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2155232620,"Different interacting signaling modules involving Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase, Ca(2+)-independent regulatory light chain phosphorylation, myosin phosphatase inhibition, and actin filament-based proteins are proposed as specific cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. However, the relative importance of specific modules is not well defined. By using tamoxifen-activated and smooth muscle-specific knock-out of myosin light chain kinase in mice, we analyzed its role in tonic airway smooth muscle contraction. Knock-out of the kinase in both tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle significantly reduced contraction and myosin phosphorylation responses to K(+)-depolarization and acetylcholine. Kinase-deficient mice lacked bronchial constrictions in normal and asthmatic airways, whereas the asthmatic inflammation response was not affected. These results indicate that myosin light chain kinase acts as a central participant in the contractile signaling module of tonic smooth muscle. Importantly, contractile airway smooth muscles are necessary for physiological and asthmatic airway resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2061584078,"Irradiation with UV light, especially UVB, causes epidermal damage via the induction of apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and DNA damage. Various stressors, including UV light, induce heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the induction, particularly that of HSP70, provides cellular resistance to such stressors. The anti-inflammatory activity of HSP70, such as its inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), was recently revealed. These in vitro results suggest that HSP70 protects against UVB-induced epidermal damage. Here we tested this idea by using transgenic mice expressing HSP70 and cultured keratinocytes. Irradiation of wild-type mice with UVB caused epidermal damage such as induction of apoptosis, which was suppressed in transgenic mice expressing HSP70. UVB-induced apoptosis in cultured keratinocytes was suppressed by overexpression of HSP70. Irradiation of wild-type mice with UVB decreased the cutaneous level of IκB-α (an inhibitor of NF-κB) and increased the infiltration of leukocytes and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the epidermis. These inflammatory responses were suppressed in transgenic mice expressing HSP70. In vitro, the overexpression of HSP70 suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased the level of IκB-α in keratinocytes irradiated with UVB. UVB induced an increase in cutaneous levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, both of which were suppressed in transgenic mice expressing HSP70. This study provides genetic evidence that HSP70 protects the epidermis from UVB-induced radiation damage.

This study provides genetic evidence that HSP70 protects the epidermis from UVB-induced radiation damage. The findings here also suggest that the protective action of HSP70 is mediated by anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-DNA damage effects. The skin can be structurally classified into several layers, including the most apical layer, the epidermis, containing large numbers of keratinocytes, and a second layer, immediately under this, the dermis, which has a high fibroblast content (1.Rabe J.H. Mamelak A.J. McElgunn P.J. Morison W.L. Sauder D.N. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2006; 55: 1-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Skin provides a major interface between the environment and the body and is constantly exposed to an array of physical and chemical stressors. Therefore, in addition to intrinsic causes, harmful exogenous causes are involved in the process of skin damage. Among exogenous harmful agents, UV irradiation is the most relevant to skin damage (photo-damage). UV light can be separated, based on wavelength, into three categories: UVA (320–400 nm), UVB (290–320 nm), and UVC (100–290 nm). Of these, the cell-damaging effect of UVA is relatively weak, whereas most UVC is absorbed by the ozone layer (2.Svobodova A. Walterova D. Vostalova J. Biomed. Pap. Med. Fac. Univ. Palacky. Olomouc. Czech. Repub. 2006; 150: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, UVB seems to play the central role in photo-damage, such as clinical sunburn, hyperpigmentation, erythema, plaque-like thickening, loss of skin tone, deep furrowing, and fine wrinkle formation, all of which constitute both clinical and cosmetic problems. Furthermore, UVB irradiation induces the development of skin cancer (photo-carcinogenesis) (3.Matsumura Y. Ananthaswamy H.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 195: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). UVB-induced photo- damage and photo-carcinogenesis both involve epidermal damage (such as induction of apoptosis), immunosuppression, inflammation (activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines), and DNA damage (4.Gröne A. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2002; 88: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Because most UVB radiation is absorbed at the epidermis, keratinocytes become a major target of its deleterious effects. For example, the UVB-induced disruption of collagen and elastin (deep furrowing and fine wrinkle formation in the skin) involves inhibition of their synthesis in fibroblasts and stimulation of their degradation by matrix metalloproteinases and other proteases, both of which are triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes (4.Gröne A. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2002; 88: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 5.Fisher G.J. Wang Z.Q. Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Therefore, suppression of UVB-induced damage (apoptosis) of keratinocytes is beneficial for the prevention of photo-damage. However, because such protection may actually aid in the survival of DNA-damaged cells, resulting in promotion of photo-carcinogenesis, a mechanism that not only suppresses UVB-induced apoptosis but also UVB-induced DNA damage is important to establish protocols to prevent photo-damage without promoting photo-carcinogenesis. UVB irradiation damages the epidermis both directly and indirectly. For example, in addition to UVB-induced direct damage of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, UVB irradiation stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesCPDcyclobutane pyrimidine dimerDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochlorideGGAgeranylgeranylacetoneHSPheat shock proteinILinterleukinIκB-αan inhibitor of NF-κBMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1MIP-2macrophage inflammatory protein-2MPOmyeloperoxidaseMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideNF-κBnuclear factor kappa B8-OHdG8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosinePOBNα-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitroneRTreverse transcriptionTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling. which also damages these molecules by oxidization. In this way, direct absorption of UVB by DNA causes DNA damage through the formation of covalent linkages, resulting in products such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). On the other hand, UVB-produced ROS also damage DNA by producing damaged nucleotides such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (6.Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, it was reported that anti-oxidant molecules prevent UVB-induced epidermal DNA damage (7.Budiyanto A. Ahmed N.U. Wu A. Bito T. Nikaido O. Osawa T. Ueda M. Ichihashi M. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, mechanisms that protect the epidermis from both UVB and ROS are important to establish ways in which to suppress photo-damage efficiently. reactive oxygen species cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride geranylgeranylacetone heat shock protein interleukin an inhibitor of NF-κB monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-2 myeloperoxidase 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide nuclear factor kappa B 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone reverse transcription terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling. When cells are exposed to stressors, a number of so-called stress proteins are induced to confer protection against such stressors. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are representative of these stress proteins, and their cellular up-regulation of expression, especially that of HSP70, provides resistance given that HSPs re-fold or degrade denatured proteins produced by stressors such as ROS (8.Simon M.M.

Because stressor-induced tissue damage is involved in various diseases, HSPs and HSP inducers have received much attention for their therapeutic potential. It is known that various HSPs are constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and their expression, especially that of HSP70, is up-regulated by different stressors (10.Wilson N. McArdle A. Guerin D.

These previous results suggest that HSP70 expression suppresses UVB-induced epidermal damage, although no genetic evidence has been reported showing that overproduction of HSP70 prevents UVB-induced epidermal damage. The potential benefit of HSP70 inducers as medicines for UVB-related skin diseases and cosmetics was also supported by a number of previously reported observations. For example, HSP70 has an anti-inflammatory activity by means of its inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and a resulting suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression (23.Krappmann D.

We also recently found that artificial overexpression of HSP70 in mouse melanoma cells suppresses melanin production. 3T. Hoshino, M. Matsuda, Y. Yamashita, M. Takehara, M. Fukuya, K. Mineda, D. Maji, H. Ihn, Y. Funasaka, and T. Mizushima, unpublished data. Although we showed in that study that the UVB-induced production of melanin in the skin is suppressed in transgenic mice expressing HSP70, the anti-inflammatory and protective effects against DNA damage of HSP70 in UVB-irradiated skin have not been proved genetically. In this study, we examined the protective role of HSP70 against photo-damage by using transgenic mice expressing HSP70. The results obtained here suggest that expression of HSP70 protects the epidermis against UVB-induced damage via anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects and suppression of DNA damage. Based on these findings, we propose that non-toxic HSP70 inducers could be beneficial for use in cosmetics and medicines for the treatment of UVB-related skin diseases.

Transgenic mice expressing HSP70 and their wild-type counterparts (6–8 weeks old, male) were gifts from Drs. C. E. Angelidis and G. N. Pagoulatos (University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece) and were prepared as described previously (30.Tanaka K. Namba T. Arai Y. Fujimoto M. Adachi H. Sobue G. Takeuchi K. Nakai A. Mizushima T. J.

The experiments and procedures described here were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kumamoto University. Animals and cultured cells were exposed to UVB irradiation with a double bank of UVB lamps (peak emission at 312 nm, VL-215LM lamp, Vilber Lourmat). The UV energy was monitored by a radiometer sensor (UVX-31, UV Products). Animals were placed under deep anesthesia with chloral hydrate (250 mg/kg), and fur was removed with electric clippers prior to the irradiation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the skin was measured as described previously (30.Tanaka K. Namba T. Arai Y. Fujimoto M. Adachi H. Sobue G. Takeuchi K. Nakai A. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23240-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Animals were placed under deep ether anesthesia and killed. The skin was dissected, rinsed with cold saline, and cut into small pieces. Samples were homogenized in 50 mm phosphate buffer, freeze-thawed, and centrifuged. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford method (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). MPO activity was determined in 10 mm phosphate buffer with 0.5 mmo-dianisidine, 0.00005% (w/v) hydrogen peroxide, and 20 μg of protein. MPO activity was obtained from the slope of the reaction curve, and its specific activity was expressed as the number of hydrogen peroxide molecules converted per minute/mg of protein. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (32.Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol.

Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to 9% (HSP70 and actin) or 12% (IκB-α) polyacrylamide SDS gels and subjected to electrophoresis, after which the proteins were immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Total RNA was extracted from skin tissues using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples (2.5 μg of RNA) were reverse-transcribed using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized cDNA was used in real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Chromo 4 system, Bio-Rad) experiments using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and analyzed with Opticon Monitor software according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products and by inclusion of template- or reverse transcriptase-free controls. To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was used as an internal standard.

Skin samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin before being cut into 4-μm-thick sections, which were then deparaffinized and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. For histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin staining), sections were stained first with Mayer's hematoxylin and then with 1% eosin alcohol solution. Samples were mounted with malinol and inspected using a BX51 microscope (Olympus). For immunohistochemical analyses, sections were incubated with 0.1% (for 8-OHdG) or 0.3% (for CPDs and HSP70) hydrogen peroxide in methanol for removal of endogenous peroxidase. Sections were incubated with 0.125% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then with 1 n HCl for 30 min for DNA denaturation. Sections were blocked with 2.5% goat serum for 10 min, incubated for 12 h with antibody against HSP70 (1:200 dilution), 8-OHdG (1:100 dilution), or CPDs (1:500 dilution) in the presence of 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine was applied to the sections, which were then incubated with Mayer's hematoxylin (hematoxylin staining was omitted for 8-OHdG). Samples were mounted with malinol and inspected using a BX51 microscope (Olympus). The intensity of 8-OHdG staining in the epidermis was measured by LuminaVision (Mitani). For TUNEL assay, sections were incubated first with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, then with terminal nucleotidyltransferase and biotin-14-ATP for 1 h at 37 °C, and finally with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin and DAPI (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. Samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using a BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus). PAM212 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfection of PAM212 cells with pcDNA3.1 containing the hsp70 gene (33.Fujimoto M. Takaki E. Hayashi T. Kitaura Y. Tanaka Y. Inouye S. Nakai A. J. Biol.

The stable transfectants expressing HSP70 were selected by immunoblotting and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Positive clones were maintained in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Cell viability was determined by the MTT method as previously described (34.Namba T. Hoshino T. Tanaka K. Tsutsumi S. Ishihara T. Mima S. Suzuki K. Ogawa S. Mizushima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 860-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the measurements of caspase-3-like activity and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (for measurement of apoptotic cells in sub-G1) were performed as described previously (34.Namba T. Hoshino T. Tanaka K. Tsutsumi S. Ishihara T. Mima S. Suzuki K. Ogawa S. Mizushima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 860-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on 8-well Lab-Tek II Chamber slides (Nunc). They were then fixed in methanol for 20 min after UVB irradiation. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, treated in a microwave oven with 0.01 m citric acid buffer for antigen activation, and then treated with 1 n HCl for 20 min for DNA denaturation. Cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for 10 min, incubated for 2 h with antibody against 8-OHdG (1:10 dilution) or CPDs (1:2000 dilution) in the presence of 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and finally incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G. Cells were simultaneously stained with DAPI (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. Samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected with the aid of a BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus). The fluorescence intensity of 8-OHdG or CPD staining was measured by using LuminaVision. In vivo ESR analysis was performed as described (35.Ishihara T. Tanaka K. Tasaka Y. Namba T. Suzuki J. Ishihara T. Okamoto S. Hibi T. Takenaga M. Igarashi R. Sato K. Mizushima Y. Mizushima T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Immediately after UVB exposure, animals were placed under deep anesthesia with chloral hydrate (250 mg/kg) and injected with POBN (a spin trap reagent) (36.Sato K. Kadiiska M.B. Ghio A.J. Corbett J.

After evaporating the sample, ESR spectra were immediately recorded at room temperature using a quartz flat cell (160 μl) in a JES-TE200 spectrometer (JEOL). The operating conditions of the ESR apparatus were: 9.43 GHz, field 335.2 ± 5 milliteslas, 40-milliwatt microwave power, 100-kHz modulation frequency, 0.25-field modulation width, 0.3-s time count, and sweep time of 2 min. All values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Two-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test was used to evaluate differences between more than three groups. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. Overexpression of HSP70 in the transgenic mice that we used in this study has been shown in various organs (9.Morimoto R.I.

Transgenic mice expressing HSP70 and wild-type mice were irradiated or not with 180 mJ/cm2 UVB. The dorsal skin was removed 24 h after completion of the irradiation and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1(A and B), the level of HSP70 was significantly higher in transgenic mice than in wild-type mice in both the presence and absence of UVB irradiation. However, under these conditions, UVB irradiation did not up-regulate the expression of HSP70 in either type of mice (Fig. 1, A and B), a finding that differs from previous reports (20.Kwon S.B. Young C. Kim D.S. Choi H.O. Kim K.H. Chung J.H. Eun H.C. Park K.C. Oh C.K. Seo J.S. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2002; 28: 144-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although we examined the effect of UVB on expression of HSP70 under various conditions (various doses of UVB and time course of the induction periods), we could not detect the UVB-dependent up-regulation of expression of HSP70 under any conditions by immunoblotting analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). We consider that this is due to the UVB-dependent increase in total amount of proteins (we applied the same amount of proteins in each lane in immunoblotting analysis). Supporting this notion, immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody against HSP70 demonstrated that the expression of HSP70 was induced by UVB irradiation at the skin (the top panels in supplemental Fig. S2). Immunohistochemical analysis also demonstrated that the expression of HSP70 is higher in the epidermis than in the dermis, as described previously (11.Morris S.D. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 27: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and that expression in the epidermis is further heightened in transgenic mice (Fig. 1C). The results in Fig. 1 suggest that these transgenic mice could be useful for examining the protective role of HSP70 against UVB-induced epidermal damage. Histological observations revealed extensive infiltration of leukocytes and epidermal disruption in skin sections prepared from UVB-irradiated wild-type mice, whereas the extent of cutaneous damage was not so apparent in transgenic mice expressing HSP70 (Fig. 2A).

However, a rapidly growing number of membrane-associated proteins (including cytoskeletal proteins, kinases, GTP-binding proteins, and their effectors) bind lipids through less structured regions. Here, we describe the development and testing of a simple computer search program that identifies unstructured potential membrane-binding sites. Initially, we found that both basic and hydrophobic amino acids, irrespective of sequence, contribute to the binding to acidic phospholipid vesicles of synthetic peptides that correspond to the putative membrane-binding domains of Acanthamoeba class I myosins. Based on these results, we modified a hydrophobicity scale giving Arg- and Lys-positive, rather than negative, values. Using this basic and hydrophobic scale with a standard search algorithm, we successfully identified previously determined unstructured membrane-binding sites in all 16 proteins tested. Importantly, basic and hydrophobic searches identified previously unknown potential membrane-binding sites in class I myosins, PAKs and CARMIL (capping protein, Arp2/3, myosin I linker; a membrane-associated cytoskeletal scaffold protein), and synthetic peptides and protein domains containing these newly identified sites bound to acidic phospholipids in vitro.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in characterizing protein domains, such as PH, FERM, C2, and ENTH, that are responsible for specific binding to membrane lipids (for review, see Ref. 1.Lemmon M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). These domains have highly defined tertiary structures comprising α-helices, β-sheets and loops, and there are multiple programs for recognizing them in protein sequences. However, a growing number of membrane-binding proteins, including cytoskeletal proteins (2.Niggli V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 604-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), GTP-binding proteins (e.g. Rit), and GTP-binding protein effectors (e.g. some PAKs) (see references below), do not fit within these categories and bind membrane lipids through much less structured regions. Here, we describe the development and testing of a simple computer search program that identifies such potential membrane-binding sites. This novel search program evolved from our previous effort (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Prompted by the report (11.Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) that several proteins bind to acidic phospholipids through a basic-hydrophobic-basic (BHB) region consisting of two small clusters of basic amino acids separated by hydrophobic residues, we identified, by visual inspection, a 13-residue BHB sequence, KVKPFLYVLKRR, within the basic region of the AMIC heavy chain (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide with this sequence inhibited the binding of AMIC to acidic phospholipid vesicles with an IC50 of 16 μm (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The relative IC50 values of synthetic peptides with the sequences of BHB segments in similar positions in the heavy chains of the two other Acanthamoeba class I myosins correlated with the localization of the myosins in either membranes (low IC50 values) or cytoplasm (high IC50 values) in the amoebae (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported in this paper, we first confirmed and extended the previous results by measuring directly the binding affinities for acidic phospholipids of the three Acanthamoeba myosin I peptides and one Dictyostelium myosin I peptide previously studied, peptides from two additional Dictyostelium class I myosins, and mutations of these peptides. We found that the basic and hydrophobic amino acid composition of the peptides, but not the sequence of the residues, was the determining factor for binding affinity. We then developed a computer search program for identifying protein regions enriched in basic and hydrophobic amino acids by changing the values for arginine and lysine from negative to positive in the Wimley and White (12.Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) hydrophobicity scale. This new basic and hydrophobic (BH) scale, which successfully identified the known membrane-binding sites in 16 proteins, provides a useful method for rapidly identifying potential membrane-binding sites. PS and PC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Large unilamellar lipid vesicles containing either 50% PS and 50% PC, or 5% PIP2, 25% PS, and 70% PC were prepared by repeated passages through an extruder fitted with two 100-mm membrane filters and repeated freezing and thawing cycles, as described previously (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Peptides with an N-terminal dansyl group were synthesized by EZBiolab (Carmel, IN). Peptide purity was higher than 95%, and molecular mass was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Peptides, final concentration 1 μm, were mixed with varied concentrations of phospholipid vesicles in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The amount of bound peptide was determined by the increase in the fluorescence intensity of the dansyl group (λex, 335 nm; λem, 515 nm). K50 for total lipid is the concentration of total phospholipid that resulted in 50% of the maximum increase in fluorescence. K50 for accessible PS is the concentration of PS on the outer bilayer required for a 50% increase in fluorescence. The T1, T2, and T4 fragments of AMIC heavy chain (AAC98089) with N-terminal FLAG were expressed in SF9 insect cells, with or without coexpression of light chain, and purified by anti-FLAG-affinity chromatography as described previously (13.Liu X. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24886-24892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Binding of the expressed proteins to 50% PS vesicles was performed as described (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the expressed proteins were mixed with various concentrations of vesicles in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 40 min at 20 °C. Aliquots were removed before and after centrifugation, and the myosin concentrations determined by measuring K+-ATPase activity. The CAH3 fragment of mouse CARMIL (Q6EDY6) corresponding to residues 961–1085 of the full-length protein, with N-terminal GFP and C-terminal His tags, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by absorption on nickel resin as described by Fujiwara et al. (14.Fujiwara, I., Remmert, K., Hammer, J. A., 3rd (11 19, 2009) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M109.031203Google Scholar). In brief, bacteria from a 150-ml expression culture were lysed by two rounds in a French press at 1,300 pounds per square inch in 10 ml of buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline buffer supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.4%, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed for 2 h with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); the resin was washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 300 mm NaCl; and the green GFP-mouse CAH3 (CARMIL homology 3 domain) fusion protein was eluted with 3 ml of buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. The concentration of monomeric GFP-mouse CAH3 was determined by Bradford assay. The purified monomeric GFP-mouse CAH3 fragment (0.6 μm) was then mixed with varied concentrations of 50% PS vesicles in the same buffer used for binding synthetic peptides and centrifuged as described above for the peptide binding assay. Aliquots were removed before and after centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 40 min at 20 °C, and the amount of unbound CAH3 fragment was determined by measuring GFP fluorescence (λex, 490 nm; λem, 510 nm). As discussed briefly in “Results,” analyses were initially performed on the EMBOSS Pepinfo Web site using one of the value scales shown in Table 2. Beginning with the first residue in the protein sequence, the program averages the values in Table 2 for each amino acid in a segment of the selected length (the window size) and gives that value as the score for the middle residue in the segment (see Ref. 15.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16895) Google Scholar). Thus, for a window of 19, the first score, which is the average of the values for residues 1–19, is given to residue 10. The program then averages the values for residues 2–20 and gives that score to residue 11, continuing in this manner until the end of the sequence with the last residue scored being 10 residues from the C terminus. Smaller windows must be used to score residues closer to the N and C termini. After BH search was developed, the EMBOSS program was modified to be more convenient for this application (http://helixweb.nih.gov/bhsearch).TABLE 2Scales used for computer searchesAmino acidK&DaReferences are as follows: K&D, Kyte and Doolittle (15); OMH, Sweet and Eisenberg (19); Consensus (19); W&W, Wimley and White (12); and BH (this paper; W&W scale with Lys and Arg values changed to 2; see “Results”).OMHConsensusW&WBHAla1.8−0.40.62−0.17−0.17Cys2.50.170.290.240.24Asp−3.5−1.31−0.9−1.23−1.23Glu−3.5−1.22−0.74−2.02−2.02Phe2.81.921.191.131.13Gal−0.4−0.670.48−0.01−0.01His−3.2−0.64−0.4−0.17−0.17Ile4.51.251.380.310.31Lys−3.9−0.67−1.5−0.992.00Leu3.81.221.060.560.56Met1.91.020.640.230.23Asn−3.5−0.92−0.78−0.42−0.42Pro−1.6−0.490.12−0.45−0.45Gln−3.5−0.91−0.85−0.58−0.58Arg−4.5−0.59−2.53−0.812.00Ser−0.8−0.55−0.18−0.13−0.13Thr−0.7−0.28−0.05−0.14−0.14Val4.20.911.08−0.07−0.07Trp−0.90.50.811.851.85Tyr−1.31.670.260.940.94a References are as follows: K&D, Kyte and Doolittle (15.Kyte J.

Open table in a new tab The fluorescence of an N-dansyl-peptide with the sequence of the previously identified BHB segment within the basic region of the AMIC heavy chain tail increased ∼10-fold when exposed to unilamellar vesicles composed of 50% PS and 50% PC (Fig. 1A). There was no significant increase in fluorescence when the peptide was exposed to vesicles composed of 100% PC (Fig. 1A) or when dansyl-l-glutamine was exposed to 50% PS or 100% PC vesicles (data not shown). These results are consistent with the increase in fluorescence of the dansyl-AMIC(tail) peptide being due to binding of the peptide to the acidic phospholipid vesicles. The K50 for binding of the dansyl-AMIC(tail) peptide to 50% PS vesicles was 13 μm for total lipid or 3.3 μm for accessible PS (Fig. 1B and Table 1A). These values are similar to the K50 of 4 μm for total lipid and 1.3 μm for accessible PS obtained previously (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

In the peptide-binding studies described in this paper, we used only vesicles consisting of 50% PS and 50% PC and will hereafter cite only the K50 values for total lipid; the K50 value for accessible PS is always 25% of the K50 value for total lipid.TABLE 1Affinities of binding of dansyl-peptides to acidic phospholipid vesiclesProtein sourcePeptide sequenceK50Total lipidAccessible PSμmA AMIA(tail)840KKKVATHVLDKK851≥209≥52 AMIB(tail)785RKKKSGQVVYNLKRR799205 AMIC(tail)802KKVKPFLYVLKRR814133.3 AMIC(scramble)VKPKFRLKYRVKL194.8 DMIB(tail)801KKKVLVHTLIRR812338.3 DMIB(hydro/Ala)KKKAAAHTAARR≥200≥50 DMIB(basic/Ala)AAAVLVHTLIAA>500>125 DMIC(tail)849KKNLATYLLDRR860≥113≥28 DMID(tail)802RKKRPWIYVQKRR81482B AMIC(head)616YRQVYDKFFYRYR628225.5 AMIC(neck)699RKTAMRKYYYEVKK7124310.8 CARMIL22RKIKISVKKKVK33143.5 CARMIL1068RRSGFLNLIKSR1079184.5 Open table in a new tab The K50 values for binding of the dansyl-peptides of the corresponding regions of the heavy chains of AMIA, AMIB, and DMID to 50% PS vesicles (Table 1A) were proportional to the previously determined (3.Brzeska H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), bound only weakly in the direct binding assay (Table 1). The K50 values of the dansyl-peptides of the BHB regions of the three Acanthamoeba myosins paralleled their preferred membrane (AMIB, AMIC) or cytoplasmic (AMIA) localization in cells (7.Baines I.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14981-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the data in Table 1 for the corresponding dansyl-peptides suggest that DMID and DMIB may have higher affinities for membranes than DMIC. To test the relative importance of the basic and hydrophobic amino acids for binding of the dansyl-peptides to acidic phospholipids, we measured the binding of the DMIB(tail) peptide with Ala substituted for either all of the hydrophobic or all of the basic amino acids. Both substitutions substantially weakened binding. Basic amino acids seemed more important than the hydrophobic residues; compare the K50 values of DMIB(hydro/Ala), DMIB(basic/Ala) and DMIB(tail) in Table 1A. These results are similar to those obtained previously for the ability of AMIC(tail) peptide to inhibit binding of AMIC (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although these peptides were originally tested as potential membrane-binding sites because of the basic-hydrophobic-basic patterns of their sequences, the affinity of the AMIC(tail) peptide was almost unchanged when the sequence was rearranged so that the hydrophobic and basic residues were in alternating positions, AMIC(scramble) (Table 1A). Thus, the composition, and not the sequence, of the residues is the principal determinant for peptide binding. These results also argue that the hydrophobic residues do not form a loop that inserts deeply into the membrane bilayer, but rather that the side chains of the hydrophobic residues interact individually at the interface between the polar head groups and the acyl chains of the phospholipids. More than 20 different amino acid hydrophobicity scales have been developed for searching protein sequences for patches of hydrophobic amino acids; see, for example, the ExPASy ProtScale Web site and the EMBOSS Pepinfo Web site. The hydrophobicity scales are useful for identifying protein regions that may penetrate deeply into the membrane but have limited application for identification of potential membrane surface-binding sites because the hydrophobicity scales do not consider the contribution of basic residues, which, as discussed in the preceding section, are important for protein binding to negatively charged regions in phospholipid vesicles and cell membranes. To design a new search program that would account for the contribution of both basic and hydrophobic amino acids to membrane binding, we chose to start with the Wimley and White (W&W) hydrophobicity scale (12.Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) because it was developed specifically for application to proteins at membrane interfaces by determination of the free energy of transfer of model peptides from a lipid bilayer to water. However, because neutral lipid bilayers were used in those experiments (appropriately for the determination of hydrophobicity uninfluenced by electrostatic interactions), the hydrophilic positive charges of Lys and Arg hindered, rather than contributed to, lipid binding. Therefore, based on our data that Lys and Arg can be at least as important as hydrophobic amino acids for binding of peptides to negatively charged lipid vesicles (Table 1A), we modified the W&W scale by giving Lys and Arg values of +2, which is approximately equal to the value for the most hydrophobic amino acid, Trp, and equal but opposite to the value for the least hydrophobic amino acid, Glu, in the W&W scale. We first compared the results of the EMBOSS Pepinfo analysis of AMIC heavy chain using our BH scale to the results using the four hydrophobicity scales in Table 2, with a window of 19 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The BH search showed three distinct peaks rising above a BH score of 0.6 (Fig. 2); such clearly defined peaks were not identified by the searches based on the four hydrophobicity scales in Table 2 (Fig. 2). The most C-terminal of these peaks, with peak residue at Leu811, was expected because we had shown that the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues Lys802-Arg814 binds to acidic phospholipid vesicles (Table 1A and Ref. 3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The two other peak regions in Fig. 2, with peak residues Val619 and Arg699, are in the head and neck domains of the AMIC heavy chain (see Fig. 4A), respectively, neither of which was known to bind to membranes. Interestingly, the potential membrane-binding site in the neck, residues Lys690-Leu718, overlaps the IQ domain, residues Ile693-Lys707, to which the AMIC calmodulin-like light chain binds (20.Wang Z.Y. Sakai J. Matsudaira P.T. Baines I.C. Sellers J.R. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Korn E.D. J. Muscle Res.

The results of the BH plots for the three Acanthamoeba myosin I heavy chains are consistent with the predominantly membrane localizations of AMIB and AMIC and the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of AMIA (7.Baines I.C.

To assess the validity of the identification of the segments in the head and neck regions of AMIC as potential membrane-binding sites, we first determined the affinity for acidic phospholipid vesicles of synthetic dansyl-peptides corresponding to sequences from those regions. Both the AMIC(head) and AMIC(neck) peptides had relatively low K50 values (Table 1B), as expected given their high content of basic and hydrophobic amino acids, although higher than the K50 of the AMIC(tail) peptide (Table 1A). To extend the analysis to the protein level, we compared the binding to acidic phospholipid vesicles of three constructs of AMIC with truncated heavy chains (Fig. 4A) (13.Liu X. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24886-24892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21.Ishikawa T. Cheng N. Liu X. Korn E.D. Steven A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

T4 was expressed with the myosin light chain (20.Wang Z.Y. Sakai J. Matsudaira P.T. Baines I.C. Sellers J.R. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Korn E.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that binds to the neck domain, and T2 was expressed both with and without the myosin light chain. As shown previously (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), T4 bound to 50% PS vesicles with a K50 of ≤5 μm (Fig. 4B), similar to the K50 for the dansyl- AMIC(tail) peptide (Table 1A). T2, with or without light chain, also bound to the vesicles, but significantly less well, with a K50 of ∼110 μm (Fig. 4B), similar to the affinity of the dansyl-AMIC(neck) peptide (Table 1B). Thus, the light chain does not block the phospholipid-binding site. Although the neck region bound only weakly to the PS vesicles, this weak binding might be sufficient to contribute to the binding of full-length AMIC by acting cooperatively with the stronger binding site in the tail. T1 bound with very much lower affinity, K50 > 500 μm (Fig. 4B), and much more weakly than the dansyl-AMIC(head) peptide (Table 1B), most likely because the affinity of the potential phospholipid-binding site in the head was affected by the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. Very similar results were obtained for binding of T4, T2, and T1 to 5% PIP2 and 25% PS vesicles (which have the same net negative charge as 50% PS vesicles); the K50 values were ≤5 μm for T4, ∼94 μm for T2, with and without light chain, and >500 μm for T1 (Fig. 4C). Thus, and consistent with previous results (3.Brzeska H. Hwang K.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32014-32023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), there appears to be no phospholipid specificity for binding. It is noteworthy that this is the first piece of evidence that a region in the neck domain of an amoeba class I myosin may contribute to its association with membranes. Although the data for the Acanthamoeba class I myosins were indicative of the potential usefulness of BH search for other proteins, it was necessary to test the ability of BH search to identify known unstructured binding sites in membrane-associated proteins. We tested 16 proteins (Table 3) in which one or more such membrane-binding sites have been defined. We used a window of 19 (see “Experimental Procedures”), except for two proteins for which a window of 11 was used: cortexillin, where the lipid-binding site is extremely C-terminal, and gelsolin, where the lipid-binding site(s) consists of multiple regions.TABLE 3Published lipid-binding regions found by BH searchProtein, source (accession no.)Published binding sites (in boldface)aWhen the amino acid numbers cited in paper and GenBa"

Behavioral studies showed greatly reduced thermal inflammatory pain perception in AQP1(-/-) mice evoked by bradykinin, prostaglandin E(2), and capsaicin as well as reduced cold pain perception. Patch clamp of freshly isolated DRG neurons showed reduced action potential firing in response to current injections. Single action potentials after pulse current injections showed reduced maximum inward current, suggesting impaired Na(v)1.8 Na(+) function. Whole-cell Na(v)1.8 Na(+) currents in Na(v)1.8-expressing ND7-23 cells showed slowed frequency-dependent inactivation after AQP1 transfection. Immunoprecipitation studies showed AQP1- Na(v)1.8 Na(+) interaction, which was verified in live cells by single-particle tracking of quantum dot-labeled AQP1. Our results implicate the involvement of AQP1 in DRG neurons for the perception of inflammatory thermal pain and cold pain, whose molecular basis is accounted for, in part, by reduced Na(v)1.8-dependent membrane Na(+) current. AQP1 is, thus, a novel target for pain management."
https://openalex.org/W2025619959,"Mammalian cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxin reductases are essential selenocysteine-containing enzymes that control thioredoxin functions. Thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TGR) is a third member of this enzyme family. It has an additional glutaredoxin domain and shows highest expression in testes. Herein, we found that human and several other mammalian TGR genes lack any AUG codons that could function in translation initiation. Although mouse and rat TGRs have such codons, we detected protein sequences upstream of them by immunoblot assays and direct proteomic analyses. Further gene engineering and expression analyses demonstrated that a CUG codon, located upstream of the sequences previously thought to initiate translation, is the actual start codon in mouse TGR. The use of this codon relies on the Kozak consensus sequence and ribosome-scanning mechanism. However, CUG serves as an inefficient start codon that allows downstream initiation, thus generating two isoforms of the enzyme in vivo and in vitro. The use of CUG evolved in mammalian TGRs, and in some of these organisms, GUG is used instead. The newly discovered longer TGR form shows cytosolic localization in cultured cells and is expressed in spermatids in mouse testes. This study shows that CUG codon is used as an inefficient start codon to generate protein isoforms in mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2032133188,"Mitochondrial mRNA editing in trypanosomatid parasites involves several multiprotein assemblies, including three very similar complexes that contain the key enzymatic editing activities and sediment at ~20S on glycerol gradients. These ~20S editosomes have a common set of 12 proteins, including enzymes for uridylyl (U) removal and addition, 2 RNA ligases, 2 proteins with RNase III-like domains, and 6 proteins with predicted oligonucleotide binding (OB) folds. In addition, each of the 3 distinct ~20S editosomes contains a different RNase III-type endonuclease, 1 of 3 related proteins and, in one case, an additional exonuclease. Here we present a protein-protein interaction map that was obtained through a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and subcomplex reconstitution with recombinant protein. This map interlinks ten of the proteins and in several cases localizes the protein region mediating the interaction, which often includes the predicted OB-fold domain. The results indicate that the OB-fold proteins form an extensive protein-protein interaction network that connects the two trimeric subcomplexes that catalyze U removal or addition and RNA ligation. One of these proteins, KREPA6, interacts with the OB-fold zinc finger protein in each subcomplex that interconnects their two catalytic proteins. Another OB-fold protein, KREPA3, appears to link to the putative endonuclease subcomplex. These results reveal a physical organization that underlies the coordination of the various catalytic and substrate binding activities within the ~20S editosomes during the editing process."
https://openalex.org/W2033164539,"Calreticulin is an abundant endoplasmic reticulum resident protein that fulfills at least two basic functions. Firstly, due to its ability to bind monoglucosylated high mannose oligosaccharides, calreticulin is a central component of the folding quality control system of glycoproteins. On the other hand, thanks to its capacity to bind high amounts of calcium, calreticulin is one of the main calcium buffers in the endoplasmic reticulum. This last activity resides on a highly negatively charged domain located at the C terminus. Interestingly, this domain has been proposed to regulate the intracellular localization of calreticulin. Structural information for this domain is currently scarce. Here we address this issue by employing a combination of biophysical techniques and molecular dynamics simulation. We found that calreticulin C-terminal domain at low calcium concentration displays a disordered structure, whereas calcium addition induces a more rigid and compact conformation. Remarkably, this change develops when calcium concentration varies within a range similar to that taking place in the endoplasmic reticulum upon physiological fluctuations. In addition, a much higher calcium concentration is necessary to attain similar responses in a peptide displaying a randomized sequence of calreticulin C-terminal domain, illustrating the sequence specificity of this effect. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that this ordering effect is a consequence of the ability of calcium to bring into close proximity residues that lie apart in the primary structure. These results place calreticulin in a new setting in which the protein behaves not only as a calcium-binding protein but as a finely tuned calcium sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2041486230,"The gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes injects a beta-NAD(+) glycohydrolase (SPN) into the cytosol of an infected host cell using the cytolysin-mediated translocation pathway. In this compartment, SPN accelerates the death of the host cell by an unknown mechanism that may involve its beta-NAD(+)-dependent enzyme activities. SPN has been reported to possess the unique characteristic of not only catalyzing hydrolysis of beta-NAD(+), but also carrying out ADP-ribosyl cyclase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities, making SPN the only beta-NAD(+) glycohydrolase that can catalyze all of these reactions. With the long term goal of understanding how these activities may contribute to pathogenesis, we have further characterized the enzymatic activity of SPN using highly purified recombinant protein. Kinetic studies of the multiple activities of SPN revealed that SPN possessed only beta-NAD(+) hydrolytic activity and lacked detectable ADP-ribosyl cyclase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Similarly, SPN was unable to catalyze cyclic ADPR hydrolysis, and could not catalyze methanolysis or transglycosidation. Kinetic analysis of product inhibition by recombinant SPN demonstrated an ordered uni-bi mechanism, with ADP-ribose being released as a second product. SPN was unaffected by product inhibition using nicotinamide, suggesting that this moiety contributes little to the binding energy of the substrate. Upon transformation, SPN was toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas a glycohydrolase-inactive SPN allowed for viability. Taken together, these data suggest that SPN functions exclusively as a strict beta-NAD(+) glycohydrolase during pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2006583267,"Thiolactomycin (TLM), a natural product thiolactone antibiotic produced by species of Nocardia and Streptomyces, is an inhibitor of the beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) enzymes in the bacterial fatty acid synthase pathway. Using enzyme kinetics and direct binding studies, TLM has been shown to bind preferentially to the acyl-enzyme intermediates of the KASI and KASII enzymes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli. These studies, which utilized acyl-enzyme mimics in which the active site cysteine was replaced by a glutamine, also revealed that TLM is a slow onset inhibitor of the KASI enzymes KasA and ecFabB but not of the KASII enzymes KasB and ecFabF. The differential affinity of TLM for the acyl-KAS enzymes is proposed to result from structural change involving the movement of helices alpha5 and alpha6 that prepare the enzyme to bind malonyl-AcpM or TLM and that is initiated by formation of hydrogen bonds between the acyl-enzyme thioester and the oxyanion hole. The finding that TLM is a slow onset inhibitor of ecFabB supports the proposal that the long residence time of TLM on the ecFabB homologues in Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumonia is an important factor for the in vivo antibacterial activity of TLM against these two organisms despite the fact that the in vitro MIC values are only 100-200 microg/ml. The mechanistic data on the interaction of TLM with KasA will provide an important foundation for the rational development of high affinity KasA inhibitors based on the thiolactone skeleton."

The prototypical G betagamma effector G protein-activated K(+) channel (GIRK; Kir3) physically interacts with G betagamma but also with G alpha(i/o). Whether and how G alpha(i/o) subunits regulate GIRK in vivo is unclear. We studied triple interactions among GIRK subunits 1 and 2, G alpha(i3) and G betagamma. We used in vitro protein interaction assays and in vivo intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer (i-FRET) between fluorophores attached to N and C termini of either GIRK1 or GIRK2 subunit. We demonstrate, for the first time, that G betagamma and G alpha(i3) distinctly and interdependently alter the conformational states of the heterotetrameric GIRK1/2 channel. Biochemical experiments show that G betagamma greatly enhances the binding of GIRK1 subunit to G alpha(i3)(GDP) and, unexpectedly, to G alpha(i3)(GTP). i-FRET showed that both G alpha(i3) and G betagamma induced distinct conformational changes in GIRK1 and GIRK2. Moreover, GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits assumed unique, distinct conformations when coexpressed with a ""constitutively active"" G alpha(i3) mutant and G betagamma together. These conformations differ from those assumed by GIRK1 or GIRK2 after separate coexpression of either G alpha(i3) or G betagamma. Both biochemical and i-FRET data suggest that GIRK acts as the nucleator of the GIRK-G alpha-G betagamma signaling complex and mediates allosteric interactions between G alpha(i)(GTP) and G betagamma. Our findings imply that G alpha(i/o) and the G alpha(i) betagamma heterotrimer can regulate a G betagamma effector both before and after activation by neurotransmitters."

https://openalex.org/W1976371008,"Small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) become activated when GDP is replaced by GTP at the highly conserved nucleotide binding site. This process is intrinsically very slow in most GTPases but is significantly accelerated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Nucleotide exchange in small GTPases has been widely studied using spectroscopy with fluorescently tagged nucleotides. However, this method suffers from effects of the bulky fluorescent moiety covalently attached to the nucleotide. Here, we have used a newly developed real-time NMR-based assay to monitor small GTPase RhoA nucleotide exchange by probing the RhoA conformation. We compared RhoA nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP and GTP analogues in the absence and presence of the catalytic DH-PH domain of PDZ-RhoGEF (DH-PH(PRG)). Using the non-hydrolyzable analogue guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), which we found to be a reliable mimic of GTP, we obtained an intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate of 5.5 x 10(-4) min(-1). This reaction is markedly accelerated to 1179 x 10(-4) min(-1) in the presence of DH-PH(PRG) at a ratio of 1:8,000 relative to RhoA. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the importance of Arg-868 near a conserved region (CR3) of the Dbl homology (DH) domain and revealed that Glu-741 in CR1 is critical for full activity of DH-PH(PRG), together suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of PDZ-RhoGEF is similar to Tiam1. Mutation of the single RhoA (E97A) residue that contacts the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain rendered the mutant 10-fold less sensitive to the activity of DH-PH(PRG). Interestingly, this mutation does not affect RhoA activation by leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), indicating that the PH domains of these two homologous GEFs may play different roles."
https://openalex.org/W2020552116,"Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), the major phospholipid of animal membranes, is generated by its remodeling and de novo synthesis. Overexpression of the remodeling enzyme, LPCAT1 (acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase) in epithelia decreased de novo PtdCho synthesis without significantly altering cellular PtdCho mass. Overexpression of LPCAT1 increased degradation of CPT1 (cholinephosphotransferase), a resident Golgi enzyme that catalyzes the terminal step for de novo PtdCho synthesis. CPT1 degradation involved its multiubiquitination and processing via the lysosomal pathway. CPT1 mutants harboring arginine substitutions at multiple carboxyl-terminal lysines exhibited proteolytic resistance to effects of LPCAT1 overexpression in cells and restored de novo PtdCho synthesis. Thus, cross-talk between phospholipid remodeling and de novo pathways involves ubiquitin-lysosomal processing of a key molecular target that mechanistically provides homeostatic control of cellular PtdCho content.

With the exception of hepatic tissues, where PtdCho synthesis may involve sequential N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, PtdCho biosynthesis in mammalian cells occurs primarily via the CDP-choline or de novo pathway. This pathway requires three enzymes: choline kinase (CK) (EC 2.7.1.32), which catalyzes the first committed step; CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) (EC 2.7.7.15), the penultimate enzyme; and cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) (EC 2.7.8.2), which catalyzes the terminal reaction within the CDP-choline pathway generating PtdCho (1.Jackowski S. Fagone P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Of these enzymes, CCT is rate-limiting and rate-regulatory. CCT is an amphitrophic enzyme and thus can switch between an inactive soluble or cytoplasmic form and an active, membrane-bound species within the nucleus. There are four isoforms of CCT, and deficiency of a major species, CCTα, is associated with impaired cell growth, apoptosis, and embryonic lethality (1.Jackowski S. Fagone P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 853-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CK may also be critical for embryonic development, and genomic deletion of the CK gene results in bone deformities and muscular dystrophy (2.Sher R.B. Aoyama C. Huebsch K.A. Ji S. Kerner J. Yang Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1456-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CPT (CPT1) catalyzes the transfer of the phosphocholine moiety from CDP-choline to diacylglycerol. A second human choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (CEPT1) that displays dual specificity using either CDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine as substrates with significant primary sequence identity to CPT1 may also regulate PtdCho availability (4.Henneberry A.L. Wistow G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29808-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CPT1 exists in the Golgi, whereas CEPT1 is detected within the endoplasmic reticulum (5.Henneberry A.L. Wright M.M. McMaster C.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3148-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The substrate requirements of CPT1 and CEPT1 for diacylglycerol would impact the molecular species profile of the newly synthesized PtdCho. Genetic inactivation of CPT genes results in reduced phospholipid synthesis, and its inhibition by isoprenoids and ceramides triggers apoptosis, underscoring CPT as a key regulator of PtdCho synthesis (6.McMaster C.R.

In addition to the CDP-choline pathway, the generation of PtdCho in tissues involves its remodeling. In the lung, this remodeling mechanism constitutes a major route for generation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPtdCho), the major component of surfactant that lowers alveolar surface tension (9.den Breejen J.N. Batenburg J.J. van Golde L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this pathway, a phospholipase A2 deacylates PtdCho at the sn-2-position of the glycerol backbone, typically releasing an unsaturated fatty acid. The resultant lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPtdCho) is then reacylated with a saturated fatty acid (typically 16:0 or 14:0), generating surfactant DPPtdCho. The identity of the deacylating phospholipase A2 is a calcium-independent, acid pH-optimal lysosomal enzyme (aiPLA2) (10.Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L238-L243PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the enzyme that catalyzes the reacylation step remained elusive, but it recently was shown to be an LPCAT1 (acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase) (11.Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12.Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T.

A conserved HX4D motif is necessary for enzymatic activity (13.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and LPCAT1 expression increases with lung development and in response to glucocorticoids (11.Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). LPCAT1 mRNA levels have also been shown to be regulated by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in cultured rat type II cells (11.Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The biochemical and molecular regulation of LPCAT1 and its role in PtdCho synthesis in vivo are largely unknown. Lung epithelia must tightly balance levels of surfactant (DPPtdCho) lipid secreted into airways versus nonsurfactant PtdCho destined for membranes. Although the de novo pathway generates both nonsurfactant PtdCho and DPPtdCho, the remodeling pathway would be predicted to synthesize primarily surfactant. Thus, it is possible that cross-talk between these pathways exists to modify pulmonary lipid composition, depending on cellular needs. In other systems, such interdependency exists between lipogenic pathways. For example, rates of PtdCho synthesis are coupled to its degradation (14.Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Tijburg L.B. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16.Tercé F. Record M. Tronchère H. Ribbes G. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CCT in COS cells increases PtdCho mass only modestly yet triggers a 3-fold increase in its degradation rate (14.Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This coupling between biosynthetic and degradative pathways indicates close regulation of PtdCho metabolism, perhaps as a means to avoid cellular lipotoxicity. Further, overexpression of PEMT2 (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-2) in hepatoma cells results in feedback inhibition of CCT by reducing its transcriptional rate without altering PtdCho content (17.Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These latter data suggest interdependency between the N-methylation and CDP-choline pathways for PtdCho biosynthesis. The relationship between the remodeling and de novo pathways for PtdCho synthesis has not been investigated. Herein, we hypothesized that the remodeling pathway regulates the CDP-choline pathway to maintain PtdCho balance. Overexpression of the remodeling enzyme, LPCAT1, in lung epithelia significantly decreased de novo PtdCho synthesis without altering cellular PtdCho levels. LPCAT1 expression increased degradation of the final enzyme within the CDP-choline pathway, CPT1, a multiubiquitinated enzyme, through its lysosomal elimination. CPT mutants harboring arginine substitutions at multiple putative ubiquitination acceptor sites conferred proteolytic resistance to inhibitory effects of LPCAT1 expression in cells. The data provide new insight into the molecular processing of a key regulatory enzyme involved in PtdCho biosynthesis and are the first indicating interdependence between remodeling and de novo pathways to preserve lipid homeostasis. The sources of murine lung epithelial (MLE) cells, culture medium, immunoblotting materials, and radiochemicals were described previously (18.Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J.

The TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system and RQ1 DNase kit were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All DNA sequencing was performed by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Cloning primers were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA). The Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope is part of the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility. RNA was purified from primary murine lung cells (21.Zhou J. Wu Y. Henderson F. McCoy D.M. Salome R.G. McGowan S.E. Mallampalli R.K. Gene Ther. 2006; 13: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent, and cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription followed by DNase I digestion, amplification, and detection by a Chromo 4 real-time PCR detector (22.Chen B.B. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33494-33506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Levels of transcripts were measured relative to GAPDH or 18 S mRNA. The coding sequence available for LPCAT1, CPT1, and CEPT1 on the NCBI Web site (NM_145376, NM_144807, NM_133869) were used to construct primers for cloning of genes from cDNA from mRNA via reverse transcriptase PCR from murine liver and kidney tissues. Amplified fragments were subcloned into PCRTOPO4.1, sequenced, and were found to be identical to the deposited NCBI LPCAT1 sequence. The resulting PCRTOPO4.1 vector served as a source for cloning into pacAd5 CMV internal ribosome entry site enhanced green fluorescent protein pA (University of Iowa DNA Core) using ClaI and BamHI restriction sites. For CPT1 and CEPT1, the Invitrogen Gateway system was used. Primers constructed containing CACC overhangs upstream of the 5′ ATG and antisense sequence with (V5-CEPT1) or without (CPT-V5his) a stop codon were used for amplification using a blunt end polymerase and pENTR/D-TOPO per the manufacturer's instructions. LR Clonase II recombinase was used for cloning of CPT1 and CEPT1 sequences into pcDNA-DEST40 or pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST gateway vectors, respectively (CPT1-V5his, V5-CEPT1). CPT1K4R and CPT1K6R were constructed by performing site-directed mutagenesis on CPT1-V5his at Lys254, Lys282, Lys283, and Lys292 (CPT1K4R) and additionally Lys307 and Lys311 for CPT1K6R using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) kit. CFP-CPT1 was generated, similar to CFP-CCT (22.Chen B.B. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33494-33506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The CPT1 construct CPT1K6R was digested with BglII and SalI, purified, and ligated into pAmCyan-C1 as described, generating CFP-CPT1K6R (20.Chen B.B. Mallampalli R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3062-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FLAG-CPT1 was constructed by amplifying CPT1 and ligation into pCMV-Tag1. A βGT-YFP (carboxyl-terminal YFP tag) plasmid was constructed by amplifying or digesting three separate fragments for ligation. First, a human cDNA was used as a template to amplify the first 249 base pairs of the UDP-Gal:βGlcNAcβ1,4-galactosyltransferase gene (B4GALT1) (GenBankTM number BC045773) with flanking ClaI/EcoRV restriction sites. Fragment 2 was an EcoRV/EcoRI YFP fragment amplified from pZsYellow-C1. Finally a pacAd5 CMV internal ribosome entry site enhanced green fluorescent protein pA vector, and the two amplified fragments were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and gel-extracted. The B4GALT1 and YFP fragments were ligated into the pacAd5 CMV internal ribosome entry site enhanced green fluorescent protein pA to generate βGT-YFP. Tandem Ubi-CFP-CPT fusion constructs were generated by cloning the ubiquitin coding sequence at the carboxyl terminus of CFP-CPT1 using SalI and ApaI sites to generate CFP-CPT1×Ub, CFP-CPT3×Ub, and CFP-CPT4×Ub. Alveolar macrophages, primary type II cells, and fibroblasts were isolated as described previously (23.McCoy D.M. Fisher K. Robichaud J. Ryan A.J. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 35: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MLE cells were maintained in Hite's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium) with 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After reaching 80% confluence, the cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% EDTA, resuspended in medium, and plated onto appropriate culture dishes containing a 3 μl/1 μg DNA ratio of FuGENE6 lipofection reagent and appropriate expression vector. After incubation overnight, the medium was replaced with Hite's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum for 8 h before cell harvesting. In some studies, an Amaxa electroporation device with program T-013 and solution L was used for plasmid transfection of cells. Cells were maintained as described above, except after trypsinization, cells were resuspended in a small volume of solution L per the manufacturer's directions. Plasmids were transfected into cells, or cells were left untransfected. Medium was aspirated 24 h post-transfection, and cells were treated an additional 24 h with 0% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with or without NH4Cl (25 mm). Cell lysates were harvested by brief sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (no EDTA if Ni2+ purification was performed), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% sodium azide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4), at 4 °C. Alternatively, cells were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium without fetal bovine serum and treated for 6 h with CHM (18 μg/ml) with either NH4Cl (25 mm) or lactacystin (25 μm). Cells were collected in Buffer A plus 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and sonicated for further analysis. MLE cells were also exposed to human KGF (20 ng/ml) for 24 h prior to harvest. Rat type II cells were transduced for 48 h with lentivirus, constructed at the University of Iowa gene transfer vector core, containing LPCAT1 in a pLenti6/V5-Dest vector. Cells were resuspended in Buffer A, and samples were first centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting microsomal pellet was resuspended in Buffer A using a 25-gauge needle. Lipids were extracted from equal amounts of membrane protein, and levels of the individual phospholipids were quantitated with a phosphorus assay (24.Mallampalli R.K. Walter M.E. Peterson M.W.

For PtdCho de novo synthesis, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline chloride during the final 2 h of incubation with choline-depleted medium. For remodeling activity, cells were labeled with 1.75 nm [14C]LysoPtdCho (55 mCi/mmol) for 3 h. Total cellular lipids were extracted, resolved using TLC, and processed for scintillation counting (18.Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and equal amounts of microsomal cellular protein were used in the assay. 1 nmol of 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (50.44 mm solution in 1:1 chloroform/methanol)/μl of 5× assay buffer was added and sonicated with 5× assay buffer (final concentration 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA). 35 μl of H2O, and cellular protein was added to 10 μl of sonicated assay buffer and 5 μl of [1-14C]acyl-CoA (0.1 μCi, 1.8 nmol) for a total assay volume of 50 μl. Upon the addition of [1-14C]acyl-CoA, samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, after which the reaction was terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol/H2O (1:2:0.70, v/v/v). Total cellular lipids from reaction mixtures were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (26.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

Each reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.2), 0.1 mg/ml Tween 20, 1 mm 1,2- dioleoylglycerol, 0.8 mm phosphatidylglycerol, 0.5 mm [14C]CDP-choline (specific activity 1,110 dpm/nmol), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 30–40 μg of protein. The lipid substrate was prepared by combining appropriate amounts of 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (1 mm) and phosphatidylglycerol (0.8 mm) in a test tube, drying under nitrogen gas, and brief sonication before the addition to the assay mixture to achieve the final desired concentration. The reaction proceeded for 1 h at 37 °C and terminated with 4 ml of methanol/chloroform/water (2:1:7, v/v/v). The remainder of the assay was performed exactly as described (29.Miller J.C.

A Bioscan AR-2000 plate reader was used for detection of radiolabeled PtdCho on LK5D TLC plates with data quantified using WinScan software. PtdCho bands on the LK5D silica plates were also scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoblotting was performed as described (22.Chen B.B. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol.

The dilution factors for the LPCAT1, V5, FLAG, and β-actin antibodies were 1:2000, 1:2000, 1:5000, and 1:10,000, respectively. Cell lysates were also incubated with 3 μl of HA antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight, incubated with 20 μl of Pierce protein A/G matrix for 2 h, and eluted with protein sample buffer/lysis buffer prior to immunoblot analysis (22.Chen B.B.

MLE cells were plated at 30% confluence on 35-mm MetTek glass bottom culture dishes and transfected with individual CFP plasmids. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then exposed to 15% bovine serum albumin, 1:200 β1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 primary goat antibody, and 1:200 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey anti-goat IgG (H + L) (Jackson Immunoresearch) to visualize the trans-Golgi; cells were also incubated with an Alexa568-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody.

An aliquot of prebound lysate was also resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE to determine loading onto the resin. The matrix resin was washed with 5 × 1 volume of 9:1 phosphate-buffered saline to lysis buffer as described in the Biomol protocol, and protein sample buffer was used to elute bound protein. Cell lysates were incubated with 40 ml of His-select nickel affinity gel resin overnight at 4 °C. The matrix resin was washed sequentially with a 3 × 3 bead volume of Buffer A without EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40; a 2 × 3 bead volume of Buffer A without EDTA, 0.005% Triton X-100, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, and 6 mm imidazole; and finally 1 volume of Buffer A without EDTA, 0.005% Triton X-100, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. After 30 min, protein sample buffer was added to the resin/buffer mixture, samples were incubated at 25 °C overnight, and proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance or Student's t test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Lung epithelial type II cells synthesize and secrete surfactant composed of the major surface-active species, DPPtdCho. At least three acytransferases might participate in remodeling of PtdCho within lung epithelia generating DPPtdCho. These proteins include LPCAT1 and two variants harboring similar catalytic domains, termed LPCAT2 (31.Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and LPCAT3 (32.Ye G.M. Chen C. Huang S. Han D.D. Guo J.H. Wan B. Yu L. DNA Seq. 2005; 16: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (AGPAT7 and LPEAT2); these enzymes exhibit similar substrate requirements with regard to saturated (16:0) fatty acyl-CoA donors (33.Soupene E. Fyrst H. Kuypers F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To evaluate which species may represent the primary acyltransferase involved in surfactant remodeling, we isolated mouse epithelial type II cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung fibroblasts. qRT-PCR shows that LPCAT1 mRNA is highly expressed in surfactant-producing mouse primary type II cells, with markedly reduced expression in macrophages or fibroblasts. Lung epithelia also expressed mRNAs encoding LPCAT2 and LPCAT3, albeit at lower levels (Fig. 1, B and C). Of the three homologues, LPCAT2 expression was highly expressed within macrophages, and LPCAT3 was most predominant within fibroblasts (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, LPCAT1 appears to be a major regulator of surfactant remodeling, but the data do not exclude redundancy with other related acyltransferases. Because LPCAT1 was highly expressed in surfactant-producing lung cells, this enzyme was cloned and expressed in murine lung epithelia to test its regulatory activity on PtdCho metabolism. Using nucleofection, we were able to achieve high level (>90%) transfection efficiency in mammalian epithelia within a strong CMV-driven mammalian expression vector (Adv-CMV-LPCAT1). Following expression of this plasmid, we detected a ∼10-fold increase in LPCAT1 mRNA (Fig. 2A), a 28-fold increase in immunoreactive LPCAT1 (Fig. 2B, inset), a ∼7-fold increase in LPCAT activity (Fig. 2B), and a nearly 3-fold increase in [3H]LysoPtdCho incorporation into DPPtdCho (Fig. 2C). Importantly, despite up-regulating LPCAT1 expression and remodeling activity,"

Phosphorylated ZmeIF5A was also identified after separation of maize leaf proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Multiple sequence alignment of eIF5A proteins showed that in monocots, in contrast to other eukaryotes, there are two serine/threonine residues that could potentially be phosphorylated by CK2. To identify the phosphorylation site(s) of ZmeIF5A, the serine residues potentially phosphorylated by CK2 were mutated. ZmeIF5A and its mutated variants S2A and S4A were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Of these recombinant proteins, only ZmeIF5A-S2A was not phosphorylated by maize CK2. Also, Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF5A-S2A mutants were not phosphorylated despite effective phosphorylation of wild-type variants. A newly developed method exploiting the specificity of thrombin cleavage was used to confirm that Ser2 in ZmeIF5A is indeed phosphorylated. To find a role of the Ser2 phosphorylation, ZmeIF5A and its variants mutated at Ser2 (S2A and S2D) were transiently expressed in maize protoplasts. The expressed fluorescence labeled proteins were visualized by confocal microscopy. Although wild-type ZmeIF5A and its S2A variant were distributed evenly between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the variant with Ser2 replaced by aspartic acid, which mimics a phosphorylated serine, was sequestered in the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2070919564,"Hypoxia, a driving force in neovascularization, promotes alterations in gene expression mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) is a modulator of endothelial cell growth and migration, but its regulation by hypoxia is poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed signaling pathways involved in the regulation of CTGF by hypoxia in endothelial cells. Exposure to low oxygen tension or treatment with the hypoxia-mimetic dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG) stabilized HIF-1α and up-regulated CTGF in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in a murine microvascular endothelial cell line. Induction of CTGF correlated with a HIF-dependent increase in protein and mRNA levels, and nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor FoxO3a. By contrast, gene expression and cellular localization of FoxO1 were not significantly altered by hypoxia. Expression of CTGF was strongly reduced by siRNA silencing of FoxO1 or FoxO3a. Furthermore, nuclear exclusion of FoxO1/3a transcription factors by inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases by okadaic acid inhibited CTGF expression, providing evidence for both FoxO proteins as regulators of CTGF expression. The DMOG-stimulated induction of CTGF was further increased when endothelial cells were co-incubated with transforming growth factor-β, an activator of Smad signaling. Activation of RhoA-Rho kinase signaling by the microtubule-disrupting drug combretastatin A4 also enhanced the DMOG-induced CTGF expression, thus placing CTGF induction by hypoxia in a network of interacting signaling pathways. Our findings provide evidence that FoxO1, hypoxia-stimulated expression of FoxO3a and its nuclear accumulation are required for the induction of CTGF by hypoxia in endothelial cells."

The prp13-1 mutant produced elongated cells, a phenotype similar to cell division cycle mutants, and displays a high incidence of lagging chromosomes on anaphase spindles. The mutant is hypersensitive to the microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole, supporting that prp13-1 has a defect in chromosomal segregation. We found that the prp13-1 mutation resulted in expression of the ura4+ gene inserted in the pericentromeric heterochromatin region and reduced recruitment of the heterochromatin protein Swi6p to that region, indicating defects in the formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin, which is essential for the segregation of chromosomes, in prp13-1. The formation of centromeric heterochromatin is induced by the RNA interference (RNAi) system in S. pombe. In prp13-1, the processing of centromeric noncoding RNAs to siRNAs, which direct the heterochromatin formation, was impaired and unprocessed noncoding RNAs were accumulated. These results suggest that U4 snRNA is required for the RNAi-directed heterochromatic gene silencing at the centromeres. In relation to the linkage between the spliceosomal U4 snRNA and the RNAi-directed formation of heterochromatin, we identified a mRNA-type intron in the centromeric noncoding RNAs.

https://openalex.org/W1982559939,"Many bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have a nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) system of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair driven by Ku and DNA ligase D (LigD). LigD is a multifunctional enzyme composed of a ligase domain fused to an autonomous polymerase module (POL) that adds ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to DSB ends and primer-templates. LigD POL and the eukaryal NHEJ polymerase lambda are thought to bridge broken DNA ends via contacts with a duplex DNA segment downstream of the primer terminus, a scenario analogous to gap repair. Here, we characterized the gap repair activity of Pseudomonas LigD POL, which is more efficient than simple templated primer extension and relies on a 5'-phosphate group on the distal gap strand end to confer apparent processivity in filling gaps of 3 or 4 nucleotides. Mutations of the His-553, Arg-556, and Lys-566 side chains implicated in DNA 5'-phosphate binding eliminate the preferential filling of 5'-phosphate gaps. Mutating Phe-603, which is imputed to stack on the nucleobase of the template strand that includes the 1st bp of the downstream gap duplex segment, selectively affects incorporation of the final gap-closing nucleotide. We find that Pseudomonas Ku stimulates POL-catalyzed ribonucleotide addition to a plasmid DSB end and promotes plasmid end joining by full-length Pseudomonas LigD. A series of incremental truncations from the C terminus of the 293-amino acid Ku polypeptide identifies Ku-(1-229) as sufficient for homodimerization and LigD stimulation. The slightly longer Ku-(1-253) homodimer forms stable complexes at both ends of linear plasmid DNA that protect the DSBs from digestion by 5'- and 3'-exonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W2030621034,"Sensory nerves may dampen inflammatory processes through the release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP mediates immunosuppressive activities through up-regulation of interleukin-10 or, alternatively, through an interleukin-10-independent pathway that is associated with rapid induction of the transcriptional inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). In this work, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms of immune modulation by CGRP. Using TLR2-stimulated dendritic cells, we show that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by CGRP is dependent on up-regulation of endogenous ICER. Dendritic cell expression of ICER was selectively induced by CGRP and elevation of cellular cAMP levels but not by numerous pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of dendritic cells with CGRP did not interfere with the induction of Tnfa gene expression but caused premature repression of TLR2-induced transcriptional activity. ATF-2 was rapidly phosphorylated and recruited to the Tnfa promoter following ligation of TLR2. Concomitant administration of CGRP completely prevented binding of ATF-2 to the Tnfa promoter, whereas recruitment of ICER was markedly elevated. In contrast, CGRP did not influence TLR2-stimulated binding of NF-kappaB p65. Together, these results are consistent with a model suggesting that CGRP causes rapid up-regulation of ICER, which in turn competes with ATF-2 for binding to the Tnfa promoter, leading to repression of gene expression."

U2OS cells were synchronized at the G1/S border by treating cells with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h followed by extensive wash and release into normal growth medium for 10 h to obtain cells in G2/M. The cell cycle stage was monitored by staining with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml), followed by cytometric analysis performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson) cytofluorimeter equipped with CellQuest software. 35S-labeled proteins were in vitro-translated (IVT) using TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). 35S-labeled IVT proteins were incubated with similar amounts (as estimated by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel) of purified GST or GST-tagged proteins (immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, Amersham Biosciences) in pulldown buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Bound proteins were eluted, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. For in vitro binding assays between GST, GST-hGTSE-1, and GST-p21 recombinant proteins, purified resin-bound GST-p21 was subjected to thrombin cleavage (1 unit/100 μg protein) for 6 h at room temperature to remove the GST tag. Digestion was stopped by adding 1 mm PMSF. Beads were pelleted at 3,000 rpm for 4 min, and supernatant (∼1 μg protein) was incubated with resin-bound GST-hGTSE-1 or GST. p21 presence was detected by immunoblot analysis using an antibody against p21. Cells were harvested in ice-cold immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) plus 1% Nonidet P-40 or in immunoprecipitation low stringency lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, where stated. After centrifugation and preclearing, lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (for anti-hGTSE-1, anti-HA, and anti-GFP immunoprecipitations) or GammaBind G Sepharose (for anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations) plus specific antibodies. Western blot analyses were performed with the following primary antibodies: affinity-purified LF1 anti-hGTSE-1 polyclonal antibody (14.Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene. 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), affinity-purified anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, anti-p21 polyclonal, DO-1 anti-p53, anti-Hsp90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21 monoclonal, anti-actin, anti-p27, anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-p27/p57, anti-cyclin B1, anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-cyclin A (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-HA 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science), and anti-FKBPL (WISp39) (Proteintech Group). Bound primary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) after addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Subconfluent H1299 and U2OS cells plated in 8 dishes (500 cm2) were collected in gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm NaF). Cell extracts were syringed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was resolved by gel filtration on a column of 1.6 cm inner diameter/70 cm length, filled with Superose 6 prep grade media. Flow rate was maintained constant at 1 ml/min, and collection of 2 ml fractions started after the void volume was reached. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hGTSE-1, anti-p21, anti-WISp39, and anti-Hsp90 antibodies. These assays were performed as described previously (17.Monte M. Benetti R. Collavin L. Marchionni L. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11744-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Glass slides were analyzed using a Leica DM4000B microscope. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and cell suspensions were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol and stored at −20 °C until analysis. For FACS analysis, cell suspensions were treated with RNase (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min at 4 °C and then stained with a propidium iodide solution (10 μg/ml) for at least 10 min in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson) cytofluorimeter equipped with CellQuest software. The number of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content was calculated through normalization by biological background subtraction noise, i.e. the sub-G1 percentage of siCONT-transfected cells treated with paclitaxel was subtracted from the sub-G1 percentage of untreated siCONT-transfected cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate. For each cell line, 3,000 cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes. After 24 h, cells were treated with the indicated doses of paclitaxel for 24 h. For knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with specific siRNAs 36 h before paclitaxel treatment, whereas for the inducible cell lines, ponasterone A was added to the culture media 16 h before paclitaxel treatment. Silencing/induction efficiency was controlled by immunoblotting. After 24 h of paclitaxel treatment, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium without drug was added. The cultures were microscopically monitored for colony formation, and when colonies were macroscopically visible, the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 3% for 20 min and stained with Crystal Violet 0.05% for 30 min in the dark. Finally, each plate was carefully washed twice with H2O and dried at 37 °C. The plates were scanned and counted for the colonies number, which is expressed as the mean ratio of scored colonies: paclitaxel-treated siCONT:sihGTSE-1 and ponasterone A:noninduced cells (-). Statistical significance was evaluated for each cell line set using Z-test method. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate. We found here that p21 protein levels change in parallel with hGTSE-1 expression in both hGTSE-1 knocked down cells and in hGTSE-1-inducible systems as evidenced by Western blot (Fig. 1A) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B) analyses. Regulation of p21 by hGTSE-1 occurs in U2OS (wild type p53), H1299 (p53-null) and in HCT116 wild type and p53-null (Fig. 1C) cells indicating a p53-independent mechanism. Importantly, such an effect was not seen with other members of the CIP/KIP family or cyclins (Fig. 1D), indicating that hGTSE-1 expression specifically targets p21. This is not a cell cycle related effect because no significant alteration in the cell cycle profile was seen in hGTSE-1-induced or -knocked down cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, respectively). Similarly, regulation of p21 protein levels was reproduced using two different hGTSE-1 siRNAs (supplemental Fig. S1C) in different cell lines (data not shown), without significantly affecting p21 mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. S1D). In fact, through cycloheximide chase experiments, we found that hGTSE-1 is able to modulate p21 protein turnover because hGTSE-1 up-regulation increases (Fig. 1E) and hGTSE-1 knockdown (KD) decreases (Fig. 1F) p21 half-life. Treatment of hGTSE-1 knocked down cells with MG132 (Fig. 1G) or lactacystin (data not shown) abolished p21 degradation restoring its basal levels, suggesting that hGTSE-1 protein protects p21 from proteasome-dependent proteolysis. Co-transfection of p21 and hGTSE-1 results in increased p21 levels (Fig. 2A). The Hsp90 chaperone complex was previously shown to regulate the stability of newly synthesized p21 through the TPR co-chaperone protein WISp39 (10.Jascur T. Brickner H. Salles-Passador I. Barbier V. El Khissiin A. Smith B. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the relevance of this complex on hGTSE-1-mediated p21 stabilization. Notably, we found that the specific Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG as well as the KD of WISp39 abrogates the effect of hGTSE-1 on ectopically expressed (Fig. 2B) and endogenous p21 levels (Fig. 2, C and D) thus indicating the requirement of a functional Hsp90-WISp39 complex for hGTSE-1-mediated p21 stabilization. Gel filtration chromatography of U2OS (Fig. 3A) and H1299 (supplemental Fig. S2A) cell extracts followed by immunoblot analysis revealed that hGTSE-1 co-elutes with p21 and WISp39 in fractions resolved with a mass of ∼300 kDa, indicating that the three proteins could form a complex in vivo. First, we investigated whether hGTSE-1 could physically interact with p21 and/or WISp39 in vitro. To this purpose, in vitro pulldown assays using recombinant hGTSE-1 and 35S-labeled IVT p21 and WISp39 were performed. p21 and WISp39 were found to interact with hGTSE-1 (Fig. 3B) but not IVT p27 under the same experimental conditions (supplemental Fig. S2B), thus confirming the specificity of hGTSE-1 for p21 with respect to its closely related sibling. Such interaction was confirmed by incubating recombinant p21 and WISp39 with IVT hGTSE-1 (supplemental Fig. S2C). Interestingly, we observed that both hGTSE-1 and p21 recombinant proteins interact with each other in vitro demonstrating a direct association, with no bridging proteins mediating their binding (Fig. 3C). Moreover, overexpressed p21 and WISp39 were detected in hGTSE-1 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3D), and the same complex was seen in reverse immunoprecipitations (data not shown) suggesting that hGTSE-1 is associated in vivo with p21 and its associated chaperone machinery. Finally, as expected, endogenous hGTSE-1 was detected in complex with endogenous WISp39 and p21 (Fig. 3E), confirming the existence of the protein complex in vivo. To find out whether the interaction of hGTSE-1 with p21 is cell cycle-regulated, we synchronized U2OS cells (which express low levels of hGTSE-1 in G1 phase (15.Monte M. Benetti R. Buscemi G. Sandy P. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30356-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) at the G1/S boundary or at G2/M phases of the cell cycle through thymidine block and release, respectively, followed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous p21 protein. The p21-hGTSE-1 complex was observed both in G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3F), indicating a constitutive interaction of these proteins throughout the cell cycle in U2OS cells. Interaction mapping through in vitro pulldown (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2, D and E) and immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4B) indicated that residues 1–221 of hGTSE-1 (hGTSE-1-(1–221)) are responsible for binding with p21 as well as with WISp39 (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the hGTSE-1-(1–221) deletion preserves the ability of the full-length in stabilizing p21 as demonstrated by co-transfection experiments (Fig. 4D). The biological consequence of p21 regulation by hGTSE-1 is reflected by the well known activity of p21 in hampering paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (19.Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, siRNA-mediated hGTSE-1 KD sensitizes cells to paclitaxel, whereas cells overexpressing hGTSE-1 display resistance to such treatment, as detected by caspase-3 cleavage, sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 5A) and colony formation assays (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S3A). This effect occurring in HeLa, U2OS (wild type p53), and H1299 (p53-null) cells suggested again a p53-independent mechanism. In fact, similar experiments performed upon transient or stable down-regulation of p53, indicated that such an effect is p53-independent (supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Because the hGTSE-1-(1–221) deletion stabilizes p21 as full-length hGTSE-1 does, we tested the effect of its expression in a U2OS-inducible pool of cells (EPIC/UP) as compared with a control full-length hGTSE-1 inducible-pool (JPIC/UP). We observed that, similar to JPIC/UP, cells with induced expression of hGTSE-1-(1–221) display resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S3A), indicating that this region of hGTSE-1 is sufficient to up-regulate p21 levels and to protect cells from paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity. Importantly, hGTSE-1 mediated chemoresistance to paclitaxel-induced cell death is dependent on p21 expression as siRNA-mediated p21 KD restores the sensitivity to apoptosis (Fig. 5D). Signaling pathways involved in paclitaxel-induced cell death are as yet poorly understood, but it is known that paclitaxel is able to induce cell death independent of p53 status (20.Debernardis D. Siré E.G. De Feudis P. Vikhanskaya F. Valenti M. Russo P. Parodi S. D'Incalci M. Broggini M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 870-874PubMed Google Scholar) and to abnormally activate G2/M-specific Cdk1, preferentially affecting cells crossing the G2/M boundary (19.Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we observed a significant reduction of paclitaxel-induced Cdk1 kinase activity in hGTSE-1-induced cells, which is relieved by p21 KD (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B, respectively). These findings mark p21 as the effector of hGTSE-1-induced resistance to paclitaxel treatment and support the observation that hGTSE-1 levels increase in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells during the acquisition of a paclitaxel resistance phenotype in vitro (supplemental Fig. S4C). In addition, the reported effect of hGTSE-1 on cell death could be extended to other type of cellular stresses besides microtubule disruption such as DNA damage, as an effect of hGTSE-1 on doxorubicin-induced cell death is observed in p53-null tumor cell lines (supplemental Fig. S5). Collectively, the data presented here indicate a novel function of hGTSE-1 in protecting p21 from proteasome-dependent degradation through its association with the Hsp90-WISp39 chaperone machinery, thus giving a further level of modulation of p21-specific interactions with its multiple partners (21.Pratt W.B. Morishima Y. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22885-22889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with the final outcome of mediating cellular chemoresistance to the microtubule disrupting agent paclitaxel. Here, we present data describing a p53-independent effect of hGTSE-1 in modulating p21 stability, as part of a protein complex that controls p21 turnover. Importantly, such regulation of p21 levels does not rely on significant alterations in the cell cycle and is specific for p21, because no other members of the CIP/KIP family of Cdk inhibitors are affected by hGTSE-1 expression. p21 abundance must be finely regulated to act in accordance to the requested outcome, as variations in its levels may determine whether it acts as an inhibitor or as an assembly factor of cyclin-Cdk complexes (4.LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 5.Dash B.C. El-Deiry W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3364-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), thereby hindering or stimulating proliferation, respectively. In fact, timed regulation of p21 levels and function is essential for cell cycle and apoptosis control (22.Abbas, T., Dutta, A. (2009) Nat. Rev. CancerGoogle Scholar); therefore, it is important to precisely understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these events. Regulation of p21 intracellular levels is mainly achieved by well established transcriptional mechanisms (23.Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) in combination with post-translational processes, both acting in concert to carry out a coordinated regulation of p21 levels within the established cellular context (10.Jascur T. Brickner H. Salles-Passador I. Barbier V. El Khissiin A. Smith B. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found here that hGTSE-1 protects p21 from a proteasome-dependent degradation and for this activity hGTSE-1 requires a functional Hsp90 complex containing the co-chaperone WISp39. WISp39 binds the N terminus of newly synthesized p21, concomitantly recruiting it to the Hsp90 machinery by means of its TPR domain; likewise, treatment of cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG abrogates WISp39-dependent stabilization of p21 (10.Jascur T. Brickner H. Salles-Passador I. Barbier V. El Khissiin A. Smith B. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). hGTSE-1-dependent regulation of p21 levels is blocked by 17-AAG or WISp39 KD, and, in addition, the three endogenous proteins co-fraction in gel filtration assays and are found in the same complex in vivo (as demonstrated by endogenous co-immunoprecipitation studies). Such results provide evidence that hGTSE-1 could be a component of such chaperone machinery that controls p21 stability. p21 is an intrinsically unstructured and highly unstable protein (6.Kriwacki R.W. Hengst L. Tennant L. Reed S.I. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11504-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 24.Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and its interaction with molecular partners has been proposed to shield it from degradation. In fact, the capacity of p21 to be directly recognized by the proteasome complex, when it is free (25.Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), highlights that binding partners of p21, such as hGTSE-1, could display an essential role in maintaining p21 steady state levels. For instance, bound Cdk2 induces a stable conformation of the N terminus of p21 (6.Kriwacki R.W. Hengst L. Tennant L. Reed S.I. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11504-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen has been proposed to mask the region of p21 involved in C8-α subunit binding and recognition by the proteasome (24.Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that hGTSE-1 is physically associated with p21 and critically involved in keeping p21 protein levels as a component of the Hsp90-WISp39 chaperone complex. p21 levels in nontransformed fibroblasts oscillate during the cell cycle, displaying peaks in G1 and G2 (26.Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the S phase, it is efficiently targeted for degradation mainly by the SCF-Skp2 ubiquitin ligase complex (27.Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and by the anaphase-promoting complex-Cdc20 complex in mitosis (28.Amador V. Ge S. Santamaría P.G. Guardavaccaro D. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 462-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Synchronization of nontransformed fibroblasts at the G1/S boundary shows that p21 levels increase concomitantly with those of hGTSE-1 as cells exit the S phase (data not shown), suggesting that hGTSE-1 could have a physiological function in maintaining p21 steady state levels, possibly during these specific phases of the cell cycle that may require additional and more stringent regulation of p21 expression. However, in the U2OS tumor cell line, low levels of hGTSE-1 are detected in G1 (15.Monte M. Benetti R. Buscemi G. Sandy P. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30356-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the hGTSE-1-p21 complex is observed both in G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, indicating that hGTSE-1 could constitutively regulate p21 levels throughout the cell cycle in transformed cells. Importantly, p21 malfunction in tumor cells often derives from variation in its levels and/or subcellular localization, mainly induced by oncogene-activated pathways (29.Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 30.Li Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 31.Westbrook T.F. Nguyen D.X. Thrash B.R. McCance D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7041-7052Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). High levels of p21 in breast cancer (as associated with ErbB2 overexpression (32.Yang W. Klos K.S. Zhou X. Yao J. Yang Y. Smith T.L. Shi D. Yu D. Cancer. 2003; 98: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), as well as in other type of cancers (22.Abbas, T., Dutta, A. (2009) Nat. Rev. CancerGoogle Scholar), have been linked to poor prognosis. As a functional consequence, we show that up-regulation of hGTSE-1 expression with the concomitant stabilization of p21 results in chemoresistance to paclitaxel-induced cell death. Moreover, we demonstrate that the region of hGTSE-1 involved in p21 binding, corresponding to amino acids 1–221, results to be sufficient both for stabilizing p21 as well as for inhibiting paclitaxel-induced cell death. p21 is known to regulate cellular responses to stress such as microtubule damage (33.Li W. Fan J. Banerjee D. Bertino J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1088-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We found here that hGTSE-1 overexpression protects cells from paclitaxel-triggered apoptosis and that such an effect depends on p21. Hampering paclitaxel-induced cell death has previously been attributed to the ability of p21 to inhibit Cdk1 activity (19.Yu D. Jing T. Liu B. Yao J. Tan M. McDonnell T.J. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we observed that paclitaxel-induced Cdk1 kinase activity diminishes upon induction of hGTSE-1 in a p21-dependent way. These results point to p21 as a mediator of hGTSE-1-induced resistance to paclitaxel treatment. We have previously demonstrated a role of hGTSE-1 in attenuating p53-mediated apoptotic response (15.Monte M. Benetti R. Buscemi G. Sandy P. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30356-30364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17.Monte M. Benetti R. Collavin L. Marchionni L. Del Sal G. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11744-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We now add that the opposite regulation of p53 and p21 stability by hGTSE-1 supports its combined role in promoting cell survival by shifting the equilibrium of the p53 response from apoptosis to survival. This protective effect could also be extended to other types of stress-induced apoptosis such as DNA damage or reactive oxygen species, in which p21 plays an important role in influencing cell fate decision (34.Chen W. Sun Z. Wang X.J. Jiang T. Huang Z. Fang D. Zhang D.D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, cancer cells expressing higher and constitutive levels of hGTSE-1 protein could display an unbalanced behavior against proapoptotic signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2006430941,"We previously found that a population of colonic stromal cells that constitutively express high levels of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2, also known as Cox-2) altered their location in the lamina propria in response to injury in a Myd88-dependent manner (Brown, S. L., Riehl, T. E., Walker, M. R., Geske, M. J., Doherty, J. M., Stenson, W. F., and Stappenbeck, T. S. (2007) J. Clin. Invest. 117, 258-269). At the time of this study, the identity of these cells and the mechanism by which they expressed high levels of Ptgs2 were unknown. Here we found that these colonic stromal cells were mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These colonic MSCs expressed high Ptgs2 levels not through interaction with bacterial products but instead as a consequence of mRNA stabilization downstream of Fgf9 (fibroblast growth factor 9), a growth factor that is constitutively expressed by the intestinal epithelium. This stabilization was mediated partially through a mechanism involving endogenous CUG-binding protein 2 (CUGbp2). These studies suggest that Fgf9 is an important factor in the regulation of Ptgs2 in colonic MSCs and may be a factor involved in its constitutive expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1969639656,"Hematopoietic stem cells can directly transdifferentiate into hepatocytes because of cellular plasticity, but the molecular basis of transdifferentiation is not known. Here, we show the molecular basis using lineage-depleted oncostatin M receptor beta-expressing (Lin(-)OSMRbeta(+)) mouse bone marrow cells in a hepatic differentiation culture system. Differentiation of the cells was marked by the expression of albumin. Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha was expressed and translocated into the nuclei of the differentiating cells. Suppression of its activation in OSM-neutralized culture medium inhibited cellular differentiation. Ectopic expression of full-length HNF4alpha in 32D myeloid cells resulted in decreased myeloid colony-forming potential and increased expression of hepatocyte-specific genes and proteins. Nevertheless, the neohepatocytes produced in culture expressed active P450 enzyme. The obligatory role of HNF4alpha in hepatic differentiation was confirmed by transfecting Lin(-)OSMRbeta(+) cells with dominant negative HNF4alpha in the differentiation culture because its expression inhibited the transcription of the albumin and tyrosine aminotransferase genes. The loss and gain of functional activities strongly suggested that HNF4alpha plays a central role in the transdifferentiation process. For the first time, this report demonstrates the mechanism of transdifferentiation of hematopoietic cells into hepatocytes, in which HNF4alpha serves as a molecular switch."

https://openalex.org/W1980694287,"The fate of stem cells is intricately regulated by numerous extrinsic and intrinsic factors that promote maintenance or differentiation. The RNA-binding translational repressor Pumilio (Pum) in conjunction with Nanos (Nos) is required for self-renewal, whereas Bam (bag-of-marbles) and Bgcn (benign gonial cell neoplasm) promote differentiation of germ line stem cells in the Drosophila ovary. Genetic analysis suggests that Bam and Bgcn antagonize Pum/Nos function to promote differentiation; however, the molecular basis of this epistatic relationship is currently unknown. Here, we show that Bam and Bgcn inhibit Pum function through direct binding. We identified a ternary complex involving Bam, Bgcn, and Pum in which Bam, but not Bgcn, directly interacts with Pum, and this interaction is greatly increased by the presence of Bgcn. In a heterologous reporter assay to monitor Pum activity, Bam, but not Bgcn, inhibits Pum activity. Notably, the N-terminal region of Pum, which lacks the C-terminal RNA-binding Puf domain, mediates both the ternary protein interaction and the Bam inhibition of Pum function. These studies suggest that, in cystoblasts, Bam and Bgcn may directly inhibit Pum/Nos activity to promote differentiation of germ line stem cells."

However, less is known about its family member hevin, discovered in tonsillar tissue of adult humans (3.Girard J.P. Springer T.A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Initial work in murine models showed significant transcription of hevin mRNA in a diverse group of tissues, with brain consistently exhibiting the highest levels among hevin-positive tissues in unchallenged mice. Subsequent studies revealed hevin protein within the central nervous system, most notably the Purkinje cell-associated Bergmann glial cells, as well as astrocytes within the white matter of the cerebellum and throughout the murine brain (4.Lively S.

Recent work has shown increased expression of hevin in activated astrocytes during central nervous system stress and/or injury and in the excitatory synapses in induced-seizure models in rats (6.McKinnon P.J.

The shared homology and distribution of SPARC and hevin have lent credence to the concept of compensatory functions for these two matricellular proteins. Although the proteins are significantly different in size, the functional domains of SPARC are highly conserved within the C-terminal region of hevin. SPARC has been shown to be the target of several proteases that liberate specific domains, such as the follistatin and EF-hand motifs, or peptides within these domains, with functions different from those of the parent protein. Because these peptides are present in vivo (9.Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10.Iruela-Arispe M.L.

It is, therefore, likely that proteolysis of hevin would affect both its function and tissue distribution. ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) cleaves the proteoglycans aggrecan and brevican (13.Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J.

ADAMTS4 activity has been correlated with arthritis and the remodeling of cartilage, of which aggrecan is a major component, and with glioma in the brain, a tissue in which cleavage of brevican has been demonstrated (14.Naito S.

The deposition and breakdown of proteoglycans is important not only during neural development but also in central nervous system injury and neurodegenerative disease (for review, see Ref. 18.Galtrey C.M. Fawcett J.W. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 54: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed additional substrates for ADAMTS4 and have thereby broadened the potential role of this protease in the brain. Herein we demonstrate the cleavage of hevin by ADAMTS4 in vivo and in vitro. This proteolysis liberates a hevin peptide, termed SPARC-like fragment (SLF), with significant homology to SPARC. Moreover, the cleavage is tissue-dependent, with predominance in the mouse brain. A monoclonal antibody was developed that selectively detects the ADAMTS4-derived peptide and differentiates it from full-length hevin as well as SPARC and its related peptides. The lack of hevin expression and hevin cleavage, as seen in hevin-null and ADAMTS4-null mice, respectively, results in altered Purkinje-cell morphology and a reactive gliosis phenotype in the brain of these adult animals. For immunoblotting and immunostaining procedures, the following antibodies (IgG) were used: polyclonal goat anti-hevin (specific for murine hevin) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), polyclonal rabbit anti-calbindin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), polyclonal goat anti-ADAMTS4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), normal IgG isotype controls (goat, rabbit, and mouse) (R&D Systems), monoclonal rat antibodies 12-155 and 12-54 against human and murine hevin, and a polyclonal rabbit antibody from our laboratory that was produced against murine hevin, affinity-purified against its immunogen, and cleared of SPARC-reactive species by a pass through SPARC-conjugated resin. The expression vector for murine hevin with a C-terminal His6 tag was kindly provided by Dr. Cagla Eroglu (Duke University, Durham, NC). The expression vector for human ADAMTS4 with a C-terminal FLAG epitope (19.Wang P. Tortorella M. England K. Malfait A.M. Thomas G. Arner E.C. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15434-15440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was the generous gift of Dr. Duanqing Pei (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). HEK 293 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to express hevin, ADAMTS4, or both. The morning after transfection, the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and subsequently grown for 3 days in DMEM with 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Conditioned media were clarified, treated with protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and analyzed by immunoblot. Hevin and its breakdown products were detected with polyclonal goat anti-hevin IgG followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and Immobilon substrate (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The presence of ADAMTS4 was confirmed by an immunoblot of cell lysates. Detection with monoclonal antibody M2 anti-FLAG was followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Scientific) and Immobilon substrate. A random library of phage-displayed CX7C peptides (where C is cysteine, and X is any amino acid) was screened for binding to recombinant murine hevin, and its homolog SPARC was coated on 96-well plates. Negative controls were bovine serum albumin and collagen I. Phage that initially bound to hevin were selected, amplified, and subjected to two further rounds of binding, selection, and amplification. Phage clone #65, displaying the sequence CAGTVSLRC, bound to hevin and to SPARC but not to the controls (supplemental Fig. 1A). A search by NCBI BLAST identified a number of proteins containing sequences of significant similarity to CAGTVSLRC, including the ADAMTS4 protein, which contains the sequence GAVSLR within its spacer region (supplemental Fig. 1B). The ScanProsite motif program (20.de Castro E. Sigrist C.J. Gattiker A. Bulliard V. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Hulo N.

Immunoblot procedures were followed as described previously (22.Weaver M.S. Workman G. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22826-22837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly, mouse tissues were lysed with M-PER lysis reagent (Pierce) containing Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Lysates and recombinant proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation for 30–60 min at room temperature in AquaBlock (EastCoast Bio, North Berwick, ME) diluted 1:1 with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated for 20 h at 4 °C in polyclonal rabbit anti-hevin IgG (1 μg/ml), rat monoclonal antibody 12-155 (1 μg/ml), or rat monoclonal antibody 12-54 (1 μg/ml). Blots were washed 3 × 5 min in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-rat IgG (Pierce). Immobilon substrate was used for detection of antibody-antigen complexes. The vectors for full-length murine hevin and for the C-terminal peptide (with CTNFQ at the N terminus), both with His6 at the C terminus, were generously provided by Dr. Cagla Eroglu. We modified the full-length hevin vector with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to express the SLF, beginning with YLKYG at the N terminus. PCR was performed with the following primers: 5′-CCACTGGTGACGCGTACCTCAAATATGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCATATTTGAGGTACGCGTCACCAGTGG-3′. This and subsequent steps of the mutagenesis were completed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The SLF insert was verified by DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and by restriction digestion of sequences that were expected to exist only in the full-length template and not in the modified vector. HEK 293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to express hevin, the C-terminal peptide, or the SLF. Cells were rinsed the next day with PBS and were grown for two more days in serum-free media. Conditioned media were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Invitrogen) affinity column. Recombinant human ADAMTS4 (R&D Systems) (250 ng) and murine hevin (5 μg) were combined in PBS and incubated for 15 min, 1 h, 4 h, or overnight at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Murine hevin produced in Sf9 cells (50 μg) was digested by ADAMTS4 (2.5 μg) according to the Cleavage Assay Protocol by R&D Systems. The SLF was isolated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and submitted to the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility for Edman sequencing. We selected conditioned media from partially cloned hybridomas developed by Brekken et al. (23.Brekken R.A. Sullivan M.M. Workman G. Bradshaw A.D. Carbon J. Siadak A. Murri C. Framson P.E. Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that had previously been rejected for further cloning because of their reactivity with protein bands of a lower apparent Mr than that of hevin. We screened the selected conditioned media for binding to the SLF as follows; hevin and the SLF were coated onto a 96-well ELISA plate at 20 ng per well. After the wells were blocked, conditioned media were added at a dilution of 1:10 in PBS and were incubated for 1–2 h followed by washes, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, additional washes, and detection by tetramethyl benzidine substrate (Thermo Scientific). Color development was stopped with 10% H3PO4. Monoclonal rat antibody 12-155 served as the negative control antibody because of its reaction with hevin but not with the SLF. The 12-54 conditioned medium was of special interest because of its capacity to detect hevin and possibly hevin fragments by immunohistochemistry. The conditioned medium was assayed by ELISA, as above, to demonstrate lack of binding to the C-terminal peptide of hevin. The 12-54 clone was expanded for conditioned media production, and the monoclonal antibody (isotype IgG2a) was purified from the conditioned media by affinity chromatography on Protein G resin (EastCoast Bio). ELISAs similar to those described above were repeated with purified monoclonal antibodies at 1 μg/ml. Brains from C57Bl6/J x 129/SVJ (24.Barker T.H. Framson P. Puolakkainen P.A. Reed M. Funk S.E.

Brains were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions and embedded in paraffin. Sections were next deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen unmasking was performed by heating of the slides for 10 min in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Nonspecific binding sites of all sections were blocked with 20% Aquablock in PBS, Tween (0.2%) for 1 h. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-calbindin IgG, goat anti-ADAMTS4 IgG, rat monoclonal antibody 12-155 (10 μg/ml), or rat monoclonal antibody 12-54 (10 μg/ml) for 15–18 h at 4 °C, washed in PBS, Tween, and exposed to goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or TRITC and/or goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to FITC or TRITC (Invitrogen) for 1 h. All co-staining antibodies described above were used at concentrations according to the manufacturers' protocols. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome (4 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Negative controls included substitution of primary antibody by non-immune rabbit and/or rat IgG. Routine sample analysis and identification of astrocytes/microglial cells were performed on serial sections of brain tissue with hematoxylin and eosin (H+E) stain. All images were compiled into figures in Adobe Illustrator (San Jose, CA). All densitometry readings are expressed as the means ± S.E. from a minimum of three independent experiments. Unpaired t tests were used to assess statistical significance between groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Whereas the distribution of hevin mRNA in mouse tissues has been reported, less is known regarding expression of the protein in these same tissues. Accordingly, immunoblots were performed against a range of mouse tissue lysates from the organs previously reported to express hevin mRNA. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against murine hevin minus the N-terminal signal sequence was used for immunodetection. The multiple epitopes identified from the use of a polyclonal antibody against the entire sequence allowed the detection of the full-length protein as well as hevin-derived peptides. As expected, these proteins were evident in all tissue lysates (Fig. 1A). In addition to the band representing full-length hevin (∼130 kDa) (Fig. 1A, arrowhead), there were several additional bands, most notably in lung and brain (Fig. 1A, arrows). Of particular interest were the smaller proteins/peptides of similar apparent Mr as that of the hevin homolog SPARC (∼43 kDa, asterisk). Our subsequent experiments were focused on brain tissue due to the abundance of hevin and its breakdown products in this organ (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Previous work has shown that the hevin family member SPARC is cleaved by a number of proteases that release peptides exhibiting functions in some cases unique from those of the parent protein (9.Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Johnson R.S. Sage E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10.Iruela-Arispe M.L. Lane T.F. Redmond D. Reilly M. Bolender R.P. Kavanagh T.J.

From this observation it was hypothesized that hevin is also susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and harbors biologically active peptides. To determine binding partners and interacting proteins, we subjected both SPARC and hevin to phage display analysis (see Refs. 25.Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 26.Kzhyshkowska J. Workman G. Cardó-Vila M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Gratchev A. Krusell L. Goerdt S. Sage E.H. J.

As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, the aggrecanase ADAMTS4 was identified as a potential protease targeting hevin as a substrate. The murine hevin sequence was scanned with an algorithm shown to identify potential cleavage sites for ADAMTS4 (21.Hills R. Mazzarella R. Fok K. Liu M. Nemirovskiy O. Leone J. Zack M.D. Arner E.C. Viswanathan M. Abujoub A. Muruganandam A. Sexton D.J. Bassill G.J. Sato A.K. Malfait A.M. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11101-11109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The scan revealed a cut-site (EAERMHS) just N-terminal to the region of highest SPARC homology within hevin (Fig. 1B). Cleavage at this site would result in a C-terminal peptide (Fig. 1C) predicted to migrate on SDS-PAGE comparably to the SPARC-like band observed in the brain lysate (Fig. 1A, lane 2). We used two approaches to ask whether hevin was a substrate for ADAMTS4. First, HEK 293 cells were transfected with a murine hevin expression vector with or without an ADAMTS4 expression vector. The resulting conditioned media were collected, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The subsequent immunoblot revealed a significant increase in hevin processing coincident with the expression of ADAMTS4 (Fig. 2A). Second, murine hevin was incubated with purified ADAMTS4 at 37 °C to establish a time course for proteolysis (Fig. 2B). By 18 h, all of the full-length hevin (Fig. 2B, arrowhead) had been cleaved to an ∼Mr 40,000 fragment (Fig. 2B, arrow). Subsequent N-terminal sequencing of this smaller band revealed the cleavage site to be as predicted by the ADAMTS4 algorithm (Fig. 1B, arrowhead). The identification of a SLF produced from hevin necessitated the generation of specific reagents that could differentiate between full-length hevin and hevin peptides. Our laboratory had produced several monoclonal anti-hevin antibodies that have been used extensively for detection of full-length hevin (but not SPARC) in a variety of experimental models (24.Barker T.H. Framson P. Puolakkainen P.A. Reed M. Funk S.E. Sage E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 923-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28.Esposito I. Kayed H. Keleg S. Giese T. Sage E.H. Schirmacher P. Friess H. Kleeff J. Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This collection of monoclonal hybridomas was used in a series of screening experiments to identify individual clones reactive with the hevin peptides described above. We developed an expression vector to produce a recombinant SLF in vitro and performed ELISAs to screen for monoclonal antibodies with which to identify the fragment. We identified one, 12-54, which reacts with the SLF (and less so with full-length hevin) but not with the C-terminal peptide, a fragment lacking the 51 residues at the N terminus of the SLF (Fig. 3A). We demonstrated that the 12-54 monoclonal antibody detects the SLF (but not the C-terminal peptide) by immunoblot, whereas 12-155 detects only the full-length hevin (Fig. 3, panels B–D). These results indicate that 1) the epitope for 12-155 resides in the region of hevin N-terminal to the SLF, and 2) the 51 residues at the N terminus of the SLF (residues 368–419 of full-length hevin) contain the epitope for 12-54. As a positive control, hevin, the SLF, and the C-terminal peptide were detected in each assay by polyclonal rabbit anti-hevin IgG. These data are shown in Fig. 3. To determine whether ADAMTS4 and hevin proteins interact in vivo, we co-stained sections of cerebellum from wild-type (WT) and ADAMTS4-null mice with polyclonal anti-murine hevin (red) and anti-ADAMTS4 antibodies (green) (Fig. 4). The polyclonal anti-hevin antibody was used in this analysis to attain the most broad spectrum of reactivity with both full-length protein and hevin peptides. In WT tissue there was an apparent co-localization of hevin and ADAMTS4 in the Purkinje cell-associated Bergmann glial cells and in astrocytes located within the white matter (Fig. 4, panels A and C, yellow stain). The lack of ADAMTS4 expression in ADAMTS4-null tissue was verified by immunoblot with recombinant ADAMTS4 as a positive control (Fig. 4, panel E). For visual clarity, the individual and merged fluorescent images are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. This result was not unexpected because both of these cell types have been shown to express hevin (4.Lively S. Ringuette M.J. Brown I.R. Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5.Lively S. Brown I.R. Neurochem. Res. 2008; 33: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6.McKinnon P.J. Margolskee R.F. Brain Res. 1996; 709: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, this is the first report showing that hevin is co-localized with ADAMTS4. In the ADAMTS4-null tissue, where lack of ADAMTS4 reactivity was expected, the specificity of the ADAMTS4 antibody within the WT Purkinje cell layer and white matter was verified (Fig. 4, panels B and D). To determine whether the fragmentation of hevin in the mouse brain was due to the activity of ADAMTS4, we used the selected monoclonal antibodies to assess the presence of hevin peptides in ADAMTS4-null brain. A monoclonal IgG specific for full-length hevin (12-155) showed localization in the glia of both WT and ADAMTS4-null tissue (Fig. 5, panels B and E). In contrast, the monoclonal antibody specific for the SLF (12-54) revealed hevin peptides in WT tissue but not in ADAMTS4-null tissue, with some minimal background staining equivalent to that of the control IgG antibody (Fig. 5, panels C and F). Fig. 5G shows an immunoblot of WT, hevin-null, and ADAMTS4-null brain lysates probed with the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-hevin antibodies. As demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, hevin fragmentation is reduced in the ADAMTS4-null brain. This change is accompanied by a relative increase in full-length hevin found in these tissues. Hevin-null tissues were used as a negative control to demonstrate antibody specificity. Whereas no behavioral studies have been performed on hevin-null animals, ADAMTS4-null animals have been reported to exhibit reduced muscle memory and coordination. Additionally, these mice have an increased susceptibility to metrazol-induced seizures (Mouse Genomic Informatics accession ID: 3604450). These phenomena have been associated with a range of functions including astrocyte activation, synaptogenesis, and basic cerebellar function (29.Sonnewald U. Kondziella D. NMR Biomed. 2003; 16: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30.Hirai H. Launey T. Mikawa S. Torashima T. Yanagihara D. Kasaura T. Miyamoto A. Yuzaki M. Nat.

Because astrocyte activation has been connected to the expression of hevin in the brain (4.Lively S. Ringuette M.J. Brown I.R. Neurochem. Res. 2007; 32: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5.Lively S. Brown I.R. Neurochem. Res. 2008; 33: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6.McKinnon P.J. Margolskee R.F. Brain Res. 1996; 709: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it was of interest to compare the basic cellular morphology and astrocyte activation within the cerebellum and white matter of adult WT, hevin-null, and ADAMTS4-null mice. In addition, sections of the cerebellum of each genotype were stained with anti-calbindin IgG to examine changes in Purkinje cell-dendrite morphology in the presence or absence of hevin and hevin peptides (Fig. 6). WT cerebellum displayed normal Purkinje cell morphology, with an extensive branching of dendrites into the molecular layer of the cerebellum. In contrast, the hevin-null and ADAMTS4-null cerebella exhibited altered Purkinje cell morphology (Fig. 6, panels D and E and panels G and H). The dendritic processes extending from the Purkinje cell bodies into the molecular layer appeared stunted and displayed significantly less branching. These stunted dendritic processes, most evident after staining for calbindin, appeared to terminate in blunt formations, in sharp contrast to the finer dendritic branching seen in the WT tissue (Fig. 6, panels D and E and panels G and H, arrows).

https://openalex.org/W2007011637,"Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA-binding protein with protective activities against cellular stress. This study considers the mechanisms by which HuR transcriptional regulation occurs in renal proximal tubule cells. Under basal conditions, HuR mRNA is expressed in two forms: one that contains a approximately 20-base 5'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence and one that contains a approximately 150-base, G+C-rich 5'-UTR that is inhibitory to translation. Recovery from cellular stresses such as thapsigargin and ATP depletion induced increased expression of the shorter, more translatable transcript and decreased expression of the longer form. Analysis of HuR upstream regions revealed sequences necessary for regulation of the shorter mRNA. Within the long, G+C-rich 5'-UTR exist multiple copies of the alternate Smad 1/5/8-binding motif GCCGnCGC. Recovery from ATP depletion induced increases in Smad 1/5/8 levels; further, gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the ability of these Smads to bind to the relevant motif in the HuR 5'-UTR. Transfection of exogenous Smad 1 increased HuR mRNA expression. Finally, HuR mRNA expression driven by the Smad-binding sites was responsive to BMP-7, a protein with known protective effects against ischemic injury in kidney. These data suggest that transcriptional induction of a readily translatable HuR mRNA may be driven by a mechanism known to protect the kidney from injury and provides a novel pathway through which administration of BMP-7 may attenuate renal damage."
https://openalex.org/W1982670709,"The N-terminal domain of NogoA, called amino-Nogo, inhibits axonal outgrowth and cell spreading via a largely unknown mechanism. In the present study, we show that amino-Nogo decreases Rac1 activity and inhibits fibroblast spreading. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-type tumor promoters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and teleocidin, increase Rac1 activity and overcome the amino-Nogo-induced inhibition of cell spreading. The stimulating effect of tumor promoters on cell spreading requires activation of protein kinase D and the subsequent activation of Akt1. Furthermore, we identified Akt1 as a new signaling component of the amino-Nogo pathway. Akt1 phosphorylation is decreased by amino-Nogo. Activation of Akt1 with a cell-permeable peptide, TAT-TCL1, blocks the amino-Nogo inhibition. Finally, we provide evidence that these signaling pathways operate in neurons in addition to fibroblasts. Our results suggest that activation of protein kinase D and Akt1 are approaches to promote axonal regeneration after injury."

NCS homolog in fission yeast (Ncs1p) is essential for cell growth under extreme Ca2+ conditions. Ncs1p expression increases ∼100-fold when fission yeast grows in high extracellular Ca2+ (>0.1 m). Here, we show that Ca2+-induced expression of Ncs1p is controlled at the level of transcription. Transcriptional reporter assays show that ncs1 promoter activity increased 30-fold when extracellular Ca2+ was raised to 0.1 m and was highly Ca2+-specific. Ca2+-dependent transcription of ncs1 is abolished by the calcineurin inhibitor (FK506) and by knocking out the calcineurin target, prz1. Thus, Ca2+-induced expression of Ncs1p is linked to the calcineurin/prz1 stress response. The Ca2+-responsive ncs1 promoter region consists of 130 nucleotides directly upstream from the start codon and contains tandem repeats of the sequence, 5′-caact-3′, that binds to Prz1p. The Ca2+-sensitive ncs1Δ phenotype is rescued by a yam8 null mutation, suggesting a possible interaction between Ncs1p and the Ca2+ channel, Yam8p. Ca2+ uptake and Ncs1p binding to yeast membranes are both decreased in yam8Δ, suggesting Ca2+-induced binding of Ncs1p to Yam8p results in channel closure.

https://openalex.org/W2077843540,"Classical NF-kappaB activity functions as an inhibitor of the skeletal muscle myogenic program. Recent findings reveal that even in newborn RelA/p65(-/-) mice, myofiber numbers are increased over that of wild type mice, suggesting that NF-kappaB may be a contributing factor in early postnatal skeletal muscle development. Here we show that in addition to p65 deficiency, repression of NF-kappaB with the IkappaB alpha-SR transdominant inhibitor or with muscle-specific deletion of IKKbeta resulted in similar increases in total fiber numbers as well as an up-regulation of myogenic gene products. Upon further characterization of early postnatal muscle, we observed that NF-kappaB activity progressively declines within the first few weeks of development. At birth, the majority of this activity is compartmentalized to muscle fibers, but by neonatal day 8 NF-kappaB activity from the myofibers diminishes, and instead, stromal fibroblasts become the main cellular compartment within the muscle that contains active NF-kappaB. We find that NF-kappaB functions in these fibroblasts to regulate inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression, which we show is important for myoblast fusion during the growth and maturation process of skeletal muscle. Together, these data broaden our understanding of NF-kappaB during development by showing that in addition to its role as a negative regulator of myogenesis, NF-kappaB also regulates nitric-oxide synthase expression within stromal fibroblasts to stimulate myoblast fusion and muscle hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1990216106,"2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol hydrolase PhlG from Pseudomonas fluorescens catalyzes hydrolytic carbon-carbon (C-C) bond cleavage of the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol to form monoacetylphloroglucinol, a rare class of reactions in chemistry and biochemistry. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, we determined the three-dimensional structure of PhlG at 2.0 A resolution using x-ray crystallography and MAD methods. The overall structure includes a small N-terminal domain mainly involved in dimerization and a C-terminal domain of Bet v1-like fold, which distinguishes PhlG from the classical alpha/beta-fold hydrolases. A dumbbell-shaped substrate access tunnel was identified to connect a narrow interior amphiphilic pocket to the exterior solvent. The tunnel is likely to undergo a significant conformational change upon substrate binding to the active site. Structural analysis coupled with computational docking studies, site-directed mutagenesis, and enzyme activity analysis revealed that cleavage of the 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol C-C bond proceeds via nucleophilic attack by a water molecule, which is coordinated by a zinc ion. In addition, residues Tyr(121), Tyr(229), and Asn(132), which are predicted to be hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl groups and unhydrolyzed acetyl group, can finely tune and position the bound substrate in a reactive orientation. Taken together, these results revealed the active sites and zinc-dependent hydrolytic mechanism of PhlG and explained its substrate specificity as well."
https://openalex.org/W1995516943,"During embryonic development, protein kinase A (PKA) plays a key role in cell fate specification by antagonizing the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. However, the mechanism by which PKA activity is regulated remains unknown. Here we show that the Misty somites (Mys) protein regulates the level of PKA activity during embryonic development in zebrafish. We isolate PKA regulatory type Ialpha subunit (Prkar1a) as a protein interacting with Mys by pulldown assay in HEK293 cells followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We show an interaction between endogenous Mys and Prkar1a in the zebrafish embryo. Mys binds to Prkar1a in its C terminus region, termed PRB domain, and activates PKA in vitro. Conversely, knockdown of Mys in zebrafish embryos results in reduction in PKA activity. We also show that knockdown of Mys induces ectopic activation of Hh target genes in the eyes, neural tube, and somites downstream of Smoothened, a protein essential for transduction of Hh signaling activity. The altered patterning of gene expression is rescued by activation of PKA. Together, our results reveal a molecular mechanism of regulation of PKA activity that is dependent on a protein-protein interaction and demonstrate that PKA activity regulated by Mys is indispensable for negative regulation of the Hh signaling pathway in Hh-responsive cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998541407,"Plasmid R6K, which contains 3 replication origins called α, γ, and β, is a favorable system to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of action at a distance, i.e. replication initiation at a considerable distance from the primary initiator protein binding sites (iterons). The centrally located γ origin contains 7 iterons that bind to the plasmid-encoded initiator protein, π. Ori α, located at a distance of ∼4 kb from γ, contains a single iteron that does not directly bind to π but is believed to access the protein by π-mediated α-γ iteron-iteron interaction that loops out the intervening ∼3.7 kb of DNA. Although the cis-acting components and the trans-acting proteins required for ori γ function have been analyzed in detail, such information was lacking for ori α. Here, we have identified both the sequence elements located at α and those at γ, that together promoted α activity. The data support the conclusion that besides the single iteron, a neighboring DNA primase recognition element called G site is essential for α-directed plasmid maintenance. Sequences preceding the iteron and immediately following the G site, although not absolutely necessary, appear to play a role in efficient plasmid maintenance. In addition, while both dnaA1 and dnaA2 boxes that bind to DnaA protein and are located at γ were essential for α activity, only dnaA2 was required for initiation at γ.

The plasmid R6K is an excellent system to study action at a distance as it applies to activation of a replication origin at a considerable distance away from the primary initiator protein binding sites. The plasmid contains 3 replication origins called α, γ, and β. The various structural features of ori α and ori γ are shown in Fig. 1. The complete natural ori α sequence consists of a ∼3.7-kb DNA sequence at the left that is joined to downstream ori γ sequence near the left of the dnaA1 box (Fig. 1A). Ori γ extends from the left of dnaA1 box and ends just after the dnaA2 box (Fig. 1B). Ori α has an obligatory requirement for γ in cis to be functional (7.Crosa J.H. Luttropp L.K. Falkow S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 443-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mini α-γ replicon contains a deletion that fuses 660 bp of the α sequence from the left margin to that of γ near the left of dnaA1 box and removes the intervening sequence (Fig. 1B). The mini α is fully functional in plasmid maintenance (8.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The α region contains, from the left, a sequence of 41 bp that is homologous to that present in ori β and is therefore called the β-homology region (βHR), 2The abbreviations used are: βHRβ-homology regionwtwild typeORFopen reading frameIHFintegration host factorSSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinSSsingle-strandedDSdouble-stranded.a spacer sequence of 45 bp, the α iteron of 23 bp, and a spacer of 54 bp followed by the putative primase recognition site (G site) of 31 bp (9.Masai H.

Gene. 1993; 126: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). There are an additional 444 bp of DNA starting after the G site and extending up to the γ sequence. The replication origin β, that is not discussed here, contains the γ sequence plus all of the sequences extending through the π open reading frame (ORF) that includes a half-iteron located near the 3′-end of the π ORF (Fig. 1B) (11.Kelley W.L.

The features of ori γ have been extensively analyzed (13.Kolter R. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1978; 1: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and it contains from left to right, the dnaA1 box, an AT-rich area embedded in what is a binding site for the host-encoded DNA-bending protein IHF, 7 iterons, and the dnaA2 box that is contiguous with the 7th iteron. The sequence immediately preceding the π ORF contains an 8th iteron and two half-iterons that form inverted repeats, and together constitute the operator element of the π ORF (11.Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kelley W.L. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5078-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14.Germino J.

Kelley W.L. Miron A. Stenzel T.T. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16056-16062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our goal was to determine which of these elements were necessary for α function. β-homology region wild type open reading frame integration host factor single-stranded DNA-binding protein single-stranded double-stranded. Previous attempts to define the structural features of ori α were fraught with two problems. First, in the plasmid constructs used (17.Shafferman A. Flashner Y. Hertman I. Lion M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the obligatory ori γ sequence, which was thought to be silent, actually retained activity. Therefore, one could not be certain whether the plasmid derivatives were being replicated from ori α or from ori γ. Second, the DNA sequences and the binding proteins, that were reported to be distorting the DNA and to be essential for α function (18.Flashner Y. Schlomai J. Shafferman A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 19.Flashner Y. Shafferman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 9123-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) were found by another group to be components of the neighboring origin of conjugative transfer (oriT) and do not seem to be a part of the α-γ replicon (20.Núñez B. Avila P. de la Cruz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21.Avila P. Núñez B. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A putative DnaG primase recognition site of R6K was identified by cloning the plasmid restriction fragments in a M13 vector and selecting for those inserts that rescued the phage replicon and allowed it to replicate in a DnaG-dependent mode (10.Kubota Y. Arai K. Masai H. Gene. 1993; 126: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, whether these sites were involved in any way with vegetative replication of the plasmid or its conjugative transfer was not known. To investigate the mechanistic aspects of replication initiation at α located at a distance of ∼4000 bp away from the 7 γ iterons at γ, which are the primary binding sites of π, it was necessary to fully characterize the relevant sequences of α required for its function. It was also necessary to identify γ sequences necessary for plasmid maintenance driven by α. With these objectives in mind, and considering some of the uncertainties with regard to the existing information about essential elements of an authentic ori α, we proceeded to identify the sequences of both α and γ needed for α function. At this time, there is no mutation of a cis element of the replicon available that selectively inactivates ori γ but retains ori α activity. Therefore, we decided to use a mutation in a trans-acting factor namely the integration host factor (IHF) that is a DNA-bending protein and worked out conditions that either masked or discouraged background replication initiations from the ori γ sequence, in a α-γ replicon. These conditions allowed us to measure α activity without the interference from the backround of initiations at γ. Here we present the results of these investigations. Data support the interpretation that a protein-DNA complex consisting of the γ sequence and at least DnaA and π proteins were needed to support α-directed plasmid maintenance. The α iteron and the G site were essential elements needed for ori α function. Furthermore, two-dimensional gel analysis of replication intermediates of the replicon showed that replication bubbles were initiated within the same small (660 bp) restriction fragment that contained the α-proximal sequences necessary for the origin activity. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for all the cloning experiments. HN356 (IHF+) and HN840 (ihfΔ) cells were used for in vivo replication assays. The list of oligonucleotides used is given in Table 1, and the sequence will be provided upon request. All the strains were grown at 37 °C (unless otherwise stated).

The oligonucleotide pairs carrying the nucleotide sequence to be inserted/deleted or to be mutated were used to carryout PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were treated with DpnI for 4 h, purified, and transformed into DH5α. DNA was isolated from the transformants growing on ampicillin (50 μg/ml) selection plates, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. M13 recombinant DNA carrying the wt or mutated DnaG sites were constructed by first cloning the mini α region into M13mp18 DNA and then mutating the G site by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. For the construction of pMS1 plasmid, the α-γ region from RSF 1040 (22.Crosa J.H. Luttropp L.K. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 454-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ampicillin gene from pUC18 were amplified by PCR using the “Ultra Pfu” DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was digested with DpnI for 4–5 h and purified. The PCR product of ampicillin was digested by EcoRI and ligated with the EcoRI cut, dephosphorylated α-γ fragment. The ligation mixture was transformed into cells carrying a chromosomally integrated π ORF to supply π protein in trans. Plasmids were isolated from the transformants growing on ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and checked by restriction digestion and sequencing. A single colony of the cells carrying mini α-γ and pMS1 plasmids was inoculated into LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The cultures were inoculated into fresh LB medium at 1:100 dilutions and grown further until the optical density at A600 reached 0.45. Cells were harvested, and plasmids isolated by a modified SDS-NaCl method (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 10 ml of 10% sucrose in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, solution. To this, 2 ml of 10 mg/ml lysozyme in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 was added followed by the addition of 8 ml of 0.25 m EDTA. After mixing and incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 4 ml of 10% SDS was added and mixed gently. Finally 6 ml of 5 m NaCl was added and mixed gently, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant collected after ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 20 min was mixed with 0.6 volume of isopropyl alcohol and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The pellet obtained after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min was dissolved in 1× TE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer. An equal volume of 5 m lithium chloride was added to it to precipitate high molecular weight RNA; the supernatant obtained after centrifugation was mixed with 0.6 volume of isopropyl alcohol and after incubation at room temperature for 20 min was centrifuged again. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 1× TE. It was treated with Raise for 2 h at 37 °C and then with proteinase K to digest RNA and protein, respectively. After a 2× phenol/chloroform extraction, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate and dissolved in 1× TE buffer. Replication intermediates from these plasmids were isolated using a BND cellulose column. The mini α-γ plasmid pAM738αγ was digested with BamHI, and the pMS1 plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The products were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in NET buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 m NaCl) and loaded onto BND cellulose columns that were pre-equilibrated with the NET buffer. The columns were washed five times with one column volume of NET buffer. Replication intermediates were eluted with the NET buffer containing 1.8% caffeine. The eluted replication intermediates were precipitated with one volume of isopropyl alcohol at −20 °C for 1–2 h and recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 90 min. The DNA pellet was air dried and dissolved in 1× TE buffer. DNA was precipitated again with ethanol and sodium acetate and dissolved in minimum volume of 1× TE. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as described (24.Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Briefly replication intermediates purified from a 1.5-liter culture were first resolved by electrophoresis for 40–44 h at 30 V without ethidium bromide at room temperature, and then the electrophoresis was carried out in a second dimension in 1.2% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide for 20–24 h at 130 V at 4 °C. After Southern blotting (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), the blots were baked under vacuum and hybridized with a random primer-labeled α region-specific DNA probe. Signals were detected using a phosphorimager. SSB was bought from commercial sources (USB, Cleveland, OH). Polymerase III* was reconstituted from the core complex consisting of the α, θ, and ϵ purified from a recombinant overproducer plasmid (a gift from Dr. Mike O'Donnell, Rockefeller University (25.O'Donnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), The τ clamp loading complex consisting of the τ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits were purified from individual overproducing plasmids and reconstituted (26.Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10291-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also purified all nine subunits of pol III* from a single overproducer plasmid pHOC3.2.1 (a gift from Drs. A. Pritchard and Charles McHenry, UCHSC, Denver, CO). IHF and DnaG proteins were purified as described (27.Nash H.A. Robertson C.A. Flamm E. Weisberg R.A. Miller H.I. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4124-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28.Loscha K. Oakley A.J. Bancia B. Schaeffer P.M. Prosselkov P. Otting G. Wilce M.C. Dixon N.E. Protein Exp. Purif. 2004; 33: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using M13G ori1 and the recombinant SS DNA of M13 containing the template strand of the R6K G site and its mutant forms, in vitro replication reactions were carried out with purified DNA pol III holoenzyme, SSB, and DnaG as described (10.Kubota Y. Arai K. Masai H. Gene. 1993; 126: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 29.Stayton M.M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13205-13212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture that contained 40 mm HEPES, KOH, pH 7.5, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 4% w/v sucrose, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm potassium glutamate, rifampicin 25 μg/ml, GTP, UTP, and CTP (200 μm each) 0.8 mm ATP, dATP, dGTP, dCTP (each at 50 μm) with 100–150 cpm [α-32P]dTTP (80–120 cpm/pmol), 0.2 μg of SS M13 DNA, 2 μg of SSB, and 100 ng of pol III holoenzyme, 75 ng of β-subunit, and 40 ng of primase. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid, and acid-insoluble radioactivity was counted after being trapped on glass fiber filters. Our goal was to identify (i) sequence elements in the mini α and (ii) those present in the γ segment that were necessary for plasmid maintenance by ori α. Because a functional ori γ sequence is needed in cis to elicit α activity, it was necessary to define in vivo conditions under which plasmid maintenance by γ was greatly reduced or eliminated so that α activity could be distinctly measured without the interfering γ activity. It has been shown that replication initiated from ori γ is very inefficient in the absence of IHF; so much so that the intracellular plasmids that are tagged with an ampR marker are maintained at very low copy number in the ihfΔ host cells that did not form colonies on LB plates containing 40–50 μg of ampicillin/ml (15.Filutowicz M. Appelt K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3829-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30.Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of 100 μg/ml ampicillin was even more drastic on colony formation in the absence of IHF, even for plasmids containing a functional α. IHF appears to be needed for initiation at γ because it bends the DNA and thereby promotes interactions of proteins located at binding sites on the opposite sides of the bend. Because the absence of IHF severely inhibited propagation of ori γ, any derivative of a α-γ replicon that allowed the ihfΔ host cells to form colonies on 40–50 μg/ml ampicillin containing Luria-Bertani (LB) plates was taken as preliminary evidence for initiation mediated by the α sequence present in the plasmid. Using this criterion, we proceeded to make specific deletions of the α region that were connected to the obligatory γ sequence as described below. The nucleotide sequence of the mini α fragment is shown in Fig. 2A. The βHR, the α iteron, and the G sites are shown as boxed sequences. The nick corresponds to one of 2 oriTs present in R6K (21.Avila P. Núñez B. de la Cruz F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The putative primer location starting with pppApG etc. is shown in gray. The various deletions of the mini α segments are shown in Fig. 2B. The construct marked with the asterisk was reported before (8.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All plasmids carried the ampR marker. The number of colonies generated by transforming IHF+ and ihfΔ host with equal amounts of DNA from each plasmid construct at both 50 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin are shown in Fig. 2C. The data represent the averages of three independent experiments. Each set of experiments included a plating efficiency control that determined the ratio of the number of colonies generated by equal amounts of pUC19 plasmid DNA transformed into the IHF+ strain divided by that in the ihfΔ host under identical conditions. This ratio was usually close to one and was used to normalize the transformation data. The data marked with asterisks in Fig. 2C indicate that the colony numbers were zero in those cases. The plasmid pAM738αγ, as expected, was propagated in the ihfΔ host. In contrast, the pAM738γ plasmid lacking the α sequence, also as expected, was not maintained in the same host. These served as positive and negative controls for the in vivo experiments, respectively. Deletion of 10 bp from the 5′-end of the β homology region, or a partial or complete deletion of βHR caused significant loss of plasmid maintenance in the absence of IHF. Deletion of all sequences from mini α, downstream of the 3′-end of the G site generated the plasmid pMA290αγ that showed significantly reduced copy number in ihfΔ cells. We extracted the plasmid DNA from cells containing an internal standard (pACYC 174) and confirmed the low copy phenotype by measuring the ratio of the plasmid DNA and that of the internal standard after resolving the DNA by electrophoresis in agarose gels (not shown). Insertions of either 5 or 10 bp inbetween the α iteron and the G site, constructed in an attempt to study the possible effect of change the helical phase between the two sites, abolished plasmid maintenance in ihfΔ cells. Replacement of the α iteron by a StyI restriction site also eliminated plasmid propagation in the ihfΔ host. From these results, we conclude that the iteron, the G site (see below), and the sequence between the two were essential elements for replication control at α. The βHR and the sequence (∼150 bp) following the G site were needed for optimal plasmid propagation in the absence of IHF. It is possible that the sequences starting immediately downstream of the 3′-end of the iteron and extending up to the G site are all part of the extended G site (31.Sims J. Benz Jr., E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and, therefore, this sequence could not be altered without causing loss of plasmid maintenance. We wished to determine whether the G site was an essential component of ori α and whether one could, with appropriate mutations, separate the ability of the site to promote SS to DS replication of the recombinant M13R6Kα (Fig. 3, A and B) from its possible function in R6K plasmid replication in vivo initiated at ori α. The assay was based on the observation that single-stranded (SS) M13 DNA containing the origin of replication of the phage G4 can be replicated to the DS form in the presence of DnaG primase, but in the absence of RNA polymerase. This is because M13 ori requires priming by RNA polymerase whereas that of G4 requires DnaG primase (32.Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar). Therefore, the hybrid SS DNA of M13 Gori1 is able to replicate in vitro when supplied with purified DnaG primase, SSB, DNA polymerase III*, and the processivity factor β (29.Stayton M.M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13205-13212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Bouché J.P. Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 765-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We cloned the mini α segment (Fig. 1B) into an M13mp18 DS vector DNA and generated SS DNA containing the putative R6K G site in the correct orientation. We then performed site-directed mutagenesis of the site and isolated two mutants namely the Not1 and the CAG (Fig. 3A). The rationale for selecting these two mutants was as follows. E. coli DNA primase recognizes the sequence CTG on the template strand and synthesizes the primer starting with pppApGp .., etc. The mutation from 5′-TGGCAG to 5′-CGGTGG was made in the hope of inactivating the consensus initiation sequence of the primer CAG (34.Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Not1 mutation was made in attempt to alter the sequence of the G site located downstream of the initiation site in the hope of reducing its affinity for the primase (Fig. 3A). The in vitro SS to DS replication was carried out in a reaction mixture containing purified DnaG, SSB, and pol III holoenzyme to determine whether one or both of the G site mutants were defective in priming activity in comparison with that of the wt G site template located in the region of ori α and the Gori1 sequences (Fig. 3B). The data (average of three independent experiments presented with S.E. bars) showed that both the M13 Gori1, and the R6K wt templates, as expected, were vigorously replicated in vitro, generating up to 200 pmol of reaction products under the specified reaction conditions. The Not1 mutant was at least as active as the wt α sequence in promoting SS to DS replication. In contrast, the CAG mutation severely reduced the replication in vitro (Fig. 3C). We incorporated the mutant G sites into the α-γ plasmid and measured the ability of the wt and the mutant forms to replicate in vivo in the IHF+ and the isogenic ihfΔ hosts. The data revealed that whereas the wt pAM738αγ replicated with nearly equal efficiency in both of the host strains, the mutant forms of the plasmid namely pMAα-Not1, pMAα-CAG, while maintaining normal self-propagation in vivo in IHF+ cells, were significantly deficient in doing so in the ihfΔ strain (Fig. 3D). Control experiments showed that pUC19 DNA, as expected, replicated equally well in both the hosts. The control plasmid pAM738γ, which included a functional γ but was deleted for α, as expected, could only be maintained in the IHF+ but not in the ihfΔ host (Fig. 3D). The in vitro and in vivo data, taken together, support the conclusion that the primase-loading G site was an essential component of ori α. Previous work using electron microscopy had localized the site of initiation to the middle of the α region (Fig. 1B) (7.Crosa J.H. Luttropp L.K. Falkow S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 443-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35.Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11075-11077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Lovett M.A. Sparks R.B. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 2905-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In fact, the bubble seems to be initiated ∼400 bp away from the genetically indispensable sequence namely the iteron and the G site, although the site where the bubble formed seemed to be dispensable. The preceding observation suggested that initiation of replication, while being absolutely dependent on the ori α sequences, did not necessarily start at a unique location. This phenomenon has also been observed in the plasmid P1 (37.Park K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have also reported that in a reconstituted system, ori γ replication did not start from just one location but at multiple sites within ∼200 bp (38.Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The genetic evidence presented above suggested that α was active in maintaining the α-γ plasmid in ihfΔ cells but did not n"
