Visual responses of a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are publicly available, along with tools for programmatic and three-dimensional interactive access. Brief vignettes illustrate the breadth of potential applications relating structure to function in cortical circuits and neuronal cell biology. Mitochondria and synapse organization are characterized as a function of path length from the soma. Pyramidal connectivity motif frequencies are predicted accurately using a configuration model of random graphs. Pyramidal cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable visual responses. Sample code shows data access and analysis."

Moderate exercise training transiently elevates plasma l-lactate levels and ameliorates obesity-associated type 2 diabetes. However, whether moderate l-lactate administration improves obesity-associated insulin resistance remains unclear. In this study, we defined 800 mg/kg/day as the dose of moderate l-lactate administration. In mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), moderate l-lactate administration for 12 weeks was shown to alleviate weight gain, fat accumulation, and insulin resistance. Along with the phenotype alterations, white adipose tissue thermogenesis was also found to be elevated in HFD-fed mice. Meanwhile, moderate l-lactate administration suppressed the infiltration and proinflammatory M1 polarization of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, l-lactate treatment suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). l-lactate can bind to the surface receptor GPR132, which typically drives the downstream cAMP-PKA signaling. As a nutrient sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) critically controls macrophage inflammatory signaling and phenotype. Thus, utilizing inhibitors of the kinases PKA and AMPK as well as siRNA against GPR132, we demonstrated that GPR132-PKA-AMPKα1 signaling mediated the suppression caused by l-lactate treatment on BMDM M1 polarization. Finally, l-lactate addition remarkably resisted the impairment of lipopolysaccharide-treated BMDM conditional media on adipocyte insulin sensitivity. In summary, moderate l-lactate administration suppresses ATM proinflammatory M1 polarization through activation of the GPR132-PKA-AMPKα1 signaling pathway to improve insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice, suggesting a new therapeutic and interventional approach to obesity-associated type 2 diabetes."

However, the biological role and function of many lncRNAs have not been fully identified. It has been shown that one potential function of lncRNAs is to act as a precursor miRNA and promote the production of multiple miRNAs. However, the function of the miiuy croaker lncRNA MIR122HG has not been explored. In the present study, we show that this differentially expressed teleost fish lncRNA can act as the host gene of miR-122-5p, regulate its expression, and indirectly regulate the expression of potential inflammatory target protein transforming growth factor-β–activated kinase 1. We show that MIR122HG can negatively regulate the transforming growth factor-β–activated kinase 1–triggered NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor 3 signaling pathways and subsequently attenuate the innate immune response. In addition, MIR122HG can promote the replication of Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus and exacerbate the pathological effects caused by viral infection. We conclude that the study of lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA interaction through bioinformatics analysis or experimental-supported analysis can provide information for further elucidation of the functions of fish lncRNAs in innate immunity.

Pathogen infection of organisms induces a series of immune responses that naturally occur for the survival of the organism and the maintenance of immune homeostasis. In these processes, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are responsible for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns in the host immune system (1Hatinguais R. Willment J.A. Brown G.D. PAMPs of the fungal cell wall and mammalian PRRs.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2020; 425: 187-223PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zhou Y. He C. Wang L. Ge B. Post-translational regulation of antiviral innate signaling.Eur. J. Immunol. 2017; 47: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PRRs mediate the activation of different downstream signaling pathways by recognizing the specific molecular characteristics of different pathogenic microorganisms. The activated signaling pathway induces immune response through the production of various inflammatory factors and type 1 interferons (IFN-1) to resist microbial infection or the entry of foreign objects. PRRs mainly include toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I)–like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–containing protein–like receptors, C-type lectins, and some DNA sensors (3Aoshi T. Koyama S. Kobiyama K. Akira S. Ishii K.J. Innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection and vaccination.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2011; 1: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TLRs can recognize both extracellular and intracellular viruses, whereas RLRs are intracellular virus sensors, which are mainly responsible for identifying viral nucleic acid that invades the cytoplasm (4Creagh E.M. O'Neill L.A. TLRs, NLRs and RLRs: A trinity of pathogen sensors that co-operate in innate immunity.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 352-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 5Kawai T. Akira S. The roles of TLRs, RLRs and NLRs in pathogen recognition.Int. Immunol. 2009; 21: 317-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). When the virus infects the host, the virus-specific recognition receptor TLRs detects the pathogen signal and then recruits the toll–interleukin (IL)-1 receptor domain–containing adapter-inducing interferon-β adaptor protein. Toll–IL-1 receptor domain–containing adapter-inducing interferon-β interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor (TRAF) 6 and TRAF3 (6Kawai T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors and their crosstalk with other innate receptors in infection and immunity.Immunity. 2011; 34: 637-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). Activated TRAF6 recruits the kinase receptor–interacting protein 1, which then interacts with the protein and activates the transforming growth factor-β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex, activates NF- κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and induces inflammatory factors (7Kawasaki T. Kawai T. Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). TAK1 also plays an important role in the RLR pathway. After RIG-I recognizes the virus, crucial adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein is recruited, and then interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is activated by the IκB kinase complex, thus promoting the mass production of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) and IFN-1 (8Xu L.-G. Wang Y.-Y. Han K.-J. Li L.-Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.-B. VISA is an adapter protein required for virus-triggered IFN-β signaling.Mol.

Cardif is an adaptor protein in the RIG-I antiviral pathway and is targeted by hepatitis C virus.Nature. 2005; 437: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). The TAK1 molecule is indispensable in these two pathways, indicating that TAK1 is essential in the immune pathway. TAK1, a serine/threonine kinase, is an evolutionarily conserved member of the MAPK family. TAK1 is an important molecule both in TLR and RLR signaling pathways; it could be activated by various proinflammatory cytokines, and it mediates downstream signal transduction (10Sakurai H. Targeting of TAK1 in inflammatory disorders and cancer.Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 2012; 33: 522-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It contains an N-terminal and C-terminal domain, and the C-terminal conformation changes to bind to TAK1-binding protein 1, which is a significant step in kinase activation and complex formation (10Sakurai H. Targeting of TAK1 in inflammatory disorders and cancer.Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 2012; 33: 522-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). TAK1 plays a key role in innate immune pathway, and it can be modified through different ways to regulate the intensity of immune response, including phosphorylation (11Levin R.S. Hertz N.T. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Mukherjee S. Innate immunity kinase TAK1 phosphorylates Rab1 on a hotspot for posttranslational modifications by host and pathogen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: E4776-E4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and ubiquitination (12Zhang L. Chu Q. Chang R. Xu T. Inducible microRNA-217 inhibits NF-κB–and IRF3-driven immune responses in lower vertebrates through targeting TAK1.J. Immunol. 2020; 205: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In mammals, several regulatory molecules regulate the activity of the innate immune response by TAK1. For example, apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 inhibits IL-1-induced NF- κ B activity by blocking TRAF6–TAK1 interactions (13Mochida Y. Takeda K. Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Amagasa T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Ichijo H. ASK1 inhibits interleukin-1-induced NF-κB activity through disruption of TRAF6-TAK1 interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32747-32752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, S6K1 interacts with TAK1, thereby inhibiting the association of TAK1-binding protein 1 and p38α with TAK1, and finally induces the activation of NF- κB and AP-1 by inhibiting the activation of IκB kinase and p38/Jun N-terminal kinase, respectively (14Kim S.Y. Baik K.-H. Baek K.-H. Chah K.-H. Kim K.A. Moon G. Jung E. Kim S.-T. Shim J.-H. Greenblatt M.B. S6K1 negatively regulates TAK1 activity in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 510-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In lower vertebrates such as fish, black carp TAK1 upregulates IRF7-mediated antiviral signal during the activation of host innate immunity (15Peng F. Jin S. Chen Z. Chang H. Xiao J. Li J. Zou J. Feng H. TRIF-mediated antiviral signaling is differentially regulated by TRAF2 and TRAF6 in black carp.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2021; 121: 104073Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, miiuy croaker miR-217 inhibits pathogen-induced antimicrobial and antiviral innate immune responses by targeting the 3′UTR of TAK1 (12Zhang L. Chu Q. Chang R. Xu T. Inducible microRNA-217 inhibits NF-κB–and IRF3-driven immune responses in lower vertebrates through targeting TAK1.J. Immunol. 2020; 205: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Considering that TAK1 is a core kinase that mediates innate immune response in the organism, the regulatory mechanism of TAK1 antiviral pathway in fish should be determined. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which is a noncoding RNA (ncRNA), is greater than 200 nt with mRNA-like structure, and after splicing, it consists of a polyadenylic acid tail and promoter structure (16Hung T. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNA in genome regulation: Prospects and mechanisms.RNA Biol. 2010; 7: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). LncRNA is widely distributed, and lncRNA is found in animals, plants, yeast, and other organisms. It is less conservative in sequence, and only approximately 12% of the lncRNA of humans can be found in other organisms (17Taylor D.H. Chu E.T.J. Spektor R. Soloway P.D. Long non-coding RNA regulation of reproduction and development.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2015; 82: 932-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The function of lncRNA involves almost all biological processes of biological physiology and pathology. It can not only regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism and other physiological processes but also participate in the regulation of various pathological processes of the body. Several important functions of lncRNAs have been identified, including acting as miRNA sponges, binding to RNA-binding protein, and involving in protein translation (18Faghihi M.A. Modarresi F. Khalil A.M. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Morgan T.E. Finch C.E. Laurent III, G.S. Kenny P.J. Wahlestedt C. Expression of a noncoding RNA is elevated in Alzheimer's disease and drives rapid feed-forward regulation of β-secretase.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 19Jiang H. Zhang H. Hu X. Li W. Knockdown of long non-coding RNA XIST inhibits cell viability and invasion by regulating miR-137/PXN axis in non-small cell lung cancer.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2018; 111: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Some lncRNAs can also be used as the host genes of miRNA, and these lncRNAs can produce the mature miRNA and have corresponding biological functions (20Rodriguez A. Griffiths-Jones S. Ashurst J.L. Bradley A. Identification of mammalian microRNA host genes and transcription units.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 21Dhir A. Dhir S. Proudfoot N.J. Jopling C.L. Microprocessor mediates transcriptional termination of long noncoding RNA transcripts hosting microRNAs.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, in humans, lncRNA H19 is the host gene of miR-675-3p and miR-675-5p (22Zou T. Jaladanki S.K. Liu L. Xiao L. Chung H.K. Wang J.-Y. Xu Y. Gorospe M. Wang J.-Y. H19 long noncoding RNA regulates intestinal epithelial barrier function via microRNA 675 by interacting with RNA-binding protein HuR.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2016; 36: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Cai X. Cullen B.R. The imprinted H19 noncoding RNA is a primary microRNA precursor.RNA. 2007; 13: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and it acts as a precursor miRNA to coordinate with mature miRNA to regulate the expression of targeted genes, which is the most classic case that lncRNA functions as a host gene to regulate miRNA. Moreover, lncRNA Gm2044 as the miR-202 host gene indirectly regulates Rbfox2 expression and modulates NCCIT cell proliferation, providing new clues for the pathogenesis and treatment of male infertility in humans (24Liang M. Hu K. He C. Zhou J. Liao Y. Upregulated lncRNA Gm2044 inhibits male germ cell development by acting as miR-202 host gene.Anim. Cells Syst. 2019; 23: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although this regulatory mechanism of lncRNA has been very mature in humans and mice, the research of lncRNA in lower vertebrates such as teleost fish is still unclear. miRNA is another important member of the ncRNA family and has attracted much attention because of its important regulatory role in the past several decades. miRNA mainly affects the expression of the entire gene through base complementary pairing with the seed sequence to the 3′-UTR of the target mRNA (25Liu S.-B. Lu L.-F. Lu X.-B. Li S. Zhang Y.-A. Zebrafish FGFR3 is a negative regulator of RLR pathway to decrease IFN expression.Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2019; 92: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Generally, miRNA has two modes of action, such as degrading the stability of mRNA and inhibiting the translation process of coding genes. In view of the interaction between miRNA and coding genes, the function of miRNA can be used to determine drug treatment targets for various diseases. The process of miRNA formation is well known, and the pre-miRNA undergoes a series of steps such as splicing in the nucleus and finally being transferred to the cytoplasm to obtain a mature miRNA (26Yu Y. Li C. Liu J. Zhu F. Wei S. Huang Y. Huang X. Qin Q. Palmitic acid promotes virus replication in fish cell by modulating autophagy flux and TBK1-IRF3/7 pathway.Front. Immunol. 2020; 11: 1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Rao Y. Ji J. Liao Z. Su H. Su J. GCRV hijacks TBK1 to evade IRF7-mediated antiviral immune responses in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella.Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2019; 93: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). LncRNAs can also produce miRNAs in humans, and these lncRNAs can also obtain functions through miRNAs, similar to precursor miRNAs (28Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (8827) Google Scholar, 29Truscott M. Islam A.B. Lightfoot J. Lopez-Bigas N. Frolov M.V. An intronic microRNA links Rb/E2F and EGFR signaling.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10e1004493Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Kang L. Han C. Yang G. Li H. Li T. Yang S. Liang N. Zhong R. Jia L. Zhu D. miR-378 and its host gene Ppargc1 β exhibit independent expression in mouse skeletal muscle.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2020; 52: 883-890Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). H19 is dependent on miR-675 to enhance the proliferation and invasion of AGS cells in gastric cancer, and the expression of miR-675 is positively correlated with the host gene H19 of miR-675 in patients with gastric cancer (31Liu G. Xiang T. Wu Q.-F. Wang W.-X. Long noncoding RNA H19-derived miR-675 enhances proliferation and invasion via RUNX1 in gastric cancer cells.Oncol. Res. 2016; 23: 99Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The knockdown of the lncRNA H19/miR-675 axis regulates myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury by targeting peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor alpha to protect the heart against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (32Luo H. Wang J. Liu D. Zang S. Ma N. Zhao L. Zhang L. Zhang X. Qiao C. The lncRNA H19/miR-675 axis regulates myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury by targeting PPARα.Mol. Immunol. 2019; 105: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the study of miRNA derived from lncRNA in fish is still in a blind spot. Generally, fish is an excellent biological model for studying the origin of the immune system. Here, we studied a new immune regulation mechanism of teleost fish after virus infection. Through high-throughput sequencing, we identified that the expression of lncRNA MIR122HG was significantly upregulated under viral stimulation. MIR122HG can regulate the production of miR-122-5p, similar to the function of pre-miR-122. We predicted that TAK1 is one of the potential targets of miR-122-5p and confirmed that miR-122-5p can inhibit TAK1 expression at different levels. Moreover, MIR122HG, which is the host gene of miR-122, can downregulate the activity of TAK1 by deriving miR-122-5p. In addition, TAK1 could negatively regulate the innate immune response induced by Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV), thereby promoting the replication of SCRV. Our research provides information for the in-depth understanding of the relationship of lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA and reveals the important position of lncRNA in the immune response of fish. Recent studies have revealed the regulatory potential of many lncRNAs, such as participation in antiviral response. To investigate the function of lncRNA in teleost antiviral immune responses, we treated miiuy croaker with SCRV for 48 h and then performed RNA-Seq analysis by comparing the differential expression of lncRNA between SCRV untreated and treated groups. Approximately 897 differentially expressed lncRNAs have been found (33Chu Q. Xu T. Zheng W. Chang R. Zhang L. Long noncoding RNA MARL regulates antiviral responses through suppression miR-122-dependent MAVS downregulation in lower vertebrates.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16e1008670Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), including MIR122HG. To further verify the RNA-Seq results of the significant abundance of MIR122HG, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of MIR122HG expression in miiuy croaker SCRV-treated spleen and Miichthys miiuy spleen cell (MSpC). The results showed that SCRV remarkably increases the expression of MIR122HG, both in spleen tissue (Fig. 1A) and MSpCs (Fig. 1B), suggesting that MIR122HG may be an immune-related ncRNA. We then evaluated the expression levels of MIR122HG in M. miiuy intestine cells (MICs), MSpCs, M. miiuy kidney cells, M. miiuy muscle cells, and M. miiuy brain cells (Fig. 1C). Among the aforementioned cell lines, MSpCs and MICs showed the highest and the lowest expression of MIR122HG, respectively. Therefore, MIR122HG is an immune-related lncRNA. Then, we used single-molecule full-length transcript sequencing, and the results showed that the length of MIR122HG was 945 bp, which is consistent with that of the Larimichthys crocea and Nibea diacanthus, located in chromosome 18 between genes ALPK2 and NEDD4L (Fig. 1D). Finally, the coding potential calculator computational algorithm was used to predict the coding ability of MIR122HG (Fig. 1E). To further verify that MIR122HG does not have the potential to encode protein, we constructed MIR122HG expression plasmid with FLAG tag (MIR122HG-FLAG). The experimental results showed that MIR122HG-FLAG plasmid did not express protein (Fig. 1F). Therefore, MIR122HG has very low coding ability, which supports that MIR122HG is an ncRNA. To further investigate the biological functions of MIR122HG, we verified the differential upregulation of MIR122HG in vivo and conducted in vitro experiments. As shown in Figure 2A, the full-length expression plasmid of MIR122HG was constructed and named MIR122HG. To determine whether MIR122HG acts as an lncRNA to exert its function, we designed three siNAs (siRNA1, siRNA2, and siRNA3) of MIR122HG and found that siRNA1 had a better knockdown effect (∼40% reduction) than si-negative control (si-NC). siRNA1 was designed on the MIR122HG sequence, except the pre-miR-122 sequence. Then the siRNA1 of MIR122HG was used in all subsequent experiments and written as si-MIR122HG (Fig. 2B). Then, we investigated the effect of MIR122HG on the regulation of immune response through the overexpression of MIR122HG in MICs and knockdown of MIR122HG in MSpCs with SCRV stimulation, respectively. Considering the important role of IFN, ISGs, and inflammatory cytokines in the clearance of invading viruses, we investigated the role of MIR122HG in regulating the expression of IFN, ISGs, and inflammatory cytokines. As shown in Figure 2C, the overexpression of MIR122HG decreased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-8, IFN-2, and Mx1 in MICs under SCRV stimulation. By contrast, knockdown of MIR122HG significantly increased this indicated gene expression in MSpCs with SCRV stimulation (Fig. 2D). Moreover, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were performed to detect cell proliferation rates for further exploring the role of MIR122HG in innate immunity. As shown in Figure 2, E and F, the overexpression of MIR122HG plasmid could decrease the cell proliferation rate, whereas transfection with si-MIR122HG could increase cell proliferation. Therefore, MIR122HG can inhibit cell proliferation. Overall, MIR122HG acts as a negative regulator to modulate the antiviral response and cell proliferation. Many lncRNAs function as primary miRNA transcripts for miRNA to regulate mRNA expression (34Li H. Yu B. Li J. Su L. Yan M. Zhu Z. Liu B. Overexpression of lncRNA H19 enhances carcinogenesis and metastasis of gastric cancer.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). MIR122HG, an lncRNA with a dramatically increased expression upon SCRV stimulation, may participate in immune response in teleost fish. Through sequence alignment, we found that miR-122-5p is matched to MIR122HG precisely; thus, we further investigated the relationship between MIR122HG and miR-122-5p. To confirm the relationship between MIR122HG and miR-122-5p, we examined the expression of miR-122-5p in SCRV-infected spleen tissue and MICs at the same time. As shown in Figure 3, A and B, miR-122-5p levels could be dramatically increased in miiuy croaker SCRV-infected spleen tissue (Fig. 3A) and MICs (Fig. 3B). We have demonstrated in Figure 2, A and B that MIR122HG and si-MIR122HG increased or inhibited the expression levels of MIR122HG, respectively. To further verify the relationship between MIR122HG and miR-122-5p, we detected the effect of gain and loss of MIR122HG on miR-122-5p expression. Figure 3C shows that increasing the levels of MIR122HG by transfecting MICs with the MIR122HG expression vector specifically induced the expression levels of miR-122-5p (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the processing of miR-122-5p from MIR122HG was increased by overexpressing MIR122HG. We also found that the expression of miR-122-5p was significantly reduced when MIR122HG was silenced, thus supporting that MIR122HG overexpression led to increased miR-122-5p levels. Therefore, MIR122HG may be the host gene of miR-122-5p. At the same time, we mutated all the sequences of the mature miR-122-5p on the MIR122HG overexpression plasmid to construct the mutant type (MT) of MIR122HG (MIR122HG-MT). Consequently, the plasmid no longer produced the mature miR-122-5p. We found that transfection of this MIR122HG-MT plasmid into MICs could not increase the level of miR-122-5p (Fig. 3C). This result confirmed that MIR122HG is the host gene of miR-122-5p and positively regulates miR-122-5p expression level. We also detected the expression of MIR122HG and miR-122-5p after transfection of pcDNA3.1, MIR122HG, MIR122HG-MT, NC, or si-MIR122HG in MICs for 24 h and treatment with SCRV infection for 24 h or treated poly (I:C) 18 h. As shown in Figure 3C, miR-122-5p and MIR122HG were highly expressed after transfection with MIR122HG in MICs under SCRV infection or poly (I:C) treatment. Importantly, upon SCRV infection or poly (I:C) treatment, the miR-122-5p level did not change when MIR122HG-MT was transfected into MICs. Therefore, regardless of viral infection, miR-122-5p is derived from MIR122HG. miRNAs affect various biological processes at the post-transcriptional level by targeting the 3′-UTR of mRNA; thus, we probed the potential target genes of miR-122-5p. Bioinformatics software programs were applied to seek the miR-122-5p targets, and we found that its potential target gene TAK1 is related to antiviral immunity. To obtain more direct evidence that miR-122-5p targets TAK1, we constructed the WT and MT of TAK1 3′-UTR reporter vector, as shown in Figure 4A. To detect the effect of miR-122-5p on the protein expression level of TAK1, we constructed the expression plasmid of TAK1 and transfected it with miR-122-5p, MIR122HG, and their respective controls into epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. As shown in Figure 4B, the results revealed that increased miR-122-5p expression led to a decrease in TAK1 protein. We also transfected miR-122-5p in different concentrations of the RNA or overexpressed MIR122HG in a concentration gradient manner in MICs. After 48 h, we detected by qRT–PCR, and the results showed that both miR-122-5p and MIR122HG reduced the expression level of TAK1 at the mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). These results preliminarily demonstrated the inhibitory effect of miR-122-5p and MIR122HG expression on TAK1 at the post-transcriptional level. To further clarify that this negative mechanism is realized through the complementation of miR-122-5p with seed sequences in the 3′UTR region, we performed dual luciferase reporting analysis. EPC cells were transfected with NC or miR-122-5p, along with TAK1 3′-UTR-WT or TAK1 3′-UTR-MT. After 24 h, the luciferase reporter assays showed that the overexpression of miR-122-5p led to a marked decrease of luciferase activity of the TAK1 3′-UTR-WT, whereas no change was observed in the luciferase activity of TAK1 3′-UTR-MT (Fig. 4D). In addition, we inserted the WT or a mutated form of TAK1 3′-UTR into mVenus-C1 vector and examined whether cotransfected with miR-122-5p could suppress the levels of GFP. As shown in Figure 4, E and F, miR-122-5p could significantly inhibit the levels of GFP, indicating the interaction between miR-122-5p and TAK1. To determine the function of MIR122HG on the luciferase activity of TAK1, we performed a similar experiment, and similar results were observed with MIR122HG (Fig. 4, G–I). Our results strongly indicate that TAK1 is the direct target of miR-122-5p. Considering that miR-122-5p could regulate TAK1-mediated antiviral pathways, we investigated whether MIR122HG, as the primary precursor of miR-122-5p, can modulate the NF- κB and IRF3 signaling pathways through the functionality obtained from miR-122-5p. First, MICs were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or MIR122HG, and MSpCs were transfected with NC or si-MIR122HG and infected with SCRV for 6, 12, and 24 h. Then, qRT–PCR analysis was performed, and we found that the increased expression of TAK1 induced by SCRV was attenuated by MIR122HG, and the inhibitory effect was most obvious when SCRV was stimulated for 12 h (Fig. 5A, left panel). Knockdown of MIR122HG caused an increase in the expression level of TAK1 after intracellular infection of SCRV (Fig. 5A, right panel). Protein detection showed that MIR122HG inhibited the expression of TAK1 after SCRV infection, whereas MIR122HG silencing promoted the expression of TAK1 at the protein level (Fig. 6B). To determine whether MIR122HG could reduce TAK1-mediated signaling, we performed dual-luciferase reporter assay. TAK1 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1, MIR122HG, MIR122HG-MT, pRL-TK vector, together with reporter genes, such as NF- κB, IL-8, IFN-2, and IRF3, were transfected into EPC cells. As expected, MIR122HG inhibited the luciferase reporter activity but not MIR122HG-MT (Fig. 6C). Then the concentration (Fig. 6D) and time gradient (Fig. 6E) assays were carried out. Results showed that MIR122HG could inhibit the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner.Figure 6miR-122-5p is able to negatively regulate NF-κB and IRF3 signaling pathway. A, miR-122-5p inhibits the mRNA level of endogenous TAK1 upon SCRV infection. qPCR assays were performed to determine the expression levels of TAK1 in MICs transfected with NC, miR-122-5p, NC-i, or miR-122-5p-i at different SCRV infection times. B, miR-122-5p suppresses the protein expression of endogenous TAK1 upon SCRV infection. MICs were transfected with NC or miR-122-5p at different concentrations, and MSpCs were transfected with NC-i or miR-122-5p-i for 24 h. Then the cells were treated with SCRV for 24 h, and the expression of TAK1 was determined by Western blotting (lower panel), and the gray value ratio about TAK1/tubulin is shown in the upper panel. C, miR-122-5p inhibits TAK1-activated luciferase activity. EPC cells were cotransfected with NC, miR-122-5p, a TAK1 expression plasmid, and a pRL-TK vector, along with an NF-κB, IL-8, IFN-2, or IRF3 reporter gene, to investigate the regulatory effect of miR-122-5p on NF-κB and IRF3 signals. D, relative luciferase activity of the indicated reporters in EPC cells after cotransfec"
https://openalex.org/W4214580471,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) has been recognized as an important biomarker for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) because of its involvement in the process of inflammation and apoptosis in septic AKI. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a condition of disrupted ER homeostasis, is implicated in multiple pathophysiological processes, including kidney disease. Herein, we investigated the correlation between ER stress and septic AKI and further explored how TIMP2 regulated ER stress-mediated apoptosis. To assess the role of TIMP2 in sepsis-induced AKI, we used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model in mice with tubule-specific deficiency of TIMP2 (Ksp-Cre/TIMP2flox/flox ) and their wild-type counterparts. Compared to the wild-type mice, TIMP2-deficient mice demonstrated lower serum creatinine levels and decreased ER stress-mediated apoptosis when subjected to CLP. Interestingly, in human kidney (HK-2) cells, overexpression of TIMP2 caused ER stress, whereas TIMP2 knockdown attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced ER stress and apoptosis. TIMP2 interacted with the binding immunoglobulin protein, an ER chaperone, and facilitates its extracellular secretion, thereby triggering ER stress. This study identified that the deletion of TIMP2 in mouse tubules mitigated sepsis-induced AKI by inhibiting ER stress-mediated apoptosis, which might be a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate renal injury."
https://openalex.org/W4214761687,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves genetic and environmental components. The underlying circuit mechanisms are unclear, but behaviorally, aversion toward unfamiliarity, a hallmark of autism, might be involved. Here, we show that in Shank3ΔC/ΔC ASD model mice, exposure to novel environments lacking familiar features produces long-lasting failure to engage and repetitive behaviors upon re-exposure. Inclusion of familiar features at first context exposure prevented enhanced dopamine transients in tail of striatum (TS) and restored context-specific control of engagement to wild-type levels in Shank3ΔC/ΔC mice. Engagement upon context re-exposure depended on the activity in prelimbic cortex (PreL)-to-TS projection neurons in wild-type mice and was restored in Shank3ΔC/ΔC mice by the chemogenetic activation of PreL→TS projection neurons. Environmental enrichment prevented ASD-like phenotypes by obviating the dependence on PreL→TS activity. Therefore, novel context experience has a key role in triggering ASD-like phenotypes in genetically predisposed mice, and behavioral therapies involving familiarity and enrichment might prevent the emergence of ASD phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4221116127,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major challenge for human health. Finding reliable diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC is highly desired in the clinic. Currently, circulating exosomal lncRNA is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of cancer and lncRNA is also a potential target in cancer therapy. Here, the diagnostic value of a panel based on exosomal lncRNA THEMIS2-211 and PRKACA-202, superior to that of AFP, was identified for diagnosing human HCC. Besides, the performance of exosomal lncRNA THEMIS2-211 alone exceeds that of AFP in diagnosing early-stage HCC patients (stage I). Furthermore, lncRNA THEMIS2-211 is highly expressed in HCC tissues and correlated with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. LncRNA THEMIS2-211 is upregulated and localized in the cytoplasm of HCC cells. LncRNA THEMIS2-211 exerts its biological function as an oncogene that promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT of HCC cells by physically interacting with miR-940 and therefore promoting SPOCK1 expressions. Rescue assays show the regulation of SPOCK1 by lncRNA THEMIS2-211 dependents on miR-940. The discovery of lncRNA THEMIS2-211 further illuminates the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and the THEMIS2-211/miR-940/SPOCK1 axis may act as a potential therapeutic target for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W4214541384,"An immunoregulatory role of stem cells, often mediated by their secretome, has been claimed by several studies. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial components of the secretome. EVs, a heterogeneous group of membranous vesicles released by many cell types into the extracellular space, are now considered as an additional mechanism for intercellular communication. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether human amniotic stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (HASC-EVs) were able to interfere with inflammasome activation in the THP-1 cell line. Two subsets of HASC-EVs were collected by sequential centrifugation, namely HASC-P10 and HASC-P100. We demonstrated that HASC-EVs were neither internalized into nor undertake a direct interaction with THP-1 cells. We showed that HASC-P10 and P100 were able to intrinsically produce ATP, which was further converted to adenosine by 5'-nucleotidase (CD73) and ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39). We found that THP-1 cells conditioned with both types of HASC-EVs failed to activate the NLRP3/caspase-1/inflammasome platform in response to LPS and ATP treatment by a mechanism involving A2a adenosine receptor activation. These results support a role for HASC-EVs as independent metabolic units capable of modifying the cellular functions, leading to anti-inflammatory effects in monocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W4214777832,"The small arginine-rich protein protamine condenses complete genomic DNA into the sperm head. Here, we applied its high RNA binding capacity for spontaneous electrostatic assembly of therapeutic nanoparticles decorated with tumour-cell-specific antibodies for efficiently targeting siRNA. Fluorescence microscopy and DLS measurements of these nanocarriers revealed the formation of a vesicular architecture that requires presence of antibody-protamine, defined excess of free SMCC-protamine, and anionic siRNA to form. Only these complex nanoparticles were efficient in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft models, when the oncogene KRAS was targeted via EGFR-mediated delivery. To show general applicability, we used the modular platform for IGF1R-positive Ewing sarcomas. Anti-IGR1R-antibodies were integrated into an antibody-protamine nanoparticle with an siRNA specifically against the oncogenic translocation product EWS/FLI1. Using these nanoparticles, EWS/FLI1 knockdown blocked in vitro and in vivo growth of Ewing sarcoma cells. We conclude that these antibody-protamine-siRNA nanocarriers provide a novel platform technology to specifically target different cell types and yet undruggable targets in cancer therapy by RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W4214582283,"Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for hearing. A short, OHC-specific enhancer is necessary but not yet available for gene therapeutic applications in OHC damage. Such damage is a major cause of deafness. Prestin is a motor protein exclusively expressed in OHCs. We hypothesized that the cis-regulatory DNA fragment deletion of Slc26a5 would affect its expression. We tested this hypothesis by conducting CRISPR/Cas9-mediated large DNA fragment deletion of mouse Slc26a5 intron regions. First, starting from a ~13 kbp fragment, step-by-step, we narrowed down the sequence to a 1.4 kbp segment. By deleting either a 13 kbp or 1.4 kbp fragment, we observed delayed Prestin expression. Second, we showed that 1.4 kbp was an OHC-specific enhancer because enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was highly and specifically expressed in OHCs in a transgenic mouse where EGFP was driven by the 1.4 kbp segment. More importantly, specific EGFP was also driven by its homologous 398 bp fragment in human Slc26a5. This suggests that the enhancer is likely to be evolutionarily conserved across different species."
https://openalex.org/W4214580884,"Breast cancer (BC) is the second cause of cancer-related deceases in the worldwide female population. Despite the successful treatment advances, 25% of BC develops resistance to current therapeutic regimens, thereby remaining a major hurdle for patient management. Current therapies, targeting the molecular events underpinning the adaptive resistance, still require effort to improve BC treatment. Using BC sphere cells (BCSphCs) as a model, here we showed that BC stem-like cells express high levels of Myc, which requires the presence of the multifunctional DNA/RNA binding protein Sam68 for the DNA-damage repair. Analysis of a cohort of BC patients displayed that Sam68 is an independent negative factor correlated with the progression of the disease. Genetic inhibition of Sam68 caused a defect in PARP-induced PAR chain synthesis upon DNA-damaging insults, resulting in cell death of TNBC cells. In contrast, BC stem-like cells were able to survive due to an upregulation of Rad51. Importantly, the inhibition of Rad51 showed synthetic lethal effect with the silencing of Sam68, hampering the cell viability of patient-derived BCSphCs and stabilizing the growth of tumor xenografts, including those TNBC carrying BRCA mutation. Moreover, the analysis of Myc, Sam68 and Rad51 expression demarcated a signature of a poor outcome in a large cohort of BC patients. Thus, our findings suggest the importance of targeting Sam68-PARP1 axis and Rad51 as potential therapeutic candidates to counteract the expansion of BC cells with an aggressive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W4214644720,"Yes-associated protein (YAP), a central effector in the Hippo pathway, is involved in the regulation of organ size, stem cell self-renewal, and tissue regeneration. In this study, we observed YAP activation in patients with alcoholic steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Accumulation of this protein in the nucleus was also observed in murine livers that were damaged after chronic-plus-single binge or moderate ethanol ingestion combined with carbon tetrachloride intoxication (ethanol/CCl4). To understand the role of this transcriptional coactivator in alcohol-related liver injury, we knocked out the Yap1 gene in hepatocytes of floxed homozygotes through adeno-associated virus (AAV8)-mediated deletion utilizing Cre recombinase. Yap1 hepatocyte-specific knockouts (KO) exhibited hemorrhage, massive hepatic necrosis, enhanced oxidative stress, elevated hypoxia, and extensive infiltration of CD11b+ inflammatory cells into hepatic microenvironments rich for connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) during ethanol/CCl4-induced liver damage. Analysis of whole-genome transcriptomics indicated upregulation of genes involved in hypoxia and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, whereas genes related to hepatocyte proliferation, progenitor cell activation, and ethanol detoxification were downregulated in the damaged livers of Yap1 KO. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh)1a1, a gene that encodes a detoxification enzyme for aldehyde substrates, was identified as a potential YAP target because this gene could be transcriptionally activated by a hyperactive YAP mutant. The ectopic expression of the human ALDH1A1 gene caused increase in hepatocyte proliferation and decrease in hepatic necrosis, oxidative stress, ECM remodeling, and inflammation during ethanol/CCl4-induced liver damage. Taken together, these observations indicated that YAP was crucial for liver repair during alcohol-associated injury. Its regulation of ALDH1A1 represents a new link in liver regeneration and detoxification."

The aims of this study were to investigate biopsychosocial factors that might further aggravate fear of COVID-19, and to establish a biopsychosocial model of severe fear of COVID-19. Methods 368 participants were included in this study. Biopsychosocial factors observed comprised biological factors (somatic risk), psychological factors (state/trait anxiety, physical symptoms of anxiety, severe health anxiety, specific phobias, depression), and psychosocial factors (social support, financial losses, social media consumption, social contacts with COVID-19 infected people). Psychometric questionnaires included State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory, Whiteley-Index / Illness Attitude Scales, Specific Phobia Questionnaire, WHO-5 and Social Support Survey. Results 162/368 (44.0%) participants had almost no fear, 170/368 (46.2%) participants had moderate fear, and 45/368 (12.2%) participants had severe fear of COVID-19. Female participants showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than male participants (gender: χ2 = 18.47, p&lt;0.001). However, the level of fear of COVID-19 increased in male participants when they had contact with people who were infected with COVID-19, while in contrast the level of fear of COVID-19 decreased in female participants when they had such contacts [ANCOVA: fear of COVID-19 (contact x gender): F(1,363) = 5.596, p = .019]. Moreover, participants without relationships showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (marital status: χ2 = 14.582, p = 0.024). Furthermore, financial losses due to the COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of fear of COVID-19 [ANCOVA: fear of COVID-19(financial loss x gender): F(1, 363) = 22.853, p&lt; .001]. Multiple regression analysis revealed female gender, severe health anxiety (WI-IAS) and state /trait anxiety (STAI) as significant predictors of severe fear of COVID-19. Conclusion In this study significant predictors of severe fear of COVID-19 were female gender, pre-existing state and trait anxiety, as well as severe health anxiety. The finding of significant predictors of fear of COVID-19 might contribute to detect people who might suffer most from severe, overwhelming fear of COVID-19 at an early stage."

To better understand the prevalence and genetic diversity of AAstVs in China, 1210 poultry samples collected from eight provinces were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect AAstV infections in different poultry populations. Then, Open reading frames 2 (ORF2) was amplified by specific primers, and the genetic evolution was analyzed. Our surveillance data demonstrate the diversity of AAstVs in China insofar as we detected 17 AAstVs, including seven chicken astroviruses (CAstVs), five avian nephritis viruses (ANVs), two goose astroviruses (GoAstVs), two duck astrovirus (DAstVs), and one new AAstV belonging to Avastrovirus Group 3 . The positive rate of AAstV infection was 1.40%. Host analysis showed that CAstVs and ANVs were isolated from chickens, DAstVs and GoAstVs were isolated from ducks. Host-species-specific AAstVs infections were also identified in numerous samples collected at each stage of production. This study provides further evidence to better understand the epidemiology of AAstVs in different species of poultry in China."
https://openalex.org/W4213412361,"The ubiquitous UbiD family of reversible decarboxylases is implicated in a wide range of microbial processes and depends on the prenylated flavin mononucleotide cofactor for catalysis. However, only a handful of UbiD family members have been characterized in detail, and comparison between these has suggested considerable variability in enzyme dynamics and mechanism linked to substrate specificity. In this study, we provide structural and biochemical insights into the indole-3-carboxylic acid decarboxylase, representing an UbiD enzyme activity distinct from those previously studied. Structural insights from crystal structure determination combined with small-angle X-ray scattering measurements reveal that the enzyme likely undergoes an open-closed transition as a consequence of domain motion, an event that is likely coupled to catalysis. We also demonstrate that the indole-3-carboxylic acid decarboxylase can be coupled with carboxylic acid reductase to produce indole-3-carboxyaldehyde from indole + CO2 under ambient conditions. These insights provide further evidence for a common mode of action in the widespread UbiD enzyme family."

This study examines these mitigation measures and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK.A school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank.Responses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1-5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement two metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a two metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school.Implementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, two metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school. Primary school staff found teaching challenging during COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger learners and those with additional learning needs."
https://openalex.org/W4213449594,"Dengue is one of the most dominant arthropod-borne viral diseases, infecting at least 390 million people every year throughout the world. Despite this, there is no effective treatment against dengue, and the only available vaccine has already been withdrawn owing to the significant adverse effects. Therefore, passive immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies is now being sought as a therapeutic option. To date, many dengue monoclonal antibodies have been identified, most of which are serotype-specific, and only a few of which are cross-reactive. Furthermore, antibodies that cross-react within serotypes are weakly neutralizing and frequently induce antibody-dependent enhancement, which promotes viral entry and replication. Therefore, broadly neutralizing antibodies with no risk of antibody-dependent enhancement are required for the treatment of dengue. Here, we developed a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody from an anti-fusion loop E53 antibody (PDB: 2IGF). We introduced previously predicted favorable complementarity-determining region (CDR) mutations into the gene encoding the scFv antibody for affinity maturation, and the resultant variants were tested in vitro against the highly conserved fusion and bc epitope of the dengue virus envelope protein. We show some of these scFv variants with two to three substitution mutations in three different CDRs possess affinity constants (KD) ranging from 20 to 200 nM. The scFv-mutant15, containing D31L, Y105W, and S227W substitutions, showed the lowest affinity constant, (KD = 24 ± 7 nM), approximately 100-fold lower than its parental construct. We propose that the scFv-derivative antibody may be a good candidate for the development of an effective and safe immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W4226343878,"The polysaccharide capsule of fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a critical virulence factor that has historically evaded complete characterization. Cryptococcal polysaccharides are known to either remain attached to the cell as capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) or to be shed into the extracellular space as exopolysaccharides (EPSs). While many studies have examined the properties of EPS, far less is known about CPS. In this work, we detail the development of new physical and enzymatic methods for the isolation of CPS which can be used to explore the architecture of the capsule and isolated capsular material. We show that sonication or Glucanex enzyme cocktail digestion yields soluble CPS preparations, while use of a French pressure cell press or Glucanex digestion followed by cell disruption removed the capsule and produced cell wall-associated polysaccharide aggregates that we call ""capsule ghosts"", implying an inherent organization that allows the CPS to exist independent of the cell wall surface. Since sonication and Glucanex digestion were noncytotoxic, it was also possible to observe the cryptococcal cells rebuilding their capsule, revealing the presence of reducing end glycans throughout the capsule. Finally, analysis of dimethyl sulfoxide-extracted and sonicated CPS preparations revealed the conservation of previously identified glucuronoxylomannan motifs only in the sonicated CPS. Together, these observations provide new insights into capsule architecture and synthesis, consistent with a model in which the capsule is assembled from the cell wall outward using smaller polymers, which are then compiled into larger ones."
https://openalex.org/W4214769990,"Objectives The objective of this report was to provide a review of the minipig intraoral dental implant model including a meta-analysis to estimate osseointegration and crestal bone remodeling. Methods A systematic review including PubMed and EMBASE databases through June 2021 was conducted. Two independent examiners screened titles/abstracts and selected full-text articles. Studies evaluating titanium dental implant osseointegration in native alveolar bone were included. A quality assessment of reporting was performed. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were produced for bone-implant contact (BIC), first BIC, and crestal bone level. Results 125 out of 249 full-text articles were reviewed, 55 original studies were included. Quality of reporting was generally low, omissions included animal characteristics, examiner masking/calibration, and sample size calculation. The typical minipig model protocol included surgical extraction of the mandibular premolars and first molar, 12±4 wks post-extraction healing, placement of three narrow regular length dental implants per jaw quadrant, submerged implant healing and 8 wks of osseointegration. Approximately 90% of studies reported undecalcified incandescent light microscopy histometrics. Overall, mean BIC was 59.88% (95%CI: 57.43–62.33). BIC increased significantly over time (p&lt;0.001): 40.93 (95%CI: 34.95–46.90) at 2 wks, 58.37% (95%CI: 54.38–62.36) at 4 wks, and 66.33% (95%CI: 63.45–69.21) beyond 4 wks. Variability among studies was mainly explained by differences in observation interval post-extraction and post-implant placement, and implant surface. Heterogeneity was high for all studies (I 2 &gt; 90%, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions The minipig intraoral dental implant model appears to effectively demonstrate osseointegration and alveolar bone remodeling similar to that observed in humans and canine models."
https://openalex.org/W4214530164,"Introduction Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is the most serious and pervasive yet under-recognized human rights violation in the world, particularly in Ethiopia. Hence, the objective of this study was to find the spatial distribution of IPV and its determinant factors in Ethiopia. Methods Secondary data analysis was conducted among 2,687 reproductive age group women (15–49 years). The distribution of IPV across the country was observed by ArcGIS software. In SaTScan software, the Bernoulli model was fitted by Kulldorff methods to identify the purely spatial clusters of IPV. Besides, Generalized Structural Equation Model (GSEM) was used to determine factors associated with each domain of IPV (physical, emotional &amp; sexual violence). Result The spatial distribution of IPV was found to be clustered in Ethiopia with Global Moran’s I 0.09 (p &lt; 0.001), and the highest IPV cluster was observed in Oromia (p &lt; 0.001), Somali (p &lt; 0.001) and SNNP (p&lt;0.001) regions. Watching television and not having attitudes toward wife beating were negatively associated with physical violence. Being rich and nonsmoker were inversely associated with emotional violence. The odds of experiencing sexual violence were high among pregnant women and wives of uneducated husbands/partners. In addition, women’s decision-making autonomy and husband/partner drinking alcohol have positive and negative associations with all domains of IPV respectively. Conclusion There was a significant clustering of IPV in Ethiopia and the highest IPV cluster was observed in Oromia, Somali and SNNP regions. Being rich, watching television, not having attitudes toward wife beating, women’s decision-making autonomy, and husband’s/partner’s high education and non-alcohol drinker status were negatively associated with IPV. The likelihood of experiencing IPV was also high among smokers and pregnant women. Thus, we recommend that improving the economic status of the household through social protection and empowerment of women in decision-making autonomy by education and employment and increasing community awareness about the consequences of IPV with particular emphasis on Oromia, Somali and SNNP regions is essential."

Thus, this study aimed to identify the motivations, barriers and preferences towards exercise among female undergraduates in Malaysia.A non-probability purposive sampling was used for the recruitment process. The inclusion criteria of the participants were registered female undergraduates and aged between 18-30 years old. A semi-structured in-depth interview was used to collect topic-related information from the participants and signed consents were obtained prior to the interview. The interview questions were on respondents' understanding of exercise, motivation and barriers to exercise, and exercise preferences. The recruitment process was conducted until the data was saturated. All interviews were audio recorded and manually transcribed verbatim. NVivo 11 was used to conduct the inductive analysis of the data to develop themes for motivation and barriers to exercise. For exercise preferences, four predetermined themes were used.A total of 26 respondents participated in this study. Eight themes were found for motivation to exercise, with the most common themes being maintaining or improving appearance, health benefits and togetherness. For barriers of exercising, five themes were found, and the most common ones were disliking exercise and no motivation. For exercise preferences, most respondents preferred a structured exercise program with flexibility in terms of when and where the exercise could be conducted. Light or moderate intensity exercise for 10-30 minutes with a frequency of 1-2 times a week was desired the most among the respondents.In conclusion, personal and environmental factors play important roles in motivating or hampering female undergraduates to exercise, and a structured program was the preferred mode of exercise of these respondents. A new exercise module was designed based on this needs assessment with a 70% acceptance rate among the participants. These findings can help the future development of more exercise modules tailored to female university students."
https://openalex.org/W4214696278,"Background The international use of and interest in veterinary naturopathy and complementary medicine are increasing. There are diverse modes of treatment, and owners seem to be well informed. However, there is a lack of data that describes the state of naturopathic or complementary veterinary medicine in Germany. This study aims to address the issue by mapping the currently used treatment modalities, indications, existing qualifications, and information pathways. In order to map the ongoing controversy, this study records the advantages and disadvantages of these medicines as experienced by veterinarians. Demographic influences are investigated to describe distributional impacts on using veterinary naturopathy and complementary medicine. Methods A standardised questionnaire was used for the cross-sectional survey. It was distributed throughout Germany in a written and digital format from September 2016 to January 2018. Because of the open nature of data collection, the return rate of questionnaires could not be calculated. To establish a feasible timeframe, active data collection stopped when the previously calculated limit of 1061 questionnaires was reached. With the included incoming questionnaires of that day a total of 1087 questionnaires were collected. Completely blank questionnaires and those where participants did not meet the inclusion criteria (were not included, leaving 870 out of 1087 questionnaires to be evaluated. A literature review and the first test run of the questionnaire identified the following treatment modalities: homoeopathy, phytotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), biophysical treatments, manual treatments, Bach Flower Remedies, neural therapy, homotoxicology, organotherapy, and hirudotherapy which were included in the questionnaire. Categorical items were processed using descriptive statistics in absolute and relative numbers based on the population of completed answers provided for each item. Multiple choices were possible. Metric data were not normally distributed (Shapiro Wilk Test); hence the median, minimum, and maximum were used for description. The impact of demographic data on the implementation of veterinary naturopathy and complementary techniques was calculated using the Mann-Whitney-U-Test for metric data and the exact Fisher-Test for categorical data. Results Overall 85.4% (n = 679 of total 795 non-blank data sets) of all the questionnaire participants used naturopathy and complementary medicine. The treatments most commonly used were complex homoeopathy (70.4%, n = 478), phytotherapy (60.2%, n = 409), classic homoeopathy (44.3%, n = 301) and biophysical treatments (40.1%, n = 272). The most common indications were orthopedic (n = 1798), geriatric (n = 1428) and metabolic diseases (n = 1124). Over the last five years, owner demand for naturopathy and complementary treatments was rated as growing by 57.9% of respondents (n = 457 of total 789). Veterinarians most commonly used scientific journals and publications as sources for information about naturopathic and complementary contents (60.8%, n = 479 of total 788). These were followed by advanced training acknowledged by the ATF (Academy for Veterinary Continuing Education, an organisation that certifies independent veterinary continuing education in Germany) (48.6%, n = 383). The current information about naturopathy and complementary medicine was rated as adequate or nearly adequate by a plurality (39.5%, n = 308) of the respondents of this question. Further, 27.7% (n = 216) of participants chose the option that they were not confident to answer this question and 91 answers were left blank. The most commonly named advantages in using veterinary naturopathy and complementary medicine were the expansion of treatment modalities (73.5%, n = 566 of total 770), customer satisfaction (70.8%, n = 545) and lower side effects (63.2%, n = 487). The ambiguity of studies, as well as the unclear evidence of mode of action and effectiveness (62.1%, n = 483) and high expectations of owners (50.5%, n = 393) were the disadvantages mentioned most frequently. Classic homoeopathy, in particular, has been named in this context (78.4%, n = 333 of total 425). Age, gender, and type of employment showed a statistically significant impact on the use of naturopathy and complementary medicine by veterinarians (p &lt; 0.001). The university of final graduation showed a weaker but still statistically significant impact (p = 0.027). Users of veterinary naturopathy and complementary medicine tended to be older, female, self-employed and a higher percentage of them completed their studies at the University of Berlin. The working environment (rural or urban space) showed no statistical impact on the veterinary naturopathy or complementary medicine profession. Conclusion This is the first study to provide German data on the actual use of naturopathy and complementary medicine in small animal science. Despite a potential bias due to voluntary participation, it shows a large number of applications for various indications. Homoeopathy was mentioned most frequently as the treatment option with the most potential disadvantages. However, it is also the most frequently used treatment option in this study. The presented study, despite its restrictions, supports the need for a discussion about evidence, official regulations, and the need for acknowledged qualifications because of the widespread application of veterinary naturopathy and complementary medicine. More data regarding the effectiveness and the mode of action is needed to enable veterinarians to provide evidence-based advice to pet owners."
https://openalex.org/W4214724838,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) exerts various biological activities through six characterized G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1-6 ). While LPA-LPA1 signaling contributes toward the demyelination and retraction of C-fiber and induces neuropathic pain, the effects of LPA-LPA1 signaling on acute nociceptive pain is uncertain. This study investigated the role of LPA-LPA1 signaling in acute nociceptive pain using the formalin test. The pharmacological inhibition of the LPA-LPA1 axis significantly attenuated formalin-induced nociceptive behavior. The LPA1 mRNA was expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and was particularly abundant in SGCs surrounding large DRG neurons, which express neurofilament 200. Treatment with LPA1/3 receptor (LPA1/3 ) antagonist inhibited the upregulation of glial markers and inflammatory cytokines in DRG following formalin injection. The LPA1/3 antagonist also attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, especially in SGCs and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein in the dorsal horn following formalin injection. LPA amounts after formalin injection to the footpad were quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and LPA levels were found to be increased in the innervated DRGs. Our results indicate that LPA produced in the innervated DRGs promotes the activation of SGCs through LPA1 , increases the sensitivity of primary neurons, and modulates pain behavior. These results facilitate our understanding of the pathology of acute nociceptive pain and demonstrate the possibility of the LPA1 on SGCs as a novel target for acute pain control."

It has not been studied yet, whether fair COVID-19 vaccination coverage achieved in Hungary is accompanied with fair effectiveness in SCs. Using census data, the vaccination coverage in SCs and the complementary areas (CAs) in the same settlements of the country was determined. To describe the settlement level differences, the vaccination coverage (until June 30, 2021) in SCs were compared to those in CAs by age, sex, and eligibility for exemption certificate standardized measures. Aggregating settlement level data, the level of geographic discrimination in Hungary was also determined. According to nationwide aggregates, crude vaccination coverage was significantly lower in SCs (40.05%, 95% CI 39.87%-40.23%) than in CAs (65.42%, 95% CI 65.37%-65.46%). The relative standardized vaccination coverage was 0.643 (95% CI 0.639-0.647) in SCs. A total of 437 of the 938 investigated settlements showed significant local vaccination disparities. Hungarian citizens living in SCs, mainly of Roma ethnicity, are a distinct high-risk group. Special intervention adapted to SCs is needed to mitigate inequality in vaccination coverage and further consequences of the pandemic."

Specialized lipid mediators (SPM) mediate resolution which attenuates inflammation and downstream NIH. We investigated the effects of a synthetic analogue of resolvin D1 (RvD1) on vascular cells and in a model of rat carotid angioplasty.Human venous VSMC and endothelial cells (EC) were employed in migration, cell shape, toxicity, proliferation and p65 nuclear translocation assays. Murine RAW 264.7 cells were utilized to test the effect of pro-resolving compounds on phagocytic activity. A model of rat carotid angioplasty was used to evaluate the effects of 17R/S-benzo-RvD1 (benzo-RvD1) and 17R-RvD1 applied to the adventitia via 25% Pluronic gel. Immunostaining was utilized to examine Ki67 expression and leukocyte recruitment. Morphometric analysis was performed on arteries harvested 14 days after injury.Exposure to benzo-RvD1 attenuated PDGF- stimulated VSMC migration across a range of concentrations (0.1-100 nM), similar to that observed with 17R-RvD1. Pre-treatment with either Benzo-RvD1 or 17R-RvD1 (10, 100nM) attenuated PDGF-BB-induced VSMC cytoskeletal changes to nearly baseline dimensions. Benzo-RvD1 demonstrated modest anti-proliferative activity on VSMC and EC at various concentrations, without significant cytotoxicity. Benzo-RvD1 (10nM) inhibited p65 nuclear translocation in cytokine-stimulated EC by 21% (p<0.05), similar to 17R-RvD1. Consistent with pro-resolving activities of other SPM, both 17R-RvD1 and benzo-RvD1 increased the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells against S. Aureus and Zymosan particles. There were no significant differences in Ki-67 or CD45 staining observed on day 3 after angioplasty. Periadventitial treatment with benzo-RvD1 reduced carotid neointimal area at 14 days compared to control (0.08 mm2 v. 0.18 mm2; p<0.05), with similar efficacy to 17R-RvD1.17R/S-benzo-RvD1 and 17R-RvD1 exhibit similar pro-resolving and anti-migratory activity in cell-based assays, and both compounds attenuated NIH following acute arterial injury in rats. Further studies of the mechanisms of resolution following vascular injury, and the translational potential of SPM analogues, are indicated."

Aberrant tau homeostasis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we performed an unbiased high-content protein profiling assay by incubating recombinant human tau on microarrays containing thousands of human polypeptides. Among the putative tau-binding partners, we identify SAH hydrolase–like protein 1/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)–binding protein (AHCYL1/IRBIT), a member of the SAH hydrolase family and a previously described modulator of IP3R activity. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, we show that endogenous as well as overexpressed tau can physically interact with AHCYL1/IRBIT in brain tissues and cultured cells. Proximity ligation assay experiments demonstrate that tau overexpression may modify the close localization of AHCYL1/IRBIT to IP3R at the endoplasmic reticulum. Together, our experimental evidence indicates that tau interacts with AHCYL1/IRBIT and potentially modulates AHCYL1/IRBIT function.

Based on familial cases of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, Pick's diseases, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy (24Goedert M. Ghetti B.

Aging Neurosci. 2015; 7: 192Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), disease-causing mutations in the MAPT (MAP tau) gene lead to heterogeneous molecular consequences. In this regard, most tau variants exhibit a higher tendency to form insoluble filaments and have different affinities for interacting partners or subcellular structures (e.g., microtubule, plasma membrane). Most relevant histopathological and clinical features include the pronounced presence of post-translationally modified tau in various brain areas, cognitive impairments, diffuse atrophy of the neocortex, and medial temporal lobe associated with neurodegenerative processes (17Crary J.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Schneider J.A. Abisambra J.F. Abner E.L. Alafuzoff I. Arnold S.E. Attems J. Beach T.G. Bigio E.H. Cairns N.J. Dickson D.W. Gearing M. Grinberg L.T.

In patients affected by sporadic forms of AD, tau is detectable at early stages in neuronal dendrites and soma of neuroanatomically connected brain areas, such as the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus (26Braak H. Braak E. Staging of Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary changes.Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 27Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11172) Google Scholar). In this regard, aberrant tau phosphorylation may lead to its missorting in the dendritic compartment, impairing the maintenance of dendritic structures and, consequently, undermining postsynaptic structures (28Ittner L.M.

Tau mislocalization to dendritic spines mediates synaptic dysfunction independently of neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1067-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Since dendritic spine remodeling correlates with the cognitive performance of an animal (31Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Harris K.M. Structural components of synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7a021758Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32Rochefort N.L. Konnerth A. Dendritic spines: From structure to in vivo function.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to believe that tau-mediated dysregulation of these subcellular structures may contribute to the cognitive decline of patients with tauopathies. As such, the pathogenic contribution of aberrant tau biology in AD remains a long-lasting research priority (1Guo T. Noble W. Hanger D.P. Roles of tau protein in health and disease.Acta Neuropathol. 2017; 133: 665-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 3Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev.

Dendritic tau in Alzheimer's disease.Neuron. 2018; 99: 13-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While a large number of studies have focused on tau in many pathological settings, less is known about the physiological function of tau beyond its role in microtubule stabilization and axonal transport (3Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this regard, because of its intrinsic properties and binding affinity to a large spectrum of proteins (34Morris M. Maeda S. Vossel K. Mucke L. The many faces of tau.Neuron. 2011; 70: 410-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), tau may hijack regulators of metabolic pathways and signaling cascades that orchestrate critical biological processes, as previously described for phosphatase and tensin homolog and the downstream insulin pathway (35Marciniak E. Leboucher A. Caron E. Ahmed T. Tailleux A. Dumont J. Issad T. Gerhardt E. Pagesy P. Vileno M. Bournonville C. Hamdane M. Bantubungi K. Lancel S. Demeyer D. et al.Tau deletion promotes brain insulin resistance.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems plausible that physiological as well as pathological mislocalization of tau may shift tau promiscuous binding properties toward unconventional partners, expanding the tau regulatory network. Consistently, the identification of novel interactors and modifiers of tau homeostasis may help to understand the complex biology of this unique MAP in cell physiology. In an attempt to address this need, we carried out an unbiased in vitro high-content protein profiling of putative htau40 interactors. We identified SAH hydrolase–like protein 1/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)–binding protein (AHCYL1/IRBIT) as a novel putative tau-interacting protein in cultured cells. Our study reveals a previously unknown tau interactor that might modulate intracellular processes, thereby broadening the pathophysiological importance of tau in various aspects of cell biology. With the purpose of finding novel molecular interactors of tau, we employed high-content protein microarrays for screening of functional polypeptides that can physically bind recombinant htau40 (Fig. 1A). Using 50 and 5 ng of Escherichia coli–derived recombinant human full-length tau protein (36Barghorn S. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Tau paired helical filaments from Alzheimer's disease brain and assembled in vitro are based on beta-structure in the core domain.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1694-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we detected 124 polypeptides that interact with htau40 in our experimental conditions (Fig. 1 and Table S1). For 121 sequences, we could confirm the annotated ORF ID across multiple databases (Table S1). Among them, DNAJ/heat shock protein 40 kD, S100 calcium-binding protein B, and bridging integrator 1 were previously described as bona fide tau interactors (37Chapuis J. Hansmannel F. Gistelinck M.

It is known that the C-terminal region of AHCYL1/IRBIT is highly homologous to the adenosylhomocysteinase AHCY, whereas the N-terminal region (residues 1–105) is unique for the IRBIT family members across phyla (44Ando H.

Since recombinant htau40 could bind two AHCYL1/IRBIT polypeptides in our microarrays (Table S1), we sought to confirm the physical interaction between tau and AHCYL1/IRBIT by using conventional coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. As a first step, we performed co-IPs using hippocampi from adult mice (Fig. 1B). Lysates were incubated with primary antibodies against tau or IRBIT, and immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted to assess IRBIT and tau, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with a possible physical interaction as shown in vitro (Fig. 1A), we found that tau and IRBIT could immunoprecipitate each other from hippocampus lysates (Fig. 1, C and D). To substantiate this line of evidence, we overexpressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged htau40 in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (Fig. 1E), which have been widely used in the field to assess tau post-translational modifications and interactions (46Houck A.L. Hernandez F. Avila J. A simple model to study tau pathology.J. Exp. Neurosci. 2016; 10: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After exposing cells to the reversible crosslinker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), we lysed the cells and performed co-IPs using a primary antibody against HA. Immunoblot analysis revealed a substantial amount of endogenous AHCYL1/IRBIT in the co-IP cell extracts (Fig. 1F). Reciprocal co-IP with AHCYL1/IRBIT antibody pulled down HA-tagged tau in cell homogenates (Fig. 1G). These data show that tau physically interacts with AHCYL1/IRBIT in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. To further support our findings in an additional cellular system, we employed human iPSC, from which we generated small-molecule neural progenitor cells (smNPCs) that were then spontaneously differentiated into neuronal cultures. Since these cells express high levels of tau isoforms normally associated with embryogenesis (13Iovino M. Agathou S. Gonzalez-Rueda A. Del Castillo Velasco-Herrera M. Borroni B. Alberici A. Lynch T.

Consistently, reciprocal co-IP using AHCYL1/IRBIT antibody could retrieve endogenous tau in homogenates from smNPC-derived neurons (Fig. 1J). Taken together, these biochemical analyses suggest that tau can physically bind AHCYL1/IRBIT in a protein microarray as well as in cultured cells. To detect potential interactions between endogenous proteins, we employed proximity ligation assays (PLAs), which enable in situ detection of proteins at close distance (<40 nm) by combining conventional immunostainings with cycles of DNA amplifications (47Fredriksson S. Gullberg M. Jarvius J. Olsson C. Pietras K. Gustafsdottir S.M. Ostman A. Landegren U. Protein detection using proximity-dependent DNA ligation assays.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). To do so, cells were first incubated with two primary antibodies, followed by a pair of oligonucleotide-attached secondary antibodies. After ligation and amplification, fluorescent dot-like structures were imaged and quantified using high-resolution confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). We employed mouse-derived primary cortical neurons (Fig. 2B) and set up our PLA-positive conditions by incubating each primary antibody (i.e., IRBIT and tau) with species-specific oligonucleotide-conjugated secondary antibodies (+crtl; Fig. 2C). Conversely, negative controls with no fluorescent signal were obtained when primary antibodies of one species were incubated with secondary antibodies against different immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) (data not shown). When PLA was performed by incubating both antitau and anti-IRBIT antibodies in combination with their corresponding secondary antibodies, we could detect fluorescent PLA staining as discrete puncta within the cell (Fig. 2D). In cortical neurons, we detected tau colocalization with MAP2, indicating that tau was also in the somatodendritic compartment because of the immature stage of the cells (Fig. 2B). Because of this localization pattern, PLA (IRBIT + tau) fluorescent puncta were observed in the soma as well as in neuronal projections (Fig. 2E). To further strengthen our evidence, we employed human smNPCs in which AHCYL1/IRBIT was downregulated by using synthetic siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 2F). We found that decreased expression of AHCYL1/IRBIT significantly reduced PLA signals of tau and IRBIT (Fig. 2G). These data indicate that tau and AHCYL1/IRBIT are in close proximity and may possibly interact in immature neurons as well as in smNPCs. We sought to explore the biological impact of tau binding to AHCYL1/IRBIT. Under physiological conditions, AHCYL1/IRBIT can bind IP3R and negatively regulate IP3R activity, thereby influencing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release upon stimulation (42Bonneau B. Ando H.

The aim of this study was to explore associations between SMI and adverse maternal and infant outcomes in the state of Victoria, Australia. Methods Our sample included all reported live singleton births in Victoria 2009–2016 (N = 595 792). Associations between SMI and adverse pregnancy outcomes were explored using Odds Ratios (OR), adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and co-morbidities, including any other mental illness. Results Of all singleton births, 2046 (0.34%) were to a mother diagnosed with a SMI. We found evidence of an association between SMI and a range of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. Compared to women without SMI, women with a SMI had higher adjusted odds of being admitted to a High Dependency Unit or Intensive Care Unit (aOR 1.83, 1.37–2.43), having gestational diabetes mellitus (1.57, 1.34–1.84), undergoing an unplanned caesarean section (1.17, 1.02–1.33), induction of labour (1.17, 1.05–1.30) and postpartum haemorrhage (1.15, 1.03–1.29). Newborns of women with SMI had higher adjusted odds of being admitted to Special Care Nursery (aOR 1.61, 1.43–1.80), a low Apgar score at 5 minutes (1.50, 1.19–1.90), preterm birth (1.40, 1.20–1.63), and low birthweight (1.26, 1.06–1.49). Conclusion Women with SMI are at higher risk for a range of adverse maternal and infant outcomes and are a population that may benefit from targeted early identification and enhanced antenatal care."

The Yellow River National Wetland in Baotou, China, is an essential migration station and a source of energy for migratory birds as it is located at an important intersection between East Asian/Australian and Central Asian flyways. From February to may 2020, we measured diet composition and energy content of whooper swans ( Cygnus cygnus ) by fecal micro-tissue analysis to understand their use of the stopover site and inform conservation. The following results were obtained: (1) whooper swans mainly fed on nine species of plants belonging to four families, including corn ( Zea mays ), reeds ( Phragmites australis ), and Suaeda ( Suaeda glauca ), which is related to the availability of local crops and abundance of plants. (2) The energy provided by crops to whooper swans was significantly higher than that of the most abundant plants in wetlands. Zea mays was the most consumed crop, and other abundant wetland plants played complementary roles. (3) The daily energy intake of whooper swans was 1393.11 kJ, which was considerably higher than their daily energy consumption. This suggested that the wetlands and the surrounding farmlands provide energy for the whooper swans to continue their migration. In order to protect migratory whooper swans, protection of important refuelling areas such as our study site should be implemented to provide sufficient energy supplies for continuing migration."

Reports on the participation of school health care in absenteeism reduction are infrequent, although physical and mental health problems are the most common causes of school absenteeism. Our aim was to explore what reasons different professionals working in schools recognize for absenteeism and which factors either promote or inhibit the inclusion of school health care in absenteeism reduction.Data for this qualitative study was gathered from ten focus groups conducted in two municipalities in southern Finland. The groups included (vice) principals, special education/resource/subject teachers, guidance counselors, school social workers, school psychologists, school nurses, school doctors, and social workers working in child protective services. Data analysis was predominantly inductive but the categorization of our results was based on existing literature.Study participants identified student-, family-, and school-related reasons for absenteeism but societal reasons went unmentioned. A number of reasons promoting the inclusion of school health care in absenteeism reduction arose, such as expertise in health-related issues and the confidentiality associated with health care. Inclusion of school health care was hindered by differences in work culture and differing perceptions regarding the aims of school health care.Professionals working in schools were knowledgeable about the different causes of school absenteeism. Clarifying both the aims of school health care and the work culture of different professionals could facilitate the inclusion of school health care in absenteeism reduction."

Thus, we investigated whether allopurinol and febuxostat, the most frequently used urate-lowering treatments, have differential renoprotective effects on chronic kidney disease.Incident users of allopurinol and febuxostat were identified from two tertiary referral centers. One-to-one propensity score matching between the allopurinol and febuxostat groups was performed. Participants were followed up until the occurrence of clinical outcomes, urate-lowering agent discontinuation, mortality, or the end of the study period, whichever occurred first. The primary outcomes were a 30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and end-stage renal disease. Differential trends of eGFR decline were estimated using a linear mixed-effects model.Each group included 654 participants. Baseline eGFRs were 40.1 [26.6-57.3] and 39.1 [27.9-58.3] mL/min/1.73 m2 in the allopurinol and febuxostat group, respectively. Adjusted least square mean change in serum urate was -1.58 mg/dL [95% confidence interval (CI), -1.78 to -1.38] and -2.69 mg/dL (95% CI, -2.89 to -2.49) in the allopurinol and febuxostat groups, respectively. Despite lower serum urate levels, febuxostat was significantly more associated with a 30% decline in eGFR (hazard ratio 1.26; 95% CI 1.03-1.54) and end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.42-2.58) than allopurinol. Annual eGFR decline in febuxostat users was estimated to be more rapid than in allopurinol users by 2.14 (standard error 0.71) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year.Allopurinol demonstrated attenuation of chronic kidney disease progression and prevention of hypouricemia, compared to febuxostat. Because the treatment can be renoprotective, further studies on its effects on chronic kidney disease are required."
https://openalex.org/W4214760473,"Pharmaceutical excipients are the basic materials and important components of pharmaceutical preparations, and play an important role in improving the efficacy of drugs and reducing adverse reactions. Therefore, selecting suitable excipients for dosage form is an important step in formulation development. An increasing number of studies have revealed that the traditionally regarded ""inert"" excipients can, however, influence the bioavailability of drugs. Moreover, these effects on the bioavailability of drugs caused by pharmaceutical excipients may differ in between males and females. In this study, the in situ effect of the widely-used pharmaceutical excipient Cremophor RH 40 spanning from 0.001% to 0.1% on the intestinal absorption of ampicillin in male and female rats using closed-loop models was investigated. Cremophor RH 40 ranging from 0.03% to 0.07% increased the absorption of ampicillin in females, however, was decreased in male rats. The mechanism of such an effect on drug absorption is suggested to be due to the interaction between Cremophor RH 40 and two main membrane transporters P-gp and PepT1. Cremophor RH 40 altered the PepT1 protein content in a sex-dependent manner, showing an increase in female rats but a decrease in males. No modification on the PepT1 mRNA abundance was found with Cremophor RH 40, indicating that the excipient may regulate the protein recruitment of the plasma membrane from the preformed cytoplasm pool to alter the PepT1 function. This influence, however, may differ between males and females. As such, the study herein shows that supposedly inert excipient Cremophor RH 40 can influence membrane fluidity, uptake and efflux transporters in a sex- and concentration-dependent manner. These findings, therefore, highlight the need for sex-specific studies in the application of solubilizing excipients in drug formulation development."

A reliable estimate of the age at onset of T1D in children would facilitate intervention plans for medical practitioners to reduce the problems with delayed diagnosis of T1D. This paper has utilised Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) to model and predict the age at onset of T1D in children in Saudi Arabia (S.A.) which is ranked as the 7th for the highest number of T1D and 5th in the world for the incidence rate of T1D. De-identified data between (2010-2020) from three cities in S.A. were used to model and predict the age at onset of T1D. The best subset model selection criteria, coefficient of determination, and diagnostic tests were deployed to select the most significant variables. The efficacy of models for predicting the age at onset was assessed using multi-prediction accuracy measures. The average age at onset of T1D is 6.2 years and the most common age group for onset is (5-9) years. Most of the children in the sample (68%) are from urban areas of S.A., 75% were delivered after a full term pregnancy length and 31% were delivered through a cesarean section. The models of best fit were the MLR and RF models with R2 = (0.85 and 0.95), the root mean square error = (0.25 and 0.15) and mean absolute error = (0.19 and 0.11) respectively for logarithm of age at onset. This study for the first time has utilised MLR, ANN and RF models to predict the age at onset of T1D in children in S.A. These models can effectively aid health care providers to monitor and create intervention strategies to reduce the impact of T1D in children in S.A."
https://openalex.org/W4213416021,"DEPTOR is a 48 kDa protein upregulated in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. DEPTOR inhibits mTOR and, by repressing a negative feedback loop, promotes AKT activation. We previously identified a compound that binds to DEPTOR in MM cells and induces its proteasomal degradation. To identify the mechanism of degradation, here, we screened for drug-induced posttranslational modifications and identified reduced phosphorylation of DEPTOR on serine 235 (S235). We show that an S235 phosphomimetic DEPTOR mutant was resistant to degradation, confirming the importance of this posttranslational modification. In addition, a DEPTOR mutant with a serine-to-alanine substitution at S235 could only be expressed upon concurrent proteasome inhibition. Thus, S235 phosphorylation regulates DEPTOR stability. Screening the DEPTOR interactome identified that the association of USP-7 deubiquitinase with DEPTOR was dependent upon S235 phosphorylation. Inhibition of USP-7 activity resulted in DEPTOR polyubiquitination and degradation. A scansite search suggested that ERK1 may be responsible for S235 phosphorylation, which was confirmed through the use of inhibitors, ERK1 knockdown, and an in vitro kinase assay. Inhibition of ERK1 also downregulated AKT phosphorylation. To test if DEPTOR phosphorylation mediated this crosstalk, MM cells were transfected with WT or phosphomimetic DEPTOR and exposed to ERK inhibitors. Although WT DEPTOR had no effect on the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, the phosphomimetic DEPTOR prevented inhibition. These results indicate that ERK1 maintains AKT activity in MM cells via phosphorylation of DEPTOR.

Disheveled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain–containing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)–interacting protein (DEPTOR) is a 48 kDa protein that binds to the mTOR and downregulates its kinase activity within TOR kinase complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR kinase complex 2 (1Peterson T.R.

DEPTOR contains two tandem DEP domains and a C-terminal PDZ domain. The function of the DEP domains is unknown, but the PDZ domain mediates protein–protein interactions, and DEPTOR binds mTOR via its PDZ domain. By repressing a negative feedback loop, DEPTOR-induced inhibition of TORC1 results in activation of the PI3K–AKT (a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase) pathway (1Peterson T.R. Laplante M.

As an mTOR inhibitor, it is not surprising that DEPTOR expression is low in most cancer subtypes. However, expression is particularly elevated in multiple myeloma (MM) tumor cells (1Peterson T.R.

High MM-specific DEPTOR expression has been explained as a mechanism to restrain cap-dependent translation and prevent endoplasmic reticulum stress (by inhibiting TORC1) while, at the same time, maintaining activated PI3K–AKT (by repressing the negative feedback loop) to prevent apoptosis. It is notable that MM tumor cells are especially sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress because of overactive immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis (2Obeng E.A. Carlson L.M. Gutman D.M. Harrington W.J.

DEPTOR expression can be regulated at the transcriptional level. Indeed, the highest levels of DEPTOR expression in MM occur within the subtype that contains Ig heavy locus translocations resulting in heightened activity of the transcription factors C-musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) and v-maf avian MAF oncogene homolog B (1Peterson T.R.

Binding to β-TrCP occurs via phosphorylated residues in a conserved degron sequence between amino acids 286 and 291. Phosphorylation events seem to be mediated by a synergistic interaction between the mTOR kinase and casein kinase 1α (CK1α), although there may also be a role for the S6 kinase 1, downstream of mTOR, and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (5Zhao Y.

Cell. 2011; 44: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These data suggest a feedforward loop where mTOR activity becomes amplified by promoting phosphorylation and degradation of its negative regulator. However, other post-translational events may also regulate DEPTOR's proteasomal degradation. For example, KDM4A, a demethylase controlling protein methylation, enhances DEPTOR stability by repressing its ubiquitination (6Carbonneau M. Gagne L.M. Lalonde M.-E. Germain M.-A. Motorina A.

Most interesting, our second-generation inhibitor, termed drug 3g, not only prevented DEPTOR/mTOR association but also induced rapid proteasomal degradation of DEPTOR, adding to the anti-MM effect (9Vega M. Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. A novel therapeutic induces DEPTOR degradation in multiple myeloma cells with resulting tumor cytotoxicity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019; 18: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Drug-induced DEPTOR destabilization was not because of an activation of mTOR or degron phosphorylation (9Vega M. Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. A novel therapeutic induces DEPTOR degradation in multiple myeloma cells with resulting tumor cytotoxicity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019; 18: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The aforementioned data indicated a novel mechanism of DEPTOR degradation, which is the subject of this report. Our results show that drug 3g induces a dephosphorylation of DEPTOR on serine 235 (S235), which results in release of the ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP-7) deubiquitinase. Polyubiquitination ensues with proteasomal degradation. The critical phosphorylation state of S235 is mediated by the extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 (ERK1). Furthermore, our results suggest that the level of S235 phosphorylation is also a physiologic regulator of DEPTOR turnover in the absence of drug 3g and that DEPTOR S235 phosphorylation plays a key role in the crosstalk between ERK and AKT in MM cells. The 8226 MM cell line contains high levels of DEPTOR because of MAF dysregulation (1Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M.

Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A.

Thus, we exposed 8226 cells to drug 3g (1 μM) + the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (to prevent DEPTOR degradation) for 4 h and performed a mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify post-translational alterations. MS identified multiple phosphorylation sites (S235, S265, S280, S287, S291, T295, and S299) with total DEPTOR sequence coverage of 94%. When compared with cells exposed to MG-132 alone, there were no significant changes in the phosphorylation status of residues S287 and S291, located within the β-TrCP degron (Fig. 1A). Gao et al. (4Gao D. Inuzuka H. Tan M.-K.M. Fukushima H. Locasale J.W. Liu P. Wan L. Zhai B. Chin R. Shaik S. Lyssiotis C.A. Gygi S.P. Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Cell. 2011; 44: 290-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reported that mTOR also phosphorylates DEPTOR on residues S299 and T295, surrounding the degron, which primes for subsequent phosphorylation of S286 and S287. Although drug 3g did increase T295 phosphorylation, this did not reach statistical significance. S299 phosphorylation was not altered. The absence of enhanced phosphorylation of the DEGRON and its surrounding residues is consistent with our previous work (9Vega M. Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. A novel therapeutic induces DEPTOR degradation in multiple myeloma cells with resulting tumor cytotoxicity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019; 18: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), demonstrating that drug 3g-induced DEPTOR degradation is not because of heightened mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. On the other hand, although drug 3g rapidly prevents binding of mTOR to DEPTOR (9Vega M. Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. A novel therapeutic induces DEPTOR degradation in multiple myeloma cells with resulting tumor cytotoxicity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019; 18: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and thus, might be expected to actually decrease mTOR-dependent degron phosphorylation, a 4 h exposure may not have been sufficient to identify such a decrease. In contrast to an absence of drug effect on these residues, a remarkable drug-induced decrease in phosphorylation was identified at S235 (Fig. 1A). S235 is located between the C-terminal DEP domain and the degron (Fig. 1B). Spectra of S235 phosphorylation specifically are shown in Fig. S1, and accessing spectra for all phosphopeptide identification can be found in the “Data availability” section under “Experimental procedures” section. No other significant alterations of post-translational modifications (PTMs) induced by drug 3g were identified. All phosphopeptide identification can also be accessed through the site shown in the “Data availability” section. To test the relevance of diminished S235 phosphorylation, we generated DEPTOR mutants that would resist S235 phosphorylation (serine-to-alanine [S–A]) or present a phosphomimetic signal (serine-to-aspartate [S–Asp]) at residue 235. FLAG-tagged constructs were transfected into MM cells, and immunoblot was performed for tagged DEPTOR expression. Although both mutants were normally transcribed, there was no protein expression of the S–A mutant identified (Fig. 1C), and simultaneous blocking of proteasome function with MG-132 allowed normal S–A protein expression (Fig. 1D). Thus, the absence of S235 phosphorylation destabilizes DEPTOR protein resulting in proteasomal degradation. As expected, when the S–A mutant was protected by MG-132, exposure to drug 3g had no effect on expression (Fig. S2A). To test if decreased phosphorylation at S235 mediates drug-induced DEPTOR degradation, 8226 cells were transfected with either tagged WT or the phosphomimetic S–Asp mutant and treated in the presence or the absence of drug 3g for 3, 6, or 12 h. Drug 3g (1 μM) induced WT DEPTOR degradation rapidly by 3 h (Fig. 1E). This rapid kinetics is comparable to drug-induced degradation of endogenous DEPTOR in sensitive MM cells (9Vega M. Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. A novel therapeutic induces DEPTOR degradation in multiple myeloma cells with resulting tumor cytotoxicity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019; 18: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast, drug 3g was incapable of destabilizing and degrading the S–Asp mutant even with exposures up to 12 h (Fig. 1E). These results confirm the relevance of S235 dephosphorylation in drug-induced DEPTOR fragmentation. In addition, the results with the S–A mutant shown in Figure 1D also indicate S235 phosphorylation physiologically regulates DEPTOR stability in the absence of drug 3g. There was only a slight prolongation of the T1/2 of the aspartate mutant versus WT DEPTOR in the absence of drug 3g (Fig. S2B). This was probably explained by the finding that, in the 8226 cell line, WT DEPTOR is constitutively phosphorylated at S235 (see later) so there is little difference in T1/2 versus the phosphomimetic mutant. We next performed MS analysis to identify any drug-induced alteration of proteins bound to DEPTOR. Tagged DEPTOR was immunoprecipitated after a 4 h exposure to drug 3g (1 μM) + MG-132 and compared with cells treated with MG-132 alone. Nonspecific binders were identified and discarded by use of IgG instead of anti-DEPTOR immunoprecipitating antibody. In the absence of drug 3g, 242 distinct binding proteins were identified by MS. Following exposure to drug 3g, there were 238 distinct DEPTOR binders identified. Combining the proteins bound to DEPTOR in the basal condition (i.e., no drug 3g) with those identified after drug 3g treatment yielded a dataset of 301 proteins. From these 301 separate proteins, the DEPTOR binding of 49 proteins significantly decreased (two-tailed p value <0.05, Table S1), and the binding of 25 proteins significantly increased following drug treatment (Table S2). For all other protein-binder identification, see the site identified in the “Data availability” section. As expected from our previous work (9Vega M. Shi Y. Frost P. Huerta-Yepez S. Antonio-Andres G. Hernandez-Pando R. Lee J. Jung M.E. Gera J. Lichtenstein A. A novel therapeutic induces DEPTOR degradation in multiple myeloma cells with resulting tumor cytotoxicity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2019; 18: 1822-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), binding to mTOR was significantly decreased by drug 3g (treated/nontreated ratio = 0.28 ± 0.05, mean ± SD, single arrow in Table S1). Also as expected, drug 3g exposure resulted in a significant increase in binding of a number of proteasomal subunits (arrows in Table S2), consistent with the overall effect of sensitizing DEPTOR for proteasome degradation. Of all 301 proteins, the USP-7 deubiquitinase demonstrated the most significant decrease in DEPTOR binding following drug exposure (treated/nontreated ratio = 0.05 ± 0.01, double arrow in Table S1). Confirmation of the MS results is shown in Figure 2A, where either 8226 or OPM-2 MM cells, expressing tagged DEPTOR, were treated in the presence or the absence of drug 3g for 4 h in the presence of MG-132, following which DEPTOR was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted for bound USP-7. OPM-2 is an additional MM cell line with abnormally upregulated DEPTOR expression. As shown, drug 3g significantly decreased DEPTOR/USP-7 binding after this short exposure in both cell lines. We next tested if the drug-induced dephosphorylation at S235 was critical for USP-7 binding by transfecting either WT FLAG-DEPTOR or the S–Asp phosphomimetic mutant, treating in the presence or the absence of drug 3g for 4 h in the presence of MG-132 and testing for bound USP-7 on anti-FLAG DEPTOR immunoprecipitates. As shown in Figure 2B, drug 3g effectively caused decreased binding of USP-7 to WT DEPTOR but had no effect on binding to the phosphomimetic mutant. Depressed binding of and action of a deubiquitinase should lead to enhanced DEPTOR ubiquitination. This was tested in drug-treated 8226 and OPM-2 cells. As shown in Figure 2C, enhanced ubiquitination of endogenous DEPTOR was evident in both cell lines treated with drug 3g in association with loss of expression. We were also fortunate to obtain sufficient primary bone marrow MM cells from two newly diagnosed patients to perform coimmunoprecipitation by immunoprecipitating endogenous DEPTOR. Figure 2D demonstrates that USP-7 is constitutively bound to DEPTOR in these patient samples. To test if USP-7 binding regulated DEPTOR stability, we first utilized a novel USP-7 inhibitor, P5091 (Fig. 3A). This inhibitor has shown promise as an anti-MM drug, and one of its proposed mechanisms is that USP-7 paralysis results in an enhanced ubiquitination and fragmentation of human and/or murine double minute-2 protein (HDM2) with subsequent p53 activation, which is thought to mediate MM cell death (10Chauhan D. Tian Z. Nicholson B. Kumar K.G.S. Zhou B. Carrasco R. McDermott J.L. Leach C.A. Fuolcinniti M. Kodrasov M.P. Weinstock J. Kingsbury W.D. Hideshima T. Shah P.K.

We, thus, treated 8226 or OPM-2 MM cells with 0, 6, or 12 μM of P5091 for 4 h. The ID50 of P5091 for the 8226 cell line after 48 h of exposure is approximately 12.5 μM (10Chauhan D. Tian Z. Nicholson B. Kumar K.G.S. Zhou B. Carrasco R. McDermott J.L. Leach C.A. Fuolcinniti M. Kodrasov M.P. Weinstock J. Kingsbury W.D. Hideshima T. Shah P.K.

At our time point of 4 h, there was no discernible toxicity to either 8226 or OPM-2 cells. Figure 3A is a representative experiment demonstrating that, as expected, P5091 caused decreased HDM2 expression and a corresponding increased p53 expression (semiquantifications of protein expression by densitometry from three independent experiments are shown below the gels as means). Also, targeting USP-7 resulted in loss of DEPTOR expression in both MM cell lines (20 ± 7% of control at 6 μM P5091 and 12 ± 5% at 12 μM for 8226 cells and 23 ± 6% at 6 μM and 27 ± 5% at 12 μM for OPM-2 cells, mean ± SD, n = 3). This was associated with enhanced ubiquitination of DEPTOR (Fig. 3B). Comparable results were seen when USP-7 was targeted genetically by two separate shRNAs in 8226 or OPM-2 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). As shown, the silencing of USP-7 was associated with decreased expression of HDM2 and DEPTOR (Fig. 3C) in both MM cell lines. A second independent shRNA was used in 8226 cells (Fig. 3D) to further support the negative effect on DEPTOR expression when USP-7 is silenced. In addition, Figure 3D demonstrates that this negative effect is reversed by MG-132. Thus, targeting USP-7 pharmacologically and genetically results in DEPTOR ubiquitination and degradation and further supports the notion that loss of DEPTOR–USP-7 binding is the key molecular alteration that mediates drug 3g-induced DEPTOR degradation. As described previously, the P5091 USP-7 inhibitor is selectively cytotoxic to MM cells (10Chauhan D. Tian Z. Nicholson B. Kumar K.G.S. Zhou B. Carrasco R. McDermott J.L. Leach C.A. Fuolcinniti M. Kodrasov M.P. Weinstock J. Kingsbury W.D. Hideshima T. Shah P.K.

However, we considered the possibility that the associated degradation of DEPTOR in P5091-treated MM cells could contribute to cytotoxicity. To test this, the FLAG-tagged phosphomimetic DEPTOR (S–Asp mutant) was ectopically expressed in 8226 cells (versus a FLAG-tagged empty vector [EV]) followed by challenge with P5091. Results shown in Figure 3E suggest that DEPTOR overexpression affords some protection against P5091, specifically identified at the 12 μM dose. Although P5091, by inhibiting USP-7, would be expected to induce some degradation of the S–Asp–transfected DEPTOR protein, there may have been a sufficient level still remaining to protect against cytotoxicity. An immunoblot assay (Fig. 3F) performed after 48 h exposure to 12 μM of P5091 suggests this possible explanation. As shown, the P5091 USP-7 inhibitor induced degradation of the FLAG-tagged DEPTOR while, as expected, having no effect on expression of the FLAG-tagged EV. However, following exposure to P5091, there was still some DEPTOR expression remaining in DEPTOR-transfected cells compared with EV-transfected cells (the latter cells demonstrating complete loss of expression of endogenous DEPTOR). A scansite search for kinase consensus sites identified ERK1 as a potential mediator of S235 phosphorylation. In addition, a previous study (5Zhao Y. Xiong X. Sun Y. DEPTOR, an mTOR inhibitor, is a physiological substrate of SCFβTrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and regulates survival and autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ERK1 can bind DEPTOR in pull-down assays. To further investigate ERK as a possible mediator of S235 phosphorylation, we first developed a phosphospecific antibody that recognized DEPTOR only when it was phosphorylated at S235. Figure 4A confirms the specificity of the antibody. WT or S–A mutant DEPTORs were expressed and immunoprecipitated. As shown, the WT DEPTOR was immunodetected with the antibody, whereas the S–A mutant, incapable of S235 phosphorylation, was not. To test the role of the ERK, we first used ERK inhibitors. As shown in Figure 4B, the PD98059 ERK inhibitor (PD) used in the 00 of MG-132 (to prevent DEPTOR degradation) markedly decreased phosphorylation of S235 after a 4 h incubation in 8226 and OPM-2 MM cells. When the PD98059 ERK inhibitor was applied in the absence of MG-132, DEPTOR expression was lost (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained with the U0126 ERK inhibitor (Fig. S3). The PD98059 ERK inhibitor also decreases binding of DEPTOR to the USP-7 deubiquitinase (Fig. 4D), further demonstrating that ERK inhibition phenocopies the effects of drug 3g on DEPTOR. In addition, silencing of ERK1 utilizing two separate shRNAs in either cell line in the presence of MG-132 also inhibited S235 phosphorylation (Fig. 4E). In the absence of MG-132, ERK1 knockdown also resulted in loss of DEPTOR expression (Fig. 4E, right panel). In addition, the PD98059 ERK inhibitor induced dephosphorylation of S235 and loss of DEPTOR expression in primary MM cells from patients (Fig. 4F). An in vitro kinase assay confirmed the ability of recombinant activated ERK1 to directly phosphorylate DEPTOR on S235 (Fig. 4G). As expected, exposure of 8226 cells to drug 3g in the presence or the absence of MG-132 (Fig. 5, A and B) also decreased S235 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent fashion. A similar inhibition of DEPTOR S235 phosphorylation and DEPTOR protein expression was identified in an additional primary MM specimen (Fig. 5C). Notably, while preventing DEPTOR S235 phosphorylation, drug 3g had little effect on phosphorylation of ERK or the ERK1 substrate, ELK-1 (Fig. 5, A–C). Thus, the inhibited ERK-induced phosphorylation of S235 in drug 3g-treated MM cells is not because of a general inhibition of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade but, more likely, occurs secondary to a structural alteration of DEPTOR after drug binding. In contrast to inhibition of ERK1, to test if a stimulation of ERK activity could enhance S235 phosphorylation, we tested effects of serum reconstitution after serum depletion. As the 8226 cell line expresses a mutant rat sarcoma virus (RAS) gene, its ERK activation is not serum dependent. We, thus, performed these experiments in OPM-2 cells and an additional MM cell line with upregulated DEPTOR expression, MM1.S. Figure 5D (for MM1.S) and Fig. S4 (for OPM-2) demonstrate that inactivation of ERK (autophosphorylation of ERK) with 18 h of serum starvation inhibits S235 DEPTOR phosphorylation and DEPTOR expression. Continued serum depletion and inhibited ERK over 36 h result in reduced DEPTOR expression, whereas reactivation with serum allows re-expression of DEPTOR. Performing the serum reactivation in the pre"

Here we identified important drivers relatively underrepresented in many migration models-CHanging mindset, Agglomeration, Social ties, and the Environment (CHASE)-and asked: How does the interplay between these drivers influence transient dynamics and long-term outcomes of migration? We addressed this question by developing and analyzing a parsimonious Markov chain model. Our findings suggest that these drivers interact in nonlinear and complex ways. The system exhibits legacy effects, highlighting the importance of including migrants' changing priorities. The increased characteristic population size of the system counter-intuitively leads to fewer surviving cities, and this effect is mediated by how fast migrants change their mindsets and how strong the social ties are. Strong social ties result in less diverse populations across cities, but this effect is influenced by how many cities remain. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these drivers are incorporated in one coherent, mechanistic, parsimonious model and the effects of their interplay on migration systematically studied. The complex interplay underscores the need to incorporate these drivers into mechanistic migration models and implement such models for real-world cases."

Serous Cancer (SC) makes 10% of all EC and accounts for 40% of EC-related deaths. We investigated expression of selected genes involved in epigenetic pathways by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 106 EC patients and analyzed mRNA-based expression levels for the same set of genes in EC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. A tissue microarray was constructed using low-grade (n = 30) and high-grade (n = 28) endometrioid, serous (n = 31) and clear cell carcinoma (n = 17) samples. Epigenetic marker levels were associated with PD-L1, ER/PgR, and MLH1 expression. Epigenetic markers were evaluated by H-score and PD-L1 expression was recorded by using Combined Positive Score. Results were correlated with disease stage and survival outcome. BRD4, KAT6a and HDAC9 levels were higher in SC compared to other histologic subtypes (p<0.001-0.038). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, DNMT3b expression was higher in SC compared to endometrioid-type but not between SC and CCC. The expression levels of BRD4 (p = 0.021) and KAT6a (p = 0.0027) were positively associated with PD-L abundance, while PgR (p = 0.029) and PD-L1 expression were negatively associated. In addition, BRD4 expression was low in specimens with loss of MLH1 expression (p = 0.02). More importantly, BRD4 abundance had a negative impact on disease outcome (p = 0.02). Transcriptionally, BRD4, KAT6a and DNMT3b expression levels were higher in SC in TCGA dataset. The median PD-L1 expression was marginally associated with BRD4, a transcriptional activator of CD274/PD-L1 (p = 0.069) and positively with KAT6a (p = 0.0095). In conclusion, the protein expression levels of epigenetic markers involved in cancer pathogenesis are increased by immunohistochemistry in SC. PD-L1 levels are associated with BRD4 and KAT6a in EC samples. A combination therapy with BRD4/PD-L1 or KAT6a/PD-L1 inhibitors might have a potential use in EC, in particular serous-type carcinoma."

However, advancement is required toward neocartilage functionality (mechanical and biochemical properties) and translatability (construct size, gross morphology, passage number, cell source, and cell type). Using fluid-induced shear (FIS) stress, a potent mechanical stimulus, over four phases, this work investigates FIS stress' efficacy toward creating large neocartilage derived from highly passaged minipig costal chondrocytes, a species relevant to the preclinical regulatory process. In Phase I, FIS stress application timing was investigated in bovine articular chondrocytes and found to improve the aggregate modulus of neocartilage by 151% over unstimulated controls when stimulated during the maturation stage. In Phase II, FIS stress stimulation was translated from bovine articular chondrocytes to expanded minipig costal chondrocytes, yielding a 46% improvement in aggregate modulus over nonstimulated controls. In Phase III, bioactive factors were combined with FIS stress to improve the shear modulus by 115% over bioactive factor-only controls. The translatability of neocartilage was improved in Phase IV by utilizing highly passaged cells to form constructs more than 9-times larger in the area (11 × 17 mm), yielding an improved aggregate modulus by 134% and a flat morphology compared to free-floating, bioactive factor-only controls. Overall, this study represents a significant step toward generating mechanically robust, large constructs necessary for animal studies, and eventually, human clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W4220883918,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative disease of the joint, featured by articular cartilage destruction and subchondral bone marrow lesions. Articular cartilage and subchondral bone constitute an osteochondral unit that guarantees joint homeostasis. During OA initiation, activated osteoclasts in subchondral bone ultimately result in impaired capacities of the subchondral bone in response to mechanical stress, followed by the degradation of overlying articular cartilage. Thus, targeting osteoclasts could be a potential therapeutic option for treating OA. Here, we observed that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression and osteoclast fusion and activity in subchondral bone were concomitantly changed during early-stage OA in the OA mouse model established by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Then, we explored the therapeutic effects of FXR agonist GW4064 on the osteochondral pathologies in ACLT mice. We showed that GW4064 obviously ameliorated subchondral bone deterioration, associated with reduction in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive multinuclear osteoclast number, as well as articular cartilage degradation, which were blocked by the treatment with FXR antagonist Guggulsterone. Mechanistically, GW4064 impeded osteoclastogenesis through inhibiting subchondral bone osteoclast fusion via suppressing c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2/nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFATc1) pathway. Taken together, our results present evidence for the protective effects of GW4064 against OA by blunting osteoclast-mediated aberrant subchondral bone loss and subsequent cartilage deterioration. Therefore, GW4064 demonstrates the potential as an alternative therapeutic option against OA for further drug development."
https://openalex.org/W4226046726,"Clitocybe nebularis lectin (CNL) is a GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-binding lectin that exhibits an antiproliferative effect exclusively on the Jurkat leukemic T cell line by provoking homotypic aggregation and dose-dependent cell death. Cell death of Jurkat cells exhibited typical features of early apoptosis, but lacked the activation of initiating and executing caspases. None of the features of CNL-induced cell death were effectively blocked with the pan-caspase inhibitor or different cysteine peptidase inhibitors. Furthermore, CNL binding induced Jurkat cells to release the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern molecule high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). A plant lectin with similar glycan-binding specificity, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) showed less selective toxicity and induced cell death in Jurkat, Tall-104, and Hut-87 cell lines. HMGB1 release was also detected when Jurkat cells were treated with WFA. We identified the CD45 and CD43 cell surface glycoproteins on Jurkat cells as the main targets for CNL binding. However, the blockade of CD45 phosphatase activity failed to block either CNL-induced homotypic agglutination or cell death. Overall, our results indicate that CNL triggers atypical cell death selectively on Jurkat cells, suggesting the potential applicability of CNL in novel strategies for treating and/or detecting acute T cell leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W4214488754,"This paper describes the effects of the interaction of cerebral fluids (arterial, capillary and venous blood, cerebrospinal fluid) on ventricular wall displacement and periventricular pressure using a mathematical multiphase poroelasticity model for the cerebral parenchyma. The interaction of cerebral fluids is given by a set of four numerical coefficients. A multiple linear regression with interaction is constructed that allows us to quantify the effect of these coefficients on the average ventricular wall displacement. The prevailing influence of an arterial-liquor component was observed. The sets of coefficients associated with such pathological conditions were found: normal pressure hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, and replacement ventriculomegaly under a prolonged hypoperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W4214570323,"Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are becoming a public health problem in Ethiopia, especially among those who have limited physical activity. Although bank workers are at an increased risk of contracting CVD, their participation in CVD preventive activities is not studied in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the perception of bank workers towards CVD preventive behaviors and associated factors in Hossana town. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 258 participants from February 11 to 30/2020. A simple random sampling method was used to select study participants from the enumerated list of staff. Data was collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire and the collected data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were done. A p-value less than 0.05 with 95% CI was considered to declare an association between independent and dependent variables. Results A total of 253 respondents with response rate of 98.0% were participated. The study revealed that the likelihood of performing CVD preventive behaviors is 62.0%. Moreover, the study found that bank workers’ exposure to passive smoking [AOR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.23–0.98], level of alcohol consumed [AOR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.01–0.54], regularly consuming fruit and vegetable in daily meal [AOR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.03–0.80], perceived severity[AOR = 0.1;95% CI: 0.01–0.68], and cues to take action [AOR = 0.12;95% CI: 0.02–0.73] were identified as predictors of perception to engage in CVD preventive behaviors. Conclusion The level of bank workers’ perception of engaging in CVD preventive behavior was in a considerable state to design and implement intervention strategies. Behavior change communication should be strengthened to improve their knowledge and perception of the severity of CVD and barriers so as to improve the likelihood of taking action."
https://openalex.org/W4214612763,"Introduction Sodium fluoride (NaF) tubes are the recommended tubes for glucose measurements, but these are expensive, have limited number of uses, and are not always available in low resource settings. Alternative sample handling techniques are thus needed. We compared glucose stability in samples collected in various tubes exposed to different pre-analytical conditions in Uganda. Methods Random (non-fasted) blood samples were drawn from nine healthy participants into NaF, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and plain serum tubes. The samples were kept un-centrifuged or centrifuged with plasma or serum pipetted into aliquots, placed in cool box with ice or at room temperature and were stored in a permanent freezer after 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours post blood draw before glucose analysis. Results Rapid decline in glucose concentrations was observed when compared to baseline in serum (declined to 64%) and EDTA-plasma (declined to 77%) after 6 hours when samples were un-centrifuged at room temperature whilst NaF-plasma was stable after 24 hours in the same condition. Un-centrifuged EDTA-plasma kept on ice was stable for up to 6 hours but serum was not stable (degraded to 92%) in the same conditions. Early centrifugation prevented glucose decline even at room temperature regardless of the primary tube used with serum, EDTA-plasma and NaF-plasma after 24 hours. Conclusion In low resource settings we recommend use of EDTA tubes placed in cool box with ice and analysed within 6 hours as an alternative to NaF tubes. Alternatively, immediate separation of blood with manual hand centrifuges will allow any tube to be used even in remote settings with no electricity."
https://openalex.org/W4214624611,"Little is known about the clinical demographics of and access to transplantation for Chinese diaspora populations with kidney disease.The UK Renal Registry provided data on adults with ethnicity recorded as 'Chinese' or 'White' starting Kidney Replacement Therapy (KRT) 1/1/97-31/12/17. Baseline characteristics were compared between Chinese and White patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationships between Chinese ethnicity and i) being listed for deceased-donor transplantation at start of KRT, ii) being listed 2 years after start of KRT, iii) pre-emptive kidney transplantation, iv) kidney transplantation 3 years after start of KRT, and v) living-donor kidney transplantation (LDKT).UK Chinese patients were younger at start of KRT (61.6 vs 65.6 years, p <0.001) and had more diabetic kidney disease (29% vs 20%, p<0.001) and glomerulonephritis (21% vs 13%, p<0.001) than White patients. We found evidence of interaction between ethnicity and sex. Compared to UK White men, UK Chinese men had lower odds of pre-emptive transplant (aOR 0.28, 95% CI [0.10-0.76]) and transplant within 3 years of KRT start (aOR 0.65, [95% CI 0.49-0.87], P = 0.004). UK White women and Chinese women had the same likelihood of pre-emptive transplant (aOR 0.78, 95% CI [0.38-1.61]), or transplant within 3 years of KRT start (aOR 0.94, 95% CI [0.60-1.46]). Both UK Chinese men and women had markedly lower odds of LDKT compared to Whites aOR 0.34 [95% CI 0.21-0.53].UK Chinese are less likely to receive a LDKT. UK Chinese men have lower odds of accessing pre-emptive wait-listing and transplantation. Understanding whether these disparities reflect modifiable barriers will help ensure equitable access to transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W4214738532,"Mathematical models are used to gauge the impact of interventions for healthcare-associated infections. As with any analytic method, such models require many assumptions. Two common assumptions are that asymptomatically colonized individuals are more likely to be hospitalized and that they spend longer in the hospital per admission because of their colonization status. These assumptions have no biological basis and could impact the estimated effects of interventions in unintended ways. Therefore, we developed a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission to explicitly evaluate the impact of these assumptions. We found that assuming that asymptomatically colonized individuals were more likely to be admitted to the hospital or spend longer in the hospital than uncolonized individuals biased results compared to a more realistic model that did not make either assumption. Results were heavily biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that directly reduced transmission in a hospital. In contrast, results were moderately biased when estimating the impact of an intervention that decolonized hospital patients. Our findings can inform choices modelers face when constructing models of healthcare-associated infection interventions and thereby improve their validity."
https://openalex.org/W4214744014,"Cellular uptake of vitamin B12 in humans is mediated by the endocytosis of the B12 carrier protein transcobalamin (TC) via its cognate cell surface receptor TCblR, encoded by the CD320 gene. Because CD320 expression is associated with the cell cycle and upregulated in highly proliferating cells including cancer cells, this uptake route is a potential target for cancer therapy. We developed and characterized four camelid nanobodies that bind holo-TC (TC in complex with B12 ) or the interface of the human holo-TC:TCblR complex with nanomolar affinities. We determined X-ray crystal structures of these nanobodies bound to holo-TC:TCblR, which enabled us to map their binding epitopes. When conjugated to the model toxin saporin, three of our nanobodies caused growth inhibition of HEK293T cells and therefore have the potential to inhibit the growth of human cancer cells. We visualized the cellular binding and endocytic uptake of the most potent nanobody (TC-Nb4) using fluorescent light microscopy. The co-crystal structure of holo-TC:TCblR with another nanobody (TC-Nb34) revealed novel features of the interface of TC and the LDLR-A1 domain of TCblR, rationalizing the decrease in the affinity of TC-B12 binding caused by the Δ88 mutation in CD320."
https://openalex.org/W4225949735,"The Ising model does not have strictly defined dynamics, only a spectrum. There are different ways to equip it with time dependence, e.g., the Glauber or the Kawasaki dynamics, which are both stochastic, but it means there is a master equation that can also describe their dynamics. These equations can be derived from the Redfield equation, where the spin system is weakly coupled to a bosonic bath. In this paper, we investigate the temperature dependence of the relaxation time of a Glauber-type master equation, especially in the case of the fully connected, uniform Ising model. The finite-size effects were analyzed with a reduced master equation and the thermodynamic limit with a time-dependent mean field equation."
