https://openalex.org/W2017919052,"Jeck and Sharpless review recent advances in sequencing, bioinformatics and biochemical analyses that have uncovered numerous circular RNA transcripts in mammalian cells. Circular RNA transcripts were first identified in the early 1990s but knowledge of these species has remained limited, as their study through traditional methods of RNA analysis has been difficult. Now, novel bioinformatic approaches coupled with biochemical enrichment strategies and deep sequencing have allowed comprehensive studies of circular RNA species. Recent studies have revealed thousands of endogenous circular RNAs in mammalian cells, some of which are highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved. Evidence is emerging that some circRNAs might regulate microRNA (miRNA) function, and roles in transcriptional control have also been suggested. Therefore, study of this class of noncoding RNAs has potential implications for therapeutic and research applications. We believe the key future challenge for the field will be to understand the regulation and function of these unusual molecules."

However, the reaction conditions needed to activate the strong C-H bond tend to overoxidize the products. Guo et al. (p. 616 ) report a high-temperature nonoxidative route that exposes methane to isolated iron sites on a silica catalyst. Methyl radicals were generated and coupled in the gas phase to form ethylene and aromatics along with hydrogen. The isolation of the active sites avoided surface reactions between the radicals that would deposit solid carbon."
https://openalex.org/W1969057487,"Long recognized as an evolutionarily ancient cell type involved in tissue homeostasis and immune defense against pathogens, macrophages are being rediscovered as regulators of several diseases, including cancer. Here we show that in mice, mammary tumor growth induces the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that are phenotypically and functionally distinct from mammary tissue macrophages (MTMs). TAMs express the adhesion molecule Vcam1 and proliferate upon their differentiation from inflammatory monocytes, but do not exhibit an ""alternatively activated"" phenotype. TAM terminal differentiation depends on the transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling, RBPJ; and TAM, but not MTM, depletion restores tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppresses tumor growth. These findings reveal the ontogeny of TAMs and a discrete tumor-elicited inflammatory response, which may provide new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2130169724,"Forget It! When examining the relationship between the production of new neurons in the hippocampus and memory, studies have generally first manipulated hippocampal neurogenesis and afterward investigated memory formation and found that new neurons help to encode new memories. However, when investigating how similar manipulations of neurogenesis impact established hippocampus-dependent memories, Akers et al. (p. 598 ; see the Perspective by Mongiat and Schinder ) uncovered a role for neurogenesis in memory clearance. Thus, the continuous addition of new neurons both degrades existing information stored in hippocampal circuits and simultaneously provides substrates for new learning."
https://openalex.org/W2001567161,"The mining of huge databases of resting-state brain activity recordings represents state of the art in the assessment of endogenous neuronal activity-and may be a promising tool in the search for functional biomarkers. However, the resting state is an uncontrolled condition and its heterogeneity is neither sufficiently understood nor accounted for. We test the hypothesis that subjects exhibit unstable wakefulness, i.e., drift into sleep during typical resting-state experiments. Analyzing 1,147 resting-state functional magnetic resonance data sets, we revealed a reliable loss of wakefulness in a third of subjects within 3 min and demonstrated the dynamic nature of the resting state, with fundamental changes in the associated functional neuroanatomy. Implications include the necessity of wakefulness monitoring and modeling, taking measures to maintain a state of wakefulness, acknowledging the possibility of sleep and exploring its consequences, and especially the critical assessment of possible false-positive or false-negative results."
https://openalex.org/W2065970275,"Adult neurogenic niches harbor quiescent neural stem cells; however, their in vivo identity has been elusive. Here, we prospectively isolate GFAP+CD133+ (quiescent neural stem cells [qNSCs]) and GFAP+CD133+EGFR+ (activated neural stem cells [aNSCs]) from the adult ventricular-subventricular zone. aNSCs are rapidly cycling, highly neurogenic in vivo, and enriched in colony-forming cells in vitro. In contrast, qNSCs are largely dormant in vivo, generate olfactory bulb interneurons with slower kinetics, and only rarely form colonies in vitro. Moreover, qNSCs are Nestin negative, a marker widely used for neural stem cells. Upon activation, qNSCs upregulate Nestin and EGFR and become highly proliferative. Notably, qNSCs and aNSCs can interconvert in vitro. Transcriptome analysis reveals that qNSCs share features with quiescent stem cells from other organs. Finally, small-molecule screening identified the GPCR ligands, S1P and PGD2, as factors that actively maintain the quiescent state of qNSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1979371466,"Water is the key resource limiting world agricultural production. Although an impressive number of research reports have been published on plant drought tolerance enhancement via genetic modifications during the last few years, progress has been slower than expected. We suggest a feasible alternative strategy by application of rhizospheric bacteria coevolved with plant roots in harsh environments over millions of years, and harboring adaptive traits improving plant fitness under biotic and abiotic stresses. We show the effect of bacterial priming on wheat drought stress tolerance enhancement, resulting in up to 78% greater plant biomass and five-fold higher survivorship under severe drought. We monitored emissions of seven stress-related volatiles from bacterially-primed drought-stressed wheat seedlings, and demonstrated that three of these volatiles are likely promising candidates for a rapid non-invasive technique to assess crop drought stress and its mitigation in early phases of stress development. We conclude that gauging stress by elicited volatiles provides an effectual platform for rapid screening of potent bacterial strains and that priming with isolates of rhizospheric bacteria from harsh environments is a promising, novel way to improve plant water use efficiency. These new advancements importantly contribute towards solving food security issues in changing climates."
https://openalex.org/W1964487937,"Maximizing atomic magnetic memory A study of the magnetic response of cobalt atoms adsorbed on oxide surfaces may lead to much denser storage of data. In hard drives, data are stored as magnetic bits; the magnetic field pointing up or down corresponds to storing a zero or a one. The smallest bit possible would be a single atom, but the magnetism of a single atom —its spin—has to be stabilized by interactions with heavy elements or surfaces through an effect called spin-orbit coupling. Rau et al. (see the Perspective by Khajetoorians and Wiebe) built a model system in pursuit of single-atom bits—cobalt atoms adsorbed on magnesium oxide. At temperatures approaching absolute zero, the stabilization of the spin's magnetic direction reached the maximum that is theoretically possible. Science , this issue p. 988 ; see also p. 976"

https://openalex.org/W2163717864,"Sulfate reduction is a globally important redox process in marine sediments, yet global rates are poorly quantified. We developed an artificial neural network trained with 199 sulfate profiles, constrained with geomorphological and geochemical maps to estimate global sulfate-reduction rate distributions. Globally, 11.3 teramoles of sulfate are reduced yearly (~15% of previous estimates), accounting for the oxidation of 12 to 29% of the organic carbon flux to the sea floor. Combined with global cell distributions in marine sediments, these results indicate a strong contrast in sub–sea-floor prokaryote habitats: In continental margins, global cell numbers in sulfate-depleted sediment exceed those in the overlying sulfate-bearing sediment by one order of magnitude, whereas in the abyss, most life occurs in oxic and/or sulfate-reducing sediments."
https://openalex.org/W1977406393,"Under the Dome The superconducting transition temperature T c of copper oxides has a dome-shaped dependence on chemical doping. Whether there is a quantum critical point (QCP) beneath the dome, and whether it is related to the enigmatic pseudogap, has been heavily debated. Two papers address this question in two different families of Bi-based cuprates. In (Bi,Pb) 2 (Sr,La) 2 CuO 6+δ , He et al. (p. 608 ) found that the Fermi surface (FS) undergoes a topological change as doping is increased, which points to the existence of a QCP at a doping close to the maximum in T c , seemingly uncorrelated with the pseudogap. Fujita et al. (p. 612 ) studied a range of dopings in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ to find an FS reconstruction simultaneous with the disappearance of both rotational and translational symmetry breaking, the latter of which has been associated with the pseudogap. These findings point to a concealed QCP."

https://openalex.org/W2022907434,"Organisms make two types of decisions on a regular basis. Perceptual decisions are determined by objective states of the world (e.g., melons are bigger than apples), whereas value-based decisions are determined by subjective preferences (e.g., I prefer apples to melons). Theoretical accounts suggest that both types of choice involve neural computations accumulating evidence for the choice alternatives; however, little is known about the overlap or differences in the processes underlying perceptual versus value-based decisions. We analyzed EEG recordings during a paradigm where perceptual- and value-based choices were based on identical stimuli. For both types of choice, evidence accumulation was evident in parietal gamma-frequency oscillations, whereas a similar frontal signal was unique for value-based decisions. Fronto-parietal synchronization of these signals predicted value-based choice accuracy. These findings uncover how decisions emerge from topographic- and frequency-specific oscillations that accumulate distinct aspects of evidence, with large-scale synchronization as a mechanism integrating these spatially distributed signals."

Together, our results demonstrate that in the mammalian nervous system STIM1 is a key regulator of intracellular Ca2+ signaling, metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent synaptic transmission, and motor coordination. The metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1) is one of the most abundantly expressed mGluRs in the mammalian central nervous system (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M.

In various brain regions, mGluR1 is required for different forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and is thus important for learning and memory formation, cognition, emotional behaviors, and motor functions (Lüscher and Huber, 2010Lüscher C.

The highest expression level of mGluR1 in the brain is found in Purkinje neurons (PNs), the principal neurons of the cerebellar cortex (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S.

Neurol. 1992; 322: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Sensorimotor integration in the cerebellar cortex decisively depends on intact mGluR1-dependent synaptic transmission at parallel fiber synapses of PNs. In humans, cerebellar functions like motor coordination are heavily impaired by autoantibodies against mGluR1 (Coesmans et al., 2003Coesmans M. Smitt P.A. Linden D.J. Shigemoto R. Hirano T. Yamakawa Y. van Alphen A.M. Luo C. van der Geest J.N. Kros J.M. et al.Mechanisms underlying cerebellar motor deficits due to mGluR1-autoantibodies.Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In mice, genomic deletion of mGluR1 leads to severe symptoms of ataxia (Aiba et al., 1994Aiba A. Kano M. Chen C. Stanton M.E. Fox G.D. Herrup K. Zwingman T.A. Tonegawa S. Deficient cerebellar long-term depression and impaired motor learning in mGluR1 mutant mice.Cell. 1994; 79: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) that is alleviated by the exclusive expression of mGluR1 in Purkinje neurons (Ichise et al., 2000Ichise T. Kano M. Hashimoto K. Yanagihara D. Nakao K. Shigemoto R. Katsuki M. Aiba A. mGluR1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells essential for long-term depression, synapse elimination, and motor coordination.Science. 2000; 288: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Binding of glutamate to postsynaptic mGluR1 activates two major intracellular signaling pathways. First, by coupling to Gαq (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Galpha(q) and Galpha11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5119-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), mGluR1 activates phospholipase C and thus induces the generation of inositoltrisphosphate (IP3). Cytosolic IP3 will then open IP3-receptor channels and thereby mediate release of Ca2+ ions from intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores. In Purkinje neurons, IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from ER stores is most effectively triggered by the repetitive stimulation of afferent parallel fibers (Finch and Augustine, 1998Finch E.A. Augustine G.J. Local calcium signalling by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate in Purkinje cell dendrites.Nature. 1998; 396: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, Takechi et al., 1998Takechi H. Eilers J. Konnerth A. A new class of synaptic response involving calcium release in dendritic spines.Nature. 1998; 396: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). IP3 receptor-dependent Ca2+ release in dendritic spines plays a key role for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, such as long-term depression (LTD), and motor learning (Miyata et al., 2000Miyata M. Finch E.A. Khiroug L. Hashimoto K. Hayasaka S. Oda S.I. Inouye M. Takagishi Y. Augustine G.J. Kano M.

Accordingly, impairments in the signal transduction pathway, including loss of Gαq (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M.

The second signaling pathway that is concomitantly activated by mGluR1 underlies the generation of a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (sEPSP) (Batchelor et al., 1994Batchelor A.M. Madge D.J. Garthwaite J. Synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the parallel fibre-Purkinje cell pathway in rat cerebellar slices.Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It has been shown that sEPSPs are also dependent on Gαq (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A.

Impairments in TRPC3-mediated signaling cause major defects in Purkinje neuron function and cerebellar motor behavior (Becker et al., 2009Becker E.B. Oliver P.L. Glitsch M.D. Banks G.T. Achilli F.

Similar deficiencies in motor control can be observed when the IP3 receptor-dependent signaling pathway is interrupted (Matsumoto et al., 1996Matsumoto M. Nakagawa T. Inoue T. Nagata E. Tanaka K.

In light of these interesting observations in nonneuronal cells, we explored the role of STIM1 in neuronal intracellular Ca2+ signaling and mGluR1-dependent synaptic transmission. First, we determined mRNA expression of Stim1 and its close homolog Stim2 (Williams et al., 2001Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V.

In whole cerebellum, mRNA levels of Stim1 were higher than those of Stim2 (Figure 1B; 2,697 ± 334 copies/ng mRNA for Stim1 versus 1,700 ± 24 for Stim2, n = 3 cerebella), a difference that was more pronounced at the level of single PNs (Figure 1C; 103 ± 71 copies of Stim1 mRNA/PN versus 11 ± 8 of Stim2, n = 23 and 14 PNs, respectively). In accordance with this transcription pattern, STIM1 protein is present in PN somata and dendrites as revealed by immunostaining (Figure 1D). The finding that in PNs, STIM1 is more abundant than STIM2 is surprising, as it contrasts with previous results in hippocampal (Berna-Erro et al., 2009Berna-Erro A. Braun A. Kraft R. Kleinschnitz C. Schuhmann M.K. Stegner D. Wultsch T. Eilers J. Meuth S.G. Stoll G. Nieswandt B. STIM2 regulates capacitive Ca2+ entry in neurons and plays a key role in hypoxic neuronal cell death.Sci.

Differential roles for STIM1 and STIM2 in store-operated calcium entry in rat neurons.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e19285Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), where STIM2 levels exceed those of STIM1. To elucidate the functional role of STIM1 in PNs, we generated mice that lack STIM1 selectively in PNs (STIM1pko) by excising exon 6 (which encodes the transmembrane domain of STIM1; Sabbioni et al., 1999Sabbioni S. Veronese A. Trubia M. Taramelli R. Barbanti-Brodano G. Croce C.M. Negrini M.

Glutamate receptor δ2 is essential for input pathway-dependent regulation of synaptic AMPAR contents in cerebellar Purkinje cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3362-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunostaining in these STIM1pko mice showed preservation of STIM1 expression in the granular layer (GL) but its absence in the PN layer (PNL) and the molecular layer (ML), which contains the dendrites of PNs (Figure 2A). We verified that the PN-specific deletion of Stim1 did not interfere significantly with the expression of mGluR1-associated genes (Figure S1 available online) and proteins (Figure S2). STIM1pko mice had no obvious motor deficits under standard cage conditions. However, when walking on a thin (1 cm) elevated beam, a test that probes cerebellar function (Hartmann et al., 2004Hartmann J. Blum R. Kovalchuk Y. Adelsberger H. Kuner R. Durand G.M. Miyata M. Kano M. Offermanns S. Konnerth A. Distinct roles of Galpha(q) and Galpha11 for Purkinje cell signaling and motor behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5119-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), STIM1pko mice performed poorly with a significantly higher number of hindpaw slips compared to control littermates (Figure 2B, left). In addition to that, STIM1pko mice exhibited impaired motor learning. Thus, in repeated sessions on an accelerating rotarod device, they showed little improvement in comparison to control mice, which after 4–5 sessions managed to stay on the turning rod for significantly longer time periods than did STIM1pko mice (Figure 2B, right). Together, these results indicate that the deletion of STIM1 in PNs causes distinct alterations in motor behavior. Cerebellar motor deficits can result from impaired transmission and plasticity at glutamatergic synapses (Ito, 2006Ito M. Cerebellar circuitry as a neuronal machine.Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 78: 272-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first analyzed AMPA receptor-mediated fast synaptic excitation in STIM1pko mice by performing whole-cell recordings of parallel fiber-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in acute cerebellar slices. As in control conditions (Konnerth et al., 1990Konnerth A. Llano I. Armstrong C.M. Synaptic currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2662-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), single stimulation-evoked EPSCs in STIM1pko mice were sensitive to the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 40 μM; Figure 2C). The time course of the EPSCs was highly similar in mutant and control animals (Figure 2D). Furthermore, paired-pulse facilitation, a characteristic form of presynaptic short-term plasticity (Atluri and Regehr, 1996Atluri P.P. Regehr W.G. Determinants of the time course of facilitation at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5661-5671PubMed Google Scholar) in parallel fiber-PN synapses (Konnerth et al., 1990Konnerth A. Llano I. Armstrong C.M. Synaptic currents in cerebellar Purkinje cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2662-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), was not altered in the absence of STIM1 (Figure 2E; n = 14 PNs in STIM1pko and n = 7 PNs in control mice). Thus, AMPA receptor-mediated transmission is not affected by loss of STIM1 in PNs, and also presynaptic glutamate release is normal. Cerebellar function critically relies on mGluR1 that is expressed at high density at PN excitatory synapses (Ichise et al., 2000Ichise T. Kano M. Hashimoto K. Yanagihara D. Nakao K. Shigemoto R.

The objective of our study was to determine whether endogenous retrovirus group WE, member l (ERVWE1)/syncytin-1 and endogenous retrovirus group FRD, member 1 (ERVFRDE1)/ syncytin-2, encoded by human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope (env) genes, are present at the surface of exosomes produced by placenta-derived villous cytotrophoblasts and whether they play a role in cellular uptake of exosomes. In addition, we sought to determine whether these proteins are present in various abundances in serum-derived exosomes from normal pregnant women vs. women with preeclampsia (PE). Isolated exosomes were analyzed for their content by Western blot, a bead-associated flow cytometry approach, and a syncytin-2 ELISA. Binding and uptake were tested through confocal and electron microscopy using the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line. Quality control of exosome preparations consisted of detection of exosomal and nonexosomal markers. Exosome–cell interactions were compared between cells incubated in the presence of control exosomes, syncytin-1 or syncytin-2-deprived exosomes, or exosomes solely bearing the uncleaved forms of these HERV env proteins. From our data, we conclude that villous cytotrophoblast exosomes are positive for both env proteins and are rapidly taken up by BeWo cells in a syncytin-1- and syncytin-2-dependent manner and that syncytin-2 is reduced in serum-derived exosomes from women with PE when compared to exosomes from normal pregnant women.—Vargas, A., Zhou, S., Éthier-Chiasson, M., Flipo, D., Lafond, J., Gilbert, C., Barbeau, B.

https://openalex.org/W2110194980,"The traditional view on visual processing emphasizes a hierarchy: local line segments are first linked into global contours, which in turn are assembled into more complex forms. Distinct from this bottom-up viewpoint, here we provide evidence for a theoretical framework whereby objects and their parts are processed almost concurrently in a bidirectional cortico-cortical loop. By simultaneous recordings from V1 and V4 in awake monkeys, we found that information about global contours in a cluttered background emerged initially in V4, started ∼40 ms later in V1, and continued to develop in parallel in both areas. Detailed analysis of neuronal response properties implicated contour integration to emerge from both bottom-up and reentrant processes. Our results point to an incremental integration mechanism: feedforward assembling accompanied by feedback disambiguating to define and enhance the global contours and to suppress background noise. The consequence is a parallel accumulation of contour information over multiple cortical areas."

Whether there is a quantum critical point (QCP) beneath the dome, and whether it is related to the enigmatic pseudogap, has been heavily debated. Two papers address this question in two different families of Bi-based cuprates. In (Bi,Pb) 2 (Sr,La) 2 CuO 6+δ , He et al. (p. 608 ) found that the Fermi surface (FS) undergoes a topological change as doping is increased, which points to the existence of a QCP at a doping close to the maximum in T c , seemingly uncorrelated with the pseudogap. Fujita et al. (p. 612 ) studied a range of dopings in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ to find an FS reconstruction simultaneous with the disappearance of both rotational and translational symmetry breaking, the latter of which has been associated with the pseudogap.

https://openalex.org/W1981729419,"Miniature neurotransmission is the transsynaptic process where single synaptic vesicles spontaneously released from presynaptic neurons induce miniature postsynaptic potentials. Since their discovery over 60 years ago, miniature events have been found at every chemical synapse studied. However, the in vivo necessity for these small-amplitude events has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that miniature neurotransmission is required for the normal structural maturation of Drosophila glutamatergic synapses in a developmental role that is not shared by evoked neurotransmission. Conversely, we find that increasing miniature events is sufficient to induce synaptic terminal growth. We show that miniature neurotransmission acts locally at terminals to regulate synapse maturation via a Trio guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and Rac1 GTPase molecular signaling pathway. Our results establish that miniature neurotransmission, a universal but often-overlooked feature of synapses, has unique and essential functions in vivo."

Although it is established that signals generated by receptor tyrosine kinases TrkA and Ret coordinate the development of distinct nociceptive circuits, mechanisms modulating TrkA or Ret pathways in developing nociceptors are unknown. We have identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1) as a critical modifier of TrkA and Ret signaling in peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Specifically, TrkA+ peptidergic nociceptors require TNF-α-TNFR1 forward signaling to suppress nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite growth, survival, excitability, and differentiation. Conversely, TNFR1-TNF-α reverse signaling augments the neurite growth and excitability of Ret+ nonpeptidergic nociceptors. The developmental and functional nociceptive defects associated with loss of TNFR1 signaling manifest behaviorally as lower pain thresholds caused by increased sensitivity to NGF.

The ability to discriminate between innocuous and painful touch is critical for survival. Nociceptors are polymodal sensory neurons that relay information about noxious tactile cues from peripheral targets to the spinal cord (Julius and Basbaum, 2001Julius D. Basbaum A.I.

Importantly, nociceptors are defined by their high excitability thresholds for thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimuli, meaning that pain is perceived only when these stimuli are potent enough to trigger action potentials (Woolf and Salter, 2000Woolf C.J.

The molecular dynamics of pain control.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Critical properties of nociceptors that govern the perceived intensity of a painful stimulus include density of peripheral target innervation, proper targeting of central projections, and high excitability thresholds (Pezet and McMahon, 2006Pezet S. McMahon S.B. Neurotrophins: mediators and modulators of pain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 507-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). It follows that if any of these components were enhanced or attenuated then the perception of pain would be altered. Target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF) initiates signaling pathways critical for tuning nociceptor sensitivity through the regulation of survival, neurite growth, and excitability (Crowley et al., 1994Crowley C.

The two major populations of mature nociceptor subclasses are peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Peptidergic nociceptors express TrkA, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P throughout development and are responsive to target-derived NGF (Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012Lallemend F. Ernfors P. Molecular interactions underlying the specification of sensory neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 373-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Nonpeptidergic nociceptors do not express TrkA or neuropeptides, but rather express an RTK, Ret, that is responsive to the target-derived glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands (Airaksinen and Saarma, 2002Airaksinen M.S.

Loss of GDNF family receptor α2 (GFRα2), a Ret coreceptor that responds to the GDNF family ligand neurturin (NRTN), impairs peripheral target innervation and sensitivity to inflammatory pain (Lindfors et al., 2006Lindfors P.H. Võikar V. Rossi J. Airaksinen M.S. Deficient nonpeptidergic epidermis innervation and reduced inflammatory pain in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor α2 knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1953-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, acute pain is sensed by TrkA+ peptidergic nociceptors in the absence of NRTN signaling, suggesting that TrkA+ and Ret+ nociceptors are functionally distinct from one another in adulthood despite being derived from the same early TrkA+ nociceptor lineage during embryonic development (Marmigère and Ernfors, 2007Marmigère F.

Generation of somatic sensory neuron diversity and implications on sensory coding.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that NGF-TrkA signaling is critical for the orchestration of peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive circuits that underlie the perception of distinct forms of painful touch. Given the broad phenotypes and functions that NGF-TrkA signaling regulates, it stands to reason that there should be factors that modulate TrkA signals and, by extension, nociceptor development and function. Clues for this hypothesis come from studies in the sympathetic nervous system, a system that also requires NGF-TrkA signaling for survival and target innervation (Crowley et al., 1994Crowley C. Spencer S.D. Nishimura M.C. Chen K.S. Pitts-Meek S. Armanini M.P. Ling L.H. McMahon S.B. Shelton D.L.

Ginty D.D. Heterogeneous requirement of NGF for sympathetic target innervation in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In sympathetic neurons, antagonism of NGF-TrkA signals can occur via the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) that induces death (Deppmann et al., 2008Deppmann C.D. Mihalas S. Sharma N. Lonze B.E.

Lee F.S. Ginty D.D. Long-distance control of synapse assembly by target-derived NGF.Neuron. 2010; 67: 422-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As such, elimination of p75NTR is analogous to TrkA gain of function in sympathetic neurons. Consequently, one would expect that the loss of p75NTR in nociceptors would manifest as heightened pain sensitivity. However, numerous reports argue the opposite; loss of p75NTR results in decreased pain sensitivity and reduced cutaneous innervation by nociceptors (Lee et al., 1992Lee K.F. Li E. Huber L.J. Landis S.C. Sharpe A.H. Chao M.V. Jaenisch R.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nociceptors from p75NTR−/− mice are roughly 3-fold less sensitive to NGF (Davies et al., 1993Davies A.M. Lee K.F. Jaenisch R. p75-deficient trigeminal sensory neurons have an altered response to NGF but not to other neurotrophins.Neuron. 1993; 11: 565-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 1994Lee K.F. Davies A.M. Jaenisch R. p75-deficient embryonic dorsal root sensory and neonatal sympathetic neurons display a decreased sensitivity to NGF.Development. 1994; 120: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that p75NTR likely augments NGF-TrkA signaling in nociceptors. If not p75NTR, might a different receptor gate NGF-TrkA signaling in nociceptors? It is possible that receptors structurally related to p75NTR may function as negative regulators of NGF-TrkA signals in nociceptors. Indeed, p75NTR is just one of over 25 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) superfamily members, many of which are implicated in the modulation of growth factor signaling (Deppmann and Janes, 2013Deppmann C.D.

The TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies: integrating mammalian biology.Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we screened for the expression of 23 TNFR family members in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG); this screening revealed the selective expression of three highly related TNFR family members: TNFR1, p75NTR, and death receptor 6 (DR6). Herein we pursued the role of TNFR1 signaling in nociceptor development in part because it has been shown to negatively regulate events such as neurite growth and survival in the sympathetic nervous system (Barker et al., 2001Barker V. Middleton G. Davey F. Davies A.M. TNFalpha contributes to the death of NGF-dependent neurons during development.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Kisiswa et al., 2013Kisiswa L. Osório C. Erice C. Vizard T. Wyatt S. Davies A.M. TNFα reverse signaling promotes sympathetic axon growth and target innervation.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar to phenotypes observed in the sympathetic nervous system, we report that TNFR1 forward signaling can also inhibit the development of NGF-TrkA-dependent sensory circuits by negatively regulating neurite growth, cell number, and excitability of TrkA+ primary nociceptors. Moreover, loss of either TNF-α or TNFR1 forward signaling drives TrkA+ nociceptors toward a premature nonpeptidergic fate. Surprisingly, we found that TNFR1 plays a dichotomous role in the function of peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Although TrkA+ peptidergic nociceptors exhibit increased responsiveness to NGF as evidenced by enhanced growth and excitability in the absence of TNFR1 or TNF-α, the Ret+/TrkA− population of nonpeptidergic nociceptors exhibits functional impairments in NRTN-dependent neurite outgrowth and excitability due to absence of TNFR1-TNF-α reverse signaling. We demonstrate that Tnf and Tnfr1 null mice are hypersensitive to several pain modalities, likely caused by enhanced nociceptor sensitivity to NGF. Finally, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the increased gain in nociceptive signals observed in Tnf or Tnfr1 knockouts is linked to an increase in the NGF sensitivity of TrkA+ nociceptors. These results suggest that TNF-α and TNFR1 coordinate the development and function of molecularly distinct nociceptive circuits through crosstalk with TrkA and Ret to either block or promote pain sensitivity in peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptor populations, respectively. In order to identify putative factors that can antagonize NGF-TrkA-dependent signaling in nociceptors, we examined the expression of 23 TNFR family members in embryonic day (E)18.5 DRG, brain, or muscle via RT-PCR (Figure S1A available online). This analysis revealed expression of three highly related TNFR family members in the DRG: p75NTR (TNFRSF16), Dr6 (TNFRSF21), and Tnfr1 (TNFRSF1A). We focused on TNFR1, an understudied TNFR family member in the context of nociceptor development and function. Given that TNFR1 is robustly expressed in the DRG, which contains many different cell types, we next sought to determine whether it is expressed on nociceptors. To this end, we performed immunohistochemistry to examine the percentage of colocalization of TNFR1 with CGRP, peripherin, or TrkA at postnatal day (P)0 (Figures 1A–1C). CGRP and TrkA represent peptidergic nociceptors, whereas peripherin labels small-diameter unmyelinated nociceptors. In each case, TNFR1 colocalizes with nociceptive markers >99% of the time (Figure S2A). In addition, we found that TNFR1 appears to be broadly expressed in the DRG as it colocalizes with parvalbumin+ proprioceptive neurons (Figure S2C). We performed the same analysis at P30 when most nociceptors are terminally specialized into distinct functional subclasses (Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012Lallemend F. Ernfors P. Molecular interactions underlying the specification of sensory neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 373-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition to CGRP, TrkA, and peripherin, we examined nonpeptidergic neurons by staining with the fluorescently conjugated lectin IB4. We observed similar levels of colocalization at P30 as at P0 (i.e., at least >99% of nociceptors are positive for TNFR1) (Figures 1D–1G; Figure S2B). We validated the TNFR1 antibody (Figure S1B) and found that TNFR1 is localized to both the cell bodies and axons of sensory neurons both in vivo (Figure S1C) and in vitro (Figure S1D). Together, these analyses suggest that TNFR1 is ubiquitously expressed by nociceptors across different stages of sensory circuit development, ranging from early to mature nociceptor populations. We also sought to localize the sources of TNF-α in developing nociceptive circuits. After validating the TNF-α antibody (Figures S1E–S1G), we found that TNF-α is enriched on sensory neurons in the P4 DRG (Figure S1H), in the epidermis between P0 and P30 (Figures 1H and 1I), and in the marginal zone and second-order spinal cord neurons at P7 (Figure 1J). Importantly, we found that TNFR2, a close relative of TNFR1 that also binds TNF-α, was absent from the DRG (Figure S1A) and spinal cord (Figure S1I). Taken together these data suggest that sensory neurons, peripheral targets, and central targets express TNF-α, which may signal to nociceptors exclusively through TNFR1 during critical periods of nociceptor circuit development and maturation. During normal developmental processes, a critical function of NGF-TrkA signaling is control of nociceptor neurite growth into peripheral targets (Patel et al., 2000Patel T.D. Jackman A. Rice F.L. Kucera J. Snider W.D. Development of sensory neurons in the absence of NGF/TrkA signaling in vivo.Neuron. 2000; 25: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). If TNF-α-TNFR1 signaling antagonizes NGF-TrkA-dependent growth of nociceptors into peripheral targets, we would predict that axon overgrowth into the skin would be observed in Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− mice. To test whether TNF-α-TNFR1 signaling is indeed required, in vivo, for proper axon innervation of peripheral targets, we performed immunohistochemical analyses for nociceptive fibers in the epidermis, as described previously (Zylka et al., 2005Zylka M.J. Rice F.L. Anderson D.J. Topographically distinct epidermal nociceptive circuits revealed by axonal tracers targeted to Mrgprd.Neuron. 2005; 45: 17-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). First, we observed that there is an increased density of small-diameter peripherin+ fibers in glabrous skin at P0 in Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− animals relative to wild-type (WT) (Figure 2A). We then stained for the pan-axonal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) and observed twice as many PGP9.5+ nociceptive fibers projecting into the epidermis in Tnfr1−/− or Tnf−/− mice than WT mice by P30, suggesting that TNF-α and TNFR1 normally suppress neurite growth programs in the periphery (Figures 2B and 2C). Finally, whole-mount substance P immunostaining of the forepaw revealed that as early as E14.5, nociceptive fibers densely innervate the digits and footpad of the paw in mice lacking TNF-α or TNFR1 (Figure 2D). Taken together these data suggest that the TNF-α-TNFR1 pathway is critical in regulating growth and refinement of nociceptor peripheral projections in vivo. To examine the role of TNFR1 on NGF-TrkA-dependent neurite growth in vitro, we established dissociated sensory neurons from WT, Tnfr1−/−, or Tnf−/− mice in microfluidic devices, which spatially isolate neuronal cell bodies and neurites (Sharma et al., 2010Sharma N. Deppmann C.D. Harrington A.W. St Hillaire C. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. Ginty D.D. Long-distance control of synapse assembly by target-derived NGF.Neuron. 2010; 67: 422-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We found that WT neurons bathed in NGF along with TNF-α or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) showed significantly lower rates of neurite growth than WT neurons bathed in NGF alone (Figure 2E). Strikingly, Tnfr1−/− neurites grew roughly five times faster than WT neurons in response to 10 ng/ml NGF, suggesting that TNFR1 plays a role in suppressing NGF-dependent neurite growth (Figure 2E). Although TNF-α had no effect on NGF-dependent neurite growth in Tnfr1−/− neurons, we observed that BDNF still slowed neurite growth in Tnfr1−/− neurons bathed in NGF, albeit to a lesser degree than BDNF treatment on WT mice neurons (Figure 2E). Interestingly, neurite growth of dissociated Tnf−/− neurons revealed separable roles for TNF-α and TNFR1, suggesting that TNFR1 may suppress nociceptor neurite growth in the absence of TNF-α. To assess the effect of NGF-mediated neurite growth on whole ganglia from Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− mice, E14.5 DRG explants were cultured in NGF, yielding results corroborating excessive NGF-dependent growth in the Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− explants; Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− neurites grew approximately three times faster than WT neurites (Figures 2F–2I). It is possible that paracrine, rather than autocrine, axon pruning programs are more dominant, yielding the difference in relative neurite growth rates between dissociated Tnf−/− nociceptors and explant cultures. Together, these data suggest that neurons lacking Tnfr1 or Tnf are more responsive to NGF in the context of in vitro neurite growth assays due to loss of TNF-α-TNFR1 forward signaling. In Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− mice, nociceptor peripheral projections display phenotypes reminiscent of those observed in classical NGF-TrkA gain-of-function experiments, demonstrating fiber overgrowth into peripheral targets (Aloe et al., 1975Aloe L. Mugnaini E. Levi-Montalcini R. Light and electron microscopic studies on the excessive growth of sympathetic ganglia in rats injected daily from birth with 6-OHDA and NGF.Arch. Ital. Biol. 1975; 113: 326-353PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to test whether nociceptor central projections were disrupted similar to peripheral projections in Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− mice. To address this, we compared peptidergic (TrkA+, CGRP+) central projections in the spinal cord between WT, Tnfr1−/−, and Tnf−/− mice at P0, P7, and P30. We noted complete segregation of peptidergic (CGRP+) and nonpeptidergic (IB4+) axons in the dorsal horn by P30 (Figures S3A–S3C), suggesting that nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate specification is intact (Chen et al., 2006bChen C.L. Broom D.C. Liu Y. de Nooij J.C. Li Z. Cen C. Samad O.A. Jessell T.M. Woolf C.J. Ma Q. Runx1 determines nociceptive sensory neuron phenotype and is required for thermal and neuropathic pain.Neuron. 2006; 49: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, we found that mice lacking Tnfr1 or Tnf display an ∼50% larger area occupied by TrkA+ and CGRP+ peptidergic fibers than WT lumbar dorsal horn at P0 (Figures 3A–3G). Moreover, most sections contained axon bundles that misprojected within the dorsal horn and extended medially and/or laterally (Figure 3H). The same analyses performed at P7 and P30 revealed similar phenotypes, suggesting that central projection defects are stable even after terminal differentiation (Figures 3I–3X). The enhanced growth and misguidance of Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− central projections are reminiscent of other pathways that negatively modulate NGF-dependent central projections such as HoxD1 (Guo et al., 2011Guo T. Mandai K. Condie B.G. Wickramasinghe S.R. Capecchi M.R. Ginty D.D. An evolving NGF-Hoxd1 signaling pathway mediates development of divergent neural circuits in vertebrates.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF-α-TNFR1 signaling is also required for proper growth and refinement of nociceptor central projections. There are several possible explanations for the increase in peptidergic peripheral and central projection densities that occur in Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− mice: (1) an increase in the neurite density of individual nociceptors; and/or (2) more nociceptors in the DRG, which would increase the overall number of fibers projecting to the skin and spinal cord. Although we have established that loss of TNFR1 signaling enhances NGF-dependent neurite growth, it is also possible that TNFR1 antagonizes nonaxon growth aspects of NGF-TrkA signaling such as cell death and differentiation in the DRG. To test this possibility we examined cell number in the DRG by counting the number of TrkA+ nociceptors at P0, P14, and P30, time points corresponding to key regulatory events in the survival and differentiation of nociceptors (Marmigère and Ernfors, 2007Marmigère F. Ernfors P. Specification and connectivity of neuronal subtypes in the sensory lineage.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed a significant decrease in the TrkA+ nociceptor population at P0 in Tnfr1−/− and Tnf−/− mice but, relative to WT, more TrkA+ neurons at P14 and P30 (Figure 4A). It is possible that the appearance of fewer TrkA+ neurons at P0 may not be due to an altered trophic threshold for survival; rather, it may have to do with altered differentiation programs. Indeed, it is e"

Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is important for microglial functions such as the release of cytokines and NO from activated microglia. There is increasing evidence suggesting that pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is related to the inflammatory responses mediated by microglia. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin well known for its roles in the activation of microglia as well as in pathophysiology and/or treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we sought to examine the underlying mechanism of BDNF-induced sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in rodent microglial cells. We observed that canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3) channels contribute to the maintenance of BDNF-induced sustained intracellular Ca2+ elevation. Immunocytochemical technique and flow cytometry also revealed that BDNF rapidly up-regulated the surface expression of TRPC3 channels in rodent microglial cells. In addition, pretreatment with BDNF suppressed the production of NO induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which was prevented by co-adiministration of a selective TRPC3 inhibitor. These suggest that BDNF induces sustained intracellular Ca2+ elevation through the up-regulation of surface TRPC3 channels and TRPC3 channels could be important for the BDNF-induced suppression of the NO production in activated microglia. We show that TRPC3 channels could also play important roles in microglial functions, which might be important for the regulation of inflammatory responses and may also be involved in the pathophysiology and/or the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders."

The presence, degree, and longevity of these synaptic changes appear to depend on several factors such as drug dose, length of exposure and withdrawal, MSN subtype, and NAc subregion. However, factors controlling drug-induced synaptic plasticity remain elusive. Here, we identify a role for the RNA-binding protein, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as a key regulator of synaptic and behavioral alterations following exposure to cocaine (COC). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that control excitatory synapse number remain poorly understood. We and others have reported that the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors negatively regulates glutamatergic synapse and dendritic spine number in hippocampal neurons (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Paradis S. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Chen C. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of MEF2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number.Science. 2006; 311: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We extended these findings to the adult NAc in vivo, showing that MEF2 regulates the dendritic spine density of NAc MSNs basally and that chronic COC administration can increase NAc MSN spine density, at least in part, by inhibition of MEF2 (Pulipparacharuvil et al., 2008Pulipparacharuvil S.

Most recently, we reported that MEF2-induced synapse elimination in hippocampal neurons requires the RNA-binding capabilities of FMRP (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R.

FMRP regulates the transport, stability, and/or translation rate of more than 850 brain mRNAs, many of which are linked to synaptic function (Darnell et al., 2011Darnell J.C. Van Driesche S.J.

Loss of FMRP expression in humans, as occurs in fragile X syndrome (FXS), results in a variety of neurological symptoms, including sensory hypersensitivity, intellectual disability, and often, autism-associated behaviors and/or epilepsy (for review, see Hagerman, 2006Hagerman R.J. Lessons from fragile X regarding neurobiology, autism, and neurodegeneration.J. Dev. Behav. Pediatr. 2006; 27: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In dendrites, FMRP regulates local protein synthesis of associated mRNAs, at least in part, by stalling translation on polyribosomes (Ceman et al., 2003Ceman S. O’Donnell W.T. Reed M. Patton S.

Glutamate-dependent activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5 [also known as GRM1 and GRM5]) increases local protein synthesis through transient dephosphorylation and degradation of FMRP (Ceman et al., 2003Ceman S.

Several studies have reported an important role for FMRP in regulating mGluR5-dependent synaptic weakening (long-term depression; LTD) (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T.

Epping-Jordan M.P. Zocchi A. Marcon C. Cottiny C. Tacconi S. Corsi M. Orzi F. Conquet F. Reinforcing and locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine are absent in mGluR5 null mutant mice.Nat.

Operant sensation seeking requires metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5).PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As such, we sought to test whether FMRP regulates COC-induced behavioral and synaptic plasticity in vivo. To test the role of FMRP in behavioral responses to repeated COC administration, we compared behavioral sensitization in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice to wild-type (WT) littermates. Behavioral sensitization results from enduring and functional neuroadaptations in the NAc and reward-related circuitry that are hypothesized to underlie the transition to compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior in addiction (Koob and Volkow, 2010Koob G.F. Volkow N.D. Neurocircuitry of addiction.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 217-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). Using either moderate or high doses of COC (daily intraperitoneal [i.p.] injections at 15 or 30 mg/kg for 7 days), we observed that, while both groups showed sensitization to COC, WT mice achieved significantly higher levels of behavioral sensitization than Fmr1 KO mice (Figures 1A–1D; see statistics listed in Table S1 available online). It is interesting that COC injections on the first few days elicited similar locomotor responses in both WT and Fmr1 KO mice, suggesting that FMRP is not required for initial COC-induced activity or early sensitization but is required for the mechanisms controlling maximal motor sensitization after repeated exposures. Once developed, reduced sensitized responses in Fmr1 KO mice were also observed after 3 to 7 days of withdrawal, at several different COC challenge doses (7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg; Figures 1B and 1D), and at 4 and 10 total months of withdrawal (Figure 1D). In contrast, neither the sensitized locomotion to context alone (saline [SAL]; Figure 1B, “0” challenge) nor the activity during noninjection trials (habituation trials in Figures S1A and S1B) were different between genotypes. Since the observed group differences could result from hypersensitivity to COC-induced stereotypy in Fmr1 KO mice, we used a time-sampling approach (Kelley, 1998Kelley A.E. Measurement of rodent stereotyped behavior.in: Crawley J.N. Gerfen C.R. McKay R. Rogawski M.A. Sibley D.R. Skolnick P. Current Protocols in Neuroscience. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar) to evaluate SAL- or COC-induced stereotypy in Fmr1 KO and WT littermates, scoring behaviors both individually and on a published scale (Spangler et al., 1997Spangler R. Zhou Y. Schlussman S.D. Ho A. Kreek M.J. Behavioral stereotypies induced by “binge’ cocaine administration are independent of drug-induced increases in corticosterone levels.Behav. Brain Res. 1997; 86: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). While WT and Fmr1 KO littermates did not differ after repeated SAL or acute, high-dose COC (30 mg/kg) on any stereotypy-related assessments, Fmr1 KO mice showed significantly greater stereotypy after repeated high-dose COC (Figure 1F, “Repeated”; for matching locomotion, see Figures 1G and S1E). More detailed analysis showed that the heightened stereotypy involved primarily orofacial behaviors (i.e., taffy pulling and paws to mouth; Figure 1H), but not grooming- or sniffing-related activities (Figures S1F and S1G). In contrast, stereotypy was not heightened in Fmr1 KO mice following a lower dose challenge (15 mg/kg; Figure 1F, “Challenge”), even though locomotor activity remained significantly impaired (last challenge in Figure 1D). To determine whether the increase in stereotypy at 30 mg/kg could reflect a general hypersensitivity to COC in Fmr1 KO mice, we also assessed sensitization using two lower doses of COC (5 and 10 mg/kg). While both genotypes sensitized to each dose, there were no locomotor differences between the groups (Figures S1C and S1D), indicating that Fmr1 KO mice are not hypersensitive to COC in general. Together, these data suggest that loss of FMRP impairs behavioral sensitization at moderate COC doses but enhances the development of stereotypy at higher COC doses. Deficits in the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling cascade have previously been shown in Fmr1 KO mice (Wang et al., 2008Wang H. Wu L.-J. Kim S.S. Lee F.J.S. Gong B. Toyoda H. Ren M. Shang Y.-Z. Xu H. Liu F. et al.FMRP acts as a key messenger for dopamine modulation in the forebrain.Neuron. 2008; 59: 634-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which could be relevant to our observations regarding sensitization. To address this possibility, we examined phosphorylation of the serine-845 site of glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1), a downstream target of this cascade, in Fmr1 KO and WT littermates after a COC dosing regimen similar to that used for sensitization testing. We observed a similar induction of P-S845 levels in WT and KO mice striata after acute or chronic COC dosing (Figure S1H), suggesting that a deficit in COC-induced activation of cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent signaling in the striatum is unlikely to account for the behavioral alterations that we observed. To test whether FMRP influences other types of COC-induced behaviors, we examined COC reward in a naive cohort of WT and Fmr1 KO mice using the COC conditioned place preference (CPP) assay. In this assay, mice are injected with either COC (7.5 mg/kg) or SAL and placed in one of two contextually distinct chambers on conditioning days. On pre- and posttest days, mice are placed into the center chamber and allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 20 min, and time spent in the COC-paired chamber minus time spent in the SAL-paired chamber is defined as COC preference. Similar to the locomotor sensitization results, we observed a significant reduction in preference for the COC-paired chamber in Fmr1 KO mice (Figure 2B), suggesting that FMRP is required for COC reward and/or learning and memory of context-drug associations. Similar to the behavioral sensitization findings, the COC reward deficit disappeared at a lower dose (5 mg/kg), where both WT and KO mice showed reduced, but comparable, preference for the drug-paired chamber (Figure S2A). Consistent with demonstration of normal reward learning at lower doses of COC, we observed that Fmr1 KO mice showed normal context- and cue-induced freezing at 24 hr after receiving three mild, aversive foot shocks in the standard fear conditioning assay (Figures 2C and S2B), suggesting that Fmr1 KO mice are able to remember a salient stimulus-context association in a timeframe similar to that used in the COC CPP assay. Given that Fmr1 KO mice model a clinical condition, FXS, we next asked whether deficits in COC reward behaviors would extend to natural reward, which would have important implications for this patient population. To assess this possibility, we used the same COC CPP chambers to test WT and Fmr1 KO mice for palatable food-based CPP. Both genotypes showed equivalent preference for high-fat chow compared to regular chow (Figures 2D and 2E). Similarly, we observed no genotype differences in the preference for sucrose at multiple concentrations (Figures 2F and S2C) in the standard two-bottle choice test. Together, these results suggest that FMRP is not required for all reward-related behaviors and may be more specific to drug reward behavior. A number of FXS-related phenotypes have now been attributed to hyperactivity or hypersensitivity of mGluR5 (Dölen et al., 2007Dölen G. Osterweil E. Rao B.S.S. Smith G.B. Auerbach B.D. Chattarji S. Bear M.F. Correction of fragile X syndrome in mice.Neuron. 2007; 56: 955-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and manipulating mGluR5 activity has been shown to alter drug reward behaviors (Olive, 2009Olive M.F. Metabotropic glutamate receptor ligands as potential therapeutics for addiction.Curr. Drug Abuse Rev. 2009; 2: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Rutten et al., 2011Rutten K. Van Der Kam E.L. De Vry J. Bruckmann W. Tzschentke T.M. The mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) potentiates conditioned place preference induced by various addictive and non-addictive drugs in rats.Addict. Biol. 2011; 16: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a gene dosage approach to test whether mGluR5 hyperfunction might contribute to the observed deficit in COC reward behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. While mice lacking one copy of the mGluR5 gene (mGluR5+/−) had normal COC reward learning behavior, reducing mGluR5 levels did rescue the Fmr1 KO deficit (Figure 2G), suggesting that Fmr1 KO impairments in COC CPP stem from mGluR5 hyperactivity. Taken together, these results suggest that mice lacking FMRP have reduced sensitivity to the rewarding impact of moderate dose COC. In the adult brain, the NAc is a critical brain region for the development and expression of COC reward and behavioral sensitization. Fmr1/FMRP is expressed in the adult NAc (Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2014Allen Institute for Brain Science. (2014). Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. http://mouse.brain-map.org/Google Scholar; Figures S3C and S3D). To test whether FMRP in the adult NAc is required for the rewarding and behavioral effects of repeated COC administration, we performed bilateral injections of AAV2-Cre-GFP or AAV2-GFP control viruses in the NAc of adult floxed Fmr1 mutant mice (Mientjes et al., 2006Mientjes E.J. Nieuwenhuizen I. Kirkpatrick L. Zu T. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Severijnen L. Rifé M. Willemsen R. Nelson D.L. Oostra B.A. The generation of a conditional Fmr1 knock out mouse model to study Fmrp function in vivo.Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 21: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) to generate conditional KO of Fmr1 (NAc cKO) in the adult brain (Figure 3A). The Fmr1 NAc cKO and control mice were then tested for COC reward and behavioral sensitization, as indicated (Figure 3B). Neither conditional NAc deletion of Fmr1 (Figure 3C) nor conditional deletion of Fmr1 in dopaminergic neurons (DAT-Cre:Fmr1fl/y; Figure S3A), caused a significant deficit in COC reward behavior, suggesting that the observed COC reward deficit in Fmr1 KO mice is due to a role for FMRP in additional brain region(s) and/or to a developmental role for FMRP. In contrast, the Fmr1 NAc cKO mice showed a significant reduction in COC-induced behavioral sensitization (Figures 3D and S3B) reminiscent of the effect observed in Fmr1 total KO mice after repeated COC exposure, suggesting strongly that FMRP plays an active role in the adult NAc to mediate the plasticity underlying behavioral sensitization. In contrast to other factors implicated in COC-induced behavioral plasticity that appear to be regulated by COC (e.g., ΔFosB), we did not observe any evidence that FMRP mRNA or protein levels were altered by repeated COC administration at 24 hr after the last injection of either 15 or 30 mg/kg (Figures S3C and S3D). These findings indicate that FMRP’s function in mediating the normal development of behavioral sensitization does not likely involve changes in its basal levels. Taken together, our combined data suggest that FMRP functions in the adult NAc to mediate behavioral plasticity induced by repeated, moderate-to-high dose COC, but its role in COC reward behavior is more complex. Numerous studies have reported that repeated, high-dose COC exposure induces structural and synaptic plasticity in MSNs of the NAc, and some of these changes have been proposed to support or antagonize COC behaviors. FMRP is known to regulate synapse weakening and to promote dendritic spine and excitatory synapse elimination (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M.

Greenough W.T. Synaptic synthesis of the Fragile X protein: possible involvement in synapse maturation and elimination.Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 83: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), as well as to control proper dendritic branch extension and pruning (Thomas et al., 2008Thomas C.C. Combe C.L. Dyar K.A. Inglis F.M. Modest alterations in patterns of motor neuron dendrite morphology in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model for fragile X.Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 26: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To explore FMRP’s role in repeated COC-induced structural plasticity in the NAc, we injected WT and Fmr1 KO mice with repeated daily COC or SAL in the same manner as described previously (i.e., 15 mg/kg daily COC injections × 7 days; Figure 4A). We analyzed MSNs 24 hr after the last injection since (1) maximal behavioral sensitization has been fully established by this time, (2) behavioral sensitization differences between WT and Fmr1 KO mice are established and persistent through short- or long-term withdrawal, and (3) any relevant structural or functional changes in the NAc that regulate behavioral sensitization must also be present. Using a well-established Golgi staining procedure, we used stereomicroscopy to reconstruct MSNs from the NAc core or shell regions (Figure 4B). In the core subregion of Fmr1 KO mice, we observed that repeated COC exposure induced a significant increase in the number and total length of dendritic branches (Figures 4C and 4D). In contrast, no significant changes were observed in shell MSN dendritic branching morphology for WT or Fmr1 KO mice after repeated COC exposure (Figures S4A and S4B). We next analyzed dendritic spine density in core and shell MSNs in both WT and Fmr1 KO mice. In the core, we observed no alterations in dendritic spine density in WT or KO mice after repeated COC administration; however, there was a modest increase in overall core MSN spine density in Fmr1 KO mice compared to WT (Figure S4C, inset), which reached significance for the thin spine category (Figure S4C). Similar to the core, we observed no COC-induced changes in overall net dendritic spine density in shell MSNs from WT mice (Figure 4E, inset). While others, including our group, have observed COC-induced changes in this region, we note that most published studies have used higher doses of COC (20–30 mg/kg COC) and longer administrations. In contrast to the WT littermates, repeated COC exposure did significantly increase overall shell MSN spine density in Fmr1 KO mice (Figure 4E, inset). Closer examination revealed that thin and stubby spine subtypes were increased after COC treatment in Fmr1 KO mice, whereas no spine subtypes were altered by COC in WT mice. Together, these findings suggest that FMRP normally functions to antagonize the formation of NAc dendritic spines and branching in response to COC exposure, which is consistent with its known role as a mediator of dendritic pruning and spine elimination (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.E. Zang T. Wilkerson J.R. Taniguchi M. Maksimova M.A. Smith L.N. Cowan C.W. Huber K.M.

The findings reveal that an overall increase in NAc core or shell MSN spine density is not strictly required for the development and short-term expression of behavioral sensitization. Moreover, the precocious increase in dendritic spine density in NAc shell in the Fmr1 KO mice after repeated COC exposure correlates with a decrease in sensitized locomotion after short-term withdrawal, similar to several other reports (LaPlant et al., 2010LaPlant Q.

Down-regulation of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme DICER1 in the retinal pigmented epithelium has been implicated in geographic atrophy, an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, little is known about the function of DICER1 in mature rod photoreceptor cells, another retinal cell type that is severely affected in AMD. Using a conditional-knockout (cKO) mouse model, we report that loss of DICER1 in mature postmitotic rods leads to robust retinal degeneration accompanied by loss of visual function. At 14 wk of age, cKO mice exhibit a 90% reduction in photoreceptor nuclei and a 97% reduction in visual chromophore compared with those in control littermates. Before degeneration, cKO mice do not exhibit significant defects in either phototransduction or the visual cycle, suggesting that miRNAs play a primary role in rod photoreceptor survival. Using comparative small RNA sequencing analysis, we identified rod photoreceptor miRNAs of the miR-22, miR-26, miR-30, miR-92, miR-124, and let-7 families as potential factors involved in regulating the survival of rods.—Sundermeier, T.

The underlying genetic determinants are beginning to emerge and are interpreted in the context of years of work characterizing postsynaptic receptor and signaling functions of learning and memory. DNA sequence analysis of intellectual disability patients has revealed greater than 80 loci on the X-chromosome that are potentially linked to disease. One of the loci is zDHHC9, a gene encoding a Ras protein acyltransferase. Protein palmitoylation is a reversible modification that controls the subcellular localization and distribution of membrane receptors, scaffolds, and signaling proteins required for neuronal plasticity. Palmitoylation occurs in two steps. In the first step, autopalmitoylation, an enzyme-palmitoyl intermediate is formed. During the second step, the palmitoyl moiety is transferred to a protein substrate, or if no substrate is available, hydrolysis of the thioester linkage produces the enzyme and free palmitate. In this study, we demonstrate that two naturally occurring variants of zDHHC9, encoding R148W and P150S, affect the autopalmitoylation step of the reaction by lowering the steady state amount of the palmitoyl-zDHHC9 intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1970775756,"Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2 are cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that mediate the activation of signaling pathways in response to ligand stimulation of upstream cell surface receptors. Despite sharing a high level of homology and the ability to activate PI3K, only Irs-2 positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in mammary tumor cells. To determine the contribution of Irs-2-dependent PI3K signaling to this selective regulation, we generated an Irs-2 mutant deficient in the recruitment of PI3K. We identified four tyrosine residues (Tyr-649, Tyr-671, Tyr-734, and Tyr-814) that are essential for the association of PI3K with Irs-2 and demonstrate that combined mutation of these tyrosines inhibits glucose uptake and lactate production, two measures of aerobic glycolysis. Irs-2-dependent activation of PI3K regulates the phosphorylation of specific Akt substrates, most notably glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk-3β). Inhibition of Gsk-3β by Irs-2-dependent PI3K signaling promotes glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis. The regulation of unique subsets of Akt substrates by Irs-1 and Irs-2 may explain their non-redundant roles in mammary tumor biology. Taken together, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which Irs-2 signaling preferentially regulates tumor cell metabolism and adds to our understanding of how this adaptor protein contributes to breast cancer progression."

Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is a PDZ-containing protein known to bind GIRK2c/GIRK3 channels, but its function in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of SNX27 in regulating GIRK currents in dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Mice lacking SNX27 in DA neurons exhibited reduced GABABR-activated GIRK currents but had normal Ih currents and DA D2R-activated GIRK currents. Expression of GIRK2a, an SNX27-insensitive splice variant, restored GABABR-activated GIRK currents in SNX27-deficient DA neurons. Remarkably, mice with significantly reduced GABABR-activated GIRK currents in only DA neurons were hypersensitive to cocaine and could be restored to a normal locomotor response with GIRK2a expression.

Mice lacking SNX27 in DA neurons exhibited reduced GABABR-activated GIRK currents but had normal Ih currents and DA D2R-activated GIRK currents. Expression of GIRK2a, an SNX27-insensitive splice variant, restored GABABR-activated GIRK currents in SNX27-deficient DA neurons. Remarkably, mice with significantly reduced GABABR-activated GIRK currents in only DA neurons were hypersensitive to cocaine and could be restored to a normal locomotor response with GIRK2a expression. These results identify a pathway for regulating excitability of VTA DA neurons, highlighting SNX27 as a promising target for treating addiction. Dopamine (DA) is an important neuromodulator of incentive salience, encoding both rewarding and aversive responses in vivo. Dysfunction in DA signaling has been implicated in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction, anxiety, and schizophrenia (Schultz, 2007Schultz W. Multiple dopamine functions at different time courses.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies are concentrated in two main nuclei in the midbrain, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN). The actions of addictive drugs converge on VTA DA neurons, where they increase DA neuron activity and the level of DA released in projection areas (Lüscher and Malenka, 2011Lüscher C. Malenka R.C. Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in addiction: from molecular changes to circuit remodeling.Neuron. 2011; 69: 650-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Exposure to addictive drugs, even acutely, produces persistent adaptations in excitatory and inhibitory pathways within the mesolimbic DA circuit, establishing the building blocks underlying addiction (Arora et al., 2011Arora D.

Inhibitory pathways primarily involve γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA); GABA activates fast GABAA-type receptors and slower G protein-coupled GABAB receptors. Repeated exposure to cocaine reduces the amplitude of fast GABA-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), promoting long-term potentiation (LTP) induction (Liu et al., 2005Liu Q.S. Pu L.

In contrast to the plethora of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins known to regulate trafficking of excitatory glutamate receptors (Kim and Sheng, 2004Kim E. Sheng M. PDZ domain proteins of synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, Sumioka, 2013Sumioka A. Auxiliary subunits provide new insights into regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking.J. Biochem. 2013; 153: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), relatively few subcellular pathways have been described for regulating GIRK channel expression. One pathway involves a change in phosphorylation of GIRK2 channels in the hippocampus, whereby dephosphorylation of a serine residue preceding an internalization motif promotes channel recycling (Chung et al., 2009Chung H.J. Qian X. Ehlers M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuronal activity regulates phosphorylation-dependent surface delivery of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, GIRK3 channels contain a lysosomal-targeting motif that can target GIRK3-containing channels for lysosomal degradation (Ma et al., 2002Ma D. Zerangue N. Raab-Graham K. Fried S.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Diverse trafficking patterns due to multiple traffic motifs in G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channels from brain and heart.Neuron. 2002; 33: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Another regulatory pathway involves association of an endosomal sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) protein with GIRK channels (Balana et al., 2011Balana B. Maslennikov I. Kwiatkowski W. Stern K.M. Bahima L. Choe S. Slesinger P.A. Mechanism underlying selective regulation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the psychostimulant-sensitive sorting nexin 27.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A unique sorting nexin regulates trafficking of potassium channels via a PDZ domain interaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus far, SNX27 is the only cytoplasmic protein known to selectively bind GIRK channels (Balana et al., 2011Balana B. Maslennikov I. Kwiatkowski W. Stern K.M. Bahima L. Choe S. Slesinger P.A. Mechanism underlying selective regulation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the psychostimulant-sensitive sorting nexin 27.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 5831-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Lunn et al., 2007Lunn M.L. Nassirpour R. Arrabit C. Tan J. McLeod I. Arias C.M. Sawchenko P.E. Yates 3rd, J.R. Slesinger P.A. A unique sorting nexin regulates trafficking of potassium channels via a PDZ domain interaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). SNX27 belongs to a family of endosomal sorting proteins, defined by the presence of a phox homology (PX) domain that binds phosphatidylinositol-3-monophosphate in the early endosome (Cullen and Korswagen, 2011Cullen P.J. Korswagen H.C. Sorting nexins provide diversity for retromer-dependent trafficking events.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 14: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Of the ∼33 sorting nexins described to date, SNX27 is unique because it is the only sorting nexin that contains a postsynaptic density-95, discs large, zona occludens (PDZ) domain. We showed previously that the PDZ domain of SNX27 associates directly with the C-terminal PDZ binding motif in GIRK2c/GIRK3 subunits (Balana et al., 2011Balana B. Maslennikov I. Kwiatkowski W. Stern K.M. Bahima L. Choe S. Slesinger P.A. Mechanism underlying selective regulation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels by the psychostimulant-sensitive sorting nexin 27.Proc.

Slesinger P.A. A unique sorting nexin regulates trafficking of potassium channels via a PDZ domain interaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems and hippocampal neurons, overexpression of SNX27 reduces the amplitude of GABAB receptor (GABABR)-activated GIRK currents (Balana et al., 2011Balana B. Maslennikov I. Kwiatkowski W. Stern K.M. Bahima L. Choe S. Slesinger P.A.

A unique sorting nexin regulates trafficking of potassium channels via a PDZ domain interaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); and in rodent neocortex, RNA expression is regulated by psychostimulant exposure (Kajii et al., 2003Kajii Y. Muraoka S. Hiraoka S. Fujiyama K. Umino A. Nishikawa T. A developmentally regulated and psychostimulant-inducible novel rat gene mrt1 encoding PDZ-PX proteins isolated in the neocortex.Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SNX27 also regulates other signaling proteins, including glutamate receptors (Wang et al., 2013Wang X. Zhao Y. Zhang X. Badie H. Zhou Y. Mu Y. Loo L.S. Cai L. Thompson R.C. Yang B. et al.Loss of sorting nexin 27 contributes to excitatory synaptic dysfunction by modulating glutamate receptor recycling in Down’s syndrome.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors (Joubert et al., 2004Joubert L. Hanson B. Barthet G. Sebben M. Claeysen S. Hong W. Marin P. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. New sorting nexin (SNX27) and NHERF specifically interact with the 5-HT4a receptor splice variant: roles in receptor targeting.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5367-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (Hayashi et al., 2012Hayashi H. Naoi S. Nakagawa T. Nishikawa T. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kondo A. Kubo K. Yabuki T. Hattori A. et al.Sorting nexin 27 interacts with multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) and mediates internalization of MRP4.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 15054-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and β2-adrenergic receptors (Lauffer et al., 2010Lauffer B.E.L. Melero C. Temkin P. Lei C. Hong W. Kortemme T. von Zastrow M. SNX27 mediates PDZ-directed sorting from endosomes to the plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For β2-adrenergic receptors, knockdown of SNX27 by RNAi in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells decreases forward trafficking of β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to reduced adrenergic signaling (Lauffer et al., 2010Lauffer B.E.L. Melero C. Temkin P. Lei C. Hong W. Kortemme T. von Zastrow M. SNX27 mediates PDZ-directed sorting from endosomes to the plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). How endogenously expressed SNX27 regulates GIRK channel expression in vivo remains an important but unanswered question. Mice with a complete SNX27 null mutation, however, exhibit severe developmental defects and die postnatally (Cai et al., 2011Cai L. Loo L.S. Atlashkin V. Hanson B.J. Hong W. Deficiency of sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) leads to growth retardation and elevated levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2C (NR2C).Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1734-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), precluding assessment of SNX27 on GIRK function in vivo. Heterozygote SNX27+/− mice, in contrast, appear to have normal neurodevelopment but exhibit defects in excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus, due to reduced levels of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (Wang et al., 2013Wang X. Zhao Y. Zhang X. Badie H. Zhou Y. Mu Y. Loo L.S. Cai L. Thompson R.C. Yang B. et al.Loss of sorting nexin 27 contributes to excitatory synaptic dysfunction by modulating glutamate receptor recycling in Down’s syndrome.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of natively expressed SNX27 in vivo and overcome the obstacle of severe developmental defects, we created a mouse mutant that lacks SNX27 protein in only DA neurons. VTA DA neurons exclusively express GIRK2c and GIRK3 subunits that contain the PDZ-binding motif required for interacting with SNX27 (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.-L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABA(B) receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Lunn et al., 2007Lunn M.L. Nassirpour R. Arrabit C. Tan J. McLeod I. Arias C.M. Sawchenko P.E. Yates 3rd, J.R. Slesinger P.A. A unique sorting nexin regulates trafficking of potassium channels via a PDZ domain interaction.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that SNX27 will be required for GIRK function in the VTA DA neurons. We discovered that SNX27 is an essential regulator of GABABR-activated GIRK signaling in VTA DA neurons and helps mitigate the stimulatory effects of cocaine, implicating SNX27 as a promising therapeutic target for treating addiction. Postnatal mice containing a null mutation in the SNX27 gene exhibit severe developmental defects and die before weaning (Cai et al., 2011Cai L. Loo L.S. Atlashkin V. Hanson B.J. Hong W. Deficiency of sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) leads to growth retardation and elevated levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2C (NR2C).Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1734-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), indicating that SNX27 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in the mouse. Indeed, SNX27 is expressed in a variety of cell types, including brain, heart, kidney, and lung (Kajii et al., 2003Kajii Y. Muraoka S. Hiraoka S. Fujiyama K. Umino A. Nishikawa T. A developmentally regulated and psychostimulant-inducible novel rat gene mrt1 encoding PDZ-PX proteins isolated in the neocortex.Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To avoid lethality, we created a conditional knockout (KO) of SNX27 in mice that targeted only DA neurons (Figure 1A; see Experimental Procedures for details). This was accomplished by crossing a preconditional floxed Snx27 line (Snx27fl/fl) with a DAT-Cre+/− line, where Cre recombinase expression is under the control of the DA transporter gene (DAT or Slc6j) (Zhuang et al., 2005Zhuang X. Masson J. Gingrich J.A. Rayport S. Hen R. Targeted gene expression in dopamine and serotonin neurons of the mouse brain.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 143: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). As expected, immunostaining for SNX27 protein revealed a loss of SNX27 protein expression in midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons of DAT-Cre+/− × Snx27fl/fl mice; we refer to these mice as SNX27DA KO mice (Figures 1A–1C). Importantly, SNX27DA KO mice were viable, bred normally, and lived into adulthood. Moreover, the number of TH-positive neurons in the VTA/SN did not appear to differ from that of control mice (Figure 1D). We next examined the viability of VTA DA neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in 3- to 4-week-old mice. DA neurons were identified by presence of a hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) current and slow firing frequency, and by Cre-dependent expression of fluorescent proteins when available (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.-L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABA(B) receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat.

Other types of VTA DA neurons exist that lack Ih and project to the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), but these neurons do not possess D2-type DA receptor (D2R)-activated GIRK currents (Lammel et al., 2008Lammel S. Hetzel A. Häckel O. Jones I. Liss B. Roeper J. Unique properties of mesoprefrontal neurons within a dual mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.Neuron. 2008; 57: 760-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). VTA DA neurons in acutely prepared horizontal midbrain slices from SNX27DA KO mice had input resistances, resting membrane potentials, and cell sizes that were indistinguishable from those in wild-type neurons (Figure 1E; Table S1 available online). Similarly, loss of SNX27 in DA neurons did not significantly change the amplitude of the Ih current (Figure 1F). Taken together, these results suggest that there were no gross changes in function of DA neurons lacking SNX27. VTA DA neurons express a robust GABABR-activated GIRK current (IBaclofen) (Arora et al., 2011Arora D. Hearing M. Haluk D.M. Mirkovic K. Fajardo-Serrano A. Wessendorf M.W. Watanabe M. Luján R.

In preconditional Snx27fl/fl littermates (referred to as wild-type [WT]) and DAT-Cre+/− controls, bath application of a saturating concentration of the GABABR agonist baclofen (300 μM) activated a large outward GABABR-activated GIRK current (203.6 ± 21.3 pA, n = 17 for WT; 246.1 ± 24.6 pA, n = 18 for DAT-Cre+/−); IBaclofen was completely suppressed by the selective inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir) inhibitor Ba2+ (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G. Ivanova T. Lunn M.-L. Stoffel M. Slesinger P.A. Lüscher C. Bi-directional effects of GABA(B) receptor agonists on the mesolimbic dopamine system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). In DA neurons of SNX27DA KO mice, the GABABR-activated GIRK current was ∼60% smaller (74.7 ± 9.2 pA, n = 18; ∗∗p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test) (Figure 2B). DA D2R-activated GIRK currents revealed with bath application of quinpirole (30 μM) were similar in size for SNX27DA KO and control mice (Figures 2C and 2D; 47.0 ± 9.1 pA, n = 13 for WT; 54.3 ± 14.2 pA, n = 8 for DAT-Cre+/−; 34.9 ± 9.1 pA, n = 14 for SNX27DA KO; p > 0.05). To investigate the potential effect of SNX27 KO on fast GABAA currents, we measured the spontaneous fast IPSCs in VTA DA neurons of SNX27DA KO mice (Bocklisch et al., 2013Bocklisch C. Pascoli V. Wong J.C. House D.R. Yvon C. de Roo M. Tan K.R. Lüscher C. Cocaine disinhibits dopamine neurons by potentiation of GABA transmission in the ventral tegmental area.Science. 2013; 341: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Neither the mean amplitude nor instantaneous frequency appeared to be different in the SNX27DA KO mice compared with DAT-Cre+/− mice (see Table S1). Thus, selective disruption of SNX27 expression in VTA DA neurons appears to preferentially affect GABABR-activated GIRK currents. VTA DA neurons receive inhibitory inputs from local and projection GABA neurons (Floresco et al., 2003Floresco S.B. West A.R. Ash B. Moore H. Grace A.A.

Because activation of GABABR-GIRK currents in VTA is sufficient to inhibit phasic firing of DA neurons (Seutin et al., 1994Seutin V. Johnson S.W. North R.A. Effect of dopamine and baclofen on N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced burst firing in rat ventral tegmental neurons.Neuroscience. 1994; 58: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the reduced GABABR-activated GIRK current would be sufficient to alter inhibitory control of neuronal activity. We constructed input-output curves for induced firing measured in current-clamp mode for wild-type and SNX27DA KO DA neurons (Figure 3). Remarkably, a saturating concentration of baclofen (300 μM) failed to inhibit firing induced over a range of current injections in DA neurons of SNX27DA KO mice, in contrast to wild-type controls (Figures 3A–3D). We next asked whether the reduction in GABABR-activated GIRK currents could be explained by a decrease in surface expression of GABAB receptors or alternatively, a decrease in GIRK channel expression (Cruz et al., 2004Cruz H.G.

To investigate a change in surface expression of GIRK channels, we examined the effect of intracellular guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), a nonhydrolyzable form of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that bypasses G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation and constitutively activates GIRK channels via a Gβγ-dependent mechanism (Logothetis et al., 1987Logothetis D.E.

The mechanisms that modulate ion channel gene expression and stabilize neural firing properties are unknown. In Drosophila, we demonstrate that loss of the Shal potassium channel induces the compensatory rebalancing of ion channel expression including, but not limited to, the enhanced expression and function of Shaker and slowpoke. Using genomic and network modeling approaches combined with genetic and electrophysiological assays, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Krüppel is necessary for the homeostatic modulation of Shaker and slowpoke expression. Remarkably, Krüppel induction is specific to the loss of Shal, not being observed in five other potassium channel mutants that cause enhanced neuronal excitability. Thus, homeostatic signaling systems responsible for rebalancing ion channel expression can be selectively induced after the loss or impairment of a specific ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2060172930,"Na(+)-dependent chloride cotransporters (NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC) are activated by phosphorylation to play critical roles in diverse physiological responses, including renal salt balance, hearing, epithelial fluid secretion, and volume regulation. Serine threonine kinase WNK4 (With No K = lysine member 4) and members of the Ste20 kinase family, namely SPAK and OSR1 (Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase, Oxidative stress-responsive kinase) govern phosphorylation. According to present understanding, WNK4 phosphorylates key residues within SPAK/OSR1 leading to kinase activation, allowing SPAK/OSR1 to bind to and phosphorylate NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC. Recently, the calcium-binding protein 39 (Cab39) has emerged as a binding partner and enhancer of SPAK/OSR1 activity, facilitating kinase autoactivation and promoting phosphorylation of the cotransporters. In the present study, we provide evidence showing that Cab39 differentially interacts with WNK4 and SPAK/OSR1 to switch the classic two kinase cascade into a signal kinase transduction mechanism. We found that WNK4 in association with Cab39 activates NKCC1 in a SPAK/OSR1-independent manner. We discovered that WNK4 possesses a domain that bears close resemblance to the SPAK/OSR1 C-terminal CCT/PF2 domain, which is required for physical interaction between the Ste20 kinases and the Na(+)-driven chloride cotransporters. Modeling, yeast two-hybrid, and functional data reveal that this PF2-like domain located downstream of the catalytic domain in WNK4 promotes the direct interaction between the kinase and NKCC1. We conclude that in addition to SPAK and OSR1, WNK4 is able to anchor itself to the N-terminal domain of NKCC1 and to promote cotransporter activation."
https://openalex.org/W2024838999,"Glucocorticoids contribute to adipocyte differentiation by cooperating with transcription factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), to stimulate transcription of the gene encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ), a master regulator of adipogenesis. However, the mechanism of PPARγ gene regulation by glucocorticoids, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and its coregulators is poorly understood. Here we show that two GR binding regions (GBRs) in the mouse PPARγ gene were responsive to glucocorticoid, and treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with glucocorticoid alone induced GR occupancy and chromatin remodeling at PPARγ GBRs, which also contain binding sites for C/EBP and PPARγ proteins. GR recruited cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1), a transcription coregulator, to the PPARγ gene GBRs. Notably, CCAR1 was required for GR occupancy and chromatin remodeling at one of the PPARγ gene GBRs. Moreover, depletion of CCAR1 markedly suppressed differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to mature adipocytes and decreased induction of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and C/EBPδ. Although CCAR1 was required for stimulation of several GR-regulated adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by glucocorticoid, it was not required for GR-activated transcription of certain anti-inflammatory genes in human A549 lung epithelial cells.

Obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (1Cristancho A.G. Lazar M.A. Forming functional fat: a growing understanding of adipocyte differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Hence, it is recognized as a prevalent health hazard worldwide. This excess of white adipose tissue caused by increases in the size and number of white adipocytes is the major cause of obesity. The number of white adipocytes present in an organism is determined largely by adipocyte differentiation (1Cristancho A.G. Lazar M.A. Forming functional fat: a growing understanding of adipocyte differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 722-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-related diseases and thereby providing important information for developing new strategies to prevent and treat obesity. Adipocytes, the major fat-containing components of adipose tissue, are developed from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) 3The abbreviations used are:MSCmesenchymal stem cellsGRglucocorticoid receptorPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinGBRglucocorticoid receptor binding regionCCAR1cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1dexdexamethasoneIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineMed1mediator subunit 1FAIREformaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elementssiRNAsmall interfering RNAshRNAshort hairpin RNATSStranscription start site. in adipose tissue. This process involves an initial commitment phase where MSC are committed to the preadipocyte lineage followed by a differentiation phase (adipogenesis) where preadipocytes differentiate into mature fat-laden adipocytes. The major discoveries of key adipogenic signaling pathways have relied heavily on investigations in preadipocyte cell lines, such as mouse 3T3-L1 cells, which undergo a highly conserved and efficient program of adipogenesis in culture and upon transplantation in vivo (2Siersbæk R. Mandrup S. Transcriptional networks controlling adipocyte differentiation.Cold Spring Harb. Symp Quant. Biol. 2011; 76: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because subsequent experiments in mice have convincingly validated the physiological significance of these major signaling pathways, the in vitro differentiation model represents a powerful and valid tool for deciphering the complex regulatory network of adipocyte differentiation. mesenchymal stem cells glucocorticoid receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein glucocorticoid receptor binding region cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 dexamethasone isobutylmethylxanthine mediator subunit 1 formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements small interfering RNA short hairpin RNA transcription start site. The adipogenic conversion of most mouse and human preadipocyte cell lines requires stimulation with a hormonal mixture that consists of the synthetic glucocorticoid analogue dexamethasone (dex), insulin, and the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). Temporary exposure of preadipocytes to the adipogenic stimuli induces a complex network of pro-adipogenic transcription factors that act at different stages of differentiation and cooperatively promote adipogenesis. Significant players in this transcriptional cascade include CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family members (i.e. C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ) and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is considered as the master positive regulator of preadipocyte differentiation to adipocytes and is both indispensable and under some conditions sufficient for adipogenesis (2Siersbæk R. Mandrup S. Transcriptional networks controlling adipocyte differentiation.Cold Spring Harb. Symp Quant. Biol. 2011; 76: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The expression levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are low in preadipocytes but are greatly enhanced after treatment of the cells with adipogenic mixture. During the first hour of adipogenesis, both of these C/EBPs associate with regulatory elements of a variety of adipogenic genes, including the two major late-acting transcription factors, C/EBPα and PPARγ, and subsequently activate gene expression. Raised levels of C/EBPα and PPARγ then induce each other's expression in a positive feedback loop promoting and maintaining the differentiated state of the mature adipocyte (3Siersbæk R. Nielsen R. Mandrup S. Transcriptional networks and chromatin remodeling controlling adipogenesis.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 23: 56-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Dex is a key component of the adipogenic mixture and is involved in transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis via binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a hormone-dependent transcription factor (4Pantoja C. Huff J.T. Yamamoto K.R. Glucocorticoid signaling defines a novel commitment state during adipogenesis in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4032-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the important role of GR in adipogenesis. First, cells with decreased GR levels were unable to efficiently store lipids and express adipocyte-selective proteins C/EBPα and PPARγ in response to adipogenic stimuli. Second, GR is involved in induction of key pro-adipogenic transcription factor C/EBPδ (4Pantoja C. Huff J.T. Yamamoto K.R. Glucocorticoid signaling defines a novel commitment state during adipogenesis in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4032-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as well as several other adipogenic genes such as RGS2 (5Nishizuka M. Honda K. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. RGS2 promotes adipocyte differentiation in the presence of ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29625-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and EPAS1 (6Shimba S. Wada T. Hara S. Tezuka M. EPAS1 promotes adipose differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40946-40953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, during the early stages of adipogenesis, transient enrichment of GR, C/EBPβ, mediator subunit 1 (Med1), p300, and histone acetylation at regulatory sites near adipogenic genes has been previously reported (7Steger D.J. Grant G.R. Schupp M. Tomaru T. Lefterova M.I. Schug J. Manduchi E. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Lazar M.A. Propagation of adipogenic signals through an epigenomic transition state.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); target genes include the gene encoding the master regulator of adipogenesis, PPARγ. Thus, GR cooperates with C/EBPβ to initiate transcriptional activation of key adipogenic genes that are required to specify adipogenic cell fate. However, both the precise molecular contribution by GR and the identities of the transcriptional coregulators that support and modulate GR activity during the adipocyte differentiation process remain largely unexplored and are the subject of the study presented here. In addition to the role of glucocorticoids and GR in regulating adipogenesis, glucocorticoids are well known for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and are, therefore, widely and successfully used in the treatment of numerous inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma. Nevertheless, glucocorticoids are also infamous for adverse metabolic side effects associated with the chronic administration required to treat these diseases effectively. For approximately two decades, great efforts have been made to identify and develop for clinical use selective GR ligands that dissociate beneficial anti-inflammatory effects from adverse metabolic effects of glucocorticoids (8Shah N.

Chem. 2011; 19: 7374-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but unfortunately with little success. Another possible approach to this problem may be offered by coregulators, which have been shown to function in a gene-specific manner with GR and other transcription factors and, therefore, may represent potential targets for combination therapy to accompany the use of classical anti-inflammatory steroids such as dex. For example, inhibition of a coregulator required for regulation of genes involved in the metabolic actions of glucocorticoids but not required for regulation of genes involved in the anti-inflammatory response to glucocorticoids could limit some side effects associated with glucocorticoid treatment of inflammatory diseases. Toward that end we performed a limited screen of coregulators by assessing the effect of depleting each coregulator from 3T3-L1 cells on the induction of several adipogenic genes by dex. In parallel, we tested the effect of coregulator depletion on dex-induced expression of several anti-inflammatory genes in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. From this screen cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1), previously identified as a coactivator for GR (12Kim J.H. Yang C.K. Heo K. Roeder R.G. An W. Stallcup M.R. CCAR1, a key regulator of mediator complex recruitment to nuclear receptor transcription complexes.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 510-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), was preferentially required for dex-induced expression of adipogenic genes versus anti-inflammatory genes. Subsequently, we characterized the role of CCAR1 in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to mature adipocytes and the mechanisms by which GR and CCAR1 contribute to the activation of the key adipogenic transcription factor, PPARγ. We found that CCAR1 determines adipogenic competency, acting in part through positive regulation of GR transcriptional activity that drives early adipogenesis. Thus, targeting glucocorticoid coregulators, such as CCAR1, could be an effective approach to separate beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids from certain unfavorable effects of glucocorticoids, such as obesity involving aberrantly activated adipogenesis.

For induction of differentiation with adipogenic mixture, 3T3-L1 cells were grown for an additional 2 days after confluence, and the 2-day post-confluent cells (designated as day 0) were induced to differentiate with DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mm IBMX, 1 μm dex, and 1 μg/ml insulin. After 2 days, medium was changed with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and again every other day thereafter until processing for analysis. Mouse MSC derived from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Cyagen Biosciences. MSC were cultured in OriCell mMSC growth medium (Cyagen Biosciences) and differentiated into adipocytes according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 days after MSC reached confluence, MSC were induced to differentiate with adipogenic medium containing FBS, IBMX, dex, insulin, and rosiglitazone (a PPARγ agonist). After cells had differentiated, acquisition of adipocyte phenotype was determined by Oil Red O staining as described previously (4Pantoja C. Huff J.T. Yamamoto K.R.

After amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed to confirm the homogeneity of PCR products from each reaction. The immunoprecipitated DNA and input signals were quantified using the relative standard curve method, and results were expressed as the percentage of input by normalizing the immunoprecipitated signal to its corresponding input signal. 3T3-L1 cells were grown with culture medium for an additional 2 days after confluence and were incubated with phenol-red free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS overnight.

FAIRE was performed essentially as previously described (21Seo W.Y. Jeong B.C. Yu E.J. Kim H.J. Kim S.H. Lim J.E. Kwon G.Y. Lee H.M. Kim J.H.

In brief, nuclei were isolated from harvested cells and submitted to sonication to shear chromatin. Samples were subjected to phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction to recover free DNA not bound by nucleosomes in the aqueous phase. After extraction cross-linking was reversed, and the FAIRE DNAs were purified. Input chromatin samples were obtained before the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction, and DNA was purified as described above. Representation of specific GR binding sites in the FAIRE DNA samples (which represent open chromatin regions) was determined relative to input DNA by quantitative PCR using the same PCR primers specified above for ChIP. RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen), resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and adjusted to 100 ng/μl. cDNA was synthesized by reverse-transcribing 0.9 μg of total RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was mixed with appropriate primers and LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Applied Science), and the mixture was then analyzed with the LightCycler 480 System (Roche Applied Science).

We aimed to evaluate risk factors for delirium after LDLT as well as to investigate whether delirium impacts the length of ICU and hospital stay.Seventy-eight patients who underwent LDLT during the period January 2010 to December 2012 at a single medical center were enrolled. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale was used to diagnose delirium. Preoperative, postoperative, and hematologic factors were included as potential risk factors for developing delirium.During the study period, delirium was diagnosed in 37 (47.4%) patients after LDLT. The mean onset of symptoms occurred 7.0±5.5 days after surgery and the mean duration of symptoms was 5.0±2.6 days. The length of stay in the ICU for patients with delirium (39.8±28.1 days) was significantly longer than that for patients without delirium (29.3±19.0 days) (p<0.05). Risk factors associated with delirium included history of alcohol abuse [odds ratio (OR) = 6.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.85-22.06], preoperative hepatic encephalopathy (OR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.36-14.51), APACHE II score ≥16 (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.71-2.56), and duration of endotracheal intubation ≥5 days (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.52-2.23).History of alcohol abuse, preoperative hepatic encephalopathy, APACHE II scores ≥16 and endotracheal intubation ≥5 days were predictive of developing delirium in the ICU following liver transplantation surgery and were associated with increased length of ICU and hospital stay."

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) responsible for the generation of peripheral tolerance are under the tight regulation of the cytokine milieu. In this study, we report a novel role of a bipyridyl compound, Caerulomycin A (CaeA), in inducing the generation of Tregs. It was observed that CaeA substantially up-regulated the pool of Tregs, as evidenced by an increased frequency of CD4+ Foxp3+ cells. In addition, CaeA significantly suppressed the number of Th1 and Th17 cells, as supported by a decreased percentage of CD4+/IFN-γ+ and CD4+/IL-17+ cells, respectively. Furthermore, we established the mechanism and observed that CaeA interfered with IFN-γ-induced STAT1 signaling by augmenting SOCS1 expression. An increase in the TGF-β-mediated Smad3 activity was also noted. Furthermore, CaeA rescued Tregs from IFN-γ-induced inhibition. These results were corroborated by blocking Smad3 activity, which abolished the CaeA-facilitated generation of Tregs. In essence, our results indicate a novel role of CaeA in inducing the generation of Tregs. This finding suggests that CaeA has enough potential to be considered as a potent future drug for the treatment of autoimmunity.

This finding suggests that CaeA has enough potential to be considered as a potent future drug for the treatment of autoimmunity. The immune system of the body is its artillery against pathogens. The immune response is very precisely tuned and tamed to discriminate self from non-self. Although the body does generate autoreactive T cells, the immune system has an accurate mechanism to eliminate such cells during thymic selection (1Kappler J.W. Roehm N. Marrack P. T cell tolerance by clonal elimination in the thymus.Cell. 1987; 49: 273-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, some autoreactive T cells can still escape deletion, establish themselves in the body, and become a potential threat to the host by generating autoimmune diseases. The body has developed additional defense mechanisms against these treacherous cells through the induction of peripheral tolerance, anergy/unresponsiveness, release of immunosuppressive molecules (TGF-β, IL-10, IL-35, etc.), and generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) 3The abbreviations used are:Tregregulatory T cellRaparapamycinCaeACaerulomycin AAbantibodyqPCRquantitative PCR.

Despite extremely careful mechanisms operating in the body to safeguard against autoreactive T cells, these cells may still become activated and can be terrifically devastating in inflicting injury by causing autoimmune diseases (5Fathman C.G.

Autoimmune diseases can be treated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and immunosuppressive agents (6Rosato E. Pisarri S. Salsano F. Current strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 2010; 24: 251-259PubMed Google Scholar). However, the limitations and side effects associated with the use of these drugs pave the way toward better and safer remedial measures (7Payne R.

Recently, the generation of antigen-specific tolerance by Tregs has gained considerable impetus following the observation that these cells are endowed with enough potential to suppress autoimmune reactions (10Shevach E.M.

Tregs are a subset of CD4+ helper T cells that specifically express fork head family transcription factor 3 (Foxp3) (12Fontenot J.D. Gavin M.A. Rudensky A.Y.

Control of regulatory T cell development by the transcription factor Foxp3.Science. 2003; 299: 1057-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, several strategies have been undertaken to enhance the production of Tregs for treating autoimmune diseases (14Zhou X. Kong N. Wang J. Fan H. Zou H. Horwitz D. Brand D. Liu Z. Zheng S.G.

Allergy Immunol. 2013; 160: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Naïve CD4+ T cells can be differentiated into Tregs by TGF-β (16Chen W. Jin W. Hardegen N. Lei K.J. Li L. Marinos N. McGrady G. Wahl S.M. Conversion of peripheral CD4+CD25-naive T cells to CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells by TGF-β induction of transcription factor Foxp3.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tregs can be increased by antagonizing TNF-α activity (17Nadkarni S. Mauri C. Ehrenstein M.R. Anti-TNF-α therapy induces a distinct regulatory T cell population in patients with rheumatoid arthritis via TGF-β.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has also been reported that rapamycin (Rapa), an immunosuppressive drug, can successfully expand Tregs (18Battaglia M. Stabilini A. Roncarolo M.G. Rapamycin selectively expands CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.Blood. 2005; 105: 4743-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Additionally, LY294002 is also known to induce Tregs (19Sauer S. Bruno L. Hertweck A. Finlay D. Leleu M. Spivakov M. Knight Z.A. Cobb B.S. Cantrell D. O'Connor E. Shokat K.M. Fisher A.G. Merkenschlager M. T cell receptor signaling controls Foxp3 expression via PI3K, Akt, and mTOR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, Rapa increases the chance of diabetes (20Houde V.P. Brûlé S. Festuccia W.T. Blanchard P.G. Bellmann K. Deshaies Y. Marette A. Chronic rapamycin treatment causes glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia by upregulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and impairing lipid deposition in adipose tissue.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It is a well known fact that most of the revolutionary medicines, like Rapa, cyclosporin A, and FK506, exhibiting antibiotic or antifungal properties were later proven to possess potent immunosuppressive activity (21Borel J.F. History of the discovery of cyclosporin and of its early pharmacological development.Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 2002; 114: 433-437PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kino T. Hatanaka H. Miyata S. Inamura N.

Fermentation, isolation and characterization.J. Antibiot. 1975; 28: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). CaeA is a bipyridyl compound and has been reported in the literature to show antifungal and antibiotic properties (24Funk A. Divekar P.V. Caerulomycin, a new antibiotic from Streptomyces caeruleus Baldacci. I. Production, isolation, assay, and biological properties.Can. J.

Caerulomycin, an antifungal antibiotic with marked in vitro and in vivo activity against Entamoeba histolytica.Z. Parasitenkd. 1984; 70: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, it encouraged us to study whether CaeA could also exhibit immunosuppression, in particular by evoking the generation of Tregs, as observed in the case of Rapa (18Battaglia M. Stabilini A. Roncarolo M.G. Rapamycin selectively expands CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.Blood. 2005; 105: 4743-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that CaeA independently induced Tregs (cTregs) and synergistically supported the TGF-β-mediated expansion of Tregs (cβTregs). We also revealed the mechanism of action involved in the generation of Tregs by CaeA. Finally, the proof of concept was established by successfully treating animals suffering from arthritis with CaeA. Female C3He and BALB/c mice and male DBA/1 mice 6–8 weeks of age were procured from the experimental animal facility of the Institute of Microbial Technology. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee. The chemicals and reagents were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or as mentioned otherwise. RPMI 1640, FBS, and TRIzol reagent were procured from Invitrogen. Penicillin, streptomycin, and pyruvic acid were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Phosphatase inhibitor mixture, STAT1, and Smad3 oligo were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). CaeA was from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). Anti-phospho-STAT1, anti-phospho-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT4, and anti-phospho-STAT6 and total STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT6 were from BD Biosciences. Anti-phospho-Smad3 and total Smad3, Smad7, and JAK1 Abs were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-JAK2 Ab and protein G-agarose beads were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). All the experiments were carried out in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (70 mg/liter), streptomycin (100 mg/liter), NaHCO3 (2.2 g/liter), HEPES (2.38 g/liter), pyruvic acid (110 mg/liter), and FBS (10%). Naïve CD4 T cells (2 × 105/ml) were stimulated using plate-bound anti-CD3 Ab (2 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 Ab (1 μg/ml) along with following polarizing conditions to differentiate them in to different Th subsets. Tregs were generated by providing the polarizing conditions using TGF-β: 5 ng/ml + IL-2: 100 units/ml for 5 days; Th1 cells by incubating with IL-12: 5 ng/ml + anti-IL-4 Ab: 10 μg/ml + IL-2: 100 units/ml for 4 days; Th17 cells by culturing with IL-6: 40 ng/ml + TGF-β: 2.5 ng/ml + anti-IL-4 Ab: 10 μg/ml + anti-IFN-γ Ab: 10 μg/ml for 4 days. In case of Th1 and Th17 cells, media supplemented with their respective polarizing cytokines were replenished and cells were cultured for additional 2 days. The purity of Tregs, Th1, and Th17 was measured by intracellular expression of Foxp3, IFN-γ, and IL-17, respectively. Before harvesting from the cultures, Th1 and Th17 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (40 nm) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 2 h. To block cytokine secretion, brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) was added. Later, and cells were incubated further for 3 h. Tregs, Th1, and Th17 cells were cultured with different concentrations of CaeA (0–0.15 μm). The modulation in the frequency of Tregs, Th1, and Th17 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. CD4 T cell activation was performed as described elsewhere (26Collison L.W. Vignali D.A. In vitro Treg suppression assays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 707: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD4 T cells (2 × 105 cells/200 μl) were stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 Abs. Tregs were added to the cultures and incubated for 48 h. Later, cells were harvested and studied for activation by flow cytometry. An alloresponse experiment was performed using splenocytes (2 × 105) of MHC-mismatched strains of mice. The C3He (H-2k) cells served as the responder and γ-irradiated DBA/1 (H-2q) cells as the stimulator. Alloresponse cultures were set in the presence or absence of Tregs for 4 days. Later, cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H] thymidine for 16 h. The cells were harvested onto glass filter mats, and incorporated radioactivity was measured as counts per minutes by scintillation counting. The induction of arthritis and disease symptoms were monitored as described previously (27Williams R.O. Collagen-induced arthritis as a model for rheumatoid arthritis.Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 98: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, male DBA/1 mice (6 mice/group) were immunized intradermally on day 0 with bovine collagen type II (100 μg) emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant (4 mg/ml desiccated Mtb H37Ra). A booster dose of bovine collagen type II in incomplete Freund adjuvant was injected on day 21. Later, CaeA (1 and 10 mg/kg body weight) and 0.5% carboxyl methyl cellulose emulsion in water was administered daily for 50 days, and animals were monitored every day for arthritis symptoms. A group treated with carboxyl methyl cellulose (0.5%) was taken as a vehicle control (placebo). Disease progression was assessed for a clinical score using following criteria: 0, no symptoms; 1, mild erythema and inflammation in the limb digits; 2, severe inflammation up to the paw; and 3, severe inflammation up to the ankle region. These score norms were adopted for each limb. For immunological assays, animals were sacrificed on day 30. The optimum response was reported during that period (28Doncarli A. Stasiuk L.M. Fournier C. Abehsira-Amar O. Conversion in vivo from an early dominant Th0/Th1 response to a Th2 phenotype during the development of collagen-induced arthritis.Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1451-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells isolated from the lymph nodes were pooled and in vitro-challenged with bovine collagen type II (50 μg) for 72 h. Later, proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The proinflammatory markers matrix metalloproteinase-3 in the serum and IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in the knee joints were estimated on day 50. For histopathological analysis, the knee joints were fixed in buffered formalin (10%) and decalcified in formic acid (1%). Microtome sections of paraffin-embedded knee joints were stained with H&E to observe the extent of inflammation. The fluorescence imaging of arthritis-induced mice was performed with the help of the in vivo imager FMT 2500 Lx (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA). ProSense 680 and 750 (cathepsin-specific activatable probes) and OsteoSense 680 and 800 (specific for bone degeneration) were used for visualizing inflammatory responses. These reagents were injected intravenously 24 h prior to imaging. Later on, hairs were removed by hair clipper and depilatory cream. The animals were imaged under a given laser wave length for excitation (680, 750, and 780 nm) and emission fluorescence (700, 780, and 805 nm). All procedures were performed under gas anesthesia (isoflurane). The intensity of fluorescence was directly proportional to the severity of the disease. Image processing and analysis was performed by TrueQuant software. CD4+ T cells were isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CD4 T cell enrichment kit, BD Biosciences). Briefly, splenocytes obtained from two mice were pooled and RBC-depleted by ACK (ammonium-chloride-potassium) lysis buffer. Later, the cells were incubated with CD4 T cell enrichment mixture (50 μl/107 cells) and biotin anti-CD25 Ab (5 μl/107 cells) for 30 min at 4 °C. The unbound Abs were removed by washing with RPMI 1640 (400 g, 5 min). The residual pellet was incubated with BDTM IMag streptavidin particles plus-DM (50 μl/107 cells) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were suspended in 4 ml of RPMI and placed in contact with iMagnet for 8 min. The CD4+ T cells obtained by negative selection were of 92% purity, as confirmed by flow cytometry. RNA from the cell pellet or tissue sample was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the help of a cDNA synthesis kit. cDNA was analyzed for the expression of Foxp3, Smad7, T-bet, SOCS1, ISG15, IRF-1, IRF-7, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 by a Quantifast SYBR Green PCR kit with the help of a Realplex master cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The following sequences were used: T-bet, 5′-CTAAGCAAGGACGGCGAAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCCACACTGCACCCACTT-3′ (reverse); TNF-α, 5′-GAACTGGCAGAAGAGGCACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGGTCTGGGCCATAGAACT-3′ (reverse); Foxp3, 5′-TTCATGCATCAGCTCTCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGGACACCCATTCCAGACT-3′ (reverse); IFN-γ, 5′-TGAACGCTACACACTGCATCTT-GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGACTCCTTTTCCGCTT-CCTGAG-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′ (reverse); Smad7, 5′-AAGTGTTCAGGTGGCCGGATC-TCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAGCATCTGGACAGC-CTGCAGTTG-3′ (reverse); SOCS1, 5′-ACCTTCTTGGTGCGCGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCCATCTTCACGCTGAGC-3′ (reverse); IRF1, 5′-CAGAGGAAAGAGAGAAAGTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACACGGTGACAGTGCTGG-3′ (reverse); IRF7, 5′-CTGGAGCCATGGGTATGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGCACAAGCCGAGACTGCT-3′ (reverse); and ISG15, 5′-GGAACGAAAGGGGCCACAGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCCATGGGCCTTCCCTCGA-3′ (reverse). Ct values of experimental samples were normalized against β-actin, and analysis was done by comparative Ct method. Results are represented in the form of relative expression (fold). The cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 secreted in the culture supernatants were determined by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with the appropriate concentration of specific Ab in phosphate buffer (pH 9.2) for 12 h at 4 °C. Later, the plates were blocked with BSA (1%) to eliminate nonspecific binding. ELISA plates were incubated with culture supernatants and appropriate standards for 12 h at 4 °C. The plates were treated with respective biotin-conjugated secondary Abs, followed by streptavidin-HRP. The plates were developed with the help of the substrate H2O2 and the chromogenic agent O-phenylenediamine. The optical density of color development was measured at 495 nm. Each step was followed by washing five times with 1× PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) and regular incubation steps. The level of cytokines was estimated by plotting a standard curve using recombinant cytokines and expressed as picograms/milliliter. The IFN-γ-mediated STAT1 response was measured by initially incubating CD4 T cells with CaeA (0–0.31 μm) for 24 h, followed by IFN-γ (200 units/ml) stimulation for 30 min. To evaluate the TGF-β-mediated Smad3 response, CD4 T cells were incubated initially with CaeA (0–0.31 μm) for 24 h, followed by IFN-γ (200 units/ml) treatment for 48 h. Later, cells were pulsed with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 1 h. As a positive control for STAT1 suppression, cells were also cultured with the JAK inhibitor pyridone 6. Immediately thereafter, the nuclear extract was prepared, and EMSA was performed, as described elsewhere (29Osaki M. Tan L. Choy B.K. Yoshida Y. Cheah K.S. Auron P.E. Goldring M.B. The TATA-containing core promoter of the type II collagen gene (COL2A1) is the target of interferon-γ-mediated inhibition in human chondrocytes: requirement for Stat1 α, Jak1 and Jak2.Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclei of cells were isolated by suspending cells in hypotonic conditions in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol) containing the following proteinase inhibitors: 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclear proteins were extracted in buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitors) and used for analysis of DNA binding. The double-stranded oligonucleotide of the consensus sequences 5′-CATGTTATGCATATTCCTGTAAGTG-3′ (STAT1) and 5′-TCGAGAGCCAGACAAAAAGCCAGACATTTAGCCAGACAC-3′ (Smad3) was used for EMSA. The double-stranded oligo was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with the help of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature using nuclear extract (5 μg) along with a labeled probe in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)). The protein with the DNA complex was separated in polyacrylamide gel (4%) using Tris borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to the imager screen at room temperature for 12 h and scanned using a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). CD4+ T cells pulsed with IFN-γ for 15 min were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The whole cell lysate was precleared using normal rabbit serum and protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Later, protein G-agarose beads were separated from the lysate by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min). The cell lysate was then incubated with either anti-JAK1 or JAK2 Abs overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min). Purified complexes were boiled in SDS sample buffer and used to analyze the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 proteins by Western blotting. The expression of Smad7 and T-bet and the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, Smad3, JAK1, and JAK2 were analyzed by Western blotting. Briefly, the whole cell lysate was prepared by suspending cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay. The equal concentration of protein lysate of all samples was separated on SDS-PAGE gels (12%) followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C for 12 h. Membrane transfer was followed by blocking with BSA (5%) in PBS and then probing with their specific Abs, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary Abs. The blots were visualized by ECL Plus Western blotting substrate. The blots were developed onto x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm ECL, GE Healthcare). Internal loading was analyzed by stripping off the primary Ab and reprobing with a suitable Ab. CD4 T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml) and CD28 (1 μg/ml) Abs were cultured with CaeA (0–0.31 μm) for 72 h. Later, cells were pelleted and resuspended in JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) medium (2.5 μg/ml). The cultures were incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min in the dark. Later, cells were washed with flow cytometry staining buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and acquired immediately using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur), and then the analysis was done using FACSDiva software. The increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by the change in the fluorescence intensity of JC-1 from a green to a red wavelength. The cells were harvested from the cultures and washed with flow cytometry buffer (PBS and 2% FBS). The Fc receptor was blocked by using anti-CD16 Ab, followed by staining with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4 and CD69 Abs and their respective isotype-matched control Abs for 30 min at 4 °C. For staining with biotinylated Abs, cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated Abs for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin. Finally, cells were washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde (1%). Intracellular cytokine staining was performed by first staining for surface markers followed by fixing with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 20 min at 4 °C. Later, the cells were washed twice in staining buffer and resuspended in permeabilizing buffer (1× PBS/0.1% saponin/1% FBS) at room temperature for 20 min. This was followed by incubating with appropriate Abs or their isotype-matched controls for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with permeabilizing buffer and resuspended in staining buffer. Nuclear protein Foxp3 staining was performed with a Foxp3 buffer staining kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Cells were acquired using FACSCalibur or FACSAria II. Analysis was performed by FACSDiva software. Statistical analysis was performed with the help of GraphPad Prism software. The differences between groups were compared by statistical analysis (two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test). The expression of Foxp3 is crucial for the generation of Tregs. Rapa is a known immunosuppressive drug that has been reported to induce Treg formation (18Battaglia M. Stabilini A. Roncarolo M.G. Rapamycin selectively expands CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.Blood. 2005; 105: 4743-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Hence, in the preliminary phase of the study, we tested whether CaeA can elicit the generation of Tregs. Interestingly, we observed that anti-CD3 and CD28 Ab-stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells cultured with CaeA showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in Foxp3+ T cells (cTregs) (Fig. 1A). Further, supplementing cultures with TGF-β significantly (p < 0.005) promoted the pool of Foxp3+ CD4 T cells (cβTregs) (Fig. 1, A and B). The enhancement in the frequency of Foxp3+ CD4 T cells was observed in a dose-dependent fashion. The data were reproduced by both flow cytometry and RT-qPCR (Fig. 1 C). The results were comparable with Rapa, which was used as a positive control (Fig. 1, A–C). We also noticed an up-regulation of CD25 (IL-2 receptor) expression on CD4 T cells on CaeA treatment, which was augmented further on complementing the cultures with TGF-β (data not shown). Intriguingly, naïve CD4 T cells cultured with CaeA under Th1 and Th17 polarizing conditions exhibited a significant decline in the expression (p < 0.005) and secretion (p < 0.0001) of IFN-γ and IL-17 by CD4 T cells, respectively (Fig. 1, D–F). Furthermore, down-regulation of CD44 and an increased mitochondrial membrane potential was noticed in CD4 T cells on treatment with CaeA (Fig. 1, G and H). T cell activation (CD44hi) is inversely proportional to the mitochondrial membrane potential (30Michalek R.D. Gerriets V.A. Jacobs S.R. Macintyre A.N. MacIver N.J. Mason E.F. Sullivan S.A. Nichols A.G. Rathmell J.C. Cutting edge: distinct glycolytic and lipid oxidative metabolic programs are essential for effector and regulatory CD4+ T cell subsets.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). We observed a similar effect with CaeA. We next checked whether cTregs and cβTregs were capable of inhibiting the function of effector T cells. It is noteworthy that a diminished expression of CD69 was observed on effector CD4 T cells cocultured with either cTregs or cβTregs (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, cTregs and cβTregs substantially (p < 0.0001) retarded the alloresponse in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (Fig. 2 C). However, the extent of suppression was better in the case of cβTregs than cTregs. These data clearly signify that cTregs and cβTregs are functionally active and have the potential to retard the activity of effector T cells. Loss of Tregs is one of the main reasons for the breakdown of peripheral tolerance. The instability of Tregs under proinflammatory conditions is a major hurdle for the restoration of tolerance by reprogrammed Tregs (31Pasare C. Medzhitov R. Toll pathway-dependent blockade of CD4+CD25+ T cell-mediated suppression by dendritic cells.Science. 2003; 299: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). Hence, proinflammatory conditions reciprocally regulate Treg generatio"
https://openalex.org/W2142157598,"Impaired adipogenesis renders an adipose tissue unable to expand, leading to lipotoxicity and conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. While factors important for adipogenesis have been studied extensively, those that set the limits of adipose tissue expansion remain undetermined. Feeding a Western-type diet to apolipoprotein E2 knock-in mice, a model of metabolic syndrome, produced 3 groups of equally obese mice: mice with normal glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemic yet glucose-tolerant mice, and prediabetic mice with impaired glucose tolerance and reduced circulating insulin. Using proteomics, we compared subcutaneous adipose tissues from mice in these groups and found that the expression of PTRF (polymerase I and transcript release factor) associated selectively with their glucose tolerance status. Lentiviral and pharmacologically overexpressed PTRF, whose function is critical for caveola formation, compromised adipocyte differentiation of cultured 3T3-L1cells. In human adipose tissue, PTRF mRNA levels positively correlated with markers of lipolysis and cellular senescence. Furthermore, a negative relationship between telomere length and PTRF mRNA levels was observed in human subcutaneous fat. PTRF is associated with limited adipose tissue expansion underpinning the key role of caveolae in adipocyte regulation. Furthermore, PTRF may be a suitable adipocyte marker for predicting pathological obesity and inform clinical management.—Perez-Diaz, S., Johnson, L. A., DeKroon, R. M., Moreno-Navarrete, J.

https://openalex.org/W1981802340,"The tumour control probability (TCP) is a formalism derived to compare various treatment regimens of radiation therapy, defined as the probability that given a prescribed dose of radiation, a tumour has been eradicated or controlled. In the traditional view of cancer, all cells share the ability to divide without limit and thus have the potential to generate a malignant tumour. However, an emerging notion is that only a sub-population of cells, the so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the tumour. A key implication of the CSC hypothesis is that these cells must be eradicated to achieve cures, thus we define TCP_S as the probability of eradicating CSCs for a given dose of radiation. A cell surface protein expression profile, such as CD44high/CD24low for breast cancer, is often used as a biomarker to monitor CSCs enrichment. However, it is increasingly recognized that not all cells bearing this expression profile are necessarily CSCs, and in particular early generations of progenitor cells may share the same phenotype. Thus, due to the lack of a perfect biomarker for CSCs, we also define a novel measurable TCP_CD+, that is the probability of eliminating or controlling biomarker positive cells. Based on these definitions, we use stochastic methods and numerical simulations to compare the theoretical TCP_S and the measurable TCP_CD+. We also use the measurable TCP to compare the effect of various radiation protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2033418251,"Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a newly-defined tumor microcirculation pattern in highly aggressive malignant tumors. We recently reported tumor growth and VM formation of gallbladder cancers through the contribution of the ephrin type a receptor 2 (EphA2)/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Paxillin signaling pathways. In this study, we further investigated the anti-VM activity of norcantharidin (NCTD) as a VM inhibitor for gallbladder cancers and the underlying mechanisms. In vivo and in vitro experiments to determine the effects of NCTD on tumor growth, host survival, VM formation of GBC-SD nude mouse xenografts, and vasculogenic-like networks, malignant phenotypes i.e., proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of GBC-SD cells. Expression of VM signaling-related markers EphA2, FAK and Paxillin in vivo and in vitro were examined by immunofluorescence, western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. The results showed that after treatment with NCTD, GBC-SD cells were unable to form VM structures when injecting into nude mouse, growth of the xenograft was inhibited and these observations were confirmed by facts that VM formation by three-dimensional (3-D) matrix, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration of GBC-SD cells were affected; and survival time of the xenograft mice was prolonged. Furthermore, expression of EphA2, FAK and Paxillin proteins/mRNAs of the xenografts was downregulated. Thus, we concluded that NCTD has potential anti-VM activity against human gallbladder cancers; one of the underlying mechanisms may be via blocking the EphA2/FAK/Paxillin signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2125213350,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of metastatic lymph node ratio (LNR) in patients having radical resection for stage III gastric cancer. Methods A total of 365 patients with stage III gastric cancer who underwent radical resection between 2002 and 2008 at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital were analyzed. The cut-point survival analysis was adopted to determine the appropriate cutoffs for LNR. Kaplan–Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used for the survival analysis. Results By cut-point survival analysis, the LNR staging system was generated using 0.25 and 0.50 as the cutoff values. Pearson's correlation test revealed that the LNR was related with metastatic lymph nodes but not related with total harvested lymph nodes. Cox regression analysis showed that depth of invasion and LNR were the independent predictors of survival (p<0.05). There was a significant difference in survival between each pN stages classified by the LNR staging, however no significant difference was found in survival rate between each LNR stages classified by the pN staging. Conclusions The LNR is an independent prognostic factor for survival in stage III gastric cancer and is superior to the pN category in TNM staging. It may be considered as a prognostic variable in future staging system."
https://openalex.org/W2011010621,"To estimate annual direct costs of early RA by resource component in an inception cohort, with reference to four distinct treatment strategies: no disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), synthetic DMARDs only, biologic DMARDs in the first year ('first-year biologic', FYB), and biologic DMARDs from the second year after inclusion ('later-year biologic', LYB); to determine predictors of total and non-DMARD related costs.The ESPOIR cohort is a French multicentric, prospective study of 813 patients with early arthritis. Data assessing RA-related resource utilisation and disease characteristics were collected at baseline, biannually during the first two years and annually thereafter. Costs predictors were determined by generalised linear mixed analyses.Over the 4-year follow-up, mean annual direct total costs per treatment strategy group were €3,612 for all patients and €998, €1,922, €14,791, €8,477 respectively for no DMARDs, synthetic DMARDs only, FYB and LYB users. The main predictors of higher costs were biologic use and higher Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores at baseline. Being a biologic user led to a higher total cost (FYB Rate Ratio (RR) 7.22, [95% CI 5.59-9.31]; LYB RR 4.39, [95% CI 3.58-5.39]) compared to non-biologic users. Only LYB increased non-DMARD related costs compared to all other patients by 60%.FYB users incurred the highest levels of total costs, while their non-DMARD related costs remained similar to non-biologic users, possibly reflecting better RA control."
https://openalex.org/W2085048990,"GABAergic neurons specifically active during paradoxical sleep (PS) localized in the dorsal paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (DPGi) are known to be responsible for the cessation of activity of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus during PS. In the present study, we therefore sought to determine the role of the DPGi in PS onset and maintenance and in the inhibition of the LC noradrenergic neurons during this state. The effect of the inactivation of DPGi neurons on the sleep-waking cycle was examined in rats by microinjection of muscimol, a GABAA agonist, or clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Combining immunostaining of the different populations of wake-inducing neurons with that of c-FOS, we then determined whether muscimol inhibition of the DPGi specifically induces the activation of the noradrenergic neurons of the LC. Slow wave sleep and PS were abolished during 3 and 5 h after muscimol injection in the DPGi, respectively. The application of clonidine in the DPGi specifically induced a significant decrease in PS quantities and delayed PS appearance compared to NaCl. We further surprisingly found out that more than 75% of the noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons of all adrenergic and noradrenergic cell groups are activated after muscimol treatment in contrast to the other wake active systems significantly less activated. These results suggest that, in addition to its already know inhibition of LC noradrenergic neurons during PS, the DPGi might inhibit the activity of noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons from all groups during PS, but also to a minor extent during SWS and waking."
https://openalex.org/W2163248716,"IKKβ functions as a principal upstream activator of the canonical NF-κB pathway by phosphorylating IκB, leading to its proteasomal degradation. Because IKKβ is considered a therapeutic target, understanding its regulation may facilitate the design of efficient regulators of this molecule. Here, we report a novel IKKβ-interacting molecule, NME1L, a splicing variant of the NME1 protein. NME1 has attracted attention in cancer research because of its antimetastatic activity and reduced expression in multiple aggressive types of cancer. However, the effect was just moderate but not dramatic in anti-cancer activities. We found that only NME1L interacts with IKKβ. Exogenous expression of NME1L resulted in a potent decrease in TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation, whereas knockdown of NME1/NME1L with shRNA enhanced activity of NF-κB. NME1L down-regulates IKKβ signaling by blocking IKKβ-mediated IκB degradation. When NME1L was introduced into highly metastatic HT1080 cells, the mobility was efficiently inhibited. Furthermore, in a metastasis assay, NME1L-expressing cells did not colonize the lung. Based on these results, NME1L is a potent antimetastatic protein and may be a useful weapon in the fight against cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2009935296,"The Na+ translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is a unique respiratory enzyme catalyzing the electron transfer from NADH to quinone coupled with the translocation of sodium ions across the membrane. Typically, Vibrio spp., including Vibrio cholerae, have this enzyme but lack the proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I). Thus, Na+-NQR should significantly contribute to multiple aspects of V. cholerae physiology; however, no detailed characterization of this aspect has been reported so far. In this study, we broadly investigated the effects of loss of Na+-NQR on V. cholerae physiology by using Phenotype Microarray (Biolog), transcriptome and metabolomics analyses. We found that the V. cholerae ΔnqrA-F mutant showed multiple defects in metabolism detected by Phenotype Microarray. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the V. cholerae ΔnqrA-F mutant up-regulates 31 genes and down-regulates 55 genes in both early and mid-growth phases. The most up-regulated genes included the cadA and cadB genes, encoding a lysine decarboxylase and a lysine/cadaverine antiporter, respectively. Increased CadAB activity was further suggested by the metabolomics analysis. The down-regulated genes include sialic acid catabolism genes. Metabolomic analysis also suggested increased reductive pathway of TCA cycle and decreased purine metabolism in the V. cholerae ΔnqrA-F mutant. Lack of Na+-NQR did not affect any of the Na+ pumping-related phenotypes of V. cholerae suggesting that other secondary Na+ pump(s) can compensate for Na+ pumping activity of Na+-NQR. Overall, our study provides important insights into the contribution of Na+-NQR to V. cholerae physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1998090449,"The intracellularly replicating lung pathogen Legionella pneumophila consists of an extraordinary variety of phospholipases, including at least 15 different phospholipases A (PLA). Among them, PlaB, the first characterized member of a novel lipase family, is a hemolytic virulence factor that exhibits the most prominent PLA activity in L. pneumophila. We analyzed here protein oligomerization, the importance of oligomerization for activity, addressed further essential regions for activity within the PlaB C terminus, and the significance of PlaB-derived lipolytic activity for L. pneumophila intracellular replication. We determined by means of analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle x-ray scattering analysis that PlaB forms homodimers and homotetramers. The C-terminal 5, 10, or 15 amino acids, although the individual regions contributed to PLA activity, were not essential for protein tetramerization. Infection of mouse macrophages with L. pneumophila wild type, plaB knock-out mutant, and plaB complementing or various mutated plaB-harboring strains showed that catalytic activity of PlaB promotes intracellular replication. We observed that PlaB was most active in the lower nanomolar concentration range but not at or only at a low level at concentration above 0.1 μm where it exists in a dimer/tetramer equilibrium. We therefore conclude that PlaB is a virulence factor that, on the one hand, assembles in inactive tetramers at micromolar concentrations. On the other hand, oligomer dissociation at nanomolar concentrations activates PLA activity. Our data highlight the first example of concentration-dependent phospholipase inactivation by tetramerization, which may protect the bacterium from internal PLA activity, but enzyme dissociation may allow its activation after export.

Nevertheless, PlaB is a virulence factor of L. pneumophila as shown in in vivo guinea pig infections in which the knock-out mutants confer attenuated replication in the lung and reduced dissemination to the spleen (22Schunder E.

It is a cell-associated and hemolytic protein hydrolyzing predominantly phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), where the hemolytic activity is determined by the ability to hydrolyze PC (13Bender J.

Cell-associated PLA activity was not only found for L. pneumophila but also in some non-pneumophila species, such as Legionella gormanii and Legionella spiritensis, which are seldom or are not associated with Legionnaires disease (23Fang G.-D.

Interestingly, the PLA activity of the non-pneumophila species tested includes a different phospholipid substrate spectrum as compared with L. pneumophila, which may restrict hemolytic activity of the former (13Bender J.

PlaB possesses the most prominent PLA/LPLA activity to date found in in vitro grown L. pneumophila as well as during host cell infection. It is about 100-fold more active than the PLAs released into the culture supernatant. Important amino acids for catalytic activity, such as the potential catalytic triad Ser-85, Asp-203, and His-251, have been identified by mutagenesis of individual amino acids of conserved residues within the novel family of lipases. Protein truncation studies have pointed to the importance of the C-terminal 15 amino acids for lipolytic activity (13Bender J. Rydzewski K. Broich M. Schunder E. Heuner K. Flieger A.

Here, we addressed protein oligomerization, the influence of oligomerization on activity, analyzed the contribution of the PlaB C terminus to lipolytic activity and oligomerization, and the significance of PlaB-derived lipolytic activity for L. pneumophila intracellular replication. We conclude that PlaB is a potent PLA and virulence factor that assembles in inactive tetramers at micromolar concentrations, and oligomer dissociation at lower concentrations activates PLA activity.

For expression of N-terminally Strep-tagged PlaB, the purified PCR product was ligated into the SmaI/KpnI site of pGP172 resulting in pKK19. Truncated versions of PlaB and Strep-tagged PlaB were generated by amplifying pJB04 or pKK19 with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, see Table 2 for primers), respectively. All mentioned plasmids were confirmed by sequencing prior to use. Miniprep DNA of plaB as well as its truncated variants expressing plasmids were transformed into chemo-competent E. coli BL21 cells and grown in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cultures were diluted 100-fold in fresh LB broth and were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37 °C. Strep-PlaB expression was induced by addition of 2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and transferred to 20 °C for overnight expression. For purification of Strep-tagged variants, cell pellets were solubilized at 4 °C in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed via three passages through an Emulsi-Flex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Strep-tagged proteins were purified at 4 °C using Strep-Tactin Superflow high capacity matrix (IBA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Purified recombinant protein was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using an analytical Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) connected to an Äkta explorer system (GE Healthcare). The column equilibrated with Tris buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) or HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) was loaded with Strep-tagged protein in a volume of 0.5 ml with a concentration of 1 mg/ml (18 μm). The elution was carried out with the same buffer by applying 1 column volume (∼24 ml) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution fractions were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with protein standards purchased from Sigma to determine the molecular weight of Strep-PlaB and its variants. Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were carried out in a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at 10 °C using an An-50 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm and ProteomeLab XL-I GUI version 6.0 (firmware 5.7). Data analysis was performed with the program SEDFIT providing a model for diffusion-deconvoluted differential sedimentation coefficient distributions (c(s) distributions) (30Schuck P.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 4 °C in an An-50 Ti rotor using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with XL-A Data Acquisition and Analysis Software version 3.0. The samples were spun at 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 rpm until no change in concentration gradients was observed for at least 12 h. Data analysis was performed using the program BPCFIT as described previously (32Wyszomirski K.H. Curth U. Alves J. Mackeldanz P. Möncke-Buchner E. Schutkowski M. Krüger D.H. Reuter M.

Experiments were performed in standard 3- or 12-mm double sector centerpieces, and concentration profiles were measured at 280 or 230 nm using the UV absorption scanning optics of the centrifuges. For SV at high protein concentrations (5.4 to 24.4 μm), rStrep-PlaB was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Prior to SV at low protein concentrations (0.13–1.1 μm) and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, rStrep-PlaB was subjected to SEC in the same buffer but without EDTA using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the absorption coefficients at 280 nm as calculated from amino acid composition with the program SEDNTERP (31Laue M.T. Shah B.D.

SAXS data were recorded at the BioSAXS P12 station of the EMBL Hamburg at the synchrotron storage ring PETRA III at DESY. The protein solution sample was loaded by an automated sample changer to a quartz capillary mounted in vacuum. The x-ray energy was set to 12 keV, and the s axis for the scattering vector was calibrated with a silver-behenate standard. To check for radiation damage, 10 frames of 100 ms were recorded. Using the first frame of every series as reference, the following frames were compared, and only those frames without any sign of radiation damage were averaged. The resulting scattering functions were normalized for exposure time and sample transmission. For further analysis, corresponding buffers were subtracted by an automated procedure, and the scattering function was normalized against the sample concentration. Initial SAXS parameters such as"
https://openalex.org/W2059181657,"We have previously demonstrated the potential role of steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) as a co-regulator in the transcription of critical molecules modulating cardiac function and metabolism in normal and stressed hearts. The present study seeks to extend the previous information by demonstrating SRC-2 fulfills this role by serving as a critical coactivator for the transcription and activity of critical transcription factors known to control cardiac growth and metabolism as well as in their downstream signaling. This knowledge broadens our understanding of the mechanism by which SRC-2 acts in normal and stressed hearts and allows further investigation of the transcriptional modifications mediating different types and degrees of cardiac stress. Moreover, the genetic manipulation of SRC-2 in this study is specific for the heart and thereby eliminating potential indirect effects of SRC-2 deletion in other organs. We have shown that SRC-2 is critical to transcriptional control modulated by MEF2, GATA-4, and Tbx5, thereby enhancing gene expression associated with cardiac growth. Additionally, we describe SRC-2 as a novel regulator of PPARα expression, thus controlling critical steps in metabolic gene expression. We conclude that through regulation of cardiac transcription factor expression and activity, SRC-2 is a critical transcriptional regulator of genes important for cardiac growth, structure, and metabolism, three of the main pathways altered during the cardiac stress response. We have previously demonstrated the potential role of steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) as a co-regulator in the transcription of critical molecules modulating cardiac function and metabolism in normal and stressed hearts. The present study seeks to extend the previous information by demonstrating SRC-2 fulfills this role by serving as a critical coactivator for the transcription and activity of critical transcription factors known to control cardiac growth and metabolism as well as in their downstream signaling. This knowledge broadens our understanding of the mechanism by which SRC-2 acts in normal and stressed hearts and allows further investigation of the transcriptional modifications mediating different types and degrees of cardiac stress. Moreover, the genetic manipulation of SRC-2 in this study is specific for the heart and thereby eliminating potential indirect effects of SRC-2 deletion in other organs.

https://openalex.org/W1978489424,"The glucocorticoid dexamethasone increases cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) abundance in human airway epithelial cells by a mechanism that requires serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) activity. The goal of this study was to determine whether SGK1 increases CFTR abundance by phosphorylating Shank2E, a PDZ domain protein that contains two SGK1 phosphorylation consensus sites. We found that SGK1 phosphorylates Shank2E as well as a peptide containing the first SGK1 consensus motif of Shank2E. The dexamethasone-induced increase in CFTR abundance was diminished by overexpression of a dominant-negative Shank2E in which the SGK1 phosphorylation sites had been mutated. siRNA-mediated reduction of Shank2E also reduced the dexamethasone-induced increase in CFTR abundance. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the glucocorticoid-induced increase in CFTR abundance requires phosphorylation of Shank2E at an SGK1 consensus site."
https://openalex.org/W1964673853,"Exposure to chronic hypoxia (CH) induces elevated pulmonary artery pressure/resistance, leading to an eventual maladaptive right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). Muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF1) is a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase that mediates myocyte atrophy and has been shown to play a role in left ventricular hypertrophy and altered cardiac bioenergetics in pressure overloaded hearts. However, little is known about the contribution of MuRF1 impacting RVH in the setting of CH. Therefore, we hypothesized that MuRF1 deletion would enhance RVH compared to their wild-type littermates, while cardiac-specific overexpression would reduce hypertrophy following CH-induced pulmonary hypertension. We assessed right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricle to left ventricle plus septal weight ratio (RV/LV+S) and hematocrit (Hct) following a 3-wk isobaric CH exposure. Additionally, we conducted dual-isotope SPECT/CT imaging with cardiac function agent 201Tl-chloride and cell death agent 99mTc-annexin V. Predictably, CH induced pulmonary hypertension, measured by increased RVSP, RV/LV+S and Hct in WT mice compared to normoxic WT mice. Normoxic WT and MuRF1-null mice exhibited no significant differences in RVSP, RV/LV+S or Hct. CH-induced increases in RVSP were also similar between WT and MuRF1-null mice; however, RV/LV+S and Hct were significantly elevated in CH-exposed MuRF1-null mice compared to WT. In cardiac-specific MuRF1 overexpressing mice, RV/LV+S increased significantly due to CH exposure, even greater than in WT mice. This remodeling appeared eccentric, maladaptive and led to reduced systemic perfusion. In conclusion, these results are consistent with an atrophic role for MuRF1 regulating the magnitude of right ventricular hypertrophy following CH-induction of pulmonary hypertension."
