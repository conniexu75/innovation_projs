We aimed to assess antibiotic usage in commercial chicken production in Bangladesh, and identify factors associated with this practice. We conducted a large-scale cross-sectional study to collect information on antibiotic usage in commercial chickens from January to May 2021. Structured interviews were conducted with 288 broiler, 288 layer and 192 Sonali (locally-produced cross-bred) farmers in 20 sub-districts across Bangladesh. The frequency of antibiotic usage, the types of antibiotics and purpose of usage were estimated for each production type. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated to measure the association between antibiotic usage and factors related to the characteristics of the farms and farmers using multivariable logistic regression models. The proportion of farms, irrespective of their production type, reporting usage of antibiotics in the 24 hours preceding the interview was 41% (n = 314, 95% CI: 37-44%). Forty-five percent (n = 344, 41-48%) reported antibiotic usage in the last 72 hours, 86% (n = 658, 83-88%) in the last 14 days, and almost all farms, 98% (n = 753, 97-99%), had used antibiotics since the start of their production cycle. Use of antibiotics in the 24 hours preceding an interview was more frequently reported in broiler (OR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.36-2.69) and Sonali (OR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.33-2.33) than layer farms. Oxytetracycline (23-31%, depending on production type), doxycycline (18-25%), ciprofloxacin (16-26%) and amoxicillin (16-44%) were the most frequently used antibiotics. Antibiotics were reported to be used for both treatment and prophylactic purposes on most farms (57-67%). Usage of antibiotics in the 24h preceding an interview was significantly associated with the occurrence of any illnesses in chickens (aOR broiler: 41.22 [95% CI:13.63-124.62], layer: aOR 36.45[9.52-139.43], Sonali: aOR 28.47[4.97-162.97]). Antibiotic usage was mainly advised by veterinary practitioners (45-71%, depending on production type), followed by feed dealers (21-40%) and farmers (7-13%). Improvement of chicken health through good farming practices along with changes in key stakeholders (feed dealers and practitioners) attitudes towards antibiotic recommendations to farmers, may help to reduce the levels of antibiotic usage and thus contribute to mitigate antimicrobial resistance."

However, the mechanisms underlying infection and replication in salivary glands are still enigmatic due to the lack of proper in vitro models. Here, we show that human induced salivary glands (hiSGs) generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. The hiSGs exhibit properties similar to those of embryonic salivary glands and are a valuable tool for the functional analysis of genes during development. Orthotopically transplanted hiSGs can be engrafted at a recipient site in mice and show a mature phenotype. In addition, we confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in hiSGs. SARS-CoV-2 derived from saliva in asymptomatic individuals may participate in the spread of the virus. hiSGs may be a promising model for investigating the role of salivary glands as a virus reservoir. Tanaka et al. generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived salivary gland organoids that serve as a model for salivary gland development and SARS-CoV-2 infection."

This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and intensity of STHs infection among individual members living within the selected household heads (HHs) certified either as a model HHs or non-model HHs based on the implementation level of a training program known as the Health Extension Program (HEP). A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2018 at Seka Chekorsa Woreda, Jimma zone. Model and non-model HHs were selected systematically from each of the randomly selected district villages employing a multistage sampling technique. Sociodemographic and risk factors data associated with STHs infections were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Parasitological stool sample microscopic examination was done using saline wet mount and Kato Katz thick smear technique. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20 for descriptive statistics, comparison, and logistic regression at a p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance. Overall, 612 individuals were recruited in the study from 120 randomly selected HHs. The prevalence of STHs infections was found to be 32.4%. A total of 45 (14.7%) model and 153 (50.0%) non-model individual participants were positive for at least one species of STHs showing a significant difference between individuals in model and non-model HHs (AOR: 6.543, 95% CI; 4.36-9.82, P<0.001). The dominant STHs were T. trichiura (21.6%) followed by A. lumbricoides (6.4%) and hookworms (2.3%). The intensity of T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides infection have shown a significant difference (p<0.05) while hookworm species infection was not significantly different (p>0.05) for the individuals in the HHs groups. On the other hand, the households training status, age of participants, and latrine use pattern were found significant predictors of STHs infection prevalence in the multivariate analysis (P<0.05). Therefore, the prevalence and intensity of STHs infection was higher among individuals living in a non-model HHs than model HHs."

Conformational shifts in the PAS domain instigated by the oxidized FAD (FADOX)/FAD anionic semiquinone (FADASQ) redox couple traverse the HAMP (histidine kinases, adenylate cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases) and kinase control domains of the Aer dimer to regulate CheA kinase activity. The PAS domain of Aer is unstable and has not been previously purified. Here, residue substitutions that rescue FAD binding in an FAD binding–deficient full-length Aer variant were used in combination to stabilize the Aer PAS domain. We solved the 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure of this variant, Aer-PAS-GVV, and revealed a PAS fold that contains distinct features associated with FAD-based redox sensing, such as a close contact between the Arg115 side chain and N5 of the isoalloxazine ring and interactions of the flavin with the side chains of His53 and Asn85 that are poised to convey conformational signals from the cofactor to the protein surface. In addition, we determined the FADox/FADASQ formal potentials of Aer-PAS-GVV and full-length Aer reconstituted into nanodiscs. The Aer redox couple is remarkably low at –289.6 ± 0.4 mV. In conclusion, we propose a model for Aer energy sensing based on the low potential of Aer-PAS–FADox/FADASQ couple and the inability of Aer-PAS to bind to the fully reduced FAD hydroquinone.

Motile bacteria correlate their swimming behavior with environmental signals by directly sensing small molecules with transmembrane chemoreceptors (1Armitage J.P. Bacterial tactic responses.Adv.

Canonical dimeric chemoreceptors bind attractants and repellants in the periplasmic space and transduce conformational signals across the inner membrane to a dedicated histidine kinase CheA through the assistance of an adaptor protein CheW (4Muok A.R.

Core signaling units further assemble into extended arrays of hexagonal symmetry that enable signal gain and sensitivity to small changes in ligand concentration (4Muok A.R. Briegel A. Crane B.R.

Core unit of chemotaxis signaling complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 9390-9395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). During chemotaxis, inhibition of CheA by attractants (kinase-off) causes counterclockwise flagellar rotation and smooth swimming, whereas activation of CheA by removal of attractants or addition of repellants causes clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation and cell tumbling. Closely related to chemotaxis is energy taxis, which is taxis in response to respiratory changes; in particular, to concentration changes of terminal electron acceptors of the electron transport chain (ETC), such as nitrate, fumarate, and especially oxygen (8Alexandre G.

Aerotaxis and other energy-sensing behavior in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The sensing of oxygen, either directly through binding O2 or indirectly through energy sensing, is termed aerotaxis (10Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Johnson M.S. Aerotaxis and other energy-sensing behavior in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Energy receptors monitor the cellular energy state and couple to the chemotactic signaling infrastructure to regulate motility (8Alexandre G. Coupling metabolism and chemotaxis-dependent behaviours by energy taxis receptors.Microbiology. 2010; 156: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Schweinitzer T. Josenhans C. Bacterial energy taxis: a global strategy?.Arch. Microbiol. 2010; 192: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis functions to situate respiring bacteria in microenvironments abundant in essential nutrients such as sugars and amino acids. As bacteria oxidize these nutrients, they deplete their surroundings of electron acceptors, and energy taxis is required to stimulate migration before energy depletion (or in the case of oxygen, anoxia) develops (11Taylor B.L. How do bacteria find the optimal concentration of oxygen?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Rebbapragada A. Johnson M.S. Harding G.P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10541-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis and energy taxis cooperate to position bacteria in a microenvironment appropriate to their metabolic needs (11Taylor B.L. How do bacteria find the optimal concentration of oxygen?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Energy taxis allows cells to monitor the metabolic flux through the ETC, which in turn couples to the ADP/ATP ratio, the membrane potential (Δψ), the osmotic potential, ΔpH, and the redox states of ETC respiratory complexes (10Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Johnson M.S. Aerotaxis and other energy-sensing behavior in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of energy sensing correspondingly vary with respiratory requirements (8Alexandre G.

Aerotaxis and other energy-sensing behavior in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The primary energy sensor for motility in Escherichia coli is the dimeric transmembrane chemoreceptor Aer (aerotaxis receptor), which responds to changes in oxygen concentration indirectly by monitoring the metabolic load of reducing equivalents in the ETC (13Taylor B.L. Aer on the inside looking out: paradigm for a PAS?HAMP role in sensing oxygen, redox and energy.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Watts K.J. Johnson M.S. Taylor B.L. Minimal requirements for oxygen sensing by the aerotaxis receptor Aer.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Aer-mediated taxis has been shown to correlate with NADH dehydrogenase activity, and Aer sensitivity to respiratory flux is increasingly thought to be achieved through interactions with respiratory complexes (15Edwards J.C.

Microbiol. 2006; 62: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aer is dimeric and composed of a cytoplasmic N-terminal PAS (Per–Arnt–Sim; named for the representative proteins: Period, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein and Single-minded) domain, a helical transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic HAMP (histidine kinases, adenylate cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins [MCPs], and phosphatases) domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil kinase control domain (KCD) with high homology to those of MCPs (16Amin D.N. Taylor B.L. Johnson M.S. Organization of the aerotaxis receptor aer in the membrane of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7206-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Aer responds to oxygen indirectly through monitoring the metabolic flux of the ETC (10Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Johnson M.S. Aerotaxis and other energy-sensing behavior in bacteria.Annu. Rev.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In reconstitution studies, Aer associates into higher order signaling units like other E. coli MCPs such as Tar and Tsr, though no direct evidence of Aer receptor clustering has been reported in cells (17Samanta D. Widom J. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Crane B.R. Bacterial energy sensor aer modulates the activity of the chemotaxis kinase CheA based on the redox state of the flavin cofactor.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25809-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Homologs of E. coli Aer are also found in pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida and Campylobacter jejuni (18Laszlo D.J. Taylor B.L. Aerotaxis in Salmonella typhimurium: role of electron transport.J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Elliott K.T. DiRita V.J.

An aerotaxis transducer gene from Pseudomonas putida.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 177-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Motility-coupled respiration is a major virulence determinant of Salmonella enterica typhimurium, a prominent foodborne pathogen (21Rivera-Chávez F. Winter S.E. Lopez C.A. Xavier M.N. Winter M.G. Nuccio S.-P. et al.Salmonella uses energy taxis to benefit from intestinal inflammation.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003267Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The sensory module of Aer is the intracellular PAS domain that binds a redox-sensitive flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. The redox state of PAS-FAD determines the Aer signaling output. The flavin undergoes changes in redox state that trigger conformational transitions within the PAS domain that propagate to the KCD to transduce Aer signaling events (13Taylor B.L.

Interactions between the PAS and HAMP domains of the Escherichia coli aerotaxis receptor aer.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7440-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reconstituted into nanodiscs, fully oxidized FAD (FADOX) confers a kinase-on signaling state, and the FAD anionic semiquinone (FADASQ) confers a kinase-off signaling state (Fig. 1B) (17Samanta D. Widom J. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Crane B.R. Bacterial energy sensor aer modulates the activity of the chemotaxis kinase CheA based on the redox state of the flavin cofactor.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25809-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Certain mutations alter cofactor-coupled Aer signaling; for example, the Aer Y111C variant produces an inverted response in signal output relative to FAD redox state (13Taylor B.L. Aer on the inside looking out: paradigm for a PAS?HAMP role in sensing oxygen, redox and energy.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Aer-dependent aerotaxis relies on the ability of Aer to switch signaling states; mutations that confer a constitutive kinase-on or kinase-off signal allow motility but do not support energy taxis (14Watts K.J. Johnson M.S. Taylor B.L. Minimal requirements for oxygen sensing by the aerotaxis receptor Aer.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Determining the reduction potential of Aer-bound FAD is critical for understanding Aer redox sensitivity and for identifying ETC species capable of interacting with Aer. E. coli cells switch from a kinase-on (CW) to a kinase-off (counterclockwise) state when (1) electron donors are introduced to reduce an oxidized ETC or (2) electron acceptors are introduced to oxidize a reduced ETC. Aer activity in nanodiscs is then consistent with this behavior because, as noted previously, Aer FADOX produces kinase-on and Aer FADASQ produces kinase-off. It follows that the fully reduced FAD hydroquinone (FADHQ), which would be favored under highly reducing conditions, should also produce kinase-on (CW). However, the FADHQ state has not yet been observed for the isolated protein, even upon reduction with dithionite or incubation with reduced FADHQ; hence, the reduction potential of the Aer FADASQ must be very low (17Samanta D.

The PAS domain is comprised of an N-cap (residues 1–19), a PAS core made up of an antiparallel β-sheet and several α-helices (residues 20–119), and a C-terminal helix (residues 119–134) that constitutes roughly the first half of a linker region previously termed F1 (residues 130–161) (26Watts K.J.

Random mutagenesis experiments using an Aer mutant deficient in FAD binding revealed three separate mutations (S28G, A65V, and A99V) that each rescue cofactor binding (22Watts K.J. Ma Q. Johnson M.S.

Furthermore, crosslinking experiments coupled with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate that transient interdimer PAS–PAS interactions contribute to higher oligomeric states in vivo, although these associations depend on temperature and appear transient (26Watts K.J.

Here, we report the structure and biophysical characterization of the Aer PAS domain, making use of the triple variant that combines all three flavin-stabilizing residue substitutions (S28G, A65V, and A99V); hereafter, called, Aer-PAS-GVV. Furthermore, the redox chemistry of PAS-FAD is investigated for different FL and PAS Aer species using a coupled deazaflavin photocycle (30Efimov I. Parkin G. Millett E.S. Glenday J. Chan C.K.

In vivo electron spin resonance (ESR) and size-exclusion chromatography small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC–SAXS) provide insight into the nature of the Aer energy-sensing function. These results have important implications for understanding energy sensing in prokaryotes. When solubilized in detergent or incorporated into nanodiscs, the flavin of E. coli Aer was reduced by one electron to the ASQ (FADASQ) state (17Samanta D. Widom J. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Crane B.R. Bacterial energy sensor aer modulates the activity of the chemotaxis kinase CheA based on the redox state of the flavin cofactor.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25809-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Most flavoproteins more typically form the neutral protonated semiquinone (FADNSQ) as the one-electron reduced state. Thus, we investigated if FADASQ formation was indeed the preferred reduced state in vivo by overexpressing Aer in BL-21 cells and recording 1H-ENDOR spectra of the whole cells. ENDOR detects protons coupled to the unpaired electron spin on the isoalloxazine ring, and the spectra unambiguously distinguish the FADASQ from FADNSQ. Cells wherein Aer expression was not induced showed no appreciable flavin signal. The ENDOR spectrum observed for Aer WT in BL21/DE3 cells was consistent with an ASQ species (Fig. 1, C and D). Three major proton frequencies were observed in the ENDOR spectrum at 10.4, 8.8, and 7.8 MHz. The peak at 10.4 MHz attributes to the H8a protons; this high value of the H8a indicates the presence of an ASQ radical in the sample (32Schleicher E. Wenzel R. Ahmad M. Batschauer A. Essen L.-O. Hitomi K. et al.The electronic state of flavoproteins: investigations with proton electron–nuclear double resonance.Appl. Magn. Reson. 2010; 37: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The proton frequencies of 8.8 and 7.8 MHz attributes to the H1′ and H6 protons, respectively. Furthermore, smaller hyperfine frequencies between 0 and 3 MHz correspond to the solvent/matrix protons as well as other unresolved protons present on the flavin (Fig. 1D) (32Schleicher E. Wenzel R.

Upon purification by SEC, the protein typically eluted as an aggregate bound to GroEL/ES and other chaperones. Watts et al. (22Watts K.J. Ma Q. Johnson M.S. Taylor B.L. Interactions between the PAS and HAMP domains of the Escherichia coli aerotaxis receptor aer.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7440-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) identified three PAS domain residue substitutions (S28G, A65V, and A99V) that each individually rescue FAD binding in FL Aer containing a lesion that abolishes FAD binding. In combination, these three substitutions stabilized the PAS domain to the extent that substantial amounts of Aer-PAS (Aer-PAS-GVV) could be expressed. Aer-PAS-GVV purified as a monomer on SEC, as verified by SEC–SAXS (Fig. 2A). The absorbance spectrum of Aer-PAS-GVV showed the characteristic sharpening of the canonical FAD vibrational peaks expected when in a protein binding site (34Evans E.W. Dodson C.A. Maeda K. Biskup T. Wedge C.J. Timmel C.R. Magnetic field effects in flavoproteins and related systems.Interf. Focus. 2013; 320130037Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Like the FL protein, reduction of Aer-PAS-GVV produced the one-electron reduced ASQ (FADASQ), and further reduction to the HQ form was not possible, even with low-potential reductants such as dithionite (17Samanta D. Widom J. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. Crane B.R. Bacterial energy sensor aer modulates the activity of the chemotaxis kinase CheA based on the redox state of the flavin cofactor.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 25809-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Applying multiple stabilizing residue substitutions had cumulative effects on purification yield and on the temperature stability of the PAS domain. For instance, Aer 1-154 S28G must be extracted at 4 °C in buffer containing 20% glycerol to obtain any protein, whereas Aer 1-154 S28G A65V can be purified at room temperature in buffer with as little as 5% glycerol content. Aer-PAS-GVV is even better behaved than the variant with two substitutions. Each of the three substitutions individually have been shown to have minimal impact on signal transduction in Aer and to support chemotaxis in tryptone soft agar (22Watts K.J. Ma Q. Johnson M.S.

We integrated transcriptomic sequencing, genomic analysis and clinicopathologic information from 582 tissue samples of 216 PTC and 75 benign thyroid nodule (BTN) patients. We discovered four subtypes of PTC including Immune-enriched Subtype, BRAF-enriched Subtype, Stromal Subtype and CNV-enriched Subtype. Molecular subtypes were validated in an external cohort of 497 PTC cases from the TCGA. Tumors in the Immune-enriched Subtype showed higher immune infiltration and overexpression of immune checkpoints, whilst BRAF-enriched Subtype showed a higher tendency for extrathyroidal extension and more advanced TNM stage. Key oncogenes including LRRK2, SLC34A2, MUC1, FOXQ1 and KRT19 were overexpressed and enriched in oncogenic MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in BRAF-enriched subtype. Further analysis of BRAF-enriched Subtype identified three subclasses with different degrees of malignancies. We also uncovered the molecular link of the initiation and progression from BTN to subtypes of PTC using trajectory analysis. Moreover, a 20-gene expression signature was generated for differential diagnosis of PTC from BTN patients. Together, our work identified previously unreported molecular subtypes of PTC, offering opportunities to stratify patients into optimal treatment plans based on molecular subtyping."

The current study followed a pre-registered analysis plan with the aim to investigate a previously unconsidered factor in the relationship between autistic traits and disorders of eating and body image: the drive for muscularity. Participants ( N = 1068) completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) and Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS). Positive correlations between AQ and EAT-26 and AQ and DMS were observed. In females, AQ remained significantly correlated with EAT-26 and DMS when controlling for co-occurring anxiety and depression symptoms, but this was not the case in males. These findings demonstrate the moderating role of sex, and the need to consider autistic traits in individuals diagnosed with, or at a heightened risk for, disorders of eating and body image."

The present work describes the taxonomic and functional profile of the bacterial and archaeal communities from five different gastrointestinal sections (rumen, omasum-abomasum, jejunum, cecum and colon) of browsing Capra hircus, by metabarcoding using 16S rRNA genes hypervariable regions. The bacterial communities across the GITs are mainly composed of Bacillota and Bacteroidota. Prevotella was the leading bacterial group found in the stomachs, Romboutsia in the jejuna, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bacteroides, UCG-010_ge, UCG-005, and Alistipes in large intestines. The archaeal communities in the stomachs and jejuna revealed to be mainly composed of Methanobrevibacter, while in the large intestines its dominance is shared with Methanocorpusculum. Across the GITs, the main metabolic functions were related to carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolisms. Significant differences in the composition and potential biological functions of the bacterial communities were observed among stomachs, jejuna and large intestines. In contrast, significant differences were observed among stomachs and jejuna verse large intestines for archaeal communities. Overall different regions of the GIT are occupied by different microbial communities performing distinct biological functions. A high variety of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) indispensable for degrading plant cell wall materials were predicted to be present in all the GIT sections."
https://openalex.org/W4306631513,"The instantaneous (ISA) and average (ASA) screw axes are techniques commonly adopted in motion analysis to functionally locate the rotation axis and center of rotation of a joint. Several approaches for calculating such axes were proposed in literature and the main limitations were identified as the need for using a threshold on angular displacements or velocities for handling the cases where the ISA is ill-defined and the need for a method for reliably estimating the center or rotation in limit cases, such as a purely rotational motion in the three-dimensional space. Furthermore, in many applications, such as in biomechanics, it is useful to statistically estimate the dispersion or variation of the ISA with respect to the ASA. In this paper we propose a novel method for estimating an ASA. Our method represents an improvement over previous methods as it: (i) exploits an optimization procedure based on the instantaneous differential kinematics (screw twist); (ii) removes the need for a threshold by introducing a weighting based on the norm of angular velocity; (iii) handles the singular cases where the position of the ASA is ill-defined by proposing a regularization term in the optimization. In addition, we proposed a method for estimating the uncertainty in the ASA calculation. The same quantities serve as a measure of the dispersion of the ISAs with respect to the ASA. The method was tested on real data and surrogate data: (i) a human gait analysis trial representing the motion of a knee, (ii) the experimental recording of the free swing motion of a mechanical hinge and (iii) synthetically generated motion data of a purely rotational (cylindrical) motion. The results showed that the new method had a lower sensitivity to noise, was able to reasonably handle the singular cases and provide a detailed analysis of ISA dispersion."
https://openalex.org/W4306632278,"Understanding shark mating dynamics and mating site use may be vital to species management. The Dry Tortugas courtship and mating ground (DTCMG) has been known as a mating site for nurse sharks, Ginglymostoma cirratum , since 1895. In a 30-yr (1992–2021) study we have documented long-term site fidelity to this area with data from 137 adult sharks (89 female, 48 male) tagged with PIT, fin, and acoustic tags. Of 118 sharks tagged from 1993 to 2014, at least 80 (68%) returned to the DTCMG in subsequent years during the June-July mating season. Known individuals returned in up to 16 different mating seasons and over periods of up 28 years, indicating that life span extends well into the forties for this species. Of all returning sharks, 59% (N = 47) have been monitored for over 10 years and 13% (N = 10) have been monitored for over 20 years. Males arrived annually in May and June and departed in July, whereas females arrived biennially or triennially in June, with a secondary peak in site use in September and August, likely associated with thermoregulation during gestation. During the mating season, males made more frequent visits of shorter duration (median = 34 visits for 1 h per visit) to the DTCMG, whereas females made fewer visits but remained on site for longer periods (median = 12.5 visits for 4.4 h per visit). Females typically mated biennially but showed a triennial cycle in 32% of cases, with many females switching cycles at least once. This pattern would reduce the potential reproductive lifetime output of a female by 11% compared to what would be projected from a strict biennial cycle. The long-term mating site fidelity of this shark population reveals the importance of identifying and protecting mating sites for this and other elasmobranch species."

We extracted and analyzed relevant data (i.e., socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behavior, fertility-related characteristics, and contraceptive use) using a modified Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator. Prevalence Ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated, and statistical significance was set at P≤0.05.The median age of the sexually active FUS was 23 years (IQR = 21-25) and 99.3% indicated that they wanted to have children. Only 49.3% knew their fertile period and 62.5% of the sexually active FUS were current contraceptive users. We found a statistically significant association between fertility awareness knowledge and period abstinence (PR = 1.57;95%CI: 1.02-2.44, p = 0.049). In multivariate adjusted models, there was a statistically significant association between fertility awareness knowledge and male condom use (APR = 1.29; 95% CI:1.02-1.64, p-value = 0.032) and the withdrawal method (APR = 1.40;95% CI:1.02-1.93, p = 0.038). We found a statistically significant effect modification of ""preferred timing to have children"" on the association between fertility awareness knowledge and withdrawal method use. There was no association between fertility awareness knowledge and the use of oral contraceptive pills.Most of the female students intend to have children in the future, but their fertility awareness knowledge was suboptimal. There was a statistically significant relationship between fertility awareness knowledge, and the use of male condoms and the withdrawal method. The study underscores the need for FUS to be targeted with interventions to help them gain knowledge of their menstrual cycle to better plan or avoid unwanted pregnancy."

However, studies comparing the effects of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are scarce. In addition, relatively few studies have analyzed the effects of SGLT2i in diabetic patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or heart failure (HF), and current guidelines recommend SGLT2i and other antidiabetic drugs equally in this population. Therefore, we aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) in patients with type 2 diabetes without prior ASCVD, CKD, or HF.Using a propensity-score matching method, we retrospectively analyzed 921 patients treated with dapagliflozin, 921 patients treated with empagliflozin, and 1842 patients treated with DPP4i (control group). Study outcomes comprised composite coronary events (acute coronary syndrome and coronary revascularization), composite ischemic events (coronary events and stroke), and composite heart failure and renal events.During follow up (median, 43.4 months), the incidence of composite coronary events was significantly lower in the SGLT2i groups than in the control group, and the incidence of composite ischemic events was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the control group. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin both demonstrated significant benefits in terms of HF and renal outcomes, supported by renoprotective effects, as assessed by the change in glomerular filtration rate. At 24-36 months of treatment, the empagliflozin group had higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and lower glycated hemoglobin levels, compared to those in the dapagliflozin and control groups.SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ASCVD, HF hospitalization, and renal events, compared to that with DPP4i use among diabetic patients without prior ASCVD, CKD, or HF. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, supporting a SGLT2i class effect."

Preliminary laboratory-based research was conducted to investigate germination and emergence requirements of C . album under various environmental conditions (e.g., photoperiods, constant temperature, salinity, moisture, soil pH, burial depth, and oat crop residue). Results showed C . album seeds were found to be photoblastic, with only 13% germination in darkness. The maximum germination (94%) of C . album occurred at an optimal temperature of 25°C, and the depressive effect of other temperatures on germination was more severe at lower rather than higher temperatures. Seed germination was suitably tolerant of salinity and osmotic potential, with germination observed at 200 mM NaCl (37.0%) and -0.8 MPa (20%), respectively. Germination was relatively uniform (88–92%) at pH levels ranging from 4 to 10. The maximum germination of C . album was observed on the soil surface, with no or rare emergence of seeds at a burial depth of 2 cm or under 7000 kg ha -1 oat straw cover, respectively. Information provided by this study will help to develop more sustainable and effective integrated weed management strategies for the control of C . album , including (i) a shallow-tillage procedures to bury weed seeds in conventional-tillage systems and (ii) oat residue retention or coverage on the soil surface in no-tillage systems."

This study aimed to evaluate pepsinogens (PGIs) and gastrin-17 (G-17) levels and to determine the diagnostic performances for gastric cancer and chronic atrophic gastritis among Mongolian individuals. We enrolled a total of 120 subjects, including gastric cancer (40), atrophic gastritis (40), and healthy control (40), matched by age (±2) and sex. Pepsinogen I (PGI), Pepsinogen II (PGII), G-17, and H . pylori IgG levels were measured using GastroPanel ELISA kit (Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). Also, PGI to PGII ratio (PGR) was calculated. For atrophic gastritis, when the optimal cut-off value of PGI was ≤75.07 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 50%, respectively; when the optimal cut-off value of PGR was ≤6.25, sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 44.7%, respectively. For gastric cancer, when the optimal cut-off value of PGI was ≤35.25 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity were 47.2% and 86.8%, respectively; when the optimal cut-off value of PGR was ≤5.27, sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 60.5%, respectively. Combinations of biomarkers with risk factors could improve diagnostic accuracy (AUC for atrophic gastritis 74.8, 95% CI 64.0–85.7, p&lt;0.001; AUC for gastric cancer 75.5, 95% CI 64.2–86.8, p&lt;0.001). PGI, PGR biomarkers combined with the risk of age, family history of gastric cancer, and previous gastric disease could not be an alternative test for upper endoscopy but might be a supportive method which is identifying individuals at medium- and high risk of gastric cancer and precancerous lesions who may need upper endoscopy."

The question remains whether RBC breakdown and intravascular hemolysis (IVH) occur in T2D patients. We characterized RBC-degradation products and vesiculation in a case-control study of 109 T2D patients and 65 control subjects. We quantified heme-related absorbance by spectrophotometry and circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) by flow cytometry and electron microscopy. Heme-related absorbance was increased in T2D vs. control plasma (+57%) and further elevated in obese T2D plasma (+27%). However, large CD235a+ EV were not increased in T2D plasma. EV from T2D plasma, or shed by isolated T2D RBC, were notably smaller in diameter (-27%) and carried heme-related absorbance. In T2D plasma, higher heme-related absorbance (+30%) was associated to peripheral sensory neuropathy, and no other vascular complication. In vitro, T2D RBC-derived EV triggered endothelial stress and thrombin activation in a phosphatidylserine- and heme-dependent fashion. We concluded that T2D was associated with low-grade IVH. Plasma absorbance may constitute a novel biomarker of peripheral neuropathy in T2D, while flow cytometry focusing on large EV may be maladapted to characterize RBC EV in T2D. Moreover, therapeutics limiting IVH or neutralizing RBC breakdown products might bolster vasculoprotection in T2D."
https://openalex.org/W4306630435,"Among species, parental behaviors vary in their magnitude, onset relative to reproduction, and sexual dimorphism. In deer mice (genus Peromyscus), while most species are promiscuous with low paternal care, monogamy and biparental care have evolved at least twice under different ecological conditions. Here, in a common laboratory setting, we monitored parental behaviors of males and females of two promiscuous (eastern deer mouse P. maniculatus and white-footed mouse P. leucopus) and two monogamous (oldfield mouse P. polionotus and California mouse P. californicus) species from before mating to after giving birth. In the promiscuous species, females showed parental behaviors largely after parturition, while males showed little parental care. In contrast, both sexes of monogamous species performed parental behaviors. However, while oldfield mice began to display parental behaviors before mating, California mice showed robust parental care behaviors only postpartum. These different parental-care trajectories in the two monogamous species align with their socioecology. Oldfield mice have overlapping home ranges with relatives, so infants they encounter, even if not their own, are likely to be closely related. By contrast, California mice disperse longer distances into exclusive territories with possibly unrelated neighbors, decreasing the inclusive fitness benefits of caring for unfamiliar pups before parenthood. Together, we find that patterns of parental behaviors in Peromyscus are consistent with predictions from inclusive fitness theory."

We tested people with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction (N = 12, mean age 62 range 23–78), or with Unilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss (USNHL, N = 9, 48, 22–82), or healthy controls (N = 21, 52, 28–80). Postural sway and head kinematics parameters (Directional Path in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions (sway &amp; head); pitch, yaw and roll (head) were analyzed in response to 2 levels of auditory (none, rhythmic sounds via headphones), visual (static, dynamic) and somatosensory cues (floor, foam) within a simulated, virtual 3-wall display of stars. We found no differences with the rhythmic auditory cues. The effect of foam was magnified in the vestibular group compared with controls for anterior-posterior and medio-lateral postural sway, and all head direction except for medio-lateral. The vestibular group had significantly larger anterior-posterior and medio-lateral postural sway and head movement on the static scene compared with controls. Differences in pitch, yaw and roll emerged between vestibular and controls only with sensory perturbations. The USNHL group did not increase their postural sway and head movement with the increased visual load as much as controls did, particularly when standing on the foam. They did not increase their medio-lateral sway with the foam as much as controls did. These findings suggest that individuals with USNHL employ a compensatory strategy of conscious control of balance, the functional implications of which need to be tested in future research."
https://openalex.org/W4306631539,"Objective We compared birth injuries for spontaneous vaginal (VD) and caesarean section (CS) deliveries in preterm and term pregnancies. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary center, between January 1st, 2007, and December 31st, 2017. The study included 62330 singleton pregnancies delivered after 24 0/7 weeks gestation. Multivariable analyses compared trauma at birth, birth hypoxia and birth asphyxia in term and preterm deliveries, stratified by mode of birth, VD versus CS. Main outcome measure was trauma at birth including intracranial laceration and haemorrhage, injuries to scalp, injuries to central and peripheral nervous system, fractures to skeleton, facial and eye injury. Results The incidence of preterm deliveries was 10.9%. Delivery of preterm babies by CS increased from 37.0% in 2007 to 60.0% in 2017. The overall incidence of all birth trauma was 16.2%. When stratified by mode of delivery, birth trauma was recorded in 23.4% of spontaneous vaginal deliveries and 7.5% of CS deliveries (aOR 3.3, 95%CI 3.1–3.5). When considered all types of birth trauma, incidence of trauma at birth was higher after 28 weeks gestation in VD compared to CS (28–31 weeks, aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.3; 32–36 weeks, aOR 4.2, 95% CI 3.6–4.9; &gt;37 weeks, aOR 3.3, 95% CI 3.1–3.5). There was no difference in the incidence of birth trauma before 28 weeks gestation between VD and CS (aOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5–1.2). Regarding overall life-threatening birth trauma or injuries at birth with severe consequences such as cerebral and intraventricular haemorrhage, cranial and brachial nerve injury, fractures of long bones and clavicle, eye and facial injury, there was no difference in vaginal preterm deliveries compared to CS deliveries (p &gt; 0.05 for all). Conclusion CS is not protective of injury at birth. When all types of birth trauma are considered, these are more common in spontaneous VD, thus favoring CS as preferred method of delivery to avoid trauma at birth. However, when stratified by severity of birth trauma, preterm babies delivered vaginally are not at higher risk of major birth trauma than those delivered by CS."
https://openalex.org/W4306632316,"Here we show that central administration of pyroglutamylated arginine-phenylamine-amide peptide (QRFP/26RFa) increases both food intake and locomotor activity, without any significant effect on energy expenditure, thermogenesis or reward. Germline knock out of either of the mouse QRFP receptor orthologs, Gpr103a and Gpr103b, did not produce a metabolic phenotype. However, both receptors are required for the effect of centrally administered QRFP to increase feeding and locomotor activity. As central injection of QRFP activated orexin/hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, we compared the action of QRFP and orexin on behaviour. Both peptides increased arousal and locomotor activity. However, while orexin increased consummatory behaviour, QRFP also affected other appetitive behaviours. Furthermore, the feeding but not the locomotor response to QRFP, was blocked by co-administration of an orexin receptor 1 antagonist. These results suggest that QRFP agonism induces both appetitive and consummatory behaviour, but only the latter is dependent on orexin/hypocretin receptor signalling."

The gene coding for the coelenterazine sulfotransferase has not been identified. Here we used a combined proteomic/transcriptomic approach to identify and clone the sulfotransferase cDNA. Multiple isoforms of coelenterazine sulfotransferase were identified from the anthozoan Renilla muelleri by intersecting its transcriptome with the LC-MS/MS derived peptide sequences of coelenterazine sulfotransferase purified from Renilla. Two of the isoforms were expressed in E. coli, purified, and partially characterized. The encoded enzymes display sulfotransferase activity that is comparable to that of the native sulfotransferase isolated from Renilla reniformis that was reported in 1970. The bioluminescent assay for sensitive detection of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) using the recombinant sulfotransferase is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W4306630409,"In home care, the toothpaste technique, which can enhance the caries-preventive effect without changing the amount of dentifrice and fluoride ion concentration, is of great significance. This study aimed to construct a model and experimental system that reproduces the interdental part and to clarify the relationship between the change in dentifrice viscosity due to dilution and washout in the high-risk approximal area of caries. Additionally, the effectiveness of the toothpaste technique and appropriate devices for delivering dentifrice to the interdental area at a low dilution were investigated. Diluted toothpaste samples were prepared (: ×1.00, ×1.25, ×1.50, ×1.75, ×2.00, ×3.00, and ×4.00). An acrylic interproximal model was created for this experiment. The flow characteristics and viscosity by dentifrice dilution were measured. In the case of low dilution of 57% (1.75×) or more, it was shown that the dentifrice in the high-risk area may be washed out early because of the decrease in viscosity, and the caries-preventive effect may be reduced. It was also suggested that to keep the dentifrice in the interdental area for 120 s at the end of brushing, a dilution must be devised to a concentration of at least 50% (2.00×). The prepared toothpaste delivery (PTD) method of delivering dentifrice to the interdental area while maintaining it at a low dilution is an effective toothpaste technique in terms of dentifrice dilution and viscosity. The use of finger brushes in the PTD method could increase the efficiency of dentifrice delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4306630413,"States, territories, non-profits, and tribes are eligible to obtain federal funding to implement federally endorsed evidence-based home visiting programs. This represents a massive success in translational science, with $400 million a year allocated to these implementation efforts. This legislation also requires that 3% of this annual funding be allocated to tribal entities implementing home visiting in their communities. However, implementing stakeholders face challenges with selecting which program is best for their desired outcomes and context. Moreover, recent reviews have indicated that when implemented in practice and delivered at scale, many evidence-based home visiting programs fail to replicate the retention rates and effects achieved during clinical trials. To inform program implementers and better identify the active ingredients in home visiting programs that drive significant impacts, we aimed to develop an expert derived consensus taxonomy on the elements used in home visiting practice that are essential to priority outcome domains.We convened a panel of 16 experts representing researchers, model representatives, and program implementers using a Delphi approach. We first elicited standard practice elements (SPEs) using open-ended inquiry, then compared these elements to behavior change techniques (BCTs) given their general importance in the field of home visiting; and finally rated their importance to 10 outcome domains.Our process identified 48 SPEs derived from the panel, with 83 additional BCTs added based on the literature. Six SPEs, mostly related to home visitor characteristics and skills, were rated essential across all outcome domains. Fifty-three of the 83 BCTs were rated unnecessary across all outcome domains.This work represents the first step in a consensus-grounded taxonomy of techniques and strategies necessary for home visiting programs and provides a framework for future hypothesis testing and replication studies."
https://openalex.org/W4306630423,"Background An alarming trend of sustained physical inactivity has been observed among women in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, mainly due to the lack of time and high cost of gym facilities. Although physical activity essentially contributes to disease prevention, evidence supporting time-efficient exercise on anthropometric measures is limited. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of interval-based high-intensity circuit training (HICT) on anthropometric measures and the nature of the relationship between these measures. Methods A single-group, quasi-experimental study was conducted in the community park of Ziauddin Hospital at Sikandarabad. Sixty women who were overweight and had sedentary lifestyles were recruited for a six-week HICT-based program conducted at 85%–95% maximum heart rate (MHR) on every alternate day. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at 6-weeks including anthropometric parameters (body mass index [BMI], body fat percentage [BF%], and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]). Results The six-week HICT-based program demonstrated a significant reduction in BMI ( p &lt;0.001), BF% ( p &lt;0.001), and WHR ( p &lt;0.001). Reductions in the BMI mean from 27.3±1.3 to 25.1±1.4 and BF% mean from 31.9±2.3 to 27.6±2.4 were observed following 18 sessions of HICT. The effect of age on BF% and WHR was linearly significant ( p &lt;0.001) with increasing age (BF%) and WHR. Conclusion Interval-based HICT was an effective exercise regimen for improving BMI, BF%, and WHR. Furthermore, the exercise protocol was feasible and well tolerated, with no reported adverse events, and it could be easily implemented in real-world community settings. BF% and WHR were significantly influenced by increasing age; therefore, our findings support the importance of exercise implementation, especially with increasing age, for the maintenance of a disease-free healthy lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W4306630482,"Our objective is to improve local decision-making for strategies to end the HIV epidemic using the newly developed Levers of HIV agent-based model (ABM). Agent-based models use computer simulations that incorporate heterogeneity in individual behaviors and interactions, allow emergence of systemic behaviors, and extrapolate into the future. The Levers of HIV model (LHM) uses Chicago neighborhood demographics, data on sex-risk behaviors and sexual networks, and data on the prevention and care cascades, to model local dynamics. It models the impact of changes in local preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) (ie, levers) for meeting Illinois' goal of ""Getting to Zero"" (GTZ) -reducing by 90% new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) by 2030. We simulate a 15-year period (2016-2030) for 2304 distinct scenarios based on 6 levers related to HIV treatment and prevention: (1) linkage to PrEP for those testing negative, (2) linkage to ART for those living with HIV, (3) adherence to PrEP, (4) viral suppression by means of ART, (5) PrEP retention, and (6) ART retention. Using tree-based methods, we identify the best scenarios at achieving a 90% HIV infection reduction by 2030. The optimal scenario consisted of the highest levels of ART retention and PrEP adherence, next to highest levels of PrEP retention, and moderate levels of PrEP linkage, achieved 90% reduction by 2030 in 58% of simulations. We used Bayesian posterior predictive distributions based on our simulated results to determine the likelihood of attaining 90% HIV infection reduction using the most recent Chicago Department of Public Health surveillance data and found that projections of the current rate of decline (2016-2019) would not achieve the 90% (p = 0.0006) reduction target for 2030. Our results suggest that increases are needed at all steps of the PrEP cascade, combined with increases in retention in HIV care, to approach 90% reduction in new HIV diagnoses by 2030. These findings show how simulation modeling with local data can guide policy makers to identify and invest in efficient care models to achieve long-term local goals of ending the HIV epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W4306631543,"Background Globally, millions of people of reproductive age experience infertility. With that notwithstanding, most infertile patients undergoing pharmacotherapy withdraw from treatment before achieving the desired outcome. The reasons for their withdrawal, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have not been well examined, hence the need for this study. Objectives The aim of the study was to examine why infertile patients discontinue pharmacotherapy prior to achieving conception. Methods The study employed an exploratory qualitative design. Purposive sampling technique was used to recruit subjects into the study. Twenty infertile patients (fourteen females and six males) who discontinued their treatment, and eight attending health professionals who provided direct care to these patients were interviewed. Telephone and face-to-face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. The data collected were transcribed, coded, and generated into themes using thematic content analysis. Results The major reasons for discontinuation of infertility treatment included lack of support from male partners, seeking alternative treatment, unmet outcome, poor medical services, distance, stigmatization, and relocation. Conclusions Patients and healthcare personnel shared both similar and diverse views on reasons for discontinuation of infertility treatment that reflect situations in a typical African setting, most of which are not reported in existing studies. The outcome of this study will provide insight for fertility therapists and policy makers in designing appropriate measures to facilitate maximum compliance and improvement in treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4306631557,"A method for assessing the degree of impact of wastewater treatment plant discharge on receiving rivers was proposed, based on the structural indicators of the population of ciliated protozoa. It was shown that the ratio of attached, crawling and free-swimming forms in bottom sediments changes under the influence of discharge. In the points subject to organic pollution, the share of attached filter-feeding bacteriovorous ciliates increases in the assemblage of ciliated protozoa. The proposed Attached Form Index (AFI) takes this ratio into account. The use of AFI makes it possible to assess the restructuring of the assemblage of ciliated protozoa under the influence of point sources of pollution, to establish a zone of negative influence of runoff, to assess the degree of restoration of the aquatic ecosystem, as the influence of the pollution source weakened."
https://openalex.org/W4306631626,"Background Glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice root extract, exhibits antiviral and immunomodulatory properties by direct inhibition of the pro-inflammatory alarmin HMGB1 (High-mobility group box 1). Objective The aim of this study was to explore the role of liquorice intake on the viral entry receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and the immunoregulatory HMGB1 in healthy individuals and to explore HMGB1 expression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or non-COVID-19 in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome patients). Material and methods This study enrolled 43 individuals, including hospitalised patients with i) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 (n = 7) or other underlying causes (n = 12), ii) mild COVID-19 (n = 4) and iii) healthy volunteers (n = 20). Healthy individuals took 50 g of liquorice (containing 3% liquorice root extract) daily for 7 days, while blood samples were collected at baseline and on day 3 and 7. Changes in ACE2 and HMGB1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Additionally, HMGB1 levels were measured in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with mild disease or COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and compared with a non-COVID-19-ARDS group. Results Liquorice intake significantly reduced after 7 days both cellular membranous ACE2 expression (-51% compared to baseline levels, p = 0.008) and plasma HMGB1 levels (-17% compared to baseline levels, p&lt;0.001) in healthy individuals. Half of the individuals had a reduction in ACE2 levels of at least 30%. HMGB1 levels in patients with mild COVID-19 and ARDS patients with and without COVID-19 were significantly higher compared with those of healthy individuals (+317%, p = 0.002), but they were not different between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. Conclusions Liquorice intake modulates ACE2 and HMGB1 levels in healthy individuals. HMGB1 is enhanced in mild COVID-19 and in ARDS with and without COVID-19, warranting evaluation of HMGB1 as a potential treatment target and glycyrrhizin, which is an active component of liquorice root extract, as a potential treatment in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory disease."
https://openalex.org/W4306632271,"Information on the effectiveness of a new long-lasting buprenorphine formulation, extended-release buprenorphine, in the neonatal rat is very limited. This study compares whether a high dose of extended-release buprenorphine (XR-Hi) attenuates thermal hypersensitivity for a longer period than a low dose of extended-release buprenorphine (XR-Lo) in a neonatal rat incisional pain model. Two experiments were performed. Experiment one: Male and female postnatal day-5 rat pups (n = 38) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups and received a subcutaneous administration of one of the following: 1) 0.9%NaCl (Saline), 0.1 mL; 2) sustained release buprenorphine (Bup-SR), 1 mg/kg; 3) XR-Lo, 0.65 mg/kg; and 4) XR-Hi, 1.3 mg/kg. Pups were anesthetized with sevoflurane in 100% O2 and a 5 mm long skin incision was made over the left lateral thigh and underlying muscle dissected. The skin was closed with surgical tissue glue. Thermal hypersensitivity testing (using a laser diode) and clinical observations were conducted 1 hour (h) prior to surgery and subsequently after 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 h of treatment. Experiment two: The plasma buprenorphine concentration level was evaluated at 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72 h on five-day-old rat pups. Plasma buprenorphine concentration for all treatment groups remained above the clinically effective concentration of 1 ng/mL for at least 4 h in the Bup-SR group, 8 h in XR-Lo and 24 h in XR-Hi group with no abnormal clinical observations. This study demonstrates that XR-Hi did not attenuate postoperative thermal hypersensitivity for a longer period than XR-Lo in 5-day-old rats; XR-Hi attenuated postoperative thermal hypersensitivity for up to 4 h while Bup-SR and XR-Lo for at least 8 h in this model."
https://openalex.org/W4306632305,"Neck with shoulder muscle stiffness/pain is a common disorder. Commonly used physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, acupuncture, and moxibustion only temporarily alleviate the disorder in most cases, thus the disorder often recurs. Low power laser therapy is often used for neck and shoulder stiffness/pain and has been effective in clinical trials. In this study, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of a newly developed self-care device for disorders including neck with shoulder muscle stiffness/pain. The device incorporates light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are safer than lasers, as its light source. Ten adults with neck with shoulder muscle stiffness/pain were subject to LED irradiation (wavelength 780 nm ± 15 nm, output 750 mW, power density 3.8 W/cm2, energy density 5.7×102 J/cm2) for 3 minutes on the affected shoulder at a standard acupuncture point (GB21, Jianjing). Immediately after irradiation, the subjective symptoms of the neck with shoulder muscle stiffness and pain evaluated by a visual analog scale were improved from 58.3 mm ± 18.7 mm to 45.5 mm ± 21.5 mm and from 45.8 mm ± 23.3 mm to 39.4 mm ± 21.8 mm, respectively. The symptoms further improved after 15 minutes of irradiation. The skin temperature at the irradiated point increased from 34.3°C ± 1.1°C to 41.0°C ± 0.7°C. The increase in skin temperature was observed within approximately 5 cm of the irradiated area. There was no effect on the heart rate variability, a measure of the autonomic nervous system; however, the baroreflex sensitivity was slightly increased. No irradiation-related adverse skin events were observed. Our LED irradiation device was found to be safe, and it improved the subjective symptoms of muscle stiff neck with shoulders."
https://openalex.org/W4306632340,"The Beta-blockers Or Placebo for Primary Prophylaxis of oesophageal varices (BOPPP) trial is a 3-year phase IV, multi-centre clinical trial of investigational medicinal product (CTIMP) that aims to determine the effectiveness of carvedilol in the prevention of variceal bleeding for small oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. Early engagement of General Practitioners (GPs) in conversations about delivery of a potentially effective secondary care-initiated treatment in primary care provides insights for future implementation. The aim of this study was to understand the implementation of trial findings by exploring i) GP perspectives on factors that influence implementation beyond the context of the trial and ii) how dose titration and ongoing treatment with carvedilol is best delivered in primary care.This qualitative study was embedded within the BOPPP trial and was conducted alongside site opening. GP participants were purposively sampled and recruited from ten Clinical Commissioning Groups in England and three Health Boards across Wales. Semi-structured telephone individual interviews were conducted with GPs (n = 23) working in England and Wales. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.Five overarching themes were identified: i) primary care is best placed for oversight, ii) a shared approach led by secondary care, iii) empower the patient to take responsibility, iv) the need to go above and beyond and v) develop practice guidance. The focus on prevention, attention to holistic care, and existing and often long-standing relationships with patients provides an impetus for GP oversight. GPs spoke about the value of partnership working with secondary care and of prioritising patient-centred care and involving patients in taking responsibility for their own health. An agreed pathway of care, clear communication, and specific, accessible guidance on how to implement the proposed treatment strategy safely and effectively are important determinants in the success of implementation.Our findings for implementing secondary care-initiated treatment in primary care are important to the specifics of the BOPPP trial but can also go some way in informing wider learning for other trials where work is shared across the primary-secondary care interface, and where findings will impact the primary care workload. We propose a systems research perspective for addressing implementation of CTIMP findings at the outset of research. The value of early stakeholder involvement is highlighted, and the need to consider complexity in terms of the interaction between the intervention and the context in which it is implemented is acknowledged.ISRCTN10324656."

Previous data indicated patients with diabetes to have a worse prognosis. This study sought to evaluate safety and efficacy of TEER in patients with diabetes in a real-world cohort.In this monocentric study 340 consecutive patients with severe primary and secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER were included. Immediate results of the procedure, intrahospital and one-year outcome were compared between patients with and without diabetes.Diabetes was present in 109 patients (32%). Patients with diabetes were younger (77 y (71, 81) vs. 79 y (74, 83); p = 0.003), had more often ischemic cardiomyopathy (68% vs. 48%; p<0.001), previous coronary-artery bypass graft (35% vs. 20%; p = 0.002) and arterial hypertension (89% vs. 75%; p<0.001) compared to those without diabetes. Baseline NYHA class, type of MR (primary vs. secondary), left ventricular dimensions and function (ejection fraction: 37% (28, 50) vs. 40% (29, 55); p = 0.10) as well as severity of MR were not different between both groups. Success of the procedure (95% vs. 95%; p = 0.84), intrahospital mortality (5.5% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.98) and one-year follow-up regarding all-cause mortality (24.2% vs. 23.0%; p = 0.72), hospitalization for heart failure (37.4% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.23), NYHA class (p = 0.14) or MR severity (p = 0.59) did not differ between both groups.Our real-world data suggest that TEER seems to be similarly safe and effective in patients with severe MR and diabetes compared to those without diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4306630407,"This study aimed to investigate the patient safety culture in Austria. We identified factors that contributed to a higher degree of patient safety and subsequently developed evidence-based suggestions on how to improve patient safety culture in hospitals. Moreover, we examined differences in the perception of patient safety culture among different professional groups. This study used a cross-sectional design in ten Austrian hospitals (N = 1,525). We analyzed the correlation between ten patient safety culture factors, three background characteristics (descriptive variables), and three outcome variables (patient safety grade, number of adverse events reported, and influence on patient safety). We also conducted an analysis of variance to determine the differences in patient safety culture factors among the various professional groups in hospitals. The findings revealed that all ten factors have considerable potential for improvement. The most highly rated patient safety culture factors were communication openness and supervisor/manager's expectations and actions promoting safety; whereas, the lowest rated factor was non-punitive response to error. A comparison of the various professional groups showed significant differences in the perception of patient safety culture between nurses, doctors, and other groups. Patient safety culture in Austria seems to have considerable potential for improvement, and patient safety culture factors significantly contribute to patient safety. We determined evidence-based practices as recommendations for improving each of the patient safety factors."

In order to perform as required under these conditions (i.e. exhibiting resilient behaviour), it is necessary to know the current position of the organisation with respect to the four resilient potentials i.e. respond, monitor, learn and anticipate. The study aimed to understand and assess resilient performance of an Internal Medicine Department in a public hospital in Denmark using the resilience assessment grid (RAG).A modified Delphi method was used to develop the context specific RAG, using interviews to generate items, two rounds of expert panel reviews and pilot testing the developed RAG questionnaire. The four sets of structured RAG questions were tested and revised until satisfactory face and content validity for application was achieved. The final version of the RAG (28-item Likert scale) questionnaire was sent electronically to 87 healthcare professionals (clinicians and managers) in January 2021 and 2022. The data was statistically analysed and illustrated in radar charts to assist in interpreting the resilience profiles.While the resilience profiles in 2021 and 2022 were similar, the scores in 2022 were slightly lower for some of the sub-indicators. The results indicate areas for improvement, especially related to the Internal Medicine Department's potential to respond and learn. The results from the RAG were presented to the chief clinical consultants and managers to identify initiatives for quality improvement and for planning a new workflow at the Internal Medicine Department.The RAG is a managerial tool to assess the potential resilient performance of the organisation in respect to the four resilience potentials, i.e., responding, monitoring, learning, and anticipating.

The study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of DS use among Bangladeshi university students and its associated factors.A cross-sectional survey of 390 students was conducted from two public universities from Barishal Division in Bangladesh using a structured questionnaire with 72 questions divided into five sections: sociodemographic, knowledge, opinions, and attitudes, types of DS, reasons and sources for using DS, and adverse reactions after taking DS. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were utilized to estimate the results.Among all the students, 15.6% students were using DS where only 7.7% of them used DS according to physicians' recommendation. Additionally, students used DS for general health and well-being, weight gaining and as a source of energy for physical and sporting activities, etc. The use of DS was significantly associated with female sex (AOR = 5.44, 95% CI: 2.18-13.52), ≥25 years age (AOR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.67), underweight (AOR = 5.86, 95% CI: 1.95-17.62), having major illness (AOR = 6.99, 95% CI: 1.98-24.70) and good knowledge of DS (AOR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.23-5.64).This study provides new findings on DS use and its correlates in Bangladeshi students which may be used by the policymakers to improve DS usage among students.

https://openalex.org/W4306630459,"Information is personally useless if its beholder cannot individually benefit from it further unless she shares it with those who can exploit that information to increase their mutual outcome. We study sharing such information anonymously in a non-strategic and non-competitive setting, where selfish and cooperative motives align. Although sharing information was cost-free and resulted in expected mutual payoff, almost all subjects showed some levels of hesitancy toward sharing information, and it was more severe in the introverts. According to our mechanistic model, this irrationality could arise because of the excessive subjective value of personally useless information and low other-regarding motives, that necessitated over-attainable personal benefit to drive sharing. Interestingly, other-regarding element correlated with the subjects’ belief about how others are cooperative in general. In addition, sensitivity to the value of information correlated with their extraversion level. The results open a new window towards understanding inefficient motives that deprive people of collective benefit."

https://openalex.org/W4306630465,"The e-cigarette or vaping product-use-associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic was primarily associated with the use of e-cigarettes containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)- the principal psychoactive substance in cannabis, and vitamin-E-acetate- an additive sometimes used in informally sourced THC-containing e-liquids. EVALI case burden varied across states, but it is unclear whether this was associated with state-level cannabis vaping prevalence. We, therefore, used linear regression models to assess the cross-sectional association between state-level cannabis vaping prevalence (obtained from the 2019 behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) and EVALI case burden (obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) adjusted for state cannabis policies. Cannabis vaping prevalence ranged from 1.14%(95%CI, 0.61%-2.12%) in Wyoming to 3.11%(95%CI, 2.16%-4.44%) in New Hampshire. EVALI cases per million population ranged from 1.90(0.38–3.42) in Oklahoma to 59.10(19.70–96.53) in North Dakota. There was no significant positive association but an inverse association between state cannabis vaping prevalence and EVALI case burden (Coefficient, -18.6; 95%CI, -37.5–0.4; p-value, 0.05). Thus, state-level cannabis vaping prevalence was not positively associated with EVALI prevalence, suggesting that there may not be a simple direct link between state cannabis vaping prevalence and EVALI cases, but rather the relationship is likely more nuanced and possibly reflective of access to informal sources of THC-containing e-cigarettes."

https://openalex.org/W4306630475,"Children living with HIV (CLHIV) have decreased bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), increasing risk for fracture and future osteoporosis. While DXA is the gold-standard for bone assessments, it lacks availability in resource-constrained settings (RCS). Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) offers an alternative owing to its portability, low cost, ease of handling, and lack of ionizing radiation. While QUS has detected reduced bone quality in CLHIV, the relationship between QUS and DXA in this population remains unexplored. At baseline and 12 months, BMC and BMD of the whole body, lumbar spine, and radius were measured by DXA in a longitudinal cohort of CLHIV in Johannesburg, South Africa. Calcaneal speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and radius SOS were obtained by QUS, and calcaneal stiffness index (SI) was calculated. Spearman correlations, with and without HIV stratification, were performed between QUS and DXA measurements at each visit and for absolute difference in measurements between visits. At baseline and 12-months, calcaneal BUA and SI displayed strong positive correlations with DXA, with only modest correlations between radial QUS and DXA at baseline. Longitudinal measures of QUS did not correlate with DXA. At both baseline and 12-months, individuals with DXA whole-body BMD z-score < -1 displayed significantly lower calcaneal BUA and SI. Cross-sectionally, calcaneal QUS correlates strongly with whole body DXA and may represent a viable diagnostic alternative in RCS. Longitudinally, the two methods do not correlate well, possibly reflecting that each method assesses distinct aspects of bone architecture."

Vaccine-induced and post-infection SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses are associated with COVID-19 recovery and protection, but the precise role of T-cell responses remains unclear, and how post-infection vaccination (‘hybrid immunity’) further augments this immunity To accomplish these goals, we studied healthy adult healthcare workers who were (a) uninfected and unvaccinated (n = 12), (b) uninfected and vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine (2 doses n = 177, one dose n = 1) or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine (one dose, n = 1), and (c) previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated (BNT162b2, two doses, n = 6, one dose n = 1; mRNA-1273 two doses, n = 1). Infection status was determined by repeated PCR testing of participants. We used FluoroSpot Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) assays, using subpools of 15-mer peptides covering the S (10 subpools), N (4 subpools) and M (2 subpools) proteins. Responses were expressed as frequencies (percent positive responders) and magnitudes (spot forming cells/10 6 cytokine-producing peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]). Almost all vaccinated participants with no prior infection exhibited IFN-γ, IL-2 and IFN-γ+IL2 responses to S glycoprotein subpools (89%, 93% and 27%, respectively) mainly directed to the S2 subunit and were more robust than responses to the N or M subpools. However, in previously infected and vaccinated participants IFN-γ, IL-2 and IFN-γ+IL2 responses to S subpools (100%, 100%, 88%) were substantially higher than vaccinated participants with no prior infection and were broader and directed against nine of the 10 S glycoprotein subpools spanning the S1 and S2 subunits, and all the N and M subpools. 50% of uninfected and unvaccinated individuals had IFN-γ but not IL2 or IFN-γ+IL2 responses against one S and one M subpools that were not increased after vaccination of uninfected or SARS-CoV-2-infected participants. Summed IFN-γ, IL-2, and IFN-γ+IL2 responses to S correlated with IgG responses to the S glycoprotein. These studies demonstrated that vaccinations with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 results in T cell-specific responses primarily against epitopes in the S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein, and that individuals that are vaccinated after SARS-CoV-2 infection develop broader and greater T cell responses to S1 and S2 subunits as well as the N and M proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4306631533,"Although circumcision is the most commonly performed surgery in males, less is known about the incidence and indications of adult circumcision. In this study, we aim to present the incidence of adult circumcision across the United States.Using IBM MarketScan® Commercial Database from 2015 to 2018, we obtained claims for circumcision in men between 18 and 64 years of age. We calculated the incidence of adult circumcision over the study period and across the United States. We also collected data on indications for surgery using International Classification of Diseases codes.We identified a total of 12,298 claims for adult circumcisions. The mean age was 39 (±12.9) years. The average incidence rates remained relatively constant from 98.1 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 to 98.2 per 100,000 person-years in 2018 (Δ+0.1%). The age-standardized incidence rates varied significantly across the United States (from 0 to 194.8 per 100,000 person-years) with South Dakota having the highest rate. The most common indications for adult circumcision were phimosis (52.5%), routine/ritual circumcision (28.7%), phimosis + balanitis/balanoposthitis (6.8%), balanitis (3.8%) and balanoposthitis (2.6%), and significantly varied by age groups.This study suggested a wide geographic variation in rates of adult circumcision between states with highest incidences in the Northeast United States. Future studies can identify the underlying causes for the observed variations."
https://openalex.org/W4306631563,"CC Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a member of the Superfamily of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), is an important effector in multiple physiopathological processes such as inflammatory and infectious entities, including central nervous system neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, recovery from nervous injuries, and in the HIV-AIDS infective processes. Thus, CCR5 is an attractive target for pharmacological modulation. Since maraviroc was described as a CCR5 ligand that modifies the HIV-AIDS progression, multiple efforts have been developed to describe the functionality of the receptor. In this work, we characterized key structural features of the CCR5 receptor employing extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) in its apo form and in complex with an endogenous agonist, the chemokine CCL5/RANTES, an HIV entry inhibitor, the partial inverse agonist maraviroc, and the experimental antagonists Compound 21 and 34, aiming to elucidate the structural features and mechanistic processes that constitute its functional states, contributing with structural details and a general understanding of this relevant system."
https://openalex.org/W4306632282,"In innovation strategy, a type of Schumpeterian competitive strategy in business administration, ""intra-individual diversity"" has attracted attention as one factor for creating innovation. In this study, we redefine ""framework for identifying researchers' areas of expertise"" as ""a framework for quantifying intra-individual diversity among researchers. Note that diversity here refers to authorship of articles in multiple research fields. The application of this framework then made it possible to visualize organizational diversity by accumulating the intra-individual diversity of researchers and to discuss the innovation strategy of the organization. The analysis in this study discusses how countries are promoting research on the topics of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which are at the core of Industry 4.0, from an innovation perspective. Note that Industry 4.0 is a technological framework that aims to ""improve the efficiency of all social systems,"" ""create new industries,"" and ""increase intellectual productivity."" For the analysis, we used 19-year bibliographic data (2000-2018) from the top 20 countries in terms of the number of papers in AI, big data, and IoT technologies. As the results, this study classified the styles of cross-disciplinary fusion into four patterns in AI and three patterns in big data. This study did not consider the results in IoT because of only small differences between countries. Furthermore, regional differences in the style of cross-disciplinary fusion were also observed, and the global innovation patterns in Industry 4.0 were classified into seven categories. In Europe and North America, the cross-disciplinary integration style was similar to that between the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, England, Italy, Canada, and France. In Asia, the cross-disciplinary fusion style was similar between China, Japan, and South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W4306632303,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe lung disease with a poor prognosis and few treatment options. In the most widely used experimental model for this disease, bleomycin is administered into the lungs of mice, causing a reaction of inflammation and consequent fibrosis that resembles the progression of human IPF. The inflammation and fibrosis together induce changes in gene expression that can be analyzed with reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), in which accurate normalization with a set of stably expressed reference genes is critical for obtaining reliable results. This work compares ten commonly used candidate reference genes in the late, fibrotic phase of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and ranks them from the most to the least stable using NormFinder and geNorm. Sdha , Polr2a and Hprt were identified as the best performing and least variable reference genes when alternating between normal and fibrotic conditions. In order to validate the findings, we investigated the expression of Tnf and Col1a1 , representing the hallmarks of inflammation and fibrotic changes, respectively. With the best three genes as references, both were found to be upregulated relative to untreated controls, unlike the situation when analyzed solely with Gapdh , a commonly used reference gene. We therefore recommend Sdha , Polr2a and Hprt as reference genes for RT-qPCR in the 4-week bleomycin challenge that represents the late fibrotic phase."
https://openalex.org/W4306632306,"Working time outside routine daily working hours is known as shift working. Studies have shown adverse effects of shift working such as stress, obesity, and diabetes on the workers’ health. The aim of the present study was to compare aspects of oral health in shift workers and non-shift workers of a cement factory in Shahroud, Iran. Study population comprised of 180 male workers of the factory in the year 2015. Convenience sampling was continued until recruiting 180 subjects of shift- and non-shift workers. Data collection included oral health questionnaire, health and safety executive (HSE) questionnaire, and clinical oral examination. The Chi-square test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and generalized Poisson model were employed for statistical evaluation. Mean age of the workers was 39.19 (±9.48); 53% had educational level of less than diploma. Their mean DMFT was 12.89 (±5.75) which correlated with number of years in shift work schedule (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.41; p&lt;0.001) but not correlated with job stress (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.11; p = 0.12). Mean number of deep periodontal pockets among the workers was 5.03 (±1.84) that showed correlation with number of years in shift work schedule (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.33; p&lt;0.001) but no correlation with job stress (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.03; p = 0.68). Adherence to various oral health behaviors was reported by less than half of the workers. Positive correlation of dental caries and periodontal diseases with shift working partly signals negative impact of working conditions on oral health among this group of workers which calls for modifications in their working environment to facilitate health practices."
https://openalex.org/W4306632357,"Muscle weakness can lead to reduced physical function and quality of life. Computed tomography (CT) can be used to assess muscle health through measures of muscle cross-sectional area and density loss associated with fat infiltration. However, there are limited opportunities to measure muscle density in clinically acquired CT scans because a density calibration phantom, allowing for the conversion of CT Hounsfield units into density, is typically not included within the field-of-view. For bone density analysis, internal density calibration methods use regions of interest within the scan field-of-view to derive the relationship between Hounsfield units and bone density, but these methods have yet to be adapted for muscle density analysis. The objective of this study was to design and validate a CT internal calibration method for muscle density analysis.We CT scanned 10 bovine muscle samples using two scan protocols and five scan positions within the scanner bore. The scans were calibrated using internal calibration and a reference phantom. We tested combinations of internal calibration regions of interest (e.g., air, blood, bone, muscle, adipose).We found that the internal calibration method using two regions of interest, air and adipose or blood, yielded accurate muscle density values (< 1% error) when compared with the reference phantom. The muscle density values derived from the internal and reference phantom calibration methods were highly correlated (R2 > 0.99). The coefficient of variation for muscle density across two scan protocols and five scan positions was significantly lower for internal calibration (mean = 0.33%) than for Hounsfield units (mean = 6.52%). There was no difference between coefficient of variation for the internal calibration and reference phantom methods.We have developed an internal calibration method to produce accurate and reliable muscle density measures from opportunistic computed tomography images without the need for calibration phantoms."
https://openalex.org/W4306667498,"A 3-months old Chinese shar-pei puppy with ichthyosis was investigated. The dog showed generalized scaling, alopecia and footpad lesions. Histopathological examinations demonstrated a non-epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. The parents of the affected puppy did not show any skin lesions. A trio whole genome sequencing analysis identified a heterozygous de novo 3 bp deletion in the KRT1 gene in the affected dog. This variant, NM_001003392.1:c.567_569del, is predicted to delete a single asparagine from the conserved coil 1A motif within the rod domain of KRT1, NP_001003392.1:p.(Asn190del). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated normal levels of KRT1 expression in the epidermis and follicular epithelia. This might indicate that the variant possibly interferes with keratin dimerization or another function of KRT1. Missense variants affecting the homologous asparagine residue of the human KRT1 cause epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Histologically, the investigated Chinese shar-pei showed a non-epidermolytic ichthyosis. The finding of a de novo variant in an excellent functional candidate gene strongly suggests that KRT1:p.Asn190del caused the ichthyosis phenotype in the affected Chinese shar-pei. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a KRT1 -related non-epidermolytic ichthyosis in domestic animals."
https://openalex.org/W4306667894,"With the advancement of urbanization and the expansion of urban areas, NIMBY (not in my back yard) environmental public facilities are increasing day by day. It is meaningful to incorporate public participation into the regulatory process for the existing pollution NIMBY facility enterprises. Through the establishment of the tripartite game model of local government, polluting NIMBY facility enterprises and the public, the evolution stability analysis and simulation analysis of their strategies are carried out, and the Pareto optimal solution is obtained. The results show that: The strategy choices of the players of the three-party game are different under different stability conditions. The system can be broken out of the bad state by increasing government punishment, local governments strictly controlling the potential profits, the potential losses of polluting enterprises not rebuilding, the long-term public benefits and reducing the cost of public participation, etc., and the three-party common governance mode can be formed. The strategy evolution speed of a player in a three-party game is affected by his own strategy choice proportion and the strategy choice proportion of the other two players, but no matter how the strategy choice proportion of the player in a three-party game changes, it will not change the final game result. On the basis of comprehensive analysis, a series of relevant suggestions are put forward from the three aspects of government, enterprises and the public, so as to provide certain reference for the design of the public participation system of polluting NIMBY facilities."
