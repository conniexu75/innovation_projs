https://openalex.org/W3212709196,"Background Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy is a barrier to achieving herd immunity, and thus, a prominent public health concern. This study aimed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy based on the World Health Organization’s ‘3Cs’ model (i.e., confidence, complacency, and convenience) in the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Methods Data from 7678 adults ages 18 or older were collected from the four most populous U.S. States, specifically New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and from English-speaking Canada at three timepoints, in May and July 2020, and March 2021 using a web-based survey ( www.covid19-database.com ). Sociodemographic information was collected, and comprehensive psychological assessments were administered. Univariate analyses were performed to identify the individual determinants of vaccine hesitancy, which were categorized as: 1) vaccine confidence, 2) vaccine complacency, 3) sociodemographic, and 4) other psychological factors. A series of models were computed using these categorizations. Results Mistrust of vaccine benefit (β(SE) = 0.67(0.01), p&lt;0.001, partial η 2 = 0.26) and lower perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (β(SE) = 0.68(0.02), p&lt;0.001, partial η 2 = 0.12) were the principal determinants of vaccine hesitancy. Right-wing political affiliation (β(SE) = 0.32(0.02), p&lt;0.001, partial η 2 = 0.03), higher risk propensity (β(SE) = 0.24(0.02), p&lt;0.001, partial η 2 = 0.03), and less negative mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (β(SE) = 0.20(0.01), p&lt;0.001, partial η 2 = 0.03) were the main sociodemographic and psychological determinants. Other sociodemographic determinants included younger age, women, race, and employment status. Lack of vaccine confidence and complacency explained 38% and 21% of the variance in vaccine hesitancy, respectively; whereas, sociodemographic and psychological determinants explained 13% and 11% of the variance in vaccine hesitancy, respectively. Discussion Targeted and tailored public health interventions that enhance the public’s confidence in vaccines and emphasize the risk and seriousness of COVID-19 may address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Efforts directed toward specific marginalized and underserved groups may be required to promote vaccine confidence."

We determined if HZ vaccination, compared to no HZ vaccination, is associated with lower risk for incident dementia.Data was obtained from Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) medical records (10/1/2008-9/30/2019) with replication in MarketScan® commercial and Medicare claims (1/1/2009-12/31/2018). Eligible patients were ≥65 years of age and free of dementia for two years prior to baseline (VHA n = 136,016; MarketScan n = 172,790). Two index periods (either start of 2011 or 2012) were defined, where patients either had or did not have a HZ vaccination. Confounding was controlled with propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Competing risk (VHA) and Cox proportional hazard (MarketScan) models estimated the association between HZ vaccination and incident dementia in all patients and in age (65-69, 70-74, ≥75) and race (White, Black, Other) sub-groups. Sensitivity analysis measured the association between HZ vaccination and incident Alzheimer's dementia (AD). HZ vaccination at index versus no HZ vaccination throughout follow-up. VHA patients mean age was 75.7 (SD±7.4) years, 4.0% were female, 91.2% white and 20.2% had HZ vaccination. MarketScan patients mean age was 69.9 (SD±5.7) years, 65.0% were female and 14.2% had HZ vaccination. In both cohorts, HZ vaccination compared with no vaccination, was significantly associated with lower dementia risk (VHA HR = 0.69; 95%CI: 0.67-0.72; MarketScan HR = 0.65; 95%CI:0.57-0.74). HZ vaccination was not related to dementia risk in MarketScan patients aged 65-69 years. No difference in HZ vaccination to dementia effects were found by race. HZ vaccination was associated with lower risk for AD.HZ vaccination is associated with reduced risk of dementia. Vaccination may provide nonspecific neuroprotection by training the immune system to limit damaging inflammation, or specific neuroprotection that prevents viral cytopathic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3212704378,"The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and since then has caused unprecedented economic and social disruption as well as presenting a major challenge to public health. Despite mass progress in COVID-19 vaccination uptake, vaccine hesitancy or anti-vax information has been reported that can delay public acceptance of a vaccine. An online cross-sectional survey (n = 439) assessed COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy in adults in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Participants completed an adapted version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour Vaccine Questionnaire, the Vaccine Attitudes Scale (VAX), Vaccine Confidence Scale, and questions on previous experience of COVID-19. Results showed that 66.7% of the sample intended to get a vaccination as soon as possible, 27.15% reported they will get a vaccine when others get theirs and when it is clear there are no side effects. 6.15% had no intention of getting a vaccine. Overall, there is a high mean intention (M = 6.12) and confidence to get a COVID-19 vaccine. There was low vaccine hesitancy (M = 2.49) as measured by the VAX scale. A further analysis of the sub factors of the VAX showed there is uncertainty and mistrust of side effects for children. The finding demonstrate that the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be useful in making recommendations for public health considerations when encouraging vaccine uptake and reducing vaccine hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W3214400387,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created urgent demand for timely data, leading to a surge in mobile phone surveys for tracking the impacts of and responses to the pandemic. Using data from national phone surveys implemented in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda during the pandemic and the pre-COVID-19 national face-to-face surveys that served as the sampling frames for the phone surveys, this paper documents selection the biases in individual-level analyses based on phone survey data. In most cases, individual-level data are available only for phone survey respondents, who we find are more likely to be household heads or their spouses and non-farm enterprise owners, and on average, are older and better educated vis-a-vis the general adult population. These differences are the result of uneven access to mobile phones in the population and the way that phone survey respondents are selected. To improve the representativeness of individual-level analysis using phone survey data, we recalibrate the phone survey sampling weights based on propensity score adjustments that are derived from a model of an individual's likelihood of being interviewed as a function of individual- and household-level attributes. We find that reweighting improves the representativeness of the estimates for phone survey respondents, moving them closer to those of the general adult population. This holds for both women and men and for a range of demographic, education, and labor market outcomes. However, reweighting increases the variance of the estimates and, in most cases, fails to overcome selection biases. This indicates limitations to deriving representative individual-level estimates from phone survey data. Obtaining reliable data on men and women through future phone surveys will require random selection of adult interviewees within sampled households."
https://openalex.org/W3212873788,"The quality of evidence about the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical health interventions is often low, but little is known about the effects of communicating indications of evidence quality to the public.In two blinded, randomised, controlled, online experiments, US participants (total n = 2140) were shown one of several versions of an infographic illustrating the effectiveness of eye protection in reducing COVID-19 transmission. Their trust in the information, understanding, feelings of effectiveness of eye protection, and the likelihood of them adopting it were measured.Compared to those given no quality cues, participants who were told the quality of the evidence on eye protection was 'low', rated the evidence less trustworthy (p = .001, d = 0.25), and rated it as subjectively less effective (p = .018, d = 0.19). The same effects emerged compared to those who were told the quality of the evidence was 'high', and in one of the two studies, those shown 'low' quality of evidence said they were less likely to use eye protection (p = .005, d = 0.18). Participants who were told the quality of the evidence was 'high' showed no statistically significant differences on these measures compared to those given no information about evidence quality.Without quality of evidence cues, participants responded to the evidence about the public health intervention as if it was high quality and this affected their subjective perceptions of its efficacy and trust in the provided information. This raises the ethical dilemma of weighing the importance of transparently stating when the evidence base is actually low quality against evidence that providing such information can decrease trust, perception of intervention efficacy, and likelihood of adopting it."

We provide a deep understanding of how the adoption of this technology could lead to changes in Europe over multiple dimensions, ranging from business to culture and society, policy and regulation, economy, and technology. From the projections that reached a significant consensus and were given a high probability of occurrence by the experts, we derive four scenarios built around two main dimensions: the digitization of assets and the change in business models."
https://openalex.org/W3212337623,"Countries in the world have various indices for the implementation of economic globalization (EG). This refers to positive and negative impacts arising from its implementation, especially in agriculture. This sector is still a basic source of existence in developing countries. At the same time, these countries have been unable to optimize their agricultural value-added (AVA) and only earn a low level of income. That way, developing countries need to take advantage of EG to increase income from agricultural exports and farmers' welfare. Other than that, there has been no study examining the impacts of EG on AVA in developing countries. So, this study intends to evaluate the impacts of the exchange rates, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, total agricultural export values, agricultural import duties, and fertilizer imports on AVA in developing countries. The panel data technique is used to assess its impact in 17 developing countries during 2006-2018. The study showed that FDI inflows and agricultural export values increase AVA in developing countries. In this study, EG positively impacts developing countries, but its implementation must pay attention to achieve sustainable development goals. We recommend developing countries focus on investments in human capital and technologies (or R&D), ensure foreign investors collaborate with local agricultural firms, increase agricultural exports, and create a conducive economic system."
https://openalex.org/W3214203126,"Fireflies are a family of charismatic beetles known for their bioluminescent signals. Recent anecdotal reports suggest that firefly populations in North America may be in decline. However, prior to this work, no studies have undertaken a systematic compilation of geographic distribution, habitat specificity, and threats facing North American fireflies. To better understand their extinction risks, we conducted baseline assessments according to the categories and criteria of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List for 132 species from the United States and Canada (approximately 79% of described species in the region). We found at least 18 species (14%) are threatened with extinction (e.g. categorized as Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) due to various pressures, including habitat loss, light pollution, and climate change (sea level rise and drought). In addition, more than half of the species (53%) could not be evaluated against the assessment criteria due to insufficient data, highlighting the need for further study. Future research and conservation efforts should prioritize monitoring and protecting populations of at-risk species, preserving and restoring habitat, gathering data on population trends, and filling critical information gaps for data deficient species suspected to be at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3212542992,"Profiling the genetic composition and relationships among groundnut germplasm collections is essential for the breeding of new cultivars. The objectives of this study were to assess the genetic diversity and population structure among 100 improved groundnut genotypes using agronomic traits and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The genotypes were evaluated for agronomic traits and drought tolerance at the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)/India across two seasons. Ninety-nine of the test genotypes were profiled with 16363 SNP markers. Pod yield per plant (PY), seed yield per plant (SY), and harvest index (HI) were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by genotype × environment interaction effects. Genotypes ICGV 07222, ICGV 06040, ICGV 01260, ICGV 15083, ICGV 10143, ICGV 03042, ICGV 06039, ICGV 14001, ICGV 11380, and ICGV 13200 ranked top in terms of pod yield under both drought-stressed and optimum conditions. PY exhibited a significant (p ≤ 0.05) correlation with SY, HI, and total biomass (TBM) under both test conditions. Based on the principal component (PC) analysis, PY, SY, HSW, shelling percentage (SHP), and HI were allocated in PC 1 and contributed to the maximum variability for yield under the two water regimes. Hence, selecting these traits could be successful for screening groundnut genotypes under drought-stressed and optimum conditions. The model-based population structure analysis grouped the studied genotypes into three sub-populations. Dendrogram for phenotypic and genotypic also grouped the studied 99 genotypes into three heterogeneous clusters. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that 98% of the total genetic variation was attributed to individuals, while only 2% of the total variance was due to variation among the subspecies. The genetic distance between the Spanish bunch and Virginia bunch types ranged from 0.11 to 0.52. The genotypes ICGV 13189, ICGV 95111, ICGV 14421, and ICGV 171007 were selected for further breeding based on their wide genetic divergence. Data presented in this study will guide groundnut cultivar development emphasizing economic traits and adaptation to water-limited agro-ecologies, including in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3213236703,"Body cooling is recommended for patients with heat stroke and heat exhaustion. However, differences in the outcomes of patients who do or do not receive active cooling therapy have not been determined. The best available evidence supporting active cooling is based on a case series without comparison groups; thus, the effectiveness of this method in improving patient prognoses cannot be appropriately quantified. Therefore, we compared the outcomes of heat stroke patients receiving active cooling with those of patients receiving rehydration-only therapy. This prospective observational multicenter registry-based study of heat stroke and heat exhaustion patients was conducted in Japan from 2010 to 2019. The patients were stratified into the “severe” group or the “mild-to-moderate” group, per clinical findings on admission. After conducting multivariate logistic regression analyses, we compared the prognoses between patients who received “active cooling + rehydration” and patients who received “rehydration only,” with in-hospital death as the endpoint. Sex, age, onset situation (i.e., exertional or non-exertional), core body temperature, liver damage, renal dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were considered potential covariates. Among those who received active cooling and rehydration-only therapy, the in-hospital mortality rates were 21.5% and 35.5%, respectively, for severe patients (n = 231) and 3.9% and 5.7%, respectively, for mild-to-moderate patients (n = 578). Rehydration-only therapy was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality in patients with severe heat illness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–8.90), whereas the cooling methods were not associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate heat illness (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 0.92–5.84). Active cooling was associated with lower in-hospital mortality only in the severe group. Our results indicated that active cooling should be recommended as an adjunct to rehydration-only therapy for patients with severe heat illness."

When considered by COVID-19 disease severity, there was a trend toward increased prevalence of AT1R-Ab (55% vs. 31%, p = 0.07), as well as significantly higher AT1R-Ab levels (median 10.7 vs. 5.9 U/mL, p = 0.03) amongst individuals with mild COVID-19 versus matched controls. In contrast, the prevalence (42% vs. 37%, p = 0.9) and level (both medians 6.7 U/mL, p = 0.9) of AT1R-Ab amongst those with severe COVID-19 did not differ from matched controls.These findings support an association between COVID-19 and AT1R-Ab, emphasizing that vascular pathology may be present in individuals with mild COVID-19 as well as those with severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W3163837537,"The rise in digital media consumption, especially among children, raises the societal question of its impact on cognition, mental health and academic achievement. Here, we investigate three different ways of measuring technology use-—total hours of media consumed, hours of video game play and number of media used concurrently—-in 118 eight-to-twelve year-old children. At stake is the question of whether different technology uses have different effects, which could explain some of the past mixed findings. We collected data about children’s media uses as well as (i) attentional and behavioral control abilities, (ii) psychological distress, psychosocial functioning, and sleep, and (iii) academic achievement and motivation. While attentional control abilities were assessed using both cognitive tests and questionnaires, mental health and sleep were all questionnaire-based. Finally, academic performance was based on self-reported grades, with motivational variables being measured through the grit and the growth-mindset questionnaires. We present partial correlation analyses and construct a psychological network to assess the structural associations between different forms of media consumption and the three categories of measures. We observe that children consume large amounts of media and media multitask substantially. Partial correlation analyses show that media multitasking specifically was mostly correlated with negative mental health, while playing video games was associated with faster responding and better mental health. No significant partial correlations were observed for total hours on media. Psychological network analysis complement these first results by indicating that all three ways of consuming technology are only indirectly related to self-reported grades. Thus, technology uses appear to only indirectly relate to academic performance, while more directly affecting mental health. This work emphasizes the need to differentiate among technology uses if one is to understand how every day digital consumption impacts human behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3212609515,"Epidemiologists report a 56% increased risk of veterans with (+) mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) developing Parkinson's disease (PD) within 12-years post-injury. The most relevant contributors to this high risk of PD in veterans (+) mTBI is unknown. As cognitive problems often precede PD diagnosis, identifying specific domains most involved with mTBI-related PD onset is critical.To discern which cognitive domains underlie the mTBI-PD risk relationship proposed in epidemiology studies.This exploratory match-controlled, cross-sectional study was conducted in a medical school laboratory from 2017-2020.Age- and IQ-matched veterans with (+) and without mTBI, non-veteran healthy controls, and IQ-matched non-demented early-stage PD were compared. Chronic neurological, unremitted/debilitating diseases, disorders, dementia, and substance use among others were excluded.Veterans were or were not exposed to non-penetrating combat-related mTBI occurring within the past 7-years. No other groups had recent military service or mTBI.Cognitive flexibility, attention, memory, visuospatial ability, and verbal fluency were examined with well-known standardized neuropsychological assessments.Out of 200 volunteers, 114 provided evaluable data. Groups significantly differed on cognitive tests [F (21,299) = 3.09, p<0.0001]. Post hoc tests showed veterans (+) mTBI performed significantly worse than matched-control groups on four out of eight cognitive tests (range: p = .009 to .049), and more often than not performed comparably to early-stage PD (range: p = .749 to .140).We found subtle, premature cognitive decline occurring in very specific cognitive domains in veterans (+) mTBI that would typically be overlooked in a clinic setting, This result potentially puts them at-risk for continual cognitive decline that may portend to the eventual onset of PD or some other neurodegenerative disease."

The primary outcome was all-cause death.Within 6 months after AMI, the adjusted mortality risk was not significantly different between NSTEMI patients and STEMI patients (HR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.67-1.03, P = 0.09). Regarding the causes of death within 6 months after AMI, mechanical complications more frequently occurred in STEMI patients than in NSTEMI patients, while proportions of post resuscitation status on arrival and heart failure were higher in in NSTEMI patients than in STEMI patients. Beyond 6 months after AMI, the adjusted mortality risk of NSTEMI relative to STEMI was not significantly different. (HR: 1.04, 95%CI: 0.90-1.20, P = 0.59). Regarding causes of death beyond 6 months after AMI, almost half of deaths were cardiovascular causes in both groups, and breakdown of causes of death was similar between NSTEMI and STEMI.The mortality risk within and beyond 6 months after AMI were not significantly different between STEMI patients and NSTEMI patients after adjusting confounders.

https://openalex.org/W3213105623,"Maternal depression is a risk factor for depression in children, though the influence of paternal depression has been less well examined. We examined the association between maternal and paternal depression, and the timing of their depression (before or after the child's birth) and outcomes for the child including incidence of child depression and poor educational attainment.A linked routine data cohort study linking General Practitioner(GP), hospital and education records of young people (aged 0 to 30 years) in Wales. Parental and child diagnosis of depression was identified from GP data. Regression analysis examined the association of maternal and paternal depression with time to diagnosis of depression in the child and odds of attaining educational milestones.In adjusted models, the relative risk of offspring developing depression was 1.22 if the mother had depression before the child was born, 1.55 if the mother had depression after the child was born and 1.73 if she had depression both before and after the child was born (chronic depression), compared to those were there was no maternal depression history. For achieving milestones at end of primary school, odds were 0.92, 0.88 and 0.79 respectively. Association of depression in the child was similar if the male living in the household had depression with risk ratios of 1.24 (before), 1.43 (after) and 1.27 (before and after) for child diagnosed depression and 0.85, 0.79 and 0.74 for achieving age 11 milestones.Children who live with a parent who has depression are more likely to develop depression and not achieve educational milestones, compared to children who live with a parent who has a history of depression (but no active depression in child's lifetime) and compared to those with no depression. This finding suggests that working closely with families where depression (particularly chronic depression) is present in either parent and treating parental depression to remission is likely to have long-term benefits for children's mental health and educational attainment."

We compared the effects of one-off 5:2 instructions with the effects of one-off standard multicomponent weight-management advice; and also examined whether additional behavioural support enhances 5:2 adherence and efficacy compared to one-off instructions.Three hundred adults with obesity were randomised to receive a Standard Brief Advice (SBA) covering diet and physical activity (N = 100); 5:2 self-help instructions (5:2SH) (N = 100); or 5:2SH plus six once-weekly group support sessions (N = 100). Participants were followed up for one year.Adherence to 5:2SH was initially high (74% at 6 weeks), but it declined over time (31% at 6 months and 22% at one year). 5:2SH and SBA achieved similar weight-loss at six months (-1.8kg (SD = 3.5) vs -1.7kg (SD = 4.4); b = 0.23, 95%CI:-0.79-1.27, p = 0.7) and at one year (-1.9kg (SD = 4.9) vs -1.8kg (SD = 5.7), b = 0.20, 95%CI:-1.21-1.60, p = 0.79), with 18% vs 15% participants losing ≥5% of their body weight with 5:2SH and SBA, respectively at one year (RR = 0.83, 95%CI:0.44-1.54, p = 0.55). Both interventions received positive ratings, but 5:2SH ratings were significantly higher. 5:2SH had no negative effect on fat and fiber intake and physical activity compared to SBA. Compared to 5:2SH, 5:2G generated a greater weight loss at 6 weeks (-2.3kg vs -1.5kg; b = 0.74, 95%CI:1.37-0.11, p = 0.02), but by one year, the difference was no longer significant (-2.6kg vs -1.9kg, p = 0.37; ≥5% body weight loss 28% vs 18%, p = 0.10).Simple 5:2 advice and multicomponent weight management advice generated similar modest results. The 5:2 diet did not undermine other health behaviours, and it received more favourable ratings. Adding initial group support enhanced 5:2 adherence and effects, but the impact diminished over time. Health professionals who provide brief weight management advice may consider including the 5:2 advice as an option.ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN79408248)."
https://openalex.org/W3213635691,"Despite Rwanda's progress toward HIV epidemic control, 16.2% of HIV-positive individuals are unaware of their HIV positive status. Tailoring the public health strategy could help reach these individuals with new HIV infection and achieve epidemic control. Recency testing is primarily for surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation but it's not for diagnostic purposes. However, it's important to know what proportion of the newly diagnosed are recent infections so that HIV prevention can be tailored to the profile of people who are recently infected. We therefore used available national data to characterize individuals with recent HIV infection in Rwanda to inform the epidemic response.We included all national-level data for recency testing reported from October 2018 to June 2020. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥15 years) who had a new HIV diagnosis, who self-reported being antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve, and who had consented to recency testing. Numbers and proportions of recent HIV infections were estimated, and precision around these estimates was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with being recently (within 12 months) infected with HIV.Of 7,785 eligible individuals with a new HIV-positive diagnosis, 475 (6.1%) met the criteria for RITA recent infection. The proportion of RITA recent infections among individuals with newly identified HIV was high among those aged 15-24 years (9.6%) and in men aged ≥65 years (10.3%) compared to other age groups; and were higher among women (6.7%) than men (5.1%). Of all recent cases, 68.8% were women, and 72.2% were aged 15-34 years. The Northern province had the fewest individuals with newly diagnosed HIV but had the highest proportion of recent infections (10.0%) compared to other provinces. Recent infections decreased by 19.6% per unit change in time (measured in months). Patients aged ≥25 years were less likely to have recent infection than those aged 15-24 years with those aged 35-49 years being the least likely to have recent infection compared to those aged 15-24 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.415 [95% CI: 0.316-0.544]).Public health surveillance targeting the areas and the identified groups with high risk of recent infection could help improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3212840936,"Fusel alcohols (FAs) are a type of flavor compound found in rice wine. An overly high FA content not only leads to spicy, bitter, and astringent taste but also has side effects. Therefore, screening for yeast that produce low FA contents has attracted much attention. Thirty-two yeast strains were isolated from fermenting material during Luzhou-flavor liquor production in this study. Strain YB-12 was selected as a suitable candidate for rice wine production. The strain was identified as a member of the genus Meyerozyma based on phylogenetic analysis using 26S rDNA gene sequences. The ability of strain YB-12 to produce ethanol was similar to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRRL Y-567, while isobutanol and isoamyl alcohol production was only 53.96% and 50.23%, respectively, of that of NRRL Y-567. The FA yield of rice wine produced with strain YB-12 was reduced to 51.85% in a 20 L fermenter. These results demonstrate that strain YB-12 presents promising characteristics for use in the production of rice wine with a potentially low content of FAs."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-intestinal symptoms of celiac patients, especially migraine, and compare it with healthy individuals.We compared 1000 celiac subjects (CS) registered at our celiac center with the control group for headache-based on International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition criteria and their GI symptoms. Besides, CS with migraine and non-migrainous headache were compared in terms of GI symptoms and accompanied conditions.Headache was more common in CS than controls (34% vs 27% respectively, P value<0.001) and more prevalent in females (71.9% in females vs 28% in males, P value = 0.004). Moreover, the prevalence of migraine in CS was higher than controls (20.7 vs 11.9% respectively, P value<0.001). Furthermore, migraine was more prevalent in females with CD (80% in females vs 19% in males, P value = 0.033), and often without aura (76%). Abdominal pain (76.9%, P value = 0.025), diarrhea (54.9%, P value = 0.002), and constipation (42.9%, P value = 0.011) were the most common GI symptoms in CS with headache and more prevalent in CS with migraine. Conversely, type 1 diabetes mellitus was less common in CS with migraine than in CS with non-migrainous headache. (P value = 0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, female sex (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.22-1.83, P value < 0.001), and CD (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.12-1.65, P value = 0.002) were independent predictors of headache, whereas age more than 60 years (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.50-0.97, P value = 0.032) had a protective effect.Headache especially migraine is more prevalent in CS than healthy controls. In addition, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation are more common in CS with migraine than in CS with non-migrainous headaches. Therefore, evaluation of CD in patients with migraine and these simultaneous GI symptoms seems reasonable."
https://openalex.org/W3214118694,"When meteorological conditions deviate from the optimal range for human well-being, the risks of illness, injury, and death increase, and such impacts are feared in particular with more frequent and intense extreme weather conditions resulting from climate change. Thermal indices, such as the universal thermal climate index (UTCI), can better assess human weather-related stresses by integrating multiple weather components. This paper quantifies and compares the seasonal and spatial association of UTCI with mortality, morbidity, and road accidents in the federal state of Bavaria, Germany. Linear regression was applied to seasonally associate daily 56 million hospital admissions and 2.5 million death counts (1995-2015) as well as approximately 930,000 road accidents and 1.7 million people injured (2002-2015) with spatially interpolated same day- and lagged- (up to 14 days) average UTCI values. Additional linear regressions were performed stratifying by age, gender, region, and district. UTCI effects were clear in all three health outcomes studied: Increased UTCI resulted in immediate (1-2 days) rises in morbidity and even more strongly in mortality in summer, and lagged (up to 14 days) decreases in fall, winter, and spring. The strongest UTCI effects were found for road accidents where increasing UTCI led to immediate decreases in daily road accidents in winter but pronounced increases in all other seasons. Differences in UTCI effects were observed e.g. between in warmer north-western regions (Franconia, more districts with heat stress-related mortality, but hospital admissions for lung, heart and external reasons decreasing with summer heat stress), the touristic alpine regions in the south (immediate effect of increasing UTCI on road accidents in summer), and the colder south-eastern regions (increasing hospital admissions for lung, heart and external reasons in winter with UTCI). Districts with high percentages of elderly suffered from higher morbidity and mortality, particularly in winter. The influences of UTCI as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of this influence call for improved infrastructure planning and resource allocation in the health sector."
https://openalex.org/W3211734786,"Virgin female moths are known to release sex pheromones to attract conspecific males. Accurate sex pheromones are required for their chemical communication. Sex pheromones of Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect, contain unsaturated fatty acid derivatives having a double bond at the 12th carbon position. A desaturase of S. exigua (SexiDES5) was proposed to have dual functions by forming double bonds at the 11th and 12th carbons to synthesize Z9,E12-tetradecedienoic acid, which could be acetylated to be a main sex pheromone component Z9,E12-tetradecenoic acetate (Z9E12-14:Ac). A deletion of SexiDES5 using CRISPR/Cas9 was generated and inbred to obtain homozygotes. Mutant females could not produce Z9E12-14:Ac along with Z9-14:Ac and Z11-14:Ac. Subsequently, pheromone extract of mutant females did not induce a sensory signal in male antennae. They failed to induce male mating behavior including hair pencil erection and orientation. In the field, these mutant females did not attract any males while control females attracted males. These results indicate that SexiDES5 can catalyze the desaturation at the 11th and 12th positions to produce sex pheromone components in S. exigua. This study also suggests an application of the genome editing technology to insect pest control by generating non-attractive female moths."
https://openalex.org/W3212125526,"The population of humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) wintering off eastern South America was exploited by commercial whaling almost to the point of extinction in the mid-twentieth century. Since cessation of whaling in the 1970s it is recovering, but the timing and level of recovery is uncertain. We implemented a Bayesian population dynamics model describing the population’s trajectory from 1901 and projecting it to 2040 to revise a previous population status assessment that used Sampling-Importance-Resampling in a Bayesian framework. Using our alternative method for model fitting (Markov chain Monte Carlo), which is more widely accessible to ecologists, we replicate a “base case scenario” to verify the effect on model results, and introduce additional data to update the status assessment. Our approach allowed us to widen the previous informative prior on carrying capacity to better reflect scientific uncertainty around historical population levels. The updated model provided more precise estimates for population sizes over the period considered (1901–2040) and suggests that carrying capacity ( K : median 22,882, mean 22,948, 95% credible interval [CI] 22,711–23,545) and minimum population size ( N 1958 : median 305, mean 319, 95% CI 271–444) might be lower than previously estimated ( K : median 24,558, mean 25,110, 95% CI 22,791–31,118; N 1958 : median 503, mean 850, 95% CI 159–3,943). However, posterior 95% credible intervals of parameters in the updated model overlap those of the previous study. Our approach provides an accessible framework for investigating the status of depleted animal populations for which information is available on historical mortality (e.g., catches) and intermittent estimates of population size and/or trend."
https://openalex.org/W3212208614,"Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by malfunction of immune-regulatory mechanisms with disturbed intestinal mucosal homeostasis and increased activation of mucosal immune cells, leading to abnormal secretion of numerous pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. MCP2/CCL8 is produced by intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages, and is a critical regulator of mucosal inflammation. NLRC4 is expressed in phagocytes and intestinal epithelial cells and is involved in intestinal homeostasis and host defense. However, no study to date has assessed the circulating levels of NLRC4 and MCP2/CCL8 in patients with CD. The study was aimed to investigate the serum levels of MCP2/CCL8 and NLRC4 in patients with active CD. Sixty-nine patients with active CD and 60 healthy participants were included in the study. Serum levels of NLRC4 and MCP2/CCL8 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median serum NLRC4 levels were lower in the patient group than in the controls (71.02 (range, 46.59-85.51) pg/mL vs. 99.43 (range 83.52-137.79) pg/mL) (P < 0.001). The median serum levels of MCP2/CCL8 were decreased in patients with CD (28.68 (range, 20.16-46.0) pg/mL) compared with the controls (59.96 (range, 40.22-105.59) pg/mL) (P < 0.001). Cut-off points of NLRC4 (<81 pg/mL) and MCP2/CCL8 (<40 pg/mL) showed high sensitivity and specificity for identifying active CD. In conclusion, this is the first study to examine circulating levels of MCP2/CCL8 and NLRC4 in patients with active CD. Our results suggest that serum NLRC4 and MCP2/CCL8 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of CD and may have a protective effect on intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Serum levels of MCP2/CCL8 and NLRC4 could be used as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target for CD."
https://openalex.org/W3212696259,"We define cell morphodynamics as the cell’s time dependent morphology. It could be called the cell’s shape shifting ability . To measure it we use a biomarker free , dynamic histology method, which is based on multiplexed Cell Magneto-Rotation and Machine Learning . We note that standard studies looking at cells immobilized on microscope slides cannot reveal their shape shifting, no more than pinned butterfly collections can reveal their flight patterns. Using cell magnetorotation, with the aid of cell embedded magnetic nanoparticles, our method allows each cell to move freely in 3 dimensions, with a rapid following of cell deformations in all 3-dimensions, so as to identify and classify a cell by its dynamic morphology . Using object recognition and machine learning algorithms, we continuously measure the real-time shape dynamics of each cell, where from we successfully resolve the inherent broad heterogeneity of the morphological phenotypes found in a given cancer cell population. In three illustrative experiments we have achieved clustering, differentiation, and identification of cells from (A) two distinct cell lines, (B) cells having gone through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition , and (C) cells differing only by their motility . This microfluidic method may enable a fast screening and identification of invasive cells, e.g., metastatic cancer cells , even in the absence of biomarkers, thus providing a rapid diagnostics and assessment protocol for effective personalized cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3213114596,"A field study was conducted on the reuse of wastewater from Mardan city to evaluate its risk of contaminating soil and wheat grains at different NPK levels. Three irrigation sources i.e. waste water (WW), canal water (CW) and alternate waste + canal water (WW+CW) were applied to wheat (cv Atta Habib 2010) grown at 0, 50, 75 and 100% NPK levels of 120:90:60 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha-1 at Palatoo Research Farm, Amir Muhammad Khan Campus, Mardan during 2015.The results showed higher grain and biomass yields in WW irrigated plots as compared to CW at NPK levels up to 50% of recommending dose revealing supplementing nutrient requirements in deficient conditions. However, irrigation of WW at higher NPK levels especially at or beyond 75% of recommended dose tended to reduce the crop yield that could be associated with heavy metals toxicity and nutritional imbalances. The use of WW substantially increased AB-DTPA extractable Zn, Mn, Pb, Ni and Cd indicating a potential threat to soil contamination. Similarly, WW irrigated wheat had higher concentrations of these heavy metals as compared to CW which limits its use for production purposes without any remediation measures. The alternate use of CW and WW as revealed by its comparative lower contamination in soil and wheat than sole WW could be one of the possible solutions and may increase the time required for threshold soil contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3213633498,"People with dementia are at risk of mobility decline. In this study, we measured changes in quantitative gait measures over a maximum 10-week period during the course of a psychogeriatric admission in older adults with dementia, with the aims to describe mobility changes over the duration of the admission, and to determine which factors were associated with this change. Fifty-four individuals admitted to a specialized dementia inpatient unit participated in this study. A vision-based markerless motion capture system was used to record participants' natural gait. Mixed effect models were developed with gait measures as the dependent variables and clinical and demographic variables as predictors. We found that gait stability, step time, and step length decreased, and step time variability and step length variability increased over 10 weeks. Gait stability of men decreased more than that of women, associated with an increased sacrum mediolateral range of motion over time. In addition, the sacrum mediolateral range of motion decreased in those with mild neuropsychiatric symptoms over 10 weeks, but increased in those with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our study provides evidence of worsening of gait mechanics and control over the course of a hospitalization in older adults with dementia. Quantitative gait monitoring in hospital environments may provide opportunities to intervene to prevent adverse events, decelerate mobility decline, and monitor rehabilitation outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3213836977,"Accurate characterization and simulation of electromagnetic propagation can be obtained by ray-tracing methods, which are based on a high frequency approximation to the Maxwell equations and describe the propagating field as a set of propagating rays, reflecting, diffracting and scattering over environment elements. However, this approach has been usually too computationally costly to be used in large and dynamic scenarios, but this situation is changing thanks the increasing availability of efficient ray-tracing libraries for graphical processing units. In this paper we present Opal, an electromagnetic propagation simulation tool implemented with ray-tracing on graphical processing units, which is part of the Veneris framework. Opal can be used as a stand-alone ray-tracing simulator, but its main strength lies in its integration with the game engine, which allows to generate customized 3D environments quickly and intuitively. We describe its most relevant features and provide implementation details, highlighting the different simulation types it supports and its extension possibilites. We provide application examples and validate the simulation on demanding scenarios, such as tunnels, where we compare the results with theoretical solutions and further discuss the tradeoffs between the simulation types and its performance."
https://openalex.org/W3212017894,"Drought stress in trees limits their growth, survival, and productivity and it negatively affects the afforestation survival rate. Our study focused on the molecular responses to drought stress in a coniferous species Larix olgensis A. Henry. Drought stress was simulated in one-year-old seedlings using 25% polyethylene glycol 6000. The drought stress response in these seedlings was assessed by analyzing select biochemical parameters, along with gene expression and metabolite profiles. The soluble protein content, peroxidase activity, and malondialdehyde content of L. olgensis were significantly changed during drought stress. Quantitative gene expression analysis identified a total of 8172 differentially expressed genes in seedlings processed after 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h of drought stress treatment. Compared with the gene expression profile of the untreated control, the number of up-regulated genes was higher than that of down-regulated genes, indicating that L. olgensis mainly responded to drought stress through positive regulation. Metabolite analysis of the control and stress-treated samples showed that under drought stress, the increased abundance of linoleic acid was the highest among up-regulated metabolites, which also included some saccharides. A combined analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome revealed that genes dominating the differential expression profile were involved in glutathione metabolism, galactose metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Moreover, the relative abundance of specific metabolites of these pathways was also altered. Thus, our results indicated that L. olgensis prevented free radical-induced damage through glutathione metabolism and responded to drought through sugar accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W3212251780,"We study the light curves of pulsating variable stars using a complex network approach to build visibility graphs. We consider various types of variables stars (e.g., Cepheids, δ Scuti, RR Lyrae), build two types of graphs (the normal visibility graph (VG) and the horizontal visibility graph (HVG)), and calculate various metrics for the resulting networks. We find that all networks have a power-law degree distribution for the VG and an exponential distribution for the HVG, suggesting that it is a universal feature, regardless of the pulsation features. Metrics such as the average degree, the clustering coefficient and the transitivity coefficient, can distinguish between some star types. We also observe that the results are not strongly affected by the presence of observation gaps in the light curves. These findings suggest that the visibility graph algorithm may be a useful technique to study variability in stars."

The aim of this study is to explore the perceived level of core self-evaluation (CSE), leader empowering behavior (LEB), and job security among Jordan University Hospital nurses in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Furthermore, it investigates the relationship between the selected variables. Differences of gender, educational level, experience, and site of work are also examined with job security. Moreover, it evaluates the contribution of CSE, LEB, gender, educational level, experience, and site of work in predicting job security among Jordan University Hospital nurses. A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted for this study. A convenience sample of 214 nurses from Jordan University Hospital was completed the CSE scale, LEB scale, and job security scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and stepwise regression were used to analyze the results. The results indicate that job security is found to be at high level, whereas LEB and CSE are found to be at moderate levels among nurses. Significant positive relationships are found between CSE, LEB, and job security. Male nurses and medical/surgical floors reported higher levels of job security than female nurses and intensive care units. Finally, the results show that LEB and gender are significant predictors of job security among nurses. We suggest that managers of nurses should apply leadership behaviors in order to increase their job security and career empowerment."
https://openalex.org/W3213122283,"Sexual harassment (SH) is prevalent in military settings and dependent on the workplace environment. Few studies have investigated this issue in non-US military settings nor have examined how contextual and individual factors related to Military Sexual Trauma (MST) vary by gender.This study draws on a national sexual survey in the French military including 1268 servicemen and 232 servicewomen. We examined four sexual stressors (repeated sexual comments, sexual coercion, repeated unwanted verbal sexual attention and sexual assault (SA)) and two combined measures of verbal SH (comments, unwanted attention) and MST (all forms). We conducted multivariate logistic regressions to identify contextual and individual factors related to these outcomes.36.7% of women and 17.5% of men experienced MST in the last year and 12.6% and 3.5% reported SA. Factors associated with verbal SH differed from those related to SA. The odds of verbal SH were elevated among men who had sex with men (OR = 3.5) and among women officers (OR = 4.6) while the odds of SA were elevated among men less than 25 years (OR = 3.5) and women with less than a high school diploma (OR = 10.9). The odds of SH increased by 20% to 80% when men worked in units with higher female representation, higher prevalence of MST (sexual comments, or sexual assault, coercion, repeated unwanted attention) and lower acceptance of women in the miliatry. The odds of SA also increased by 70% among men working in units with higher female representation and higher prevalence of sexual oppression. The odds of SA against women were particular high (OR = 5.7) in units with a high prevalence of sexual assault, coercion, or repeated unwanted attention.MST is common in the French military, with women experiencing more severe forms than men. Our resuls call for programmatic action to reduce workplace factors related to verbal SH and SA in the French military."
https://openalex.org/W3213824096,"Epidemiologic data regarding health care acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from Nepal are negligible. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a major tertiary hospital in Nepal between April 2016 and March 2018, to calculate the incidence of VAP, and to describe clinical variables, microbiological etiology, and outcomes. Four hundred and thirty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Demographic data, medical history, antimicrobial administration record, chest X-ray, biochemical, microbiological and haematological results, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and the sequential organ failure assessment scores were recorded. Categorical variables were expressed as count and percentage and analyzed using the Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range and analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and the pairwise Wilcoxon rank—sum test. 46.8% (205/438) of the patients required intubation. Pneumonia was common in both intubated (94.14%; 193/205) and non-intubated (52.36%; 122/233) patients. Pneumonia developed among intubated patients in the ICU had longer days of stay in the ICU (median of 10, IQR 5–15, P&lt; 0.001) when compared to non-intubated patients with pneumonia (median of 4, IQR 3–6, P&lt; 0.001). The incidence rate of VAP was 20% (41/205) and incidence density was 16.45 cases per 1,000ventilator days. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with pneumonia requiring intubation (44.6%, 86/193) than patients with pneumonia not requiring intubation (10.7%, 13/122, p&lt;0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Gram negative bacteria such as Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species were the dominant organisms from both VAP and non-VAP categories. Multi-drug resistance was highly prevalent in bacterial isolates associated with VAP (90%; 99/110) and non-VAP categories (81.5%; 106/130). HAP including VAP remains to be the most prevalent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) at Patan hospital. A local study of etiological agents and outcomes of HAP and VAP are required for setting more appropriate guidelines for management of such diseases."

Severe cases can have case fatality ratio 25% or higher in low-middle income countries, but early diagnosis and timely treatment have a proven benefit. The Smart Triage program in Jinja Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda will provide expedited sepsis treatment in children through a data-driven electronic patient triage system. To complement the ongoing Smart Triage interventional trial, we propose methods for a concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis of the Smart Triage platform.We will use a decision-analytic model taking a societal perspective, combining government and out-of-pocket costs, as patients bear a sizeable portion of healthcare costs in Uganda due to the lack of universal health coverage. Previously published secondary data will be used to link healthcare utilization with costs and intermediate outcomes with mortality. We will model uncertainty via probabilistic sensitivity analysis and present findings at various willingness-to-pay thresholds using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.Our proposed analysis represents a first step in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an innovative digital triage platform designed to improve clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis through expediting care in low-resource settings. Our use of a decision analytic model to link secondary costing data, incorporate post-discharge healthcare utilization, and model clinical endpoints is also novel in the pediatric sepsis triage literature for low-middle income countries.

However, few studies have evaluated effects of donor AKI status on graft outcomes after KT in Asian population. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate graft function after KTs from donors with AKI compared to matched KTs from donors without AKI using a multicenter cohort in Korea.We analyzed a total of 1,466 KTs collected in Korean Organ Transplant Registry between April 2014 and December 2017. KTs from AKI donors (defined as donors with serum creatinine level ≥ 2 mg/dL) and non-AKI donors (275 cases for each group) were enrolled using a 1:1 propensity score matching. Graft outcomes including graft and patient survival, delayed graft function (DGF), rejection rate, and serially measured estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated.After propensity matching, KTs from AKI donors showed higher rate of DGF (44.7% vs. 24.0%, p < 0.001). However, the rejection rate was not significantly different between the two groups (KTs from AKI donors vs. KTs from non-AKI donors). eGFRs measured after 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years were not significantly different by donor AKI status. With median follow-up duration of 3.52 years, cox proportional hazards models revealed hazard ratio of 0.973 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.584 to 1.621), 1.004 (95% CI, 0.491 to 2.054) and 0.808 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.426 to 1.532) for overall graft failure, death-censored graft failure and patient mortality, respectively, in KTs from AKI donors compared to KTs from non-AKI donors as a reference.KTs from AKI donors showed comparable outcomes to KTs from non-AKI donors, despite a higher incidence of DGF. Results of this study supports the validity of using kidneys from deceased AKI donors in Asian population."
https://openalex.org/W3211901459,"Passively grasping an unseen artificial finger induces ownership over this finger and an illusory coming together of one's index fingers: a grasp illusion. Here we determine how interoceptive ability and attending to the upper limbs influence this illusion. Participants passively grasped an unseen artificial finger with their left index finger and thumb for 3 min while their right index finger, located 12 cm below, was lightly clamped. Experiment 1 (n = 30) investigated whether the strength of the grasp illusion (perceived index finger spacing and perceived ownership) is related to a person's level of interoceptive accuracy (modified heartbeat counting task) and sensibility (Noticing subscale of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness). Experiment 2 (n = 30) investigated the effect of providing verbal or tactile cues to guide participants' attention to their upper limbs. On their own, neither interoceptive accuracy and sensibility or verbal and tactile cueing had an effect on the grasp illusion. However, verbal cueing increased the strength of the grasp illusion in individuals with lower interoceptive ability. Across the observed range of interoceptive accuracy and sensibility, verbal cueing decreased perceived index spacing by 5.6 cm [1.91 to 9.38] (mean [95%CI]), and perceived ownership by ∼3 points on a 7-point Likert scale (slope -0.93 [-1.72 to -0.15]). Thus, attending to the upper limbs via verbal cues increases the strength of the grasp illusion in a way that is inversely proportional to a person's level of interoceptive accuracy and sensibility."
https://openalex.org/W3213579576,"This research investigated whether LGBTQ* minority stress and public displays of affection (PDA; e.g., kissing, hugging) among LGBTQ* couples are context-sensitive. We expected that (a) LQBTQ* minority stress would be more prevalent in a harmful (i.e., city center) versus a less harmful (i.e., university campus) context, and (b) PDA would be reduced for LGBTQ* couples in a harmful context. In three studies, LGBTQ* and Hetero/Cis students (NTotal = 517) reported LGBTQ*-specific minority stress and PDA in the city and on campus. The city center was higher in minority stress than the campus in all studies. Also, LGBTQ* participants' PDA enjoyment was lower in the city than on campus (Studies 1 and 3). Minority stress mediated the context effect on PDA (Study 3). A qualitative analysis illuminated the harmful versus protective natures of public contexts. We conclude that a protective context can powerfully promote healthy LGBTQ* relationship behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3213920126,"Childhood is considered the most important phase of human development; within it the period from birth to 5 years of age is particularly critical, given the speed at which changes occur. The context where children live can influence early childhood developmnent (ECD) by providing or limiting opportunities to learn, play and establish social interactions. This study explored the associations between characteristics of the urban environment and ECD in 2,194 children aged 36 to 59 months living in urban municipalities in Mexico.We obtained ECD information from the 2015 Survey of Boys, Girls, and Women (ENIM, for its Spanish acronym), measured with the Early Childhood Development Index. The urban environment was evaluated at the municipal level, considering variables from five environment domains: physical, social, service, socioeconomic, and governance. Multilevel logistic models were fitted to assess the association between urban environment characteristics and the inadequacy of ECD in general and by specific development domains: learning, socio-emotional, physical, and alpha-numeric.Inadequate ECD was inversely associated with the availability of libraries (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.72), and positively associated with population density (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01-1.02). For the specific ECD domains, inadequate socio-emotional development was inversely associated with the availability of libraries (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.85). Inadequate literacy-numeracy knowledge was associated inversely with the availability of daycare centers (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.97), and directly associated with the number of hospitals and clinics (OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.72). Finally, the marginalization index was positively associated with inadequacy in the learning domain (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.03).Some aspects of the urban environment associated with ECD, suggest that intervening in the urban context could improve overall child development. Investment in resources oriented to improve socio-emotional development and literacy (such as libraries and daycare), could foster ECD in Mexico."

We used Chi-square tests to compare proportions for categorical variables and t-tests to compare means for continuous variables.A total of 190 PDs from 500 programs (38.0%) and 236 trainees from 142 programs (28.4%) responded. Most respondents did not believe that parental leave policies were accessible publicly (322/426; 75.6%), on password-protected intranet (343/426; 80.5%), or upon request (240/426; 56.3%). The PDs and trainees broadly felt that parental leave for fellows should be 5-10 weeks (156/426; 36.6%) or 11-15 weeks (165/426; 38.7%). A majority of PDs felt that there was no increased burden upon other fellows (122/190; 64.2%) or change in overall well-being (110/190; 57.9%). When asked about the biggest barrier to parental leave support, most PDs noted time constrains of fellowship (101/190; 53.1%) and the limited number of fellows (43/190; 22.6%). Trainees similarly selected the time constraints of training (88/236; 37.3%), but nearly one-fifth chose the culture in medicine (44/236; 18.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in answers based on the respondents' sex, specialty, or subspecialty.Parental leave policies are broadly in place, but did not feel these were readily accessible, standardized, or of optimum length. PDs and trainees noted several barriers that undermine support for better parental leave policies, including time constraints of fellowship, the limited number of fellows for coverage, and workplace culture. Standardization of parental leave policies is advisable to allow trainees to pursue fellowship training and care for their newborns without undermining their educational experiences."
https://openalex.org/W3211413978,"Traditional forecasting methods in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) data have two limitations that significantly reduce forecasting accuracy: (1) the imbalance of data, that is, the failure cases of M&A are far fewer than the successful cases (82%/18% of our sample), and (2) both the bidder and the target of the merger have numerous descriptive features, making it difficult to choose which ones to forecast. This study proposes a neural network using partial-sigmoid (i.e., partial-sigmoid neural network [PSNN]) as the activation function of the output layer and compares three feature selection methods, namely, chi-square (chi2) test, information gain and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Experimental results prove that our PSNN (improved up to 0.37 precision, 0.49 recall, 0.41 G-Mean and 0.23 F1-measure) and feature selection (improved 1.83%-13.16% accuracy) method can effectively improve the adverse effects of the defects of the above two merger data on forecasting. Scholars who studied the forecast of merger failure have overlooked three important features: assets of the previous year, market value and capital expenditure. The chi2 test feature selection method is the best among the three feature selection methods."
https://openalex.org/W3211435174,"In Ethiopia the pharmacy service has had several gaps among these were low patient satisfaction, and poor availability of essential pharmaceuticals. In addition, previous studies showed variation in magnitude of client satisfaction, and there is no previous study in the study area. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine client satisfaction with outpatient pharmacy service and associated factors among adult clients at Dubti General Hospital in Afar, Ethiopia.A hospital based cross sectional study design was employed from February 1 to March 30, 2020 at Dubti General Hospital. Participants were selected by systematic random sampling method. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was computed to assess statistical association between the outcome variable, and independent variables. AOR with 95% CI were used to show statistical Significance at P <0.05.The overall satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy service was 165(40.5%). Regarding associated factors, service payment insured through their workplace was positively associated with satisfaction (AOR = 3.178, 95% CI: 1.294-7.80) where as availability of some medications (AOR = 0.393, 95% CI: 0.208-0.741), unfair medication cost (AOR = 0.613, 95% CI: 0.607-0.910), and lack of organized pharmacy work flow (AOR = 0.105, 95% CI: 0.049-0.221) were negatively associated with clients' satisfaction.The clients' satisfaction in this study is low that warrants immediate corrective measures. Corrective measures should be taken based on identified gaps such as improving drug availability, pharmacy work flow, and cost of medications."
https://openalex.org/W3211672994,"Absorptive capacity-the ability to learn and apply external knowledge and information to acquire material resources-is an essential but overlooked driver in community adaptation to new and unprecedented disasters. We analyzed data from a representative random sample of 603 individuals from 25 coastal communities in Louisiana affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We used simultaneous equation models to assess the relationship between absorptive capacity and resource acquisition for affected individuals after the disaster. Results show that the diversity of individuals' prior knowledge coupled with the community's external orientation and internal cohesion facilitate resource use. They go beyond simply providing resources and demonstrate individual and community features necessary for absorbing information and knowledge and help devise adaptation strategies to address the dynamics of changing economic, social, and political environment after the disaster."
https://openalex.org/W3211770754,"Melanoma-associated antigen H1 (MAGEH1) is a protein that belongs to melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) superfamily. Growth arrest and DNA damage 45G (GADD45G) is a member of the DNA damage-inducible gene family which responds to environmental stresses. We have previously shown that GADD45G is a protein that promotes apoptosis of renal tubular cells in response to a nephrotoxic injury. In this study, we show evidence that MAGEH1 interacts with GADD45G and is involved in the induction of nephrotoxin-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells.Primary human renal tubular epithelial (HRE) cells and human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells were used in this study. To produce stable cell lines in which MAGEH1 expression was silenced, HRE cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a single guide RNA construct targeting the MAGEH1 gene. To knockdown GADD45G expression in HRE cells, a vector containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used. We used short interfering RNAs (siRNA) to achieve transient silencing of genes in HK-2 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were synthesized to overexpress MAGEH1 and GADD45G proteins. Human protein microarray was used to identify proteins that binds to GADD45G. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were then performed to confirm microarray results. Cell death was induced by cyclosporine A (CsA). Real-time quantitative PCR assay was used to evaluate gene expression levels. The degree of apoptosis and necrosis of cultured cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Expression levels of caspases were examined using western blot analysis.We found that GADD45G bound to one protein spotted in the protein microarray, which was subsequently identified as MAGEH1. We confirmed the interaction between GADD45G and MAGEH1 protein using the co-immunoprecipitation assay. MAGEH1 gene expression was not altered by CsA-induced cytotoxic injury, whereas GADD45G gene expression was increased significantly upon CsA treatment. MAGEH1 expression was significantly downregulated in GADD45G knockdown HRE stable cells suggesting that MAGEH1 expression may be dependent on GADD45G expression. CsA-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in MAGEH1 knockdown HRE stable cells which led to an increased survival of these cells. Similar results were observed in GADD45G knockdown HRE stable cells. Accordingly, CsA-induced apoptosis was significantly decreased in MAGEH1 siRNA and GADD45G siRNA transfected HK-2 cells. CsA-induced activation of caspase-7 and caspase-9 was inhibited in MAGEH1 knockdown HRE stable cells, and similarly in GADD45G knockdown HRE stable cells.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that MAGEH1 interacts with GADD45G and that MAGEH1 is involved in caspase-dependent apoptosis of renal tubular cells induced by nephrotoxic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3212466614,"Little is known about the muscle condition in children with obesity.To investigate the effect of obesity and fatty liver on muscle area and muscle fat in children and young adults.We evaluated consecutive liver fat quantification MRIs in children and young adults between June 2015 and April 2019. We obtained hepatic fat and paraspinal muscle fat at mid L2 from the fat map, psoas muscle area (PMA) at mid L3, and z-score of PMA. The patient's age, height and weight at the time of the MRI were recorded. Body mass index (BMI) z-score was also calculated. Spearman correlation and partial correlation analyses were performed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were also performed using significant variables.A total of 132 patients (97 male) were included with a median age of 13.0 years (interquartile range 11-16 years). The median BMI was 23.7 kg/m2 (interquartile range 21.2-27.7 kg/m2). The weight, BMI, liver fat, and z-score of PMA were all higher in male patients than they were in female patients. The amount of liver fat had no correlation with muscle fat or PMA z-score after adjusting BMI. However, the BMI z-score was positively correlated with the PMA z-score (ρ = 0.432, p<0.001) even after adjusting for liver fat. On regression analyses, the BMI z-score had linear positive relationship with PMA z-score (β = 0.289, p<0.001) and muscle fat (β = 0.218, p = 0.016).Male children and young adults have greater PMA than do female children and young adults. Obesity is associated with higher PMA and paraspinal muscle fat. However, liver fat is not related with the muscle condition in children and young adults."
https://openalex.org/W3213494540,"Victims of violence, accidents, theft, and serious threat (hereafter abbreviated as victims) are more than nonvictims at risk for problems in different domains, varying from mental health to legal problems. However, the extent to which victims with these problems compared to nonvictims with similar problems receive problem-related professional or formal help is unclear. It is unknown if predictors of unmet needs differ between victims and nonvictims. Aim of the present study is to fill this gap of knowledge.Data was extracted from surveys of the VICTIMS-study (2018, 2019 and 2020), conducted with the Dutch population-based longitudinal LISS panel. Each survey assessed 1.) experiences with physical violence, accidents, theft, and serious threat and other traumatic or stressful events in the past 12 months and 2.) various problems and use of professional help, e.g. do receive help, do not need help, could use help but do not use it, cannot find or afford help for these problems. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess differences in problems, in the use of problem-related professional help, and in predictors of unmet needs between victims (N = 1,756) and nonvictims (N = 5,000).Victims more often had assessed problems than nonvictims. Victims compared to nonvictims with similar problems had 1.5 to 2 times more often unmet needs: they could not find or afford professional help for their mental, physical, partner/family, financial and legal problems. In addition, victims less often received help for legal and administrative problems. Most predictors of unmet needs, e.g. could use help but do not use it, cannot find or afford help, were not significant and hardly differed between both groups.The findings that victims compared to nonvictims more often have various problems and more often cannot find or afford problem-related professional help, suggest that there is room for improvement for victims services."
https://openalex.org/W3213884951,"Objective To identify risk factors for functional decline after hospitalization for Gram-negative bacteremia. Patients and methods A prospective cohort study based on a randomized controlled trial conducted between January 1, 2013 and August 31, 2017 in Israel and Italy. Hospitalized patients with Gram-negative bacteremia who survived until day 90 and were not bedridden at baseline were included. The primary end point was functional decline at 90 days. Results Five hundred and nine patients were included. The median age of the cohort was 71 years (interquartile range [IQR], 60–80 years), 46.4% (236/509) were male and 352 of 509 (69%) patients were independent at baseline. Functional decline at 90 days occurred in 24.4% of patients (124/509). In multivariable analysis; older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; for an one-year increment, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.05), functional dependence in instrumental activities of daily living at baseline (OR, 4.64; 95% CI 2.5–8.6), low Norton score (OR, 0.87; 95% CI 0.79–0.96) and underlying comorbidities: cancer (OR, 2.01; 95% CI 1.14–3.55) and chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 2.23 95% CI 1.12–4.42) and longer length of hospital stay (OR 1.09; for one-day increment, 95% CI 1.04–1.15) were associated with functional decline. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was associated with lower rates of functional decline within 90 days (OR, 0.4; 95% CI 0.21–0.78). Conclusions Patients surviving bloodstream infections have poor long term trajectories after clinical recovery and hospital discharge. This has vast implications for patients, their family members and health policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W3214600838,"White abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) was once commonly found in coastal waters of the Southern California Bight (SCB) and south to Punta Abreojos, Baja California, Mexico. During the 1970s, white abalone supported a commercial fishery, which reduced the population and resulted in the closure of the fishery in 1996. When population levels continued to decline, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) listed the species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife and NMFS began surveying the wild populations, propagating specimens in captivity, and protecting its seabed habitat. We modeled coarse-scale (17 x 17 km) historical (using fishery-dependent data [1955-1996]) and contemporary (using fishery-independent data [1996-2017]) distributions of white abalone throughout its historical domain using random forests and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), respectively, and its fine-scale (10 x 10 m) contemporary distribution (fishery-independent data) using MaxEnt. We also investigated potential outplanting habitat farther north under two scenarios of future climate conditions. The coarse-scale models identified potential regions to focus outplanting efforts within SCB while fine-scale models can inform population monitoring and outplanting activities in these particular areas. These models predict that areas north of Point Conception may become candidate outplant sites as seawater temperatures continue to rise in the future due to climate change. Collectively, these results provide guidance on the design and potential locations for experimental outplanting at such locations to ultimately improve methods and success of recovery efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3212227714,"Background/Aim Medication prescription is a fundamental component in the care of the elderly. Several characteristics of aging and geriatric medicine affect prescriptions for these people and make the selection of drug therapy a difficult and complex process. The objective of this study is to develop a geriatric portal for asynchronous online counseling (AGAlink) for use by physicians specializing in family medicine to reduce medication problems among older adult patients in the first level of care. Method A qualitative study was carried out in the first level of care at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), 31 family doctors were interviewed to identify attitudes, preferences about the use of the AGAlink geriatric portal, as well as their recommendations for the implementation of this tool in their daily practice. For the analysis of the data obtained, a qualitative thematic content analysis was used. Results 90% of the physicians used the geriatric portal outside office hours without the need for the patient to be present. The perception of the physician towards the use of the AGAlink geriatric portal was favorable, provided relevant information and had several positive effects on the process of care for medical prescription. The barriers identified to accept the change in medication were not having the proposed therapeutic option, lack of any laboratory analysis, continuing to consider their experience for the prescription of the medication. Conclusions The AGAlink geriatric portal was a tool that was well received by physicians who expressed a positive attitude, considered an investment of a short time that allowed them to update and learn about strategies to reduce the prescription problems presented among the elderly population. However, the main barrier was the use of technology, especially in the doctors with more seniority in the service."
https://openalex.org/W3212532553,"Local identity and civic pride have not been comprehensively taken into consideration as the main parameters in the previous studies related to discourse and identity, especially in most of the developing countries. In other words, discourse analysts have not thoroughly studied the mentioned parameters, and systematic data on this path are very scarce. For that purpose, a critical discourse analysis approach was used to study the city identity of ""Hawleri"" people of Erbil city which is the capital and the most populated city in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and known as a center for the worship of the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar. Thus, the ultimate goals of this study are to first understand how urban residents tend to group themselves according to the cities and communities they live in, and then to show how they proudly affiliate themselves to geographical regions. The data are taken from the city social media and through a survey distributed among people in Erbil. In order to achieve the goals of this study, the author attempted to investigate (i) how civic pride and urban identity are formed, (ii) in what ways people try to group themselves in the cities, (iii) what is the role of culture in shaping the community identity, (iv) who is called Hawleri, and (v) does the language variety have an impact on speakers' civic identity, through studying the place, experience, emotions, history, culture, beliefs and language variety of Hawleri people. Additionally, the total number of participants is 809 people (236 people from the online community and 573 people from the survey). This study concludes that civic pride and city identity are found in the discourse of most people. Hawleri people, as the residents of the oldest city in the Middle East, tend to show this feeling and belonging through speaking a local variety of Kurdish language, their textiles and their common culture, history and geographical birthplace. These sentimentalities sometimes lead to discrimination, bias and racism among different ethnicities living in the city."
https://openalex.org/W3212839879,"The ability to consider the future under the influence of an induced current state is known as induced-state episodic foresight. One study to date has examined adults' induced episodic foresight and found that adults' (like children's) preferences for the future are related to their current state such that they predicted wanting water (vs. pretzels) in the future when experiencing a current state of thirst [1]. We attempted to replicate these findings in adults. In Study 1, adults (N = 198) in a laboratory selected pretzels for tomorrow at the same rate (around 20%) in an experimental condition (thirst induced) and a control condition (thirst not induced). In a lecture, 32% of adults preferred pretzels for tomorrow without thirst induction (Study 2, N = 63). Partially replicating Kramer et al. [1], we found that a minority of adults preferred pretzels (vs. water) when experiencing a current state of thirst. However, in contrast to their findings, our results showed that when thirst was not induced, a minority of adults also preferred pretzels for tomorrow. Thus, adults' future preference was similar regardless of thirst induction. We also tested thirst as a mechanism for adults' preference for the future and found that across conditions adults' thirst predicted their choice of water (vs. pretzels) for the future. In sum, our results partially replicated Kramer et al. [1] by showing the current state, regardless of thirst induction, predicts adults' choices for the future."
https://openalex.org/W3214356512,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) complicating acute rheumatic fever (ARF) remains an important health problem in developing countries. No definitive diagnostic test for ARF exists and the role of Doppler echocardiography (DEC) for long-term prognostic evaluation following ARF is not well established.To investigate the prognostic value of DEC in patients with ARF as a predictor of chronic valve dysfunction.Prospectively enrolled patients with clinical ARF had a DEC performed soon after diagnosis and repeated at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and thereafter at every 1-2 years. We defined chronic valve dysfunction by ≥ 3 of the following: increased valve thickening, commissure fusion, subvalvular thickening, reduced leaflet mobility, non-trivial mitral and/or aortic regurgitation. We performed univariate analysis and developed multivariate logistic regression models to identify variables that may influence evolution to RHD. p <0.05 was considered significant.We evaluated 70(57% men) patients, 10.8±5.6 years-old during the ARF episode and followed for 95±26 months. Chronic valve dysfunction was identified in 36(51.4%) which fulfilled criteria for RHD and 10(27.8%) of them died or underwent valve surgery. Univariate analysis showed that mitral valve thickening and presence of mitral regurgitation at baseline DEC, were associated with RHD(p<0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that only mitral valve thickness either as a continuous (Odds-Ratio:5.8;95%CI:1.7-19.7) or as a categorical variable (Odds-Ratio:4.04;95%CI:1.06-15.3) was an independent predictor of chronic valve dysfunction.Mitral leaflets thickening documented at the time of diagnosis of ARF is a consistent prognostic marker for the subsequent evolution to RHD."
