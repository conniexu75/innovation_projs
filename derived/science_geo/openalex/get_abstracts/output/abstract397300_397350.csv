https://openalex.org/W1965255584,"Transport of fermions is central in many fields of physics. Electron transport runs modern technology, defining states of matter such as superconductors and insulators, and electron spin, rather than charge, is being explored as a new carrier of information [1]. Neutrino transport energizes supernova explosions following the collapse of a dying star [2], and hydrodynamic transport of the quark-gluon plasma governed the expansion of the early Universe [3]. However, our understanding of non-equilibrium dynamics in such strongly interacting fermionic matter is still limited. Ultracold gases of fermionic atoms realize a pristine model for such systems and can be studied in real time with the precision of atomic physics [4, 5]. It has been established that even above the superfluid transition such gases flow as an almost perfect fluid with very low viscosity [3, 6] when interactions are tuned to a scattering resonance. However, here we show that spin currents, as opposed to mass currents, are maximally damped, and that interactions can be strong enough to reverse spin currents, with opposite spin components reflecting off each other. We determine the spin drag coeffcient, the spin diffusivity, and the spin susceptibility, as a function of temperature on resonance and show that they obey universal laws at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the spin diffusivity approaches a minimum value set by the ratio of the reduced Planck's constant to the atomic mass. For repulsive interactions, our measurements appear to exclude a metastable ferromagnetic state [7-9]."

https://openalex.org/W2088823312,"Autophagy is a cell housekeeping mechanism that has recently received attention in relation to its effects on the immune response. Genetic studies have identified candidate loci for Crohn's disease susceptibility among autophagy genes, while experiments in murine macrophages from ATG16L1 deficient mice have shown that disruption of autophagy increases processing of IL-1β and IL-18 through an inflammasome-dependent manner. Using complementary approaches either inducing or inhibiting autophagy, we describe modulatory effects of autophagy on proinflammatory cytokine production in human cells. Inhibition of basal autophagy in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) significantly enhances IL-1β after stimulation with TLR2 or TLR4 ligands, while at the same time reducing the production of TNFα. In line with this, induction of autophagy by starvation inhibited IL-1β production. These effects of autophagy were not exerted at the processing step, as inflammasome activation was not influenced. In contrast, the effect of autophagy on cytokine production was on transcription level, and possibly involving the inhibition of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. In conclusion, autophagy modulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in human cells through an inflammasome-independent pathway, and this is a novel mechanism that may be targeted in inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2027239352,"Background The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is a well-studied non-obese spontaneous type 2 diabetes (T2D) animal model characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the pancreatic beta cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs involved in many fundamental biological processes. We aim to identify miRNAs that are differentially-expressed in the pancreatic islets of the GK rats and investigate both their short- and long term glucose-dependence during glucose-stimulatory conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Global profiling of 348 miRNAs in the islets of GK rats and Wistar controls (females, 60 days, N = 6 for both sets) using locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based microarrays allowed for the clear separation of the two groups. Significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified 30 differentially-expressed miRNAs, 24 of which are predominantly upregulated in the GK rat islets. Monitoring of qPCR-validated miRNAs during GSIS experiments on isolated islets showed disparate expression trajectories between GK and controls indicating distinct short- and long-term glucose dependence. We specifically found expression of rno-miR-130a, rno-miR-132, rno-miR-212 and rno-miR-335 to be regulated by hyperglycaemia. The putative targets of upregulated miRNAs in the GK, filtered with glucose-regulated mRNAs, were found to be enriched for insulin-secretion genes known to be downregulated in T2D patients. Finally, the binding of rno-miR-335 to a fragment of the 3′UTR of one of known down-regulated exocytotic genes in GK islets, Stxbp1 was shown by luciferase assay. Conclusions/Significance The perturbed miRNA network found in the GK rat islets is indicative of a system-wide impairment in the regulation of genes important for the normal functions of pancreatic islets, particularly in processes involving insulin secretion during glucose stimulatory conditions. Our findings suggest that the reduced insulin secretion observed in the GK rat may be partly due to upregulated miRNA expression leading to decreased production of key proteins of the insulin exocytotic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2090936348,"Relief fits the definition of a reward. Unlike other reward types the pleasantness of relief depends on the violation of a negative expectation, yet this has not been investigated using neuroimaging approaches. We hypothesized that the degree of negative expectation depends on state (dread) and trait (pessimism) sensitivity. Of the brain regions that are involved in mediating pleasure, the nucleus accumbens also signals unexpected reward and positive prediction error. We hypothesized that accumbens activity reflects the level of negative expectation and subsequent pleasant relief. Using fMRI and two purpose-made tasks, we compared hedonic and BOLD responses to relief with responses during an appetitive reward task in 18 healthy volunteers. We expected some similarities in task responses, reflecting common neural substrates implicated across reward types. However, we also hypothesized that relief responses would differ from appetitive rewards in the nucleus accumbens, since only relief pleasantness depends on negative expectations. The results confirmed these hypotheses. Relief and appetitive reward task activity converged in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which also correlated with appetitive reward pleasantness ratings. In contrast, dread and pessimism scores correlated with relief but not with appetitive reward hedonics. Moreover, only relief pleasantness covaried with accumbens activation. Importantly, the accumbens signal appeared to specifically reflect individual differences in anticipation of the adverse event (dread, pessimism) but was uncorrelated to appetitive reward hedonics. In conclusion, relief differs from appetitive rewards due to its reliance on negative expectations, the violation of which is reflected in relief-related accumbens activation."

https://openalex.org/W2076641476,"Neurons and glial cells in the developing brain arise from neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Nestin, an intermediate filament protein, is thought to be expressed exclusively by NPCs in the normal brain, and is replaced by the expression of proteins specific for neurons or glia in differentiated cells. Nestin expressing NPCs are found in the adult brain in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. While significant attention has been paid to studying NPCs in the SVZ and SGZ in the adult brain, relatively little attention has been paid to determining whether nestin-expressing neural cells (NECs) exist outside of the SVZ and SGZ. We therefore stained sections immunocytochemically from the adult rat and human brain for NECs, observed four distinct classes of these cells, and present here the first comprehensive report on these cells. Class I cells are among the smallest neural cells in the brain and are widely distributed. Class II cells are located in the walls of the aqueduct and third ventricle. Class IV cells are found throughout the forebrain and typically reside immediately adjacent to a neuron. Class III cells are observed only in the basal forebrain and closely related areas such as the hippocampus and corpus striatum. Class III cells resemble neurons structurally and co-express markers associated exclusively with neurons. Cell proliferation experiments demonstrate that Class III cells are not recently born. Instead, these cells appear to be mature neurons in the adult brain that express nestin. Neurons that express nestin are not supposed to exist in the brain at any stage of development. That these unique neurons are found only in brain regions involved in higher order cognitive function suggests that they may be remodeling their cytoskeleton in supporting the neural plasticity required for these functions."
https://openalex.org/W2067983977,"Bacterial exopolysaccharides have always been suggested to play crucial roles in the bacterial initial adhesion and the development of complex architecture in the later stages of bacterial biofilm formation. However, Escherichia coli group II capsular polysaccharide was characterized to exert broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. In this study, we firstly reported that a bacterial exopolysaccharide (A101) not only inhibits biofilm formation of many bacteria but also disrupts established biofilm of some strains. A101 with an average molecular weight of up to 546 KDa, was isolated and purified from the culture supernatant of the marine bacterium Vibrio sp. QY101 by ethanol precipitation, iron-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. High performance liquid chromatography traces of the hydrolyzed polysaccharides showed that A101 is primarily consisted of galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, rhamnose and glucosamine. A101 was demonstrated to inhibit biofilm formation by a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria without antibacterial activity. Furthermore, A101 displayed a significant disruption on the established biofilm produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not by Staphylococcus aureus. Importantly, A101 increased the aminoglycosides antibiotics' capability of killing P. aeruginosa biofilm. Cell primary attachment to surfaces and intercellular aggregates assays suggested that A101 inhibited cell aggregates of both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, while the cell-surface interactions inhibition only occurred in S. aureus, and the pre-formed cell aggregates dispersion induced by A101 only occurred in P. aeruginosa. Taken together, these data identify the antibiofilm activity of A101, which may make it potential in the design of new therapeutic strategies for bacterial biofilm-associated infections and limiting biofilm formation on medical indwelling devices. The found of A101 antibiofilm activity may also promote a new recognition about the functions of bacterial exopolysaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W2089551216,"Matricellular proteins, including periostin, are important for tissue regeneration.Presently we investigated the function of periostin in cutaneous wound healing by using periostin-deficient ⁻/⁻ mice. Periostin mRNA was expressed in both the epidermis and hair follicles, and periostin protein was located at the basement membrane in the hair follicles together with fibronectin and laminin γ2. Periostin was associated with laminin γ2, and this association enhanced the proteolytic cleavage of the laminin γ2 long form to produce its short form. To address the role of periostin in wound healing, we employed a wound healing model using WT and periostin⁻/⁻ mice and the scratch wound assay in vitro. We found that the wound closure was delayed in the periostin⁻/⁻ mice coupled with a delay in re-epithelialization and with reduced proliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, keratinocyte proliferation was enhanced in periostin-overexpressing HaCaT cells along with up-regulation of phosphorylated NF-κB.These results indicate that periostin was essential for keratinocyte proliferation for re-epithelialization during cutaneous wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2016938202,"Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes requires extensive changes in gene expression, which are partly mediated by post-translational modifications of nucleosomal histones. An essential modification for oligodendrocyte differentiation is the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues which is catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). The transcriptional targets of HDAC activity within OPCs however, have remained elusive and have been identified in this study by interrogating the oligodendrocyte transcriptome. Using a novel algorithm that allows clustering of gene transcripts according to expression kinetics and expression levels, we defined major waves of co-regulated genes. The initial overall decrease in gene expression was followed by the up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and myelination. Functional annotation of the down-regulated gene clusters identified transcripts involved in cell cycle regulation, transcription, and RNA processing. To define whether these genes were the targets of HDAC activity, we cultured rat OPCs in the presence of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor previously shown to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation. By overlaying the defined oligodendrocyte transcriptome with the list of 'TSA sensitive' genes, we determined that a high percentage of 'TSA sensitive' genes are part of a normal program of oligodendrocyte differentiation. TSA treatment increased the expression of genes whose down-regulation occurs very early after induction of OPC differentiation, but did not affect the expression of genes with a slower kinetic. Among the increased 'TSA sensitive' genes we detected several transcription factors including Id2, Egr1, and Sox11, whose down-regulation is critical for OPC differentiation. Thus, HDAC target genes include clusters of co-regulated genes involved in transcriptional repression. These results support a de-repression model of oligodendrocyte lineage progression that relies on the concurrent down-regulation of several inhibitors of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2090298455,"Background The Wnt pathway mediates differentiation of epithelial tissues; depending on the tissue types, Wnt can either drive or inhibit the differentiation process. We hypothesized that key genes in the Wnt pathway are suppressed in the human airway epithelium under the stress of cigarette smoking, a stress associated with dysregulation of the epithelial differentiated state. Methodology/Principal Findings Microarrays were used to assess the expression of Wnt-related genes in the small airway epithelium (SAE) obtained via bronchoscopy and brushing of healthy nonsmokers, healthy smokers, and smokers with COPD. Thirty-three of 56 known Wnt-related genes were expressed in the SAE. Wnt pathway downstream mediators β-catenin and the transcription factor 7-like 1 were down-regulated in healthy smokers and smokers with COPD, as were many Wnt target genes. Among the extracellular regulators that suppress the Wnt pathway, secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was up-regulated 4.3-fold in healthy smokers and 4.9-fold in COPD smokers, an observation confirmed by TaqMan Real-time PCR, Western analysis and immunohistochemistry. Finally, cigarette smoke extract mediated up-regulation of SFRP2 and down-regulation of Wnt target genes in airway epithelial cells in vitro. Conclusions/Significance Smoking down-regulates the Wnt pathway in the human airway epithelium. In the context that Wnt pathway plays an important role in differentiation of epithelial tissues, the down-regulation of Wnt pathway may contribute to the dysregulation of airway epithelium differentiation observed in smoking-related airway disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1965910744,"Sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide (Cer), sphingosine (SPH), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), contribute to multiple aspects of carcinogenesis including cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and tumor resistance. The cellular balance between Cer and S1P levels, for example, is an important determinant of cell fate, with the former inducing apoptosis and the later mitogenesis. Acid ceramidase (ASAH1) plays a pivotal role in regulating the intracellular concentration of these two metabolites by hydrolyzing Cer into SPH, which is rapidly phosphorylated to form S1P. Genistein is a phytoestrogen isoflavone that exerts agonist and antagonist effects on the proliferation of estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, primarily as a ligand for estrogen receptors. Genistein can also activate signaling through GPR30, a G-protein-coupled cell surface receptor. Based on the relationship between bioactive sphingolipids and tumorigenesis, we sought to determine the effect of genistein on ASAH1 transcription in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We show herein that nanomolar concentrations of genistein induce ASAH1 transcription through a GPR30-dependent, pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway that requires the activation of c-Src and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Activation of this pathway promotes histone acetylation and recruitment of phospho-estrogen receptor α and specificity protein-1 to the ASAH1 promoter, ultimately culminating in increased ceramidase activity. Finally, we show that genistein stimulates cyclin B2 expression and cell proliferation in an ASAH1-dependent manner. Collectively, these data identify a mechanism through which genistein promotes sphingolipid metabolism and support a role for ASAH1 in breast cancer cell growth.

Biochem. 2008; 49: 413-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Acid ceramidase (encoded by ASAH1) is a lipid hydrolase that directly regulates Cer metabolism by catalyzing its degradation to sphingosine (SPH) and a free fatty acid (44Li C.M. Park J.H. He X.

SPH is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SPHK) to form S1P. Because Cer hydrolysis is the major pathway for SPH generation (45Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), ASAH1 plays a key role in regulating cellular homeostasis by controlling the Cer/SPH/S1P balance within the cell.

Despite the prominent roles of sphingolipids in cancer development and the proliferative actions of low doses of genistein, little is known about the relationship between these two factors in cancer progression. Therefore, based on the importance of ASAH1 in sphingolipid metabolism, the role of Cer/S1P balance in carcinogenesis, and the numerous biological effects of genistein in cancer cells, we sought to determine the role of genistein in ASAH1 gene transcription in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We show that genistein induces ASAH1 gene expression through an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism involving both GPR30 and ERα. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ASAH1 expression is required for genistein-stimulated cyclin B2 expression and MCF-7 cell proliferation.

Twenty-four h later, cells were transfected again, incubated for an additional 24 h, and then treated with 20 nm genistein or 10 nm G-1 for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and quantified by qRT-PCR as described above. Reduction of GPR30 and ERα protein expression at the time of RNA isolation was confirmed by Western blotting. MDA-MB-231 cells were subcultured into 12-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-hERα (kindly provided by Dr. Ann Nardulli, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL) using GeneJuice (EMD Biosciences). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with 20 nm genistein or 5 nm E2 for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated and ASAH1, pS2, and β-actin mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR as described above. Expression of ERα was confirmed by Western blotting 48 h after transfection. For quantification of ASAH1 protein expression, MCF-7 cells were treated with 20 nm genistein for 24, 48, or 72 h and harvested into RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Cell lysates were isolated and separated by SDS-PAGE as previously described (55Lucki N. Sewer M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Western blots were incubated with anti-ASAH1 (HPA005468, Sigma) and anti-GAPDH (sc-25778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. For quantification of ERK1/2 activation, MCF-7 cells were serum starved for 40 h, then treated with 20 nm genistein for 0 to 30 min.

For quantification of cyclin B2 protein expression, MCF-7 cells were serum starved for 48 h and then pre-treated with 200 ng/ml of nocodazole (Calbiochem Inc.) for 10 h. Cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS, serum-free minimum essential medium was added to each well, and cells were treated with 20 nm genistein for 6 or 12 h. In some experiments, cells were transfected with 75 nm ASAH1 siRNA oligonucleotides (M-005228-01-0005, Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific) using HiPerfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) for 24 h prior to pretreatment with nocodazole. Cell lysates were isolated and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were incubated with anti-cyclin B2 (K0189–3, Cell Signaling), anti-ASAH1 (Sigma), and anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Protein expression was detected using an ECF Western blotting kit (GE Healthcare) and visualized using a VersaDoc 4000 Imager (Bio-Rad). Cloning of the human ASAH1 promoter and generation of deletion constructs were previously described (55Lucki N. Sewer M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were subcultured into 24-well plates and transfected with 100 ng of pGL3-ASAH1 or pGL3-ASAH1(EREmutant) and 1.5 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) using GeneJuice (EMD Biosciences). Some cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of pCMV-hERα. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with 20 nm genistein for 16 h and the transcriptional activity of the ASAH1 reporter gene was determined using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly (pGL3-ASAH1) luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (pRL-TK) and expressed as fold-change over the mean of the untreated control group. Mutagenesis of the putative ER response element (ERE) at position 475/−457 of the ASAH1 promoter was carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and confirmed by sequencing. ERE was disrupted by mutating 4 consecutive residues to alanine (underlined) using the following primer set: forward 5′-GGG CAA AGA TGG AAA AGG GTG GGA TGT TAC-3′, reverse 5′-ACA TCC CAC CCT TTT CCA TCT TTG CCC TCT-3′. MCF-7 cells were subcultured into 150-mm dishes and treated for 1 h with 20 nm genistein and ChIP assays were performed as described previously (57Dammer E.B. Leon A. Sewer M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The purified chromatin solutions were precleared and immunoprecipitated using 5 μg of primary antibody (anti-acetylhistone H3, anti-RNA polymerase II, anti-phospho-Ser118-ERα (clone NL-44), anti-SRC-1, or anti-specificity protein-1 (Sp1)) and 30 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz). All antibodies used for ChIP were purchased from Millipore. Quantitative PCR was carried out using 20% output, 5% input (diluted 1:4), the ABsolute qPCR SYBR Green Fluorescein Mix (Thermo Scientific) and the primer sets are listed under Table 1. For quantitative proliferative assays, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and 24 h later transfected with 75 nm nonspecific siRNA oligonucleotides or siRNA against ASAH1 or siRNA against ASAH2 (M-005229-00-0005, Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific) for 24 h. In some experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and 24 h later transfected with an ASAH1 expression plasmid (0.4 μg/well) for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 20 nm genistein, 10 nm G-1, or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) for 24 h. After treatment, the cultures were incubated for an additional 6 h in the presence of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 10 μm). Cell proliferation was assayed by BrdU incorporation measurements with an ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Western blotting was used to confirm reduction of ASAH1 and ASAH2 protein levels 48 h after siRNA transfection. Similarly, ASAH1 overexpression was confirmed by Western blotting 48 h after transfection. MCF-7 cells were plated in 96-well plates and 24 h later transfected with 75 nm nonspecific siRNA oligonucleotides or siRNA against ASAH1 (M-005228-01-0005, Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific). Twenty-four h later, cells were treated for 12, 24, or 48 h with 20 nm genistein or dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reduction of ASAH1 protein levels was confirmed by Western blotting 48 h after transfection. MCF-7 cells were subcultured into 100-mm dishes and treated for 48 or 72 h with 20 nm genistein and in vitro ASAH1 activity assay was performed as previously described (55Lucki N. Sewer M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TLC plates were visualized by fluorescence scanning on a VersaDoc 4000 imager (Bio-Rad). NBD-dodecanoic acid formation was quantified and normalized to the protein content of each sample. One-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison, and unpaired Student's t tests were performed using GraphPad InStat software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Statistically significant differences from a compared value were defined as p < 0.05 denoted by asterisks (*) or carats (∧). To evaluate the effect of genistein on the transcription of ceramidase genes (ASAH), MCF-7 cells were treated with 20 nm genistein for 24 h. ASAH1 mRNA expression was significantly increased by 2.5-fold in response to low-dose genistein treatment (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, ASAH2 mRNA expression was also induced by 2.6-fold in response to treatment, whereas the expression of ASAH3 was unchanged (Fig. 1A). Because aberrant ASAH1 expression has been reported in cancer cells (46Saad A.F. Meacham W.D. Bai A. Anelli V. Elojeimy S. Mahdy A.E. Turner L.S. Cheng J. Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Keane T.E.

https://openalex.org/W2022180444,"Background H5N1 influenza vaccines, including live intranasal, appear to be relatively less immunogenic compared to seasonal analogs. The main influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) was shown to be more susceptible to acidic pH treatment than that of human or low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. The acidification machinery of the human nasal passageway in response to different irritation factors starts to release protons acidifying the mucosal surface (down to pH of 5.2). We hypothesized that the sensitivity of H5 HA to the acidic environment might be the reason for the low infectivity and immunogenicity of intranasal H5N1 vaccines for mammals. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate that original human influenza viruses infect primary human nasal epithelial cells at acidic pH (down to 5.4), whereas H5N1 HPAIVs lose infectivity at pH≤5.6. The HA of A/Vietnam/1203/04 was modified by introducing the single substitution HA2 58K→I, decreasing the pH of the HA conformational change. The H5N1 reassortants containing the indicated mutation displayed an increased resistance to acidic pH and high temperature treatment compared to those lacking modification. The mutation ensured a higher viral uptake as shown by immunohistochemistry in the respiratory tract of mice and 25 times lower mouse infectious dose50. Moreover, the reassortants keeping 58K→I mutation designed as a live attenuated vaccine candidate lacking an NS1 gene induced superior systemic and local antibody response after the intranasal immunization of mice. Conclusion/Significance Our finding suggests that an efficient intranasal vaccination with a live attenuated H5N1 virus may require a certain level of pH and temperature stability of HA in order to achieve an optimal virus uptake by the nasal epithelial cells and induce a sufficient immune response. The pH of the activation of the H5 HA protein may play a substantial role in the infectivity of HPAIVs for mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2145916438,"Intra- and interspecific variation in flower color is a hallmark of angiosperm diversity. The evolutionary forces underlying the variety of flower colors can be nearly as diverse as the colors themselves. In addition to pollinator preferences, non-pollinator agents of selection can have a major influence on the evolution of flower color polymorphisms, especially when the pigments in question are also expressed in vegetative tissues. In such cases, identifying the target(s) of selection starts with determining the biochemical and molecular basis for the flower color variation and examining any pleiotropic effects manifested in vegetative tissues. Herein, we describe a widespread purple-white flower color polymorphism in the mustard Parrya nudicaulis spanning Alaska. The frequency of white-flowered individuals increases with increasing growing-season temperature, consistent with the role of anthocyanin pigments in stress tolerance. White petals fail to produce the stress responsive flavonoid intermediates in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP), suggesting an early pathway blockage. Petal cDNA sequences did not reveal blockages in any of the eight enzyme-coding genes in white-flowered individuals, nor any color differentiating SNPs. A qRT-PCR analysis of white petals identified a 24-fold reduction in chalcone synthase (CHS) at the threshold of the ABP, but no change in CHS expression in leaves and sepals. This arctic species has avoided the deleterious effects associated with the loss of flavonoid intermediates in vegetative tissues by decoupling CHS expression in petals and leaves, yet the correlation of flower color and climate suggests that the loss of flavonoids in the petals alone may affect the tolerance of white-flowered individuals to colder environments."
https://openalex.org/W2017825535,"While exceptional for an intense diversification of lineages, the evolutionary history of the order Rodentia comprises only a limited number of morphological morphotypes for the mandible. This situation could partly explain the intense debates about the taxonomic position of the latest described member of this clade, the Laotian rock rat Laonastes aenigmamus (Diatomyidae). This discovery has re-launched the debate on the definition of the Hystricognathi suborder identified using the angle of the jaw relative to the plane of the incisors. Our study aims to end this ambiguity. For clarity, it became necessary to revisit the entire morphological diversity of the mandible in extant and extinct rodents. However, current and past rodent diversity brings out the limitations of the qualitative descriptive approach and highlights the need for a quantitative approach. Here, we present the first descriptive comparison of the masticatory apparatus within the Ctenohystrica clade, in combining classic comparative anatomy with morphometrical methods. First, we quantified the shape of the mandible in rodents using 3D landmarks. Then, the analysis of osteological features was compared to myological features in order to understand the biomechanical origin of this morphological diversity. Among the morphological variation observed, the mandible of Laonastes aenigmamus displays an intermediate association of features that could be considered neither as sciurognathous nor as hystricognathous."
https://openalex.org/W2057760804,"Background Over recent decades jellyfish have caused fish kill events and recurrent gill problems in marine-farmed salmonids. Common jellyfish (Aurelia spp.) are among the most cosmopolitan jellyfish species in the oceans, with populations increasing in many coastal areas. The negative interaction between jellyfish and fish in aquaculture remains a poorly studied area of science. Thus, a recent fish mortality event in Ireland, involving Aurelia aurita, spurred an investigation into the effects of this jellyfish on marine-farmed salmon. Methodology/Principal Findings To address the in vivo impact of the common jellyfish (A. aurita) on salmonids, we exposed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts to macerated A. aurita for 10 hrs under experimental challenge. Gill tissues of control and experimental treatment groups were scored with a system that rated the damage between 0 and 21 using a range of primary and secondary parameters. Our results revealed that A. aurita rapidly and extensively damaged the gills of S. salar, with the pathogenesis of the disorder progressing even after the jellyfish were removed. After only 2 hrs of exposure, significant multi-focal damage to gill tissues was apparent. The nature and extent of the damage increased up to 48 hrs from the start of the challenge. Although the gills remained extensively damaged at 3 wks from the start of the challenge trial, shortening of the gill lamellae and organisation of the cells indicated an attempt to repair the damage suffered. Conclusions Our findings clearly demonstrate that A. aurita can cause severe gill problems in marine-farmed fish. With aquaculture predicted to expand worldwide and evidence suggesting that jellyfish populations are increasing in some areas, this threat to aquaculture is of rising concern as significant losses due to jellyfish could be expected to increase in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2099057097,"Deregulation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E6AP contributes to the development of the Angelman syndrome and to cervical carcinogenesis suggesting that the activity of E6AP needs to be under tight control. However, how E6AP activity is regulated at the post-translational level under non-pathologic conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we report that the giant protein HERC2, which is like E6AP a member of the HECT family of ubiquitin-protein ligases, binds to E6AP. The interaction is mediated by the RCC1-like domain 2 of HERC2 and a region spanning amino acid residues 150–200 of E6AP. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HERC2 stimulates the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of E6AP in vitro and within cells and that this stimulatory effect does not depend on the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of HERC2. Thus, the data obtained indicate that HERC2 acts as a regulator of E6AP.

Both domains serve as interaction sites for E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.

Because many cellular processes are controlled by ubiquitination, it is not surprising that deregulation of components of the ubiquitin-conjugation system contributes to the development of human diseases (1Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 2Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. Annu. Rev.

Staub O. BMC Biochem. 2007; 8: S6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). E6AP, the founding member of the HECT family of E3s, represents one of the most prominent examples for this notion. Inactivation of the E3 activity of E6AP by mutation or loss of expression results in the development of the Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, whereas unscheduled activation of E6AP by interaction with the E6 oncoprotein of certain human papillomaviruses, including HPV16, contributes to cervical carcinogenesis (5Matsuura T.

Thus, thorough characterization of E6AP and its substrates and regulators should provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the aforementioned diseases. E6AP is encoded by the UBE3A gene located on chromosome 15q11–13 and exists in three isoforms generated by differential splicing (7Clayton-Smith J. Laan L. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 10Nicholls R.D. Knepper J.L. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

The isoforms differ at their N termini, but it is currently unknown if the isoforms have different properties (e.g. protein-binding properties). Several substrates of E6AP have been reported, including HHR23A and HHR23B, Blk, AIB1, PML, alpha-Synuclein, Arc, and Ring1B (12Kumar S. Talis A.L. Howley P.M. J. Biol.

However, with the exception of Arc and potentially Ring1B (17Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. Ploegh H.L.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6788-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the relevance of these interactions for development of the Angelman syndrome remains to be shown. In this study, we report that E6AP binds to HERC2, which is a member of the HECT and RCC1-like (HERC) domain subfamily of HECT E3s (4Scheffner M. Staub O. BMC Biochem. 2007; 8: S6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Gonzalo F.R. Rosa J.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1826-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The interaction site of E6AP on HERC2 and vice versa was mapped to RLD2 of HERC2 and a region within the N-terminal 200 amino acid residues of E6AP. Furthermore, we provide evidence that binding of the isolated RLD2 or of full-length HERC2 activates the E3 activity of E6AP in vitro and within cells, respectively. Thus, besides the notion that this is the first example of heteromer formation between HECT E3s, the data identify HERC2 as a potential regulator of E6AP. H1299 cells, HEK293T cells, and MEFs derived from E6AP knock-out (Ube3a−/−) mice (20Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) (Charles River) or wild-type littermates were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. To generate a cell line, in which HERC2 expression is stably suppressed by RNA interference, H1299 cells were transfected with pMSCVpuro-HERC2 (Clontech) expressing an shRNA directed against nucleotides 8476–8499 of the HERC2 mRNA (with nucleotide 1 referring to A of the start codon) by lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). Cells stably containing the expression construct were selected by resistance to puromycin (Sigma). After establishing single cell clones, protein extracts were prepared, and HERC2 levels were determined by Western blot using an anti-HERC2 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). The bacterial expression construct for the GST fusion protein of HPV16 E6 was described previously (21Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression constructs for the ubiquitin mutant ubLIA (substitution of Leu-8 and Ile-44 by Ala) and for GST fusion proteins of RLD2 and RLD3, respectively, of HERC2, and of amino acids 150–200 of E6AP (numbering according to isoform 1 (11Yamamoto Y. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) (see Fig. 1) were generated by PCR-based approaches (further details will be provided upon request). Expression constructs (in vitro translation, transient transfection experiments) encoding HA-tagged wild-type E6AP (isoform 1), the HA-tagged catalytically inactive mutant E6AP-C820A (substitution of Cys-820 by Ala), Myc-tagged ΔRING-Ring1B, and His-tagged ubiquitin were described previously (22Kuballa P. Matentzoglu K. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Ben-Saadon R. Zaaroor D. Ziv T. Ciechanover A. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8960-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding various deletion mutants of E6AP isoform 1 (Fig. 1) were generated by PCR-based approaches (further details will be provided upon request) and expressed as N-terminally HA-tagged forms from pcDNA3. Expression constructs encoding an N-terminally HA-tagged form of full-length HERC2 and the respective catalytically inactive mutant HERC2-C4762A (substitution of Cys-4762 by Ala) were kindly provided by Trenzyme GmbH (Konstanz, Germany). For transient expression, cells were transfected with the respective constructs in the presence of a reporter construct encoding β-galactosidase by lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection as described (22Kuballa P. Matentzoglu K. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and, when necessary (Fig. 4), transfection efficiency was determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Levels of HA-tagged E6AP, HA-tagged E6AP mutants, HA-tagged HERC2, and Myc-tagged ΔRING-Ring1B were determined by Western blot analysis. The antibodies used for detection were the mouse monoclonal HA.11 (Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany) for HA-tagged proteins and the mouse monoclonal 9E10 (Abcam) for Myc-tagged ΔRING-Ring1B. Endogenous HERC2 and E6AP present in protein extracts prepared from MEFs, H1299 cells, KD1299 cells (H1299 cells with stable knockdown of HERC2 expression), and HEK293T cells were detected by an anti-HERC2 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Bioscience) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against E6AP (25Nuber U. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), respectively. In vitro coprecipitation experiments using GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (21Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate-translated 35S-labeled proteins was incubated with bacterially expressed GST or GST fusion proteins as indicated (Fig. 1, B and C). After 3 h, bound proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and electrophoresed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and 35S-labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. For coprecipitation experiments using ectopically expressed E6AP (Fig. 1E), ∼5 × 106 H1299 cells were transfected with the E6AP expression construct indicated. Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection and precleared with Protein A-Sepharose. Then, 4 μg of the mouse monoclonal antibody HA.11 was added, extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and bound proteins were precipitated by using Protein A-Sepharose. Precipitated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. For coprecipitation experiments with endogenous E6AP (Fig. 2A), protein extracts were prepared from ∼107 E6AP null (Ube3a−/−) or wild-type (Ube3a+/+) MEFs and precleared with Protein A-Sepharose. 1 μg of a mouse monoclonal anti-E6AP antibody (25Nuber U. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was added, extracts were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and bound proteins were precipitated by using Protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by Western blot. For size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2C), 400 μg of protein extract derived from H1299 cells or from KD1299 cells was applied to a Sephacryl S300 column and fractionated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl as running buffer. One half of each fraction (1 ml) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the antibodies indicated. For in vitro ubiquitination experiments, RLD2 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli BL21. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 and E6AP (isoform 1) were expressed in the baculovirus system, and UbcH5b, wild-type ubiquitin, and the ubiquitin mutant ubLIA were expressed in E. coli BL21 by using the pET expression system as described (26Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For in vitro ubiquitination, 1 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate-translated 35S-labeled substrate (E6AP, ΔRING-Ring1B) was incubated with 50 ng of E1, 50 ng of UbcH5b, 200 ng of baculovirus-expressed E6AP, and 20 μg of ubiquitin in the absence or presence of bacterially expressed RLD2 (200 ng) in 40-μl volumes. In addition, reactions contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, and 4 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 25 °C for the times indicated (Fig. 3), total reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and 35S-labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Results shown are representative of at least three different experiments with three different preparations of each protein. For ubiquitination of E6AP and Ring1B within cells, one 6-cm plate of HEK293T cells was transfected with expression constructs encoding E6AP (2.5 μg), ΔRING-Ring1B (500 ng), His-tagged ubiquitin (1.5 μg), and HERC2 or the catalytically inactive mutant HERC2-C4762A (3 μg) as indicated (Fig. 4). 24 h after transfection, 30% of the cells were lysed under non-denaturing conditions as described (24Glockzin S. Ogi F.X. Hengstermann A. Scheffner M. Blattner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8960-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to determine expression levels of E6AP, ΔRING-Ring1B, and the two forms of HERC2. The remaining cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, and ubiquitinated proteins were purified as described (24Glockzin S. Ogi F.X. Hengstermann A. Scheffner M. Blattner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8960-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with E6AP, yeast two-hybrid screens and coprecipitation experiments using a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein of E6AP and cell extracts followed by mass spectrometric identification of coprecipitated proteins (27Matentzoglu K. Scheffner M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were employed. A protein that was identified in both experimental setups is HERC2 (for details, see supplemental Fig. 1). HERC2 consists of 4834 amino acid residues, contains three RLDs, and contains a C-terminal HECT domain (Fig. 1A). It is thus a member of the HERC subfamily of HECT E3s (4Scheffner M. Staub O. BMC Biochem. 2007; 8: S6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Gonzalo F.R. Rosa J.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1826-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Due to its size, verification of the potential interaction of full-length HERC2 with E6AP in vitro cannot be readily achieved. However, in the yeast two-hybrid screen several independent clones encoding distinct but overlapping regions of HERC2 were obtained. The region that is common to all clones encompasses RLD2 (amino acid residues 2958–3326; Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1A) indicating that RLD2 interacts with E6AP. Indeed, GST pulldown experiments with in vitro translated radiolabeled E6AP revealed that RLD2 binds E6AP, whereas binding was not observed with RLD3, RLD1, or the isolated HECT domain of HERC2 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). This indicates that RLD2 is sufficient and likely necessary for binding of HERC2 to E6AP, although the possibility that other regions of HERC2 contribute to the interaction with E6AP cannot be excluded. Furthermore, coprecipitation experiments with various deletion mutants of E6AP translated in vitro (Fig. 1C) or expressed in bacteria (Fig. 1D) or expressed within cells (Fig. 1E) showed that the region spanning amino acid residues 150–200 of E6AP (numbering according to isoform 1 (11Yamamoto Y. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) is necessary and sufficient for E6AP to bind to HERC2. To provide evidence that endogenous E6AP and HERC2 are present in common complexes within cells, two approaches were used. Firstly, coprecipitation experiments were performed using cell extracts derived from E6AP null MEFs (prepared from Ube3a−/− embryos) or from wild-type MEFs (prepared from littermates and Ube3a+/+ embryos) (Fig. 2A). This showed that HERC2 can only be precipitated by an anti-E6AP antibody from extracts derived from wild-type MEFs demonstrating that endogenous HERC2 and E6AP can bind to each other. Secondly, H1299 cells with a stable knockdown of HERC2 expression were established by RNA interference (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2B, KD1299). Protein extracts derived from KD1299 cells and parental H1299 cells were applied to size-exclusion chromatography, and the fractionation behavior of HERC2 and E6AP was analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, in extracts derived from parental H1299 cells, E6AP fractionates in two peaks. One peak corresponds to a protein or protein complex with a molecular mass of >600 kDa and coincides with the presence of HERC2. The other protein peak migrates with a molecular mass of 90–120 kDa, corresponding to the mass of monomeric E6AP. Importantly, in KD1299 extracts, E6AP is not found in the high molecular mass fractions supporting the notion that endogenous HERC2 and E6AP are present in common complexes. Due to the high molecular mass of HERC2, it is not possible to conclude if other proteins are present in the HERC2-E6AP complex or if the complexes consist of E6AP and HERC2 only. Nonetheless, the results obtained in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid screen indicate that the interaction of E6AP and HERC2 does not require any additional proteins (i.e. E6AP and HERC2 interact directly). Because both E6AP and HERC2 are members of the HECT family of E3s, an obvious possibility is that HERC2 represents a substrate for E6AP and/or vice versa. In ubiquitination experiments in vitro, isolated RLD2 or an N-terminally truncated mutant of HERC2 spanning amino acid residues 2832–4834 are indeed ubiquitinated by E6AP. However, no evidence could be obtained in overexpression experiments, or in experiments in which endogenous E6AP expression was down-regulated by RNA interference (22Kuballa P. Matentzoglu K. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), that endogenous or ectopically expressed full-length HERC2 represent substrates for E6AP (data not shown). E6AP is known to ubiquitinate itself (“autoubiquitination”) in vitro (25Nuber U. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To obtain initial evidence that the interaction of E6AP with HERC2 has functional consequences, bacterially expressed RLD2 was added to an E6AP autoubiquitination reaction. This revealed that, under the conditions used, the kinetics of E6AP autoubiquitination is ∼2-fold faster in the presence of RLD2 (Fig. 3A). Although the effect of RLD2 on E6AP autoubiquitination is highly reproducible, different conditions were tested (e.g. limiting amounts of ubiquitin; see supplemental Fig. 2) to obtain more convincing evidence that binding of RLD2 stimulates the E3 activity of E6AP. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3B, a ubiquitin mutant termed ubLIA, in which Leu-8 and Ile-44 of wild-type ubiquitin were replaced by Ala, was employed. The mutations in ubLIA affect the hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin and, in consequence, ubLIA is compromised in its ability to interact with ubiquitin-binding proteins and is also less efficiently activated by E1 (28Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 29Dikic I. Wakatsuki S. Walters K.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the presence of ubLIA the kinetics of E6AP autoubiquitination was significantly slowed down (Fig. 3B; compare with Fig. 3A). More importantly, addition of RLD2 resulted in a significant stimulation of E6AP autoubiquitination. Furthermore, this effect is specific for RLD2, because it was not observed with RLD3 (Fig. 3B) or with an E6AP mutant that does not bind to RLD2 but is active in autoubiquitination (25Nuber U. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 3). We have recently shown that the ubiquitin ligase Ring1B represents a substrate for E6AP (18Zaaroor-Regev D. de Bie P. Scheffner M. Noy T. Shemer R. Heled M. Stein I. Pikarsky E. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6788-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, to investigate if the effect of RLD2 is restricted to E6AP autoubiquitination or if RLD2 in general acts as an activator of E6AP, E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of a Ring1B mutant, ΔRING-Ring1B, was studied (ΔRING-Ring1B was used as substrate rather than wild-type Ring1B, because, due to deletion of the RING domain, ΔRING-Ring1B does not function as an E3 ligase and in consequence cannot ubiquitinate itself. Thus, E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of ΔRING-Ring1B can be easily monitored) (23Ben-Saadon R. Zaaroor D. Ziv T. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, similar to E6AP autoubiquitination, E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of ΔRING-Ring1B was significantly stimulated in the presence of RLD2. Because we have not yet succeeded in generating bacterial or baculovirus-based expression constructs for full-length HERC2, we have not been able so far to determine in vitro whether the stimulatory effect of RLD2 is a peculiarity of the isolated domain or whether it can also be observed with full-length HERC2. However, we managed to ectopically express full-length HERC2 in HEK293T cells. This enabled us to ask the question as to whether HERC2 can stimulate E6AP activity within cells. To address this issue, the effect of full-length HERC2 on E6AP autoubiquitination and E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of ΔRING-Ring1B was determined in cotransfection experiments (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). The results obtained clearly indicate that both ubiquitination reactions are stimulated by HERC2. Furthermore, this stimulatory effect does not require a catalytically active form of HERC2, as it was observed in the presence of HERC2-C4762A, in which the catalytically active Cys residue of HERC2 was substituted by Ala. This indicates that the increase in ubiquitination observed in the presence of HERC2 was not due to HERC2-mediated ubiquitination of E6AP or Ring1B but that, similar to the in vitro situation, HERC2 acted as a stimulator of the E3 activity of E6AP. In this study, we have shown that the HECT E3 family members E6AP and HERC2 bind to each other and that HERC2 can stimulate the E3 activity of E6AP. Furthermore, the interaction of E6AP and HERC2 is not mediated via their HECT domains but rather by regions within the respective N-terminal extensions (Fig. 1A). Based on the fact that HERC2 consists of 4834 amino acids, we propose that HERC2 is a multifunctional protein and that one of its functions is to act as an allosteric activator of E6AP. Similar to the E6AP gene (UBE3A), the gene encoding HERC2 is located on chromosome 15q11–13 and is frequently deleted in patients with Angelman syndrome (10Nicholls R.D. Knepper J.L. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Although there is currently no evidence to indicate that loss of HERC2 activity contributes to the development of the Angelman syndrome, this does not exclude the possibility that, in neuronal cells, the activity of E6AP is in part controlled by HERC2. It was recently reported that E6AP regulates synapse development by targeting Arc, which is involved in internalization of glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (17Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. Ploegh H.L. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Steen J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus, to support the notion that HERC2 is involved in controlling E6AP activity in neurons, it was of immediate interest to determine if HERC2 can also stimulate E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of Arc. However, we have so far not been able to obtain any evidence that E6AP induces ubiquitination of Arc in vitro or in overexpression experiments (data not shown), neither in the absence nor in the presence of HERC2. This may indicate that additional factors (e.g. post-translational modification of Arc and/or E6AP) are involved in the interaction of E6AP with Arc or that Arc is not a direct target of E6AP (i.e. ubiquitination/degradation of Arc is mediated by another E3 enzyme that may be regulated by E6AP). Because HERC2 affects E6AP-mediated ubiquitination of Ring1B in vitro and in overexpression experiments within cells (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), we have looked into the possibility that knockdown of endogenous HERC2 expression by RNA interference affects Ring1B levels. The results obtained so far have been inconclusive. However, it should be noted that the effect of down-regulation of HERC2 expression on Ring1B levels maybe rather difficult to observe. For example, the effect of E6AP on Ring1B can be readily visualized by using Ring1B mutants devoid of E3 activity but is more difficult to observe with wild-type Ring1B (18Zaaroor-Regev D. de Bie P. Scheffner M. Noy T. Shemer R. Heled M. Stein I. Pikarsky E. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6788-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, E6AP may not be the only E3 enzyme involved in determining the half-life of Ring1B. Furthermore, although the efficiency of knockdown of HERC2 expression that we were able to achieve is rather good (approximately 90%), it is not complete and, thus, it is possible that the remaining level of HERC2 may suffice for stimulation of E6AP activity. HERC2 was recently reported to be involved in DNA repair processes and to interact with RNF8, RNF168, XPA, and BRCA1 (30Bekker-Jensen S. Rendtlew Danielsen J. Fugger K. Gromova I. Nerstedt A.

Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6384-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although BRCA1 and XPA appear to be substrates for HERC2 (31Kang T.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4890-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 32Wu W. Sato K. Koike A. Nishikawa H. Koizumi H. Venkitaraman A.R. Ohta T. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6384-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), RNF8 activity appears to be stimulated by HERC2 (30Bekker-Jensen S. Rendtlew Danielsen J. Fugger K. Gromova I. Nerstedt A. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mailand N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 (1–12): 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast to E6AP, however, the interaction of HERC2 with RNF8 involves the HECT domain of HERC2 suggesting that different mechanism are involved in HERC2-mediated stimulation of E6AP and of RNF8. Furthermore, we have so far not obtained any evidence that, through its interaction with HERC2, E6AP may be involved in DNA repair processes. In this context, it should be noted that spontaneous mutations in the murine Herc2 gene have been associated with the phenotypes of so-called rjs or jdf2 mice (33Lehman A.L. Nakatsu Y. Ching A. Bronson R.T. Oakey R.J. Keiper-Hrynko N. Finger J.N. Durham-Pierre D. Horton D.B. Newton J.M. Lyon M.F. Brilliant M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genome. 1999; 10: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although not contradictory, the phenotypes of these mice are not obviously linked to deficiencies in DNA repair pathways supporting the notion that HERC2 is a multifunctional protein. Furthermore, HERC2 was recently identified in a study searching for proteins that interact with the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein (35Vos R.M. Altreuter J. White E.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8885-8892Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence indicates that E6 can bind to HERC2 in an E6AP-dependent as well as in an E6AP-independent manner and that E6, E6AP, and HERC2 can form ternary complexes (supplemental Fig. 4). Thus, it will be interesting to determine if E6 can affect HERC2 function and vice versa. How does HERC2 stimulate E6AP activity? We have previously shown that autoubiquitination of E6AP occurs in trans rather than in cis (i.e. E6AP-E6AP interaction is required for autoubiquitination) (25Nuber U. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, obvious possibilities are that HERC2 induces E6AP multimerization or that, similar to the situation in the presence of the HPV E6 oncoprotein (36Kao W.H. Beaudenon S.L. Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6408-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), E6AP autoubiquitination occurs in cis. However, based on the notion that, unlike the E6 oncoprotein, the presence of RLD2 does not affect the amount of E6AP required in vitro to observe autoubiquitination (data not shown) both possibilities appear to be unlikely. An alternative possibility is that binding of HERC2 alters the conformation of the HECT domain of E6AP, affecting for example the kinetics of the final transfer of activated ubiquitin from the catalytic cysteine residue of E6AP to the receiving lysine residue of E6AP or of a substrate of E6AP. Unlike the HECT domain (37Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the structure of full-length E6AP has not been reported yet. Because the interaction of E6AP and HERC2 does not involve the HECT domain, elucidation of the mechanism, by which HERC2 stimulates E6AP activity, will probably have to await the solution of the structure of full-length E6AP in the absence and presence of RLD2.

Although insect odorant receptors have seven transmembrane domains like G-protein coupled receptors, they have an inverted membrane topology, constituting a key difference between the olfactory systems of insects and other animals. While heteromeric insect ORs form ligand-activated non-selective cation channels in recombinant expression systems, the evidence for an involvement of cyclic nucleotides and G-proteins in odor reception is inconsistent. We addressed this question in vivo by analyzing the role of G-proteins in olfactory signaling using electrophysiological recordings. We found that Gα(s) plays a crucial role for odorant induced signal transduction in OR83b expressing olfactory sensory neurons, but not in neurons expressing CO₂ responsive proteins GR21a/GR63a. Moreover, signaling of Drosophila ORs involved Gα(s) also in a heterologous expression system. In agreement with these observations was the finding that elevated levels of cAMP result in increased firing rates, demonstrating the existence of a cAMP dependent excitatory signaling pathway in the sensory neurons. Together, we provide evidence that Gα(s) plays a role in the OR mediated signaling cascade in Drosophila."

ADAM12-L and -S share a high overall sequence homology, differing only in the transmembrane domain (that ADAM12-S lacks) and a C terminus that is distinct in each isoform.

The role of the two isoforms of ADAM12 or mechanistic studies describing their functional role in cancer have been rare to date. In this report, we have utilized an in vivo orthotopic tumor model that reliably recapitulates human breast tumor growth to investigate the role of the two distinct isoforms of ADAM12 in the development of invasive breast cancer.ADAM12 can be detected in the urine of breast (8Roy R.

The discovery of ADAM12 as a potential biomarker for breast cancer begged the question of its relevance in human breast tumorigenesis. We show that overexpression of both ADAM12 isoforms in breast tumor cells promotes tumor growth and that only ADAM12-S expression stimulates their migration and invasion in vitro and local and distant invasion in vivo as a function of its proteolytic activity. We further show that both ADAM12-L and ADAM12-S expression levels are significantly higher in human malignant breast tissue and metastatic lymph nodes compared with normal breast tissue.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that urinary ADAM12 is predictive of disease status in breast cancer patients and that its levels in urine increase with progression of the disease. Increased levels of ADAM12 mRNA and protein have previously been reported in a number of cancers and tumor cell lines, suggesting an active role for ADAM12 in tumor progression. However, these studies did not identify either the causal role or the distinct contributions of either ADAM12 isoform in tumorigenesis. This study is the only one to date to describe a role for ADAM12 overexpression in human cancer cells using an orthotopic breast tumor model.IHC of a panel human breast tumors indicated that ADAM12 expression is up-regulated in primary tumors at early stages and is maintained at later stages of tumorigenesis and in metastatic LN. Of the matched sets of primary tumor tissue and metastatic LN analyzed in this study, a majority had positive expression of ADAM12 in both the primary tumor and matched LN, suggesting that ADAM12 expression may be essential for primary tumor growth as well as promoting and/or maintaining distant metastasis. Interestingly, within this cohort, ∼13% of the primary tumors did not stain positive for ADAM12, whereas their matched LNs did (Fig. 1D), suggesting that metastatic cells originating from primary tumors expressing low levels or no ADAM12 may up-regulate ADAM12 expression during the process of invasion and that ADAM12 function may be critical for the establishment of distant metastasis.This is the first report to analyze expression of both the transmembrane and secreted isoforms of ADAM12 in human breast cancer. Our data indicate that there is increased expression of both isoforms of ADAM12 in human breast cancer tissue. Interestingly, expression of the transmembrane isoform, ADAM12-L, was found to be slightly but significantly higher in early stages of breast tumorigenesis, whereas both forms are expressed in late-stage disease. The tumor stage-dependent differences in the expression levels of ADAM12 isoforms may result in their distinct contributions to the tumor growth and metastasis process. Increased expression of the transmembrane isoform, ADAM12-L, in Stage I and II breast cancer may reflect its role in promoting tumor growth, perhaps via its sheddase and growth factor receptor activation function. The high levels of ADAM12-S in late-stage human breast tumors support its potential role in tumor invasion and metastasis.ADAM12 expression and catalytic function has not previously been correlated with enhanced tumor cell proliferation, although its effect on the proliferation of normal cells has been reported. ADAM12-L was reported to regulate bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis in an HB-EGF- and EGFR-dependent manner (22Rocks N. Estrella C. Paulissen G. Quesada-Calvo F. Gilles C. Guéders M.M. Crahay C. Foidart J.M. Gosset P. Noel A. Cataldo D.D. Cell Prolif. 2008; 41: 988-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, ADAM12-L has been reported to enhance chondrocyte proliferation in osteoarthritis via the degradation of IGFBP-5 and increased bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor (23Okada A. Mochizuki S. Yatabe T. Kimura T. Shiomi T. Fujita Y. Matsumoto H. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Iwamoto Y. Okada Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 778-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, an increased expression of ADAM12-L in early-stage breast cancer, coupled with its unique sheddase function, may suggest a role for this protease in breast tumor growth in vivo. The secreted isoform, ADAM12-S, which is rarely expressed in normal adult tissue (placenta is an exception) and which we found to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local and distant metastasis in vivo, was expressed in late stage human breast tumors, indicating a potential role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Surprisingly, ADAM12 expression in human breast tumors appeared to be primarily epithelial rather than stromal. This is in contrast to mouse models of breast and prostate tumors, where ADAM12 staining was detected almost exclusively in the stroma (24Peduto L. Reuter V.E. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Shaffer D.R. Scher H.I. Blobel C.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This difference suggests that the ADAM12-overexpressing orthotopic breast tumor model, used in this study, may reliably recapitulate human breast tumor growth compared with other models.Two recent studies have begun to investigate a role for ADAM12 in tumorigenesis using transgenic mouse models. One report used the mouse mammary tumor virus-polyomavirus middle T oncogene (MMTV-PyMT) mouse breast tumor model to show that ADAM12 transcripts were strongly up-regulated in the stromal cell subpopulation adjacent to epithelial tumor cells, which were largely negative for ADAM12 expression (24Peduto L. Reuter V.E. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Shaffer D.R. Scher H.I. Blobel C.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5462-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In a gain of function study, transgenic overexpression of human ADAM12 in MMTV-PyMT mice was reported to accelerate breast tumor progression and increase tumor burden and aggressiveness (25Kveiborg M. Fröhlich C. Albrechtsen R. Tischler V. Dietrich N. Holck P. Kronqvist P. Rank F. Mercurio A.M. Wewer U.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This report attributed the effect of Adam 12 on tumor growth to its opposing effects on apoptosis (i.e. ADAM12 expression increased sensitivity of stromal cells to apoptosis but rendered tumor cells resistant to apoptosis). However, this observed effect of ADAM12 on apoptosis was independent of its proteolytic function (25Kveiborg M. Fröhlich C. Albrechtsen R. Tischler V. Dietrich N. Holck P. Kronqvist P. Rank F. Mercurio A.M. Wewer U.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although we observe a similar decrease in apoptotic rates in ADAM12-expressing breast tumor cells, our results are in contrast to the previous study in that our data indicate that catalytic activity of the secreted isoform, ADAM12-S, is essential for its protumorigenic and prometastatic effects in vitro as well as in vivo. In the case of the transmembrane isoform, we cannot rule out the possibility that the cysteine-rich, disintegrin or cytoplasmic domains of ADAM12-L may independently influence its tumorigenic potential. It is widely appreciated that use of the MMTV-PyMT model results in rapid development of multifocal mammary adenocarcinomas as well as local and distant metastasis, regardless of the expression of the gene/protein of interest, making it difficult to rigorously and fairly relegate any effects observed specifically to ADAM12. To address this, we have tested the effects of ADAM12 overexpression in the breast tumor epithelium in a less aggressive tumor model, which provides the opportunity to more clearly assess the potential role of this protease in the initial establishment of the human breast tumors (tumor take), growth, and metastasis. Using human cancer cells in an in vivo orthotopic breast tumor model, we demonstrate that ADAM12 expression significantly increased tumor take and tumor growth.We have recently reported that ADAM12 expression in breast tumor cells results in up-regulation of alternative growth pathways (18Roy R. Moses M.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). Expression of ADAM12-L resulted in increased amphiregulin shedding and a concomitant up-regulation of EGFR protein expression and activation, ultimately resulting in estrogen-independent breast tumor cell proliferation. Similarly, increased ADAM12-S expression resulted in up-regulation of pIGF-1R and pMAPK levels in breast tumor cells (18Roy R. Moses M.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, one might speculate that ADAM12-induced higher tumor growth rates observed in this study may be associated with its effect on the up-regulation of alternative growth pathways. In the case of the secreted isoform, ADAM12-S, the tumor-promoting activity was a function of its catalytic function because cells expressing the enzymatically inactive form of the protease had tumor take rates and tumor volumes similar to parental MCF-7 cells.Comparative analysis of ADAM12 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines indicated that expression is significantly elevated in highly invasive, estrogen-receptor-negative lines such as MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T as compared with low metastatic, estrogen-responsive lines such as MCF-7 and T47-D. To begin to understand the contribution of the distinct isoforms of ADAM12 in promoting breast tumorigenesis, we established stable clones that overexpress ADAM12-L, ADAM12-S, and ADAM12-Scatmut, respectively, in MCF-7 cells. Expression of ADAM12-S resulted in increased migration and invasion of MCF-7 and T47-D breast tumor cells. This effect was specific for ADAM12-S, as silencing of expression led to a reversal of increased migration. Therefore, the metalloprotease function of ADAM12-S is crucial for the stimulation of migration because MCF-7 cells expressing the catalytically inactive form of the protein do not display increased migration in vitro. Interestingly, ADAM12-L-expressing cells did not display a similar increase in migratory capacity. This effect was recapitulated in the in vivo tumor studies. ADAM12-S tumors had increased local invasion of the surrounding area, a higher incidence of vascular invasion, a significantly higher incidence of LN metastasis (40%), as well as lung colonization of individual tumor cells (38%) as compared with WT MCF-7 tumors that displayed no LN or lung colonization. The ADAM12-l-expressing tumors were moderately invasive (LN metastasis, 21% and lung colonies, 20%). However, these rates were not found to be significantly higher than WT MCF-7-tumor-bearing animals. Our data suggests that expression of the secreted isoform, ADAM12-S, but not the transmembrane isoform, ADAM12-L, selectively increased local tumor invasion and incidence of vascular invasion and promoted significantly higher incidence of LN metastasis as well as lung colonization as compared with WT MCF-7 tumors. Interestingly, ADAM12 appears to exert distinct and opposing effects on tumor versus normal cell migration. For example, ADAM12 was reported to inhibit Chinese hamster ovary cell migration, although this activity was independent of its catalytic function (26Huang J. Bridges L.C. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4982-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, ADAM12-deficient keratinocytes migrated significantly more than wild-type keratinocytes in a wound-healing mouse model (27Harsha A. Stojadinovic O. Brem H. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Wewer U. Loomis C.A. Blobel C.P. Tomic-Canic M. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Importantly, both of these studies were conducted with normal cells, and neither of these studies explored isoform-specific effects on cell migration. Our results suggest that the secreted isoform, ADAM12-S, enhances the migratory and invasive capacity of breast tumor cells, thereby allowing malignant cells to locally invade as well as to form distant metastasis. Therefore, in normal tissue, ADAM12 may inhibit cell migration by mediating cell adhesion via integrin interactions, whereas, in tumor cells, higher levels of ADAM12-S proteolytic function stimulate cell migration and invasion. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the effect of the secreted isoform, ADAM12-S, on tumor cell migration and invasion as well as tumor metastasis is mediated via integrin interactions, it has been previously reported that several ADAM family members can cleave extracellular matrix proteins (28Roy R. Zhang B. Moses M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 608-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, given that the effect of ADAM12-S on tumor cell migration and invasion is dependent on catalytic function, it is probable that ADAM12-S stimulates migration and invasion via ECM cleavage and remodeling. Experiments exploring the mechanism by which ADAM12 may exert its effects of tumor proliferation and invasion are currently being conducted.Our study establishes distinct roles for ADAM12 isoforms in breast tumor progression and in local and distant tumor metastasis. These findings reflect the increased expression of ADAM12 in human breast cancer and metastatic lymph nodes and highlight the therapeutic potential of down-regulating or targeting ADAM12 in breast cancer, perhaps through the development of ADAM12-specific inhibitors (29Kveiborg M. Jacobsen J. Lee M.H. Nagase H. Wewer U.M. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 2010; 430: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).

The discovery of ADAM12 as a potential biomarker for breast cancer begged the question of its relevance in human breast tumorigenesis. We show that overexpression of both ADAM12 isoforms in breast tumor cells promotes tumor growth and that only ADAM12-S expression stimulates their migration and invasion in vitro and local and distant invasion in vivo as a function of its proteolytic activity. We further show that both ADAM12-L and ADAM12-S expression levels are significantly higher in human malignant breast tissue and metastatic lymph nodes compared with normal breast tissue. Human ADAM12 (meltrin α, MCMP) is expressed as two alternatively spliced forms, a membrane-anchored long form (ADAM12-L) and a short secreted form (ADAM12-S) (1Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2049653566,"Prior studies have shown that treatment with the peracetylated 4-fluorinated analog of glucosamine (4-F-GlcNAc) elicits anti-skin inflammatory activity by ablating N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), sialyl Lewis X (sLe(X)), and related lectin ligands on effector leukocytes. Based on anti-sLe(X) antibody and lectin probing experiments on 4-F-GlcNAc-treated leukocytes, it was hypothesized that 4-F-GlcNAc inhibited sLe(X) formation by incorporating into LacNAc and blocking the addition of galactose or fucose at the carbon 4-position of 4-F-GlcNAc. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether 4-F-GlcNAc is directly incorporated into N- and O-glycans released from 4-F-GlcNAc-treated human sLe(X) (+) T cells and leukemic KG1a cells. At concentrations that abrogated galectin-1 (Gal-1) ligand and E-selectin ligand expression and related LacNAc and sLe(X) structures, MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analyses showed that 4-F-GlcNAc 1) reduced content and structural diversity of tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans and of O-glycans, 2) increased biantennary N-glycans, and 3) reduced LacNAc and sLe(X) on N-glycans and on core 2 O-glycans. Moreover, MALDI-TOF MS did not reveal any m/z ratios relating to the presence of fluorine atoms, indicating that 4-F-GlcNAc did not incorporate into glycans. Further analysis showed that 4-F-GlcNAc treatment had minimal effect on expression of 1200 glycome-related genes and did not alter the activity of LacNAc-synthesizing enzymes. However, 4-F-GlcNAc dramatically reduced intracellular levels of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a key precursor of LacNAc synthesis. These data show that Gal-1 and E-selectin ligand reduction by 4-F-GlcNAc is not caused by direct 4-F-GlcNAc glycan incorporation and consequent chain termination but rather by interference with UDP-GlcNAc synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1981128262,"The volatile microbial metabolite 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is a root cause of taste and odor issues in freshwater. Although current evidence suggests that 2-MIB is not toxic, this compound degrades water quality and presents problems for water treatment. To address these issues, cyanobacteria and actinomycetes, the major producers of 2-MIB, have been investigated extensively. In this study, two 2-MIB producing strains, coded as Pseudanabaena sp. and Planktothricoids raciborskii, were used in order to elucidate the genetic background, light regulation, and biochemical mechanisms of 2-MIB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. Genome walking and PCR methods revealed that two adjacent genes, SAM-dependent methyltransferanse gene and monoterpene cyclase gene, are responsible for GPP methylation and subsequent cyclization to 2-MIB in cyanobacteria. These two genes are located in between two homologous cyclic nucleotide-binding protein genes that may be members of the Crp-Fnr regulator family. Together, this sequence of genes forms a putative operon. The synthesis of 2-MIB is similar in cyanobacteria and actinomycetes. Comparison of the gene arrangement and functional sites between cyanobacteria and other organisms revealed that gene recombination and gene transfer probably occurred during the evolution of 2-MIB-associated genes. All the microorganisms examined have a common origin of 2-MIB biosynthesis capacity, but cyanobacteria represent a unique evolutionary lineage. Gene expression analysis suggested that light is a crucial, but not the only, active regulatory factor for the transcription of 2-MIB synthesis genes. This light-regulated process is immediate and transient. This study is the first to identify the genetic background and evolution of 2-MIB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, thus enhancing current knowledge on 2-MIB contamination of freshwater."
https://openalex.org/W1975712574,"The Asia-specific PLA2G7 994G-T transversion leads to V279F substitution within the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA₂) and to absence of enzyme activity in plasma. This variant offers a unique natural experiment to assess the role of Lp-PLA₂ in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans. Given conflicting results from mostly small studies, a large two-stage case-control study was warranted.PLA2G7 V279F genotypes were initially compared in 2890 male cases diagnosed with CAD before age 60 with 3128 male controls without CAD at age 50 and above and subsequently in a second independent male dataset of 877 CAD cases and 1230 controls. In the first dataset, the prevalence of the 279F null allele was 11.5% in cases and 12.8% in controls. After adjustment for age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, glucose and lipid levels, the OR (95% CI) for CAD for this allele was 0.80 (0.66-0.97, p = 0.02). The results were very similar in the second dataset, despite lower power, with an allele frequency of 11.2% in cases and 12.5% in controls, leading to a combined OR of 0.80 (0.69-0.92), p = 0.002. The magnitude and direction of this genetic effect were fully consistent with large epidemiological studies on plasma Lp-PLA₂ activity and CAD risk.Natural deficiency in Lp-PLA₂ activity due to carriage of PLA2G7 279F allele protects from CAD in Korean men. These results provide evidence for a causal relationship between Lp-PLA₂ and CAD, and support pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme as an innovative way to prevent CAD."
https://openalex.org/W1971772440,"The majority of managed forests in Fennoscandia are younger than 70 years old but yet little is known about their potential to host rare and threatened species. In this study, we examined red-listed bryophytes and lichens in 19 young stands originating from clear-cutting (30–70 years old) in the boreal region, finding 19 red-listed species (six bryophytes and 13 lichens). We used adjoining old stands, which most likely never had been clear-cut, as reference. The old stands contained significantly more species, but when taking the amount of biological legacies (i.e., remaining deciduous trees and dead wood) from the previous forest generation into account, bryophyte species number did not differ between old and young stands, and lichen number was even higher in young stands. No dispersal effect could be detected from the old to the young stands. The amount of wetlands in the surroundings was important for bryophytes, as was the area of old forest for both lichens and bryophytes. A cardinal position of young stands to the north of old stands was beneficial to red-listed bryophytes as well as lichens. We conclude that young forest plantations may function as habitat for red-listed species, but that this depends on presence of structures from the previous forest generation, and also on qualities in the surrounding landscape. Nevertheless, at repeated clear-cuttings, a successive decrease in species populations in young production stands is likely, due to increased fragmentation and reduced substrate amounts. Retention of dead wood and deciduous trees might be efficient conservation measures. Although priority needs to be given to preservation of remnant old-growth forests, we argue that young forests rich in biological legacies and located in landscapes with high amounts of old forests may have a conservation value."
https://openalex.org/W1975549226,"Mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) has an unidentified toxic property that provokes ALS. Several ALS-linked SOD1 mutations cause long C-terminal truncations, which suggests that common cytotoxic SOD1 conformational species should be misfolded and that the C-terminal end cannot be involved. The cytotoxicity may arise from interaction of cellular proteins with misfolded SOD1 species. Here we specifically immunocaptured misfolded SOD1 by the C-terminal end, from extracts of spinal cords from transgenic ALS model mice. Associated proteins were identified with proteomic techniques.

For comparison, proteins in spinal cord extracts with affinity for immobilized apo G93A mutant SOD1 were determined. Two-dimensional gel patterns with a limited number of bound proteins were found, which were similar for the two SOD1 mutants. Apart from neurofilament light, the proteins identified were all chaperones and by far most abundant was Hsc70. The immobilized apo G93A SOD1, which would populate a variety of conformations, was found to bind to a considerable number of additional proteins. A substantial proportion of the misfolded SOD1 in the spinal cord extracts appeared to be chaperone-associated. Still, only about 1% of the Hsc70 appeared to be associated with misfolded SOD1.

Overall, about 6% of all cases with ALS show SOD1 mutations, and more than 160 such mutations have been identified (2Wroe R. Wai-Ling Butler A. Andersen P.M. Powell J.F. Al-Chalabi A. Amyotroph. Lateral. Scler. 2008; 9: 249-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mutations confer a cytotoxic gain of function of unknown character to the enzyme (3Andersen P.M. Nilsson P.

The ALS-linked mutant SOD1s, including nine with long C-terminal truncations, are likely to cause ALS by essentially the same mechanism. In the shortest of these the native sequence ends with Leu-117 followed by four novel amino acids and a premature stop codon. The truncated mutants lack the stabilizing Cys-57—Cys-146 disulfide bond and β-strand 8 of the β-barrel core of the protein, and should show limited native folding. Thus, any cytotoxic conformational species common to the ALS-linked SOD1 mutations should be misfolded. Furthermore, the C-terminal end cannot be involved in the cytotoxicity. One conceivable mechanism by which such misfolded SOD1 species might provoke the disease is through interaction with essential cellular proteins that could become inactivated, depleted, or erroneously activated. We have previously shown that misfolded SOD1 species are enriched in spinal cords from mice expressing mutant human SOD1s (hSOD1s) (5Zetterström P. Stewart H.G. Bergemalm D. Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S.

These species account for minute subfractions of the stable hSOD1 mutants G93A and D90A, and major portions of the small amounts of the unstable G85R and G127insTGGG (G127X) mutant hSOD1s present in spinal cords. Here we used novel antibodies to specifically capture misfolded hSOD1 species via their C-terminal ends from spinal cord extracts taken from transgenic model mice expressing mutant hSOD1s of widely different physical properties. Proteins associated with the captured hSOD1s were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis separation and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (two-dimensional gel/MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis.

The mice used were around 100 days old. The use and maintenance of the mice and the experimental protocol described in this article were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Research at Umeå University. Mice were killed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. The spinal cord was dissected by cutting the vertebral column at the base of the skull and just above the hip bone. A syringe was inserted at the lower opening and the spinal cord was flushed out with 0.15 m NaCl. Rat spinal cords were dissected in the same way. The spinal cords were homogenized with an Ultraturrax apparatus (IKA, Staufen, Germany) for 1 min and sonication for 1 min at 4 °C in 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, in 0.15 m NaCl) supplemented with 1.8 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and the antiproteolytic mixture Complete® without EDTA (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants collected. To determine the proportion of hSOD1 that was pelleted in the centrifugation, 500 μl of homogenates from three 100-day-old G93A and G127X hSOD1 transgenic mice were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants carefully removed. 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer was gently added to the tubes to remove any residual supernatant with soluble SOD1 without disrupting the pellets. There was no resuspension and washing of the pellet with homogenization buffer since the aim was to measure the primarily pelleted hSOD1. This step was repeated twice. The pellets were then suspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer by sonication, mixed with SDS/PAGE sample buffer to a final SDS concentration of 2%, boiled and subjected to Western immunoblotting together with the supernatants. Antibodies to peptides corresponding to amino acids 131–153 in hSOD1 and amino acids 123–132 in the G127X mutant hSOD1 variant were raised in rabbits as previously described (6Jonsson P.A. Ernhill K.

After purification with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and Sulfolink peptide affinity purification (Pierce), the antibodies were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose-Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) at 2 mg/g wet gel. Typically, 100 mg wet weight of specific ab-Sepharose was incubated with an extract of two spinal cords for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Prior to this incubation, the extract had been pre-cleared with the same amount of non-immune IgG-Sepharose. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant with unbound proteins was removed. The ab-Sepharose gel beads were then washed twice, first with 50 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and then with 50 ml of PBS, and then gently pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g. The bound SOD1 was released by 60 min of incubation at 23 °C with 1 ml PBS containing 30 μg of the peptide used for immunization. The Sepharose beads were removed by filtration through an Ultrafree-CL centrifugal filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The proteins released were then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold acetone, and dissolved in 200 μl of DeStreak Rehydration Solution (GE Healthcare). Recombinant hSOD1s were expressed in Escherichia coli together with the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) and purified as described elsewhere (8Ahl I.M. Lindberg M.J. Tibell L.A. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They carried cysteine to alanine mutations at positions 6 and 111 to avoid disulfide oligomerization during experiments. For immobilization, wild-type hSOD1 or G93A mutant hSOD1 were dialyzed with 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3, at 4 °C overnight and were immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose at 6 mg/g wet gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the remaining active groups on the gel were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine for 60 min at 23 °C. To remove electrostatically bound proteins, the gel beads were washed four cycles with 0.1 m Tris-HCl in 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.5, followed by 0.1 m sodium acetate in 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.5. To render the hSOD1s in apo form, the gel beads were treated for 4 h with 4 m guanidinium-Cl and 25 mm EDTA in 33 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.7, at 23 °C and then washed with large volumes of PBS. Gels with bound holo- or apo-hSOD1 were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 20 volumes of rat spinal cord homogenate, typically 5 ml of homogenate to 250 mg of wet gel beads. The extracts used were pre-cleared with the same amount ethanolamine-blocked CNBr-Sepharose. The gels were then washed twice with 100 ml of PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. The gel beads were recovered by fast filtration through a 5-μm nylon filter (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA). The gels were dried in a SpeedVac apparatus (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at low temperature, and the bound proteins were released by incubation with DeStreak buffer for 90 min at 23 °C. Samples were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described elsewere (9Bergemalm D. Forsberg K. Srivastava V. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brännström T. Wingsle G. Marklund S.L. J. Neurochem. 2010; 114: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) except that 10–14.5% or 12.5% Criterion precast gels (Bio-Rad) were used for the second dimension. The gels were stained with Coomassie G-250 for protein identification, or silver stained for pattern analysis as described elsewhere (10Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Protein identification was carried out as described elsewhere (11Bergemalm D. Forsberg K. Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Brännström T. Andersen P.M. Antti H. Marklund S.L. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 1306-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, spots were excised from Coomassie G-250 stained gels and digested with trypsin (V511a: 2 μg/ml; Promega, Madison, WI). Peptide spectra were recorded in a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Peptide peak lists generated in Data Explorer software version 4 (Applied Biosystems) were used to identify proteins by searching the Swiss-Prot database (version 50.9) using an in-house Mascot server that was licensed to Umeå University by Matrix Science (Boston, MA). Search parameters were set to allow mass deviations of ±50 ppm and one or two missed cleavage sites, as well as the fixed modification carbamidomethylation of cysteine and the variable modification oxidation of methionine. Identifications that were statistically significant (with a Mowse score of at least 60 and a p value of < 0.05) and that showed a gel position close to the theoretical mass and isoelectric point were regarded as positive. The Western immunoblots were generally carried out as previously described (6Jonsson P.A. Ernhill K. Andersen P.M. Bergemalm D. Brännström T. Gredal O. Nilsson P. Marklund S.L. Brain. 2004; 127: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) using an antibody raised in chicken against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 57–72 of the hSOD1 sequence. For quantification of hSOD1 in pellets an antibody raised in rabbits against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 24–39 of the hSOD1 sequence was used. For Hsc70, a rat monoclonal antibody (ab19136; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used. The chemiluminescence of the blots was recorded in a ChemiDoc apparatus and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The aim of the present study was to identify proteins that bind to misfolded hSOD1 in spinal cord extracts from mice expressing two different mutant hSOD1s. The G93A hSOD1 transgenic model shows the highest levels of misfolded hSOD1 in the spinal cords of the transgenic models examined so far (5Zetterström P. Stewart H.G. Bergemalm D. Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brännström T. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14157-14162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Even so, only about 3% of the G93A mutant hSOD1 is misfolded. The truncated G127X hSOD1 is completely disordered structurally and is present at a somewhat lower level in the spinal cord than misfolded hSOD1 in G93A mice (5Zetterström P. Stewart H.G. Bergemalm D. Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brännström T. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14157-14162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To capture misfolded hSOD1 from the G93A mice, we used an antibody raised to a peptide sequence at the C-terminal end of hSOD1 (amino acids 131–153). The antibody shows almost complete specificity for misfolded hSOD1 species (Fig. 1A). For the G127X mice, an anti-peptide antibody was similarly used (raised to amino acids 123–132 at the C-terminal end; 128–132 being a novel sequence caused by the 4 nucleotide insertion in the G127X SOD1 mutation). This antibody does not recognize folded or misfolded hSOD1 with the native C-terminal sequence (6Jonsson P.A. Ernhill K. Andersen P.M. Bergemalm D. Brännström T. Gredal O. Nilsson P. Marklund S.L. Brain. 2004; 127: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The antibodies were covalently coupled to Sepharose and incubated with spinal cord extracts. The bound misfolded SOD1 was then released from the beads by incubation with the corresponding immunization peptides. The advantage of this mild procedure is that proteins that non-specifically adhere to the beads are released only to a limited extent, resulting in relatively clean two-dimensional gel patterns. Because both of these antibodies recognize parts of the hSOD1 sequence that is absent in some of the ALS-linked truncation mutants, they should not interfere with any protein interaction relevant to ALS pathogenesis. Fig. 2A shows the silver-stained two-dimensional gel patterns of G93A spinal cord extract proteins bound to and released from 131–153-abSepharose beads. In addition to hSOD1, several other protein spots were found. To control for unspecific protein adhesion and release from the beads, the 131–153-abSepharose was also incubated with spinal cord extracts from C57Bl6 control mice and G127X transgenic mice (Fig. 2, C and D). In a further control, we incubated a pre-immune IgG-Sepharose preparation with G93A spinal cord extracts (Fig. 2E). Typically, a few proteins/spots were seen in control experiments, most of them being apparently the same. The 131–153 antibody did bind some unspecific proteins, as they appeared in both controls with 131–153-abSepharose but not with IgG-Sepharose or the G127X hSOD1-specific antibody. These spots are marked with an asterisk in Fig. 2, A, C, and D. Despite pre-clearing with IgG-Sepharose gel, extensive washing, and use of different detergents, some spots remained on the control gels. These proteins (spots) were not considered to specifically bind to misfolded SOD1, and they were not considered further. The binding proteins identified are marked on the two-dimensional gel image (Fig. 2A) and are listed in Table 1. The train of spots at about 16 kDa is hSOD1. By far the most abundant interacting protein was found to be Hsc70. It is notable that 3 of the other proteins found are also chaperones: Hsp74 and HS70A, which are cytosolic, and the endoplasmatic reticulum-resident Grp78. Next to Hsc70, β-tubulin was the strongest spot in the gel. However, both β-tubulin and β-actin showed highly variable contents in the immunocapture experiments, and they were also present in control incubations to a variable extent, sometimes stronger in the control gels than in the gels with specific antibodies used for capture (Fig. 2F). Thus, we cannot say with any certainty whether they specifically bind to misfolded SOD1. Hsc70 spots were also seen in Fig. 2F, but at levels far below those seen when misfolded SOD1 was captured (Fig. 2, A and B). We thus consider the interaction between Hsc70 and misfolded SOD1 to be real and specific.TABLE 1Proteins binding to misfolded SOD1 in extracts of spinal cord of transgenic miceProteinAbbreviationAccession no.

Incubation of the G127X-specific antibody with a G93A spinal cord extract gave results that resembled those of previous controls (Fig. 2F). To determine the distribution of hSOD1 between the soluble supernatant phase and the 20,000 × g pellets, the hSOD1 content in three pellets each from G93A and G127X experiments were determined. The pellets were found to contain 5.4 ± 1.2% and 5.5 ± 0.3%, respectively, of the total hSOD1 in the homogenates (Fig. 1B). Thus relatively small proportions of the total hSOD1 are present in non-disrupted tissue, debris, and in aggregates in the 100-day-old mice examined. At 100 days the G127X mice are far from symptomatic, whereas mild symptoms sometimes are present in G93A mice. Still, only small amounts of aggregates are present in G93A mice at that stage (12Karch C.M. Prudencio M. Winkler D.D. Hart P.J. Borchelt D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7774-7779Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For comparison, we analyzed proteins that bound to recombinant G93A mutant or to recombinant wild-type hSOD1 immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose. The preparations were incubated with extracts of rat spinal cord. Rats transgenically expressing mutant hSOD1s also develop ALS (13Nagai M. Aoki M. Miyoshi I. Kato M. Pasinelli P. Kasai N. Brown Jr., R.H. Itoyama Y. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9246-9254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, any ALS-causing interactions between hSOD1 and spinal cord proteins should also occur in the rat. First, proteins binding to holo hSOD1s were determined. Few interacting proteins were found and large amounts of hSOD1 were released with the interacting proteins (Fig. 3B). Holo hSOD1 is a dimer and hSOD1 bound to the Sepharose gel via only one subunit can easily be released. Another uncertainty is that the covalent coupling as well as the harsh post-coupling treatments might have rendered a fraction of the hSOD1 molecules un/misfolded. This fraction might have interacted with some of the proteins. Because of this uncertainty and the evidence that un/misfolded hSOD1 species might be more relevant for ALS pathogenesis we focused on immobilized apo hSOD1s. These were prepared by exposure of the gel beads to 4 m guanidinium-Cl and the chelator EDTA. The resulting beads should contain apo hSOD1 bound in random positions populating a variety of conformations from complete disorder to native folding (14Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These preparations were incubated with rat spinal cord extracts in the same way. Following washing, bound proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel separation and MALDI-TOF/MS analysis (Fig. 3). The patterns seen with G93A mutant hSOD1 and wild-type hSOD1 were qualitatively similar, but the amounts of bound protein were greater with the mutant. Despite the considerably larger amounts of hSOD1 and extracted proteins involved, only moderately more protein appeared to be present on the gels compared with the immunocapture experiments with extracts from G93A transgenic mice (Fig. 2). The patterns were, however, different with markedly less Hsc70 and a far greater number of protein spots. Especially with the apoG93A hSOD1, several spots were below the MALDI-TOF/MS detection limit (Fig. 3). All proteins seen in the immunocapture experiments were identified, except Hsp74 and HS70A (Table 2). All protein spots seen in the experiments with immobilized holo hSOD1 (Fig. 3B) appeared to be present in the studies with apo hSOD1s.TABLE 2Proteins in rat spinal cord extracts interacting with immobilized apoG93A hSOD1ProteinAbbreviationAccession no.

To determine the proportion of spinal cord Hsc70 that bound misfolded hSOD1, 131–153-abSepharose was added to spinal cord extracts from G93A and wild-type hSOD1 transgenic mice. In the case of G127X mice, the mutant-specific 123–132 antibody was used. Following washing, the gel beads were boiled in sample buffer, and bound Hsc70 was quantified against dilutions of a G93A spinal cord extract (Fig. 4). The proportions detected for the mutants barely reached 1% of the total amount of Hsc70. Some Hsc70 was bound to misfolded SOD1 in spinal cord tissue from wild-type hSOD1 transgenic mice (0.2%) but none could be detected in non-transgenic littermates (not shown). The precise degree of association between Hsc70 and hSOD1 is difficult to assess, because of limitations in the experiments with the immobilized polyclonal antibodies. Some of the bound hSOD1 is likely to be lost from the antibody gels during the washing. To get an idea of the magnitude, the amount of G127X hSOD1 present in the sample buffer extract from the 123–132-abSepharose was compared with the total amount of mutant protein in the spinal cord extract before and after immunocapture. All the G127X hSOD1 was found to be captured from the extract, but only about 50% of that was recovered in the sample buffer extract. Thus, the true figures for the proportion of Hsc70 that bound to misfolded hSOD1 could, broadly speaking, be double those in Fig. 4. Notably, there might also be some reversal of Hsc70 binding to hSOD1 during the washing of the gel beads. In this study, we used immunocapture of misfolded SOD1 and general proteomic techniques to search for interacting proteins without preconceived ideas. The aim was to identify the proteins that interacted with soluble misfolded hSOD1 in spinal cords from two strains of transgenic ALS mice. At the time point chosen (100-day-old) the G93A mice sometimes show mild symptoms where as the G127X mice are presymtomatic. However, very little hSOD1 is aggregated at this time point (Fig. 1B). Thus, in the present study any potentially noxious protein interactions with hSOD1 are likely to take place in the soluble phase. We found that the major proteins that interact with soluble misfolded hSOD1 in murine spinal cords are all chaperones (Table 1). The fact that they were the same for G93A and G127X mice shows that the 26 C-terminal amino acids are not involved in the interactions. By far the most important was Hsc70, which appeared to complex with a substantial proportion of the misfolded hSOD1. Association of misfolded hSOD1 in spinal cord extracts with Hsc70 has also been observed previously (15Wang J. Farr G.W. Zeiss C.J. Rodriguez-Gil D.J. Wilson J.H. Furtak K. Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Ruse C.I. Yates 3rd, J.R. Perrin S. Feany M.B. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Watanabe Y. Morita E. Fukada Y. Doi K. Yasui K. Kitayama M. Nakano T. Nakashima K. PLoS. One. 2008; 3: e3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and also in cell culture models (17Choi J.S. Cho S. Park S.G. Park B.C. Lee D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using proteomic methods. Hsc70 has also been found to co-aggregate with hSOD1 in inclusions in transgenic animal models (9Bergemalm D. Forsberg K. Srivastava V. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brännström T. Wingsle G. Marklund S.L. J. Neurochem. 2010; 114: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The inclusions also contained Grp78 and NF-L, suggesting that proteins that interact with soluble misfolded SOD1 also tend to co-aggregate. The constitutively expressed Hsc70 is enriched in the nervous system relative to levels found in peripheral tissues (18Manzerra P. Rush S.J. Brown I.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The levels are higher in neurons than in other CNS cells, and are particularly high in motor neurons (19Chen S. Brown I.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007; 12: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Still, the shielding with Hsc70 is not sufficient to prevent hSOD1-induced cytotoxicity. This inability is not related to depletion of chaperoning capacity, because only a small proportion of the Hsc70 was found to be occupied in binding of misfolded hSOD1. A caveat is that we analyzed whole tissue in this study. Ventral horns account for 20% of the murine spinal cord (20Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Brännström T. Nilsson P. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2006; 65: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and motor neurons constitute 20% of the volume of ventral horns (21Burke R.E. Marks W.E. Computational Neuroanatomy: Principles and Methods. 48th Ed. Humana, Totowa, NJ2002Google Scholar). If the major proportion of the complexing between Hsc70 and misfolded hSOD1 takes place in motor neurons, a depletion situation might exist. It is, however, well established that mutant hSOD1 has noxious effects on multiple cell types in the motor areas (22Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Other transgenic models have lower levels of misfolded SOD1 (5Zetterström P. Stewart H.G. Bergemalm D. Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brännström T. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 14157-14162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and should sequester a smaller proportion of the Hsc70. Finally, considerably less would be occupied in humans who express the mutant hSOD1s at some 50-fold lower rates than the transgenic murine models (23Jonsson P.A. Graffmo K.S. Andersen P.M. Brännström T. Lindberg M. Oliveberg M. Marklund S.L. Brain. 2006; 129: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This suggests that depletion of chaperone capacity is not a feature of mutant hSOD1-provoked ALS, as has been proposed (24Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9010-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Accordingly, overexpression of Hsp70 (a functionally similar homolog of Hsc70) does not ameliorate disease caused by mutant hSOD1s in transgenic mice (25Liu J. Shinobu L.A. Ward C.M. Young D. Cleveland D.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The heat shock protein coinducer arimoclomol, which induces several chaperones concomitantly, does however prolong survival of G93A mice (26Kieran D. Kalmar B. Dick J.R. Riddoch-Contreras J. Burnstock G. Greensmith L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It has not been tested in mice with lower levels of misfolded hSOD1. A clinical trial with arimoclomol is currently being conducted in ALS patients carrying SOD1 mutations (27Lanka V. Wieland S. Barber J. Cudkowicz M. Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2009; 18: 1907-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), to evaluate its role in humans. Most of the immunocaptured proteins were molecular chaperones in the present study (Table 1); no interaction partner for misfolded SOD1 was found that could explain the cytotoxicity of mutant SOD1 in ALS. In addition to those found here, more than 30 proteins have been reported to interact with mutant SOD1s (16Watanabe Y. Morita E. Fukada Y. Doi K. Yasui K. Kitayama M. Nakano T. Nakashima K. PLoS. One. 2008; 3: e3497Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28Jain M.R. Ge W.W. Elkabes S. Li H. Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2008; 2: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A number of reasons for why they were not found can be suggested. We wanted to detect associations that did not involve the C-terminal end, and that only involved misfolded SOD1 species, because we considered that only those would be relevant. Speculatively, some of the previous findings could have involved associations with C-terminal segments as well as with more natively folded hSOD1 species. In the study with immobilized apo G93A, many more protein spots were indeed visible and identified (Fig. 3 and Table 2), some of which have already been shown to bind SOD1: actin, (16Watanabe Y.

Neurochem. 2004; 90: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). RINI has apparently not been described to bind hSOD1 before. Conspicuously absent in the immunocapture experiments was CCS, which was one of the major protein spots found in the experiment with apoG93A (Fig. 3 and Table 2). One likely explanation is that a significant interaction between SOD1 and CCS involves the C-terminal end of SOD1 (35Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The systems studied have also varied; findings in cultured cells are not necessarily relevant to complex tissues such as spinal cord. Sensitivity is another consideration. Despite the fact that all the misfolded hSOD1 from 2 spinal cords was captured in each experiment, it is apparent that the sensitivity of the present proteomic approach is insufficient to detect proteins complexed in very small amounts. Many of the previous studies have focused on preconceived candidate interacting proteins, allowing the use of specific antibodies for highly sensitive detection. A combination of the present C-terminal immunocapture protocol with high-resolution, high-sensitivity mass spectrometry might lead to the identification of further low-abundance interaction partners for misfolded SOD1. In summary misfolded soluble hSOD1, both wild-type protein and two different mutants, was found to a large extent to be bound to chaperones in mouse spinal cords. The most abundant interacting protein was Hsc70, but only about 1% of the total cellular Hsc70 was sequestered. Chaperone insufficiency is therefore not likely to be cytotoxic in ALS. No other conceivable explanation for the cytotoxicity of mutant SODs was apparent from the other interactions identified.

https://openalex.org/W2088982569,"Sexual differentiation of the rodent brain is dependent upon the organizing actions of the steroid hormone, estradiol. In the preoptic area, a brain region critical for the expression of adult reproductive behavior, there are twice as many dendritic spine synapses per unit length on newborn male neurons compared to female neurons and this sex difference correlates with the expression of adult male copulatory behavior. The sex difference in the POA is achieved via estradiol's upregulation of the membrane-derived lipid signaling molecule prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂); PGE₂ is necessary and sufficient to masculinize both dendritic spine density and adult sexual behavior in rats. We have previously shown that PGE₂ activates EP₂ and EP₄ receptors which increases protein kinase A (PKA) activity and that masculinized dendritic spine density and sex behavior are both dependent upon PKA as well as activation of AMPA type glutamate receptors. In the current experiments, we build upon this signaling cascade by determining that PGE₂ induces phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1, which leads to increased AMPA receptor insertion at the membrane. Treating female pups on the day of birth with PGE₂ induced the phosphorylation of GluR1 at the PKA-sensitive site within 2 hours of treatment, an effect that was blocked by co-administration of the PKA/AKAP inhibitor, HT31 with PGE₂. Brief treatment of mixed neuronal/glial POA cultures with PGE₂ or the cAMP/PKA stimulator, forskolin, increased membrane associated GluR1 in both neurons and glia. We speculate that PGE₂ induced increases in AMPA receptor associated with the membrane underlies our previously observed increase in dendritic spine density and is a critical component in the masculinization of rodent sex behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2120170560,"Cyto-nuclear shuttling of β-catenin is at the epicenter of the canonical Wnt pathway and mutations in genes that result in excessive nuclear accumulation of β-catenin are the driving force behind the initiation of many cancers. Recently, Naked Cuticle homolog 1 (Nkd1) has been identified as a Wnt-induced intracellular negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. The current model suggests that Nkd1 acts between Disheveled (Dvl) and β-catenin. Here, we employ the zebrafish embryo to characterize the cellular and biochemical role of Nkd1 in vivo. We demonstrate that Nkd1 binds to β-catenin and prevents its nuclear accumulation. We also show that this interaction is conserved in mammalian cultured cells. Further, we demonstrate that Nkd1 function is dependent on its interaction with the cell membrane. Given the conserved nature of Nkd1, our results shed light on the negative feedback regulation of Wnt signaling through the Nkd1-mediated negative control of nuclear accumulation of β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W1965984077,"The recent release of the Bovine HapMap dataset represents the most detailed survey of bovine genetic diversity to date, providing an important resource for the design and development of livestock production. We studied this dataset, comprising more than 30,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for 19 breeds (13 taurine, three zebu, and three hybrid breeds), seeking to identify small panels of genetic markers that can be used to trace the breed of unknown cattle samples. Taking advantage of the power of Principal Components Analysis and algorithms that we have recently described for the selection of Ancestry Informative Markers from genomewide datasets, we present a decision-tree which can be used to accurately infer the origin of individual cattle. In doing so, we present a thorough examination of population genetic structure in modern bovine breeds. Performing extensive cross-validation experiments, we demonstrate that 250-500 carefully selected SNPs suffice in order to achieve close to 100% prediction accuracy of individual ancestry, when this particular set of 19 breeds is considered. Our methods, coupled with the dense genotypic data that is becoming increasingly available, have the potential to become a valuable tool and have considerable impact in worldwide livestock production. They can be used to inform the design of studies of the genetic basis of economically important traits in cattle, as well as breeding programs and efforts to conserve biodiversity. Furthermore, the SNPs that we have identified can provide a reliable solution for the traceability of breed-specific branded products."
https://openalex.org/W2090310072,"Background Allium sativum leaf agglutinin (ASAL) is a 25-kDa homodimeric, insecticidal, mannose binding lectin whose subunits are assembled by the C-terminal exchange process. An attempt was made to convert dimeric ASAL into a monomeric form to correlate the relevance of quaternary association of subunits and their functional specificity. Using SWISS-MODEL program a stable monomer was designed by altering five amino acid residues near the C-terminus of ASAL. Methodology/Principal Findings By introduction of 5 site-specific mutations (-DNSNN-), a β turn was incorporated between the 11th and 12th β strands of subunits of ASAL, resulting in a stable monomeric mutant ASAL (mASAL). mASAL was cloned and subsequently purified from a pMAL-c2X system. CD spectroscopic analysis confirmed the conservation of secondary structure in mASAL. Mannose binding assay confirmed that molecular mannose binds efficiently to both mASAL and ASAL. In contrast to ASAL, the hemagglutination activity of purified mASAL against rabbit erythrocytes was lost. An artificial diet bioassay of Lipaphis erysimi with mASAL displayed an insignificant level of insecticidal activity compared to ASAL. Fascinatingly, mASAL exhibited strong antifungal activity against the pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria brassicicola in a disc diffusion assay. A propidium iodide uptake assay suggested that the inhibitory activity of mASAL might be associated with the alteration of the membrane permeability of the fungus. Furthermore, a ligand blot assay of the membrane subproteome of R. solani with mASAL detected a glycoprotein receptor having interaction with mASAL. Conclusions/Significance Conversion of ASAL into a stable monomer resulted in antifungal activity. From an evolutionary aspect, these data implied that variable quaternary organization of lectins might be the outcome of defense-related adaptations to diverse situations in plants. Incorporation of mASAL into agronomically-important crops could be an alternative method to protect them from dramatic yield losses from pathogenic fungi in an effective manner."
https://openalex.org/W2075434952,"The use of spectrally distinct variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) such as cyan or yellow mutants (CFP and YFP, respectively) is very common in all different fields of life sciences, e.g. for marking specific proteins or cells or to determine protein interactions. In the latter case, the quantum physical phenomenon of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is exploited by specific microscopy techniques to visualize proximity of proteins.When we applied a commonly used FRET microscopy technique--the increase in donor (CFP)-fluorescence after bleaching of acceptor fluorophores (YFP), we obtained good signals in live cells, but very weak signals for the same samples after fixation and mounting in commercial microscopy mounting fluids. This observation could be traced back to much faster bleaching of CFP in these mounting media. Strikingly, the opposite effect of the mounting fluid was observed for YFP and also for other proteins such as Cerulean, TFP or Venus. The changes in photostability of CFP and YFP were not caused by the fixation but directly dependent on the mounting fluid. Furthermore we made the interesting observation that the CFP-fluorescence intensity increases by about 10-15% after illumination at the YFP-excitation wavelength--a phenomenon, which was also observed for Cerulean. This photoactivation of cyan fluorescent proteins at the YFP-excitation can cause false-positive signals in the FRET-microscopy technique that is based on bleaching of a yellow FRET acceptor.Our results show that photostability of fluorescent proteins differs significantly for various media and that CFP bleaches significantly faster in commercial mounting fluids, while the opposite is observed for YFP and some other proteins. Moreover, we show that the FRET microscopy technique that is based on bleaching of the YFP is prone to artifacts due to photoactivation of cyan fluorescent proteins under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1980912623,"In Drosophila, the CASZ1 (castor) gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor and is a neural fate-determination gene. In mammals, the CASZ1 gene encodes two major isoforms, CASZ1a with 11 zinc fingers and CASZ1b with 5 zinc fingers. CASZ1b is more evolutionally conserved since it is the only homologue found in drosophila and Xenopus. Our previous study showed that full length CASZ1 (CASZ1a) functions to suppress growth in neuroblastoma tumor. However, the function of CASZ1b isoform in mammals is unknown. In this study, realtime PCR analyses indicate that mouse CASZ1b (mCASZ1b) is dynamically expressed during neurogenesis. CASZ1b and CASZ1a co-exist in all the neuronal tissues but exhibit distinct expression patterns spatially and temporally during brain development. CASZ1b and CASZ1a expression is coordinately upregulated by the differentiation agent Retinoic Acid, as well as agents that modify the epigenome in neural crest derived neuroblastoma cell lines. In contrast CASZ1b is down regulated while CASZ1a is upregulated by agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels. CASZ1b and CASZ1a have no synergistic or antagonistic activities on the regulation of their target NGFR gene transcription. Specific restoration of CASZ1b in NB cells suppresses tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with its function role, we find that low CASZ1b expression is significantly associated with decreased survival probability of neuroblastoma patients (p<0.02). This study indicates that although their mechanisms of regulation may be distinct, both CASZ1b and CASZ1a have largely redundant but critical roles in suppressing tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2086214944,"The need to vary body temperature to optimize physiological processes can lead to thermoregulatory behaviours, particularly in ectotherms. Despite some evidence of within-population phenotypic variation in thermal behaviour, the occurrence of alternative tactics of this behaviour is rarely explicitly considered when studying natural populations. The main objective of this study was to determine whether different thermal tactics exist among individuals of the same population. We studied the behavioural thermoregulation of 33 adult brook charr in a stratified lake using thermo-sensitive radio transmitters that measured hourly individual temperature over one month. The observed behavioural thermoregulatory patterns were consistent between years and suggest the existence of four tactics: two ""warm"" tactics with both crepuscular and finer periodicities, with or without a diel periodicity, and two ""cool"" tactics, with or without a diel periodicity. Telemetry data support the above findings by showing that the different tactics are associated with different patterns of diel horizontal movements. Taken together, our results show a clear spatio-temporal segregation of individuals displaying different tactics, suggesting a reduction of niche overlap. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the presence of behavioural thermoregulatory tactics in a vertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W1995371839,"The adaptor protein ankyrin-R interacts via its membrane binding domain with the cytoplasmic domain of the anion exchange protein (AE1) and via its spectrin binding domain with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton in human erythrocytes. This set of interactions provides a bridge between the lipid bilayer and the membrane skeleton, thereby stabilizing the membrane. Crystal structures for the dimeric cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (cdb3) and for a 12-ankyrin repeat segment (repeats 13–24) from the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R (AnkD34) have been reported. However, structural data on how these proteins assemble to form a stable complex have not been reported. In the current studies, site-directed spin labeling, in combination with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron-electron resonance, has been utilized to map the binding interfaces of the two proteins in the complex and to obtain inter-protein distance constraints. These data have been utilized to construct a family of structural models that are consistent with the full range of experimental data. These models indicate that an extensive area on the peripheral domain of cdb3 binds to ankyrin repeats 18–20 on the top loop surface of AnkD34 primarily through hydrophobic interactions.

Human erythrocytes exhibit an unusual biconcave disc shape and remarkable plasma membrane mechanical stability and deformability, all of which are necessary for their survival in the circulatory system. It is now well established that the unusual cell shape and membrane mechanical properties are due in large part to the presence of an extensive membrane skeleton, composed primarily of the proteins spectrin and actin, that lines the inner membrane surface and to specific bridging interactions between this membrane skeleton and intrinsic membrane proteins in the lipid bilayer. The spectrin-actin skeleton associates with the membrane bilayer via two types of contacts, one involving short actin protofilaments and protein 4.1, which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C, and the second involving the bridging protein ankyrin-R and protein 4.2, which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the anion exchange protein (AE1) 3The abbreviations used are: AE1anion exchanger 1cdb3cytoplasmic domain of band 3AnkD34ankyrin repeats 13–24 of human erythrocyte ankyrin-RDEERdouble electron-electron resonanceMTSSL1-oxyl-2,2,5,5,-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate spin labelNiEDDAnickel (II) ethylenediamine diacetic acidBMOEbis-maleimidoethaner.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. also known as band 3. Alterations in this second class of interactions often result in spherical erythrocytes with decreased cell size and increased fragility, a condition known clinically as hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary spherocytosis is a spectrum of inherited diseases, occurring in one family out of 2,000–3,000, which present clinically as varying degrees of hemolytic anemia resulting from hemolysis of the spherical erythrocytes as they flow through the microcirculation. Recent data have indicated that 15–20% of hereditary spherocytosis cases are attributable to AE1 mutations and that ∼50% of hereditary spherocytosis cases result from ankyrin-R mutations (1Delaunay J.

The ankyrin family of adaptor proteins, which includes the three isoforms ankyrin-R, ankyrin-G, and ankyrin-B in vertebrates, serves critical functions in cells by linking the lipid bilayer to the spectrin-actin-based membrane skeleton as well as assembling proteins in specialized membrane domains (reviewed in Refs. 2Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 3Nilsson Jr., K.R. Bennett V. J. Cardiovasc.

Like the other two isoforms, ankyrin-R contains an N-terminal membrane binding domain, a central spectrin binding domain, and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The membrane binding domain is composed of 24 ankyrin repeat modules, each of which contains two anti-parallel α-helices and a long loop. The individual repeats are connected by a β-hairpin, giving rise to stacking of the ankyrin repeats in a superhelical spiral (5Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Proteolysis studies have shown that the 24 repeats in ankyrin-R, the isoform in human erythrocytes, can be subdivided into four groups of six repeats each (D1, D2, D3, and D4). This same study demonstrated that the full-length membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R bound two cdb3 dimers with positive cooperativity. One binding site was located in domain 2 (AnkD2; repeats 7–12), and the second binding site was located in domains 3 and 4 (AnkD34; repeats 13–24) (6Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that a “tetramer” of AE1, rather than the fundamental dimer, is involved in binding ankyrin-R (e.g. Refs. 7Che A. Morrison I.E. Pan R. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9588-9595Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 8Thevenin B.J. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16166-16172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a stable subpopulation of AE1 tetramers can be extracted by non-ionic detergents from erythrocyte ghost membrane preparations (e.g. Refs. 9Blackman S.M. Piston D.W. Beth A.H. Biophys.

Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) drives the formation of a true tetramer of cdb3 or whether the structure is more accurately described as a dimer of dimers with no major structural rearrangements of the individual dimer units. Now that crystal structures are available for isolated cdb3 (12Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for isolated ankyrin-R repeats 13–24 (AnkD34 (5Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)), it is possible to determine the structure of the complex formed between one cdb3 dimer and AnkD34 using modern protein-docking algorithms in conjunction with structural constraints obtained from site-directed spin labeling studies (e.g. Refs. 13Hilger D.

In the present studies, site-directed spin labeling and EPR have been employed to map the binding interfaces on cdb3 and on AnkD34 under conditions where the proteins form a stable complex. Distance measurements using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) between pairs of spin labels in cdb3 and AnkD34 have shown that the global structure of neither protein is significantly altered upon complex formation. All of these data have been utilized to build a family of structural models using the ROSETTA suite of docking algorithms (reviewed in Ref. 16Kaufmann K.W. Lemmon G.H. Deluca S.L. Sheehan J.H. Meiler J. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) that are compatible with the experimental data. The models indicate that a large section of the peripheral domain of cdb3 interacts with ankyrin repeats 18–20 on the top loop region of AnkD34 primarily through hydrophobic interactions. The binding surface on AnkD34 is remote from the ankyrin groove, which has been hypothesized to be involved in binding to a number of membrane proteins. In preliminary docking studies, the ankyrin groove of AnkD34 was hypothesized to be involved in binding to cdb3 (5Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The models presented in this work indicate that the ankyrin groove is not the binding interface, and they also place restrictions on whether a second cdb3 dimer could bind to the D2 domain of ankyrin-R to form a true tetramer of cdb3. The preparation and spin labeling of wild-type and single or double Cys mutants of cdb3 have been described in previous work (17Zhou Z. DeSensi S.C. Stein R.A. Brandon S. Dixit M. McArdle E.J. Warren E.M. Kroh H.K. Song L. Cobb C.E. Hustedt E.J. Beth A.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15115-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding ankyrin repeats 13–24 plus 12 residues from the spectrin binding domain (AnkD34; residues 403–827) of ankyrin-R were provided by Dr. Peter Michaely (University of Texas, Southwestern). The DNA construct for wild type-AnkD34 was inserted into the pGEX-2T expression vector (GE Healthcare) wherein the two endogenous cysteines at positions 476 and 531 were converted to Ser and Ala, respectively. Cys-less and single or double Cys mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GST fusion protein was overexpressed in BL21 Gold (DE3)-competent cells by incubating the culture at 17 °C for 3.5–4 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside and purified using a GST affinity chromatography system (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. Before being cleaved from the resin, single or double Cys mutants of AnkD34 were reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5,-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) spin label (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, ON, Canada; Fig. 1) in the binding buffer plus 0.1% (v/v) octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8) at room temperature for 2 h and then at 4 °C overnight. Unreacted spin label was removed by flowing excess washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) through the column until no spin label was detected in the flow-through by EPR. Spin-labeled AnkD34s were released from the immobilized GST tag by thrombin cleavage in binding buffer, which contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.0. Upon completion of the cleavage reaction, benzamidine-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added to remove the residual thrombin from the protein solution. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE as described in previous work (18Zhou Z. DeSensi S.C. Stein R.A. Brandon S. Song L. Cobb C.E. Hustedt E.J. Beth A.H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10248-10257Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All samples used in the studies were >95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining intensity. Protein concentrations were determined either by using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard or by measuring absorbance at 280 nm with the calculated extinction coefficients for each protein construct (cdb3, 33,920 m−1cm−1; AnkD34, 15,930 m−1cm−1). To assess the effect of mutation and concomitant spin labeling on the binding affinity of singly labeled cdb3 mutants, a known amount (0.5–1 nmol) of wt-ankD34-GST fusion protein was immobilized on the GST resin. To each aliquot of 50% (v/v) suspension, a 4-fold molar excess amount of a singly labeled cdb3 mutant was added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the column was washed with washing buffer three times to remove the unbound cdb3. The resultant resin was directly loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel, and the band intensities of each protein were analyzed using a UN-SCAN-IT gel digitizing system (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). The amount of bound cdb3 was assessed from the band intensity ratio between bound cdb3 and normalized wt-AnkD34 fusion protein. The relative binding affinity of each spin-labeled cdb3 mutant was estimated by comparing the bound fraction of a mutant with that of wt-cdb3. Likewise, the binding affinities of singly labeled AnkD34 mutants were evaluated in the same manner as described above using a series of singly labeled AnkD34-GST fusion proteins that were immobilized on the resin and wt-cdb3. The data from these experiments are provided in supplemental Figs. S2 and S3. Complexes between spin-labeled AnkD34s and cdb3s were prepared by incubating wild-type or specific spin-labeled proteins in the same binding buffer defined above at 4 °C overnight. Both proteins were concentrated to the desired range using a centrifugal membrane filter device (30-kDa molecular mass cutoff; Millipore, Billerica, MA) before complex formation. Cross-linking of the complex between a pair of Cys residues from each protein was accomplished using a homo-bifunctional maleimide cross-linker, bismaleimidoethane (BMOE, Pierce Biotechnology), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each pair of single Cys mutants of cdb3 and AnkD34 was mixed at an equimolar ratio (10 μm final concentration of each protein) and allowed to form a complex in binding buffer containing 5 mm EDTA as mentioned above. To 100 μl of protein mix, freshly prepared BMOE stock solution (20 mm in N,N-dimethylformamide) was added to give 30 μm final concentration. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 5 mm SDS and 10 mm DTT, and the formation of the cross-linked complex in the reaction mixture was visualized by SDS-PAGE as described in previous work (18Zhou Z. DeSensi S.C. Stein R.A. Brandon S. Song L. Cobb C.E. Hustedt E.J. Beth A.H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10248-10257Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were collected at X-band (9.8 GHz) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with a TM110 cavity (BrukerBiospin, Billerica, MA) using 5 milliwatts of microwave power and 1 Gauss of field modulation at 100 kHz. Samples were prepared in the binding buffer in the 80–120 μm concentration range, and spectra were collected at room temperature in 50-μl glass capillaries (Kimble Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ). For the measurement of spin label side chain accessibilities, a singly labeled protein mixed with a 4 m excess amount of its non-labeled binding partner was used to ensure saturation of binding sites. NiEDDA accessibility of individual sites on each protein was measured using a gas-permeable TPX (a tradename for polymethylpentene) capillary and an ER4123D resonator (BrukerBiospin) as described previously (17Zhou Z. DeSensi S.C. Stein R.A. Brandon S. Dixit M. McArdle E.J. Warren E.M. Kroh H.K. Song L. Cobb C.E. Hustedt E.J. Beth A.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15115-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accessibilities are expressed numerically as dimensionless Π values, which were calculated from the following equation∏(NiEDDA)=P1/2(NiEDDA)-P1/2(N2)ΔH0Eq. 1 where P½ is the half-saturation power in the presence of NiEDDA or N2 and ΔH0 is the field width of the central peak. Short inter-probe distances (<20 Å) were measured on samples in binding buffer plus 50% glycerol at 2 °C. The resulting EPR spectra were analyzed using the convolution method, which assumes Gaussian distance distributions as described in previous work (e.g. Refs. 19Hustedt E.J. Stein R.A. Sethaphong L.

The four-pulse DEER experiment was performed at X-band (9.5 GHz) on a Bruker EleXsys 580 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker split ring resonator (ER 4118X-MD5). A standard four-pulse sequence was employed with a 32-ns π pulse and a 16-ns π/2-pulse sequence. All measurements were recorded at 80 K. Samples were prepared in binding buffer containing 30% (w/w) glycerol in the 150–250 μm concentration range and loaded into 2.4-mm inner diameter quartz capillaries (Wilmad LabGlass, Buena, NJ). Although the inter-protein distances were measured from a complex composed of two labeled proteins in an equimolar ratio, for the intra-protein distances, labeled proteins were allowed to form a complex with a 1.5–2 m excess amount of its diamagnetic binding partner prior to the measurement. All DEER data were analyzed using software developed in-house, which simultaneously fits the background signal as a function of an effective spin concentration and radius of the molecule or complex while determining the specific interactions of interest using a distance distribution defined as a sum of Gaussians. 4E. J. Hustedt, manuscript in preparation. This approach, which takes into account the excluded volume of the molecule or complex, typically gave better fits to the data than those obtained using a priori background correction. All of the DEER data shown in the figures are with the background removed subsequent to the analysis. The calculated average distances and distance distributions were similar to those obtained using the conventional Tikhonov regularization method (21Chiang Y.W. Borbat P.P. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2005; 172: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The structure refinement process was carried out by first generating a large number of docked cdb3-AnkD34 complexes. The experimental results presented in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, below, indicate that neither the cdb3 homo-dimer nor the AnkD34 fragment undergoes any major global conformational changes upon complex formation. Therefore, the RosettaDock program (22Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) was used to perform rigid docking calculations with the x-ray crystal structures for cdb3 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1HYN) and AnkD34 (PDB code 1N11). 100,000 docked complexes were generated using unrestrained rigid body docking to explore all plausible docking orientations as shown in Fig. 9, upper panel, below. Next, a filtering protocol was devised to screen the 100,000 candidate complexes to eliminate all the models that were clearly inconsistent with the experimental DEER distance measurements. In the first-pass filter, the Cβ-Cβ distance was measured for a pair of spin-labeled sites in cdb3 and AnkD34 from each docking model. To take the extrinsic distance between the nitroxide electron and the Cβ carbon (∼7 Å) into account, Cβ-Cβ distance ± 14 Å cutoff was applied to select acceptable models in the first-pass filter process. Because cdb3 is a homo-dimer, spin label positions in each subunit were considered in the filtering process. Using this cutoff criterion and 20 experimental DEER distance measurements, it was determined that 811 docked poses from the RosettaDock calculations were compatible with the distance constraints as shown in Fig. 9, middle panel. All other docking poses had at least one (and generally many) spin label pair distance violation that exceeded the Cβ-Cβ ± 14 Å tolerance value.FIGURE 3Intra-protein distances in AnkD34 measured by DEER. The residue pairs are defined by the structure in the upper panel, and representative DEER data before and after complex formation with cdb3 are shown in the lower panel. The DEER data (black dots) and fits to the data before complex formation (blue) and after complex formation (red)red) are shown as solid lines in the stacked plots in the lower panel. The resultant average distances and distance distributions from fitting the data (Å) are shown in the insets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 9Ensemble of structural models for the cdb3-AnkD34 complex superimposed on the crystal structure of AnkD34. The top panel shows 500 representative poses from the 100,000 generated by RosettaDock using no constraints to guide how the proteins could interact. The center panel shows how filtering these 100,000 poses using the 20 inter-protein distance constraints from DEER measurements reduced the number of poses to 811 and gave a strong indication of the surfaces of the two proteins that formed the binding interface, the potential orientations of cdb3 relative to AnkD34, and which ankyrin repeats were likely involved in binding. The bottom panel shows the top 30 structures that were obtained by filtering the 811 poses in the center panel with the solvent accessibility data as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A second-stage filter was then implemented to select candidate structures that were consistent with experimental data for spin label side chain accessibility. Using MSMS software (23Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), per-residue solvent-accessible surface areas were computed for five sites that caused large reductions in complex formation upon mutation (cdb3, 72, 129, 158; AnkD34, 596 and 629) and nine sites that exhibited large changes in NiEDDA accessibility (i.e. changes in Π values of <−8; see TABLE 1, TABLE 2) upon formation of the complex (cdb3, 137, 148, 160, 166, 254; AnkD34, 598, 631, 662, 664). Using canonical surface areas for fully exposed side chains in GXG tripeptides (24Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 105: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), the raw surface area computed for each of the wild-type residues was normalized to a value between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a fully exposed residue and 0 representing a fully buried residue. The normalized values were summed together to form an accessibility score, where a small score corresponds to more buried surface and therefore better agreement with the experiment. The top 100 structures were sorted based upon increasing accessibility score, and every 10 structures were then binned cumulatively from the top.TABLE 1NiEDDA accessibility of surface sites on the peripheral domain of cdb3 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2NiEDDA accessibility of surface sites on AnkD34View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab An overall backbone r.m.s.d. was then computed for all structures in each of the bins, and the r.m.s.d. values versus bin size were plotted. The larger bins, with 40 or more structures, contained structures with accessibility scores that were a minimum of 28% larger than the best overall score of 1.96. In addition, the slope of the r.m.s.d. versus bin size plot is much steeper beginning with a bin size of 40, indicating that besides significantly worse accessibility scores, the larger bins contain structures that look significantly different from the best-scoring structure (r.m.s.d. from the mean of as high as 6.1 Å in the 40-structure bin, moving higher from there). Given these statistics, the top 30 structures were chosen as the final solution set, which spans a range of accessibility scores from 1.96–2.48 and has an average pairwise r.m.s.d. value of 2.68 Å over all backbone atoms. It should be noted that it is also possible to more precisely model the orientation of the R1 side chain, thereby lowering the ± 14 Å tolerance value used in this work (e.g. (15Bhatnagar J.

However, having extensive interface mapping data from solvent accessibility measurements permitted the determination of structural models without the need for these approaches. The first questions that were addressed were whether the global structures of either cdb3 or AnkD34 were significantly altered upon complex formation. This question was addressed for cdb3 by spin labeling selected sites on the cdb3 dimer and then observing dipolar couplings by EPR for sites at the dimer interface or by DEER at selected sites remote from the dimer interface in the absence and then the presence of bound wt-AnkD34. As shown by the representative data in Fig. 2 and by additional data in supplemental Fig. S1, there were no significant changes in inter-probe distances as a result of complex formation, indicating that the global structure of the cdb3 dimer was not altered even under conditions where a wt-AnkD34 was bound to the peripheral domain of each monomer. The analyses of the DEER data in Fig. 2 are shown in tabular form in supplemental Table S1. Likewise, when two cysteine residues were introduced into Cys-less AnkD34 at sites in the groove region or along the convex backbone and DEER measurements were made on the spin-labeled proteins, there were no significant changes in inter-probe distances following complex formation with wt-cdb3 as shown in Fig. 3 and as given in tabular form in supplemental Table S2. Collectively, these data indicated that modeling of the structure of the complex formed between cdb3 and AnkD34 to a first approximation would only require rigid body docking of the two proteins using binding interface information obtained from EPR experiments (i.e. what surfaces of the two proteins are in close contact) and inter-protein distance constraints obtained from EPR or DEER experiments (i.e. what is the relative spatial positioning of the two proteins). This basic approach has been described and successfully utilized in previous work on other protein complexes by other investigators (e.g. Refs. 13Hilger D. Polyhach Y. Padan E. Jung H. Jeschke G.

The effects of different intervention and setting characteristics are not well known. We simulate the effects of the different target age groups and delivery channels, seasonal or year-round delivery, transmission intensity, seasonality, proportions of malaria fevers treated and drug characteristics.We use a dynamic, individual-based simulation model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemiology, antimalarial drug action and case management to simulate DALYs averted and the cost per DALY averted by IPTi and IPTc. IPT cost components were estimated from economic studies alongside trials.IPTi and IPTc were predicted to be cost-effective in most of the scenarios modelled. The cost-effectiveness is driven by the impact on DALYs, particularly for IPTc, and the low costs, particularly for IPTi which uses the existing delivery strategy, EPI. Cost-effectiveness was predicted to decrease with low transmission, badly timed seasonal delivery in a seasonal setting, short-acting and more expensive drugs, high frequencies of drug resistance and high levels of treatment of malaria fevers. Seasonal delivery was more cost-effective in seasonal settings, and year-round in constant transmission settings. The difference was more pronounced for IPTc than IPTi due to the different proportions of fixed costs and also different assumed drug spacing during the transmission season. The number of DALYs averted was predicted to decrease as a target five-year age-band for IPTc was shifted from children under 5 years into older ages, except at low transmission intensities.Modelling can extend the information available by predicting impact and cost-effectiveness for scenarios, for outcomes and for multiple strategies where, for practical reasons, trials cannot be carried out. Both IPTi and IPTc are generally cost-effective but could be rendered cost-ineffective by characteristics of the setting, drug or implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2073378425,"Activation of the IKK-NFκB pathway increases the resistance of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR). This effect has been largely attributed to the induction of anti-apoptotic proteins by NFκB. Since efficient repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is required for the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells, we investigated if activation of the IKK-NFκB pathway also regulates DSB repair to promote cell survival after IR. We found that inhibition of the IKK-NFκB pathway with a specific IKKβ inhibitor significantly reduced the repair of IR-induced DSBs in MCF-7 cells. The repair of DSBs was also significantly inhibited by silencing IKKβ expression with IKKβ shRNA. However, down-regulation of IKKα expression with IKKα shRNA had no significant effect on the repair of IR-induced DSBs. Similar findings were also observed in IKKα and/or IKKβ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). More importantly, inhibition of IKKβ with an inhibitor or down-regulation of IKKβ with IKKβ shRNA sensitized MCF-7 cells to IR-induced clonogenic cell death. DSB repair function and resistance to IR were completely restored by IKKβ reconstitution in IKKβ-knockdown MCF-7 cells. These findings demonstrate that IKKβ can regulate the repair of DSBs, a previously undescribed and important IKKβ kinase function; and inhibition of DSB repair may contribute to cance cell radiosensitization induced by IKKβ inhibition. As such, specific inhibition of IKKβ may represents a more effective approach to sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy."

Male to female ratios show consistent bias toward males, the biological bases and variations of which are not well understood. We have used data from the Gambian National Cancer Registry to compare trends in incidence of HCC in both genders.Two periods were compared, 1988-1997 (early) and 1998-2006 (recent). In addition, the regression program joinpoint was used to assess trends over 19 years. Differences with self-reported ethnicity were assessed for the recent period using population data from 2003 census. Male to female ratio showed a significant decrease between the two periods from 3.28∶1 (95% CI, [2.93-3.65]) to 2.2∶1 (95% CI, [1.99-2.43]). Although rates in males were relatively stable (38.36 and 32.84 for, respectively, early and recent periods), they increased from 11.71 to 14.9 in females with a significant Annual Percentage Change of 3.01 [0.3-5.8] over 19 years and an increase in number of cases of 80.28% (compared to 26% in males). Significant variations in HCC risk, but not in gender ratio were observed in relation with ethnicity.This analysis of the only national, population-based cancer registry in West Africa shows a significant increase in HCC in females over recent years. This increase may be the consequence of major changes in lifestyle or viral risk factors, in particular obesity and hepatitis C, which have both been documented to increase in West Africa during recent years."
https://openalex.org/W2066191238,"We describe an illusion in which a stranger's voice, when presented as the auditory concomitant of a participant's own speech, is perceived as a modified version of their own voice. When the congruence between utterance and feedback breaks down, the illusion is also broken. Compared to a baseline condition in which participants heard their own voice as feedback, hearing a stranger's voice induced robust changes in the fundamental frequency (F0) of their production. Moreover, the shift in F0 appears to be feedback dependent, since shift patterns depended reliably on the relationship between the participant's own F0 and the stranger-voice F0. The shift in F0 was evident both when the illusion was present and after it was broken, suggesting that auditory feedback from production may be used separately for self-recognition and for vocal motor control. Our findings indicate that self-recognition of voices, like other body attributes, is malleable and context dependent."

The response to HCV treatment is genotype specific, with the predominant genotype 1 showing the lowest rate of sustained virological response. Virally encoded enzymes are candidate targets for intervention. In particular, promising antiviral molecules are being developed to target the viral NS3/4A protease and NS5B polymerase. Most of the studies with the NS5B polymerase have been done with genotypes 1b and 2a, whilst information about other genotypes is scarce. Here, we have characterized the de novo activity of NS5B from genotypes 1 to 5, with emphasis on conditions for optimum activity and kinetic constants. Polymerase cooperativity was determined by calculating the Hill coefficient and oligomerization through a new FRET-based method. The V(max)/K(m) ratios were statistically different between genotype 1 and the other genotypes (p<0.001), mainly due to differences in V(max) values, but differences in the Hill coefficient and NS5B oligomerization were noted. Analysis of sequence changes among the studied polymerases and crystal structures show the αF helix as a structural component probably involved in NS5B-NS5B interactions. The viability of the interaction of αF and αT helixes was confirmed by docking studies and calculation of electrostatic surface potentials for genotype 1 and point mutants corresponding to mutations from different genotypes. Results presented in this study reveal the existence of genotypic differences in NS5B de novo activity and oligomerization. Furthermore, these results allow us to define two regions, one consisting of residues Glu128, Asp129, and Glu248, and the other consisting of residues of αT helix possibly involved in NS5B-NS5B interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2141013541,"Deregulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling is a hallmark of malignant glioma. Two alternatively spliced PDGF-A mRNAs have been described, corresponding to a long (L) and a short (S) isoform of PDGF-A. In contrast to PDGF-A(S), the PDGF-A(L) isoform has a lysine and arginine rich carboxy-terminal extension that acts as an extracellular matrix retention motif. However, the exact role of PDGF-A(L) and how it functionally differs from the shorter isoform is not well understood.We overexpressed PDGF-A(L) as a transgene under control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter in the mouse brain. This directs expression of the transgene to astrocytic cells and GFAP expressing neural stem cells throughout the developing and adult central nervous system. Transgenic mice exhibited a phenotype with enlarged skull at approximately 6-16 weeks of age and they died between 1.5 months and 2 years of age. We detected an increased number of undifferentiated cells in all areas of transgene expression, such as in the subependymal zone around the lateral ventricle and in the cerebellar medulla. The cells stained positive for Pdgfr-α, Olig2 and NG2 but this population did only partially overlap with cells positive for Gfap and the transgene reporter. Interestingly, a few mice presented with overt neoplastic glioma-like lesions composed of both Olig2 and Gfap positive cell populations and with microvascular proliferation, in a wild-type p53 background.Our findings show that PDGF-A(L) can induce accumulation of immature cells in the mouse brain. The strong expression of NG2, Pdgfr-α and Olig2 in PDGF-A(L) brains suggests that a fraction of these cells are oligodendrocyte progenitors. In addition, accumulation of fluid in the subarachnoid space and skull enlargement indicate that an increased intracranial pressure contributed to the observed lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2079691459,"Expression of the lineage-specific DNA-binding factor Foxp3 controls the development and function of naturally occurring regulatory T cells. Foxp3 has been shown to interact with a multitude of transcriptional regulators including NFAT, NF-κB (p65), Runx1 and RORγt, as well as the histone modification enzymes TIP60, HDAC7 and HDAC9. The sum of these interactions is believed to cause the change in the transcriptional program of regulatory T cells. Here we show that Foxp3 directly or as part of a multimeric complex engages with the NF-κB component c-Rel. We demonstrate that the N-terminal region of Foxp3 is required for the binding of c-Rel, but not NFAT. Conversely, deletion of the forkhead domain causes a loss of interaction with NFAT, but not c-Rel. Our findings are of particular interest, as c-Rel is crucial for the induction of Foxp3 in regulatory T cells during thymic development, but has to be repressed in mature regulatory T cells to maintain their suppressive phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2003842483,"Background The stability of atherosclerotic plaques determines the risk for rupture, which may lead to thrombus formation and potentially severe clinical complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Although the rate of plaque formation may be important for plaque stability, this process is not well understood. We took advantage of the atmospheric 14C-declination curve (a result of the atomic bomb tests in the 1950s and 1960s) to determine the average biological age of carotid plaques. Methodology/Principal Finding The cores of carotid plaques were dissected from 29 well-characterized, symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis and analyzed for 14C content by accelerator mass spectrometry. The average plaque age (i.e. formation time) was 9.6±3.3 years. All but two plaques had formed within 5–15 years before surgery. Plaque age was not associated with the chronological ages of the patients but was inversely related to plasma insulin levels (p = 0.0014). Most plaques were echo-lucent rather than echo-rich (2.24±0.97, range 1–5). However, plaques in the lowest tercile of plaque age (most recently formed) were characterized by further instability with a higher content of lipids and macrophages (67.8±12.4 vs. 50.4±6.2, p = 0.00005; 57.6±26.1 vs. 39.8±25.7, p<0.0005, respectively), less collagen (45.3±6.1 vs. 51.1±9.8, p<0.05), and fewer smooth muscle cells (130±31 vs. 141±21, p<0.05) than plaques in the highest tercile. Microarray analysis of plaques in the lowest tercile also showed increased activity of genes involved in immune responses and oxidative phosphorylation. Conclusions/Significance Our results show, for the first time, that plaque age, as judge by relative incorporation of 14C, can improve our understanding of carotid plaque stability and therefore risk for clinical complications. Our results also suggest that levels of plasma insulin might be involved in determining carotid plaque age."
https://openalex.org/W2029616097,"Background Experimental psychology has only recently provided supporting evidence for Freud's and Janet's description of unconscious phenomena. Here, we aimed to assess whether specific abilities, such as personal psychodynamic experience, enhance the ability to recognize unconscious phenomena in peers – in other words, to better detect implicit knowledge related to individual self-experience. Methodology and Principal Findings First, we collected 14 videos from seven healthy adults who had experienced a sibling's cancer during childhood and seven matched controls. Subjects and controls were asked to give a 5-minute spontaneous free-associating speech following specific instructions created in order to activate a buffer zone between fantasy and reality. Then, 18 raters (three psychoanalysts, six medical students, three oncologists, three cognitive behavioral therapists and three individuals with the same experience of trauma) were randomly shown the videos and asked to blindly classify them according to whether the speaker had a sibling with cancer using a Likert scale. Using a permutation test, we found a significant association between group and recognition score (ANOVA: p = .0006). Psychoanalysts were able to recognize, above chance levels, healthy adults who had experienced sibling cancer during childhood without explicit knowledge of this history (Power = 88%; p = .002). In contrast, medical students, oncologists, cognitive behavioral therapists and individuals who had the same history of a sibling's cancer were unable to do so. Conclusion This experiment supports the view that implicit recognition of a subject's history depends on the rater's specific abilities. In the case of subjects who did have a sibling with cancer during childhood, psychoanalysts appear better able to recognize this particular history."

https://openalex.org/W2016252145,"Nm23/NDP kinases are multifunctional enzymes involved in the general homeostasis of triphosphate nucleosides. Numerous studies have shown that NDPKs also serve as regulatory factors of various cell activities, not always connected to nucleotide phosphorylation. In particular, the nme-1 gene, encoding the NM23-1/NDPKA protein, has been reported as a metastasis suppressor gene. This activity was validated in hepatocellular tumors induced in nm23-1 deficient mice. Yet, data describing the primary physiological functions of nm23-1/NDPKA is still scarce. We have characterized in depth the phenotype of nm23-1 deletion in the mammary gland in mice carrying whole body nm23-M1 invalidation. We also asked why the nm23-M1⁻/⁻ mutant females displayed severe nursing disability. We found that the growth retardation of mutant virgin glands was due to reduced proliferation and apoptosis of the epithelial cells within the terminal end buds. The balance of pro/anti-apoptotic factors was impaired in comparison with wild type glands. In the lactating glands, the reduced proliferation rate persisted, but the apoptotic factors were unchanged. However, those defects did not seem to affect the gland maturation since the glands lacking nm23-1/NDPKA appeared morphologically normal. Thorough examination of all the functional aspects of the mammary glands revealed that lack of nm23-1/NDPKA does not impact the production or the ejection of milk in the lumen of lobuloalveolae. Interestingly, an epithelial plug was found to obstruct the extremity of the unique lactiferous duct delivering the milk out of the nipple. These cells, normally disappearing after lactation takes place, persisted in the mutant nipples. This work provides a rare instance of nm23-1/NDPKA physiological functions in the mammary glands and reveals its implication as a modulator factor of proliferation and apoptosis in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2076725876,"Extensive studies of pre-TCR- and TCR-dependent signaling have led to characterization of a pathway deemed essential for efficient T cell development, and comprised of a cascade of sequential events involving phosphorylation of Lck and ZAP-70, followed by phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76, and subsequent additional downstream events. Of interest, however, reports from our lab as well as others have indicated that the requirements for ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76 are partially reversed by inactivation of c-Cbl (Cbl), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets multiple molecules for ubiquitination and degradation. Analysis of signaling events in these Cbl knockout models, including the recently reported analysis of SLP-76 transgenes defective in interaction with Vav1, suggested that activation of Vav1 might be a critical event in alternative pathways of T cell development. To extend the analysis of signaling requirements for thymic development, we have therefore assessed the effect of Cbl inactivation on the T cell developmental defects that occur in Vav1-deficient mice. The defects in Vav1-deficient thymic development, including a marked defect in DN3-DN4 transition, were completely reversed by Cbl inactivation, accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and ERKs in response to pre-TCR/TCR cross-linking of Vav1⁻/⁻Cbl⁻/⁻ DP thymocytes. Taken together, these results suggest a substantially modified paradigm for pre-TCR/TCR signaling and T cell development. The observed consensus pathways of T cell development, including requirements for ZAP-70, LAT, SLP-76, and Vav1, appear to reflect the restriction by Cbl of an otherwise much broader set of molecular pathways capable of mediating T cell development."

The advantage of DNAzymes over ribozymes is that they are inexpensive to produce and exhibit good stability. The ""10-23 DNA enzyme"" is composed of a catalytic domain of 15 deoxynucleotides, flanked by two substrate-recognition domains of approximately eight nucleotides in each direction, which provides the complementary sequence required for specific binding to RNA substrates. However, these eight nucleotides might not afford sufficient binding energy to hold the RNA substrate along with the DNAzyme, which would interfere with the efficiency of the DNAzyme or cause side effects, such as the cleavage of non-cognate mRNAs.In this study, we inserted a nonpairing bulge at the 5' end of the ""10-23 DNA enzyme"" to enhance its efficiency and specificity. Different sizes of bulges were inserted at different positions in the 5' end of the DNAzyme. The non-matching bulge will avoid strong binding between the DNAzyme and target mRNA, which may interfere with the efficiency of the DNAzyme.Our novel DNAzyme constructs could efficiently silence the expression of target genes, proving a powerful tool for gene silencing. The results showed that the six oligo bulge was the most effective when the six oligo bulge was 12-15 bp away from the core catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2076184454,"The seagrass limpet Tectura paleacea (Gastropoda; Patellogastropoda) belongs to a seagrass obligate lineage that has shifted from the Caribbean in the late Miocene, across the Isthmus of Panama prior to the closing of the Panamanian seaway, and then northward to its modern Baja California – Oregon distribution. To address whether larval entrainment by seagrass beds contributes to population structuring, populations were sampled at six California/Oregon localities approximately 2 degrees latitude apart during two post-settlement periods in July 2002 and June 2003. Partial cytochrome oxidase b (Cytb) sequences were obtained from 20 individuals (10 per year) from each population in order to determine the levels of population subdivision/connectivity. From the 120 individuals sequenced, there were eighty-one unique haplotypes, with the greatest haplotype diversity occurring in southern populations. The only significant genetic break detected was consistent with a peri-Point Conception (PPC) biogeographic boundary while populations north and south of Point Conception were each panmictic. The data further indicate that populations found south of the PPC biogeographic boundary originated from northern populations. This pattern of population structure suggests that seagrass patches are not entraining the larvae of T. paleacea by altering flow regimes within their environment; a process hypothesized to produce extensive genetic subdivision on fine geographic scales. In contrast to the haplotype data, morphological patterns vary significantly over very fine geographic scales that are inconsistent with the observed patterns of genetic population structure, indicating that morphological variation in T. paleacea might be attributed to differential ecophenotypic expression in response to local habitat variability throughout its distribution. These results suggest that highly localized conservation efforts may not be as effective as large-scale conservation efforts in near shore marine environments."
