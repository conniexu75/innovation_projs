https://openalex.org/W2708579841,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are commonly used for in vivo gene transfer. Nevertheless, AAVs that provide efficient transduction across specific organs or cell populations are needed. Here, we describe AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S, capsids that efficiently transduce the central and peripheral nervous systems, respectively. In the adult mouse, intravenous administration of 1 × 1011 vector genomes (vg) of AAV-PHP.eB transduced 69% of cortical and 55% of striatal neurons, while 1 × 1012 vg of AAV-PHP.S transduced 82% of dorsal root ganglion neurons, as well as cardiac and enteric neurons. The efficiency of these vectors facilitates robust cotransduction and stochastic, multicolor labeling for individual cell morphology studies. To support such efforts, we provide methods for labeling a tunable fraction of cells without compromising color diversity. Furthermore, when used with cell-type-specific promoters and enhancers, these AAVs enable efficient and targetable genetic modification of cells throughout the nervous system of transgenic and non-transgenic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2733265822,"Genetic alterations that activate NOTCH1 signaling and T cell transcription factors, coupled with inactivation of the INK4/ARF tumor suppressors, are hallmarks of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but detailed genome-wide sequencing of large T-ALL cohorts has not been carried out. Using integrated genomic analysis of 264 T-ALL cases, we identified 106 putative driver genes, half of which had not previously been described in childhood T-ALL (for example, CCND3, CTCF, MYB, SMARCA4, ZFP36L2 and MYCN). We describe new mechanisms of coding and noncoding alteration and identify ten recurrently altered pathways, with associations between mutated genes and pathways, and stage or subtype of T-ALL. For example, NRAS/FLT3 mutations were associated with immature T-ALL, JAK3/STAT5B mutations in HOXA1 deregulated ALL, PTPN2 mutations in TLX1 deregulated T-ALL, and PIK3R1/PTEN mutations in TAL1 deregulated ALL, which suggests that different signaling pathways have distinct roles according to maturational stage. This genomic landscape provides a logical framework for the development of faithful genetic models and new therapeutic approaches."

Here we present gene expression profiles of purified microglia isolated at autopsy from the parietal cortex of 39 human subjects with intact cognition. Overall, genes expressed by human microglia were similar to those in mouse, including established microglial genes CX3CR1, P2RY12 and ITGAM (CD11B). However, a number of immune genes, not identified as part of the mouse microglial signature, were abundantly expressed in human microglia, including TLR, Fcγ and SIGLEC receptors, as well as TAL1 and IFI16, regulators of proliferation and cell cycle. Age-associated changes in human microglia were enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell surface receptor expression and actin (dis)assembly. Limited overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently."
https://openalex.org/W2729286457,"Rice feeds half the world's population, and rice blast is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C2H2-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2728549768,"Transposon reactivation is an inherent danger in cells that lose epigenetic silencing during developmental reprogramming. In the mouse, long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, or endogenous retroviruses (ERV), account for most novel insertions and are expressed in the absence of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation in preimplantation stem cells. We found abundant 18 nt tRNA-derived small RNA (tRF) in these cells and ubiquitously expressed 22 nt tRFs that include the 3′ terminal CCA of mature tRNAs and target the tRNA primer binding site (PBS) essential for ERV reverse transcription. We show that the two most active ERV families, IAP and MusD/ETn, are major targets and are strongly inhibited by tRFs in retrotransposition assays. 22 nt tRFs post-transcriptionally silence coding-competent ERVs, while 18 nt tRFs specifically interfere with reverse transcription and retrotransposon mobility. The PBS offers a unique target to specifically inhibit LTR-retrotransposons, and tRF-targeting is a potentially highly conserved mechanism of small RNA–mediated transposon control."

When critically short telomeres arise in the absence of telomerase, they can be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) to prevent premature senescence onset. It is unclear why specifically the shortest telomeres are targeted for HDR. We demonstrate that the non-coding RNA TERRA accumulates as HDR-promoting RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) preferentially at very short telomeres. The increased level of TERRA and R-loops, exclusively at short telomeres, is due to a local defect in RNA degradation by the Rat1 and RNase H2 nucleases, respectively. Consequently, the coordination of TERRA degradation with telomere replication is altered at shortened telomeres. R-loop persistence at short telomeres contributes to activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and promotes recruitment of the Rad51 recombinase. Thus, the telomere length-dependent regulation of TERRA and TERRA R-loops is a critical determinant of the rate of replicative senescence.

Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes harboring G-rich repetitive sequences that prevent repair activities at chromosome termini (Arnoult and Karlseder, 2015Arnoult N. Karlseder J.

How telomeres solve the end-protection problem.Science. 2009; 326: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). As the canonical replication machinery is unable to compensate for the end replication problem (Lingner et al., 1995Lingner J. Cooper J.P. Cech T.R.

Telomerase, a reverse-transcriptase, counteracts telomere loss by adding de novo repeats to the 3′ ends (Greider and Blackburn, 1987Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

Lingner J. Telomere length homeostasis.Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Lack of telomerase activity leads to progressive telomere shortening, ultimately resulting in a permanent checkpoint-mediated arrest, referred to as replicative senescence (Campisi and d’Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d’Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar). In some metazoans, where telomerase becomes downregulated in somatic cells, replicative senescence is considered tumor-suppressive by limiting the number of divisions a proliferative cell can undergo. Telomere shortening must, however, be tightly regulated to ensure that senescence does not occur prematurely, which could lead to failed tissue regeneration potential. In yeast, one critically short telomere is sufficient to trigger senescence (Abdallah et al., 2009Abdallah P. Luciano P. Runge K.W. Lisby M. Géli V. Gilson E. Teixeira M.T.

The length of the shortest telomere as the major determinant of the onset of replicative senescence.Genetics. 2013; 194: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas four to five critically short telomeres are required in human cells (Kaul et al., 2011Kaul Z. Cesare A.J. Huschtscha L.I. Neumann A.A. Reddel R.R. Five dysfunctional telomeres predict onset of senescence in human cells.EMBO Rep. 2011; 13: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At critically short telomeres, homology-directed repair (HDR) between sister chromatids can partially compensate for the loss of telomeric repeats in the absence of telomerase, thereby buffering against early onset senescence (Fallet et al., 2014Fallet E. Jolivet P. Soudet J. Lisby M. Gilson E. Teixeira M.T. Length-dependent processing of telomeres in the absence of telomerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3648-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The in vivo activity of budding yeast telomerase requires the proteins Est1, Est2, Est3, and the RNA moiety TLC1 (Hughes et al., 1997Hughes T.R. Morris D.K. Salinger A. Walcott N. Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. The role of the EST genes in yeast telomere replication.Ciba Found. Symp. 1997; 211 (Discussion 47–52, 71–75): 41-47PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of any of these components results in replicative senescence following multiple population doublings (Abdallah et al., 2009Abdallah P. Luciano P. Runge K.W. Lisby M. Géli V. Gilson E.

A mutant with a defect in telomere elongation leads to senescence in yeast.Cell. 1989; 57: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) in a similar manner to human somatic cells where telomerase is not expressed (Teixeira, 2013Teixeira M.T. Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to study replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening.Front. Oncol. 2013; 3: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Yeast telomeres are bound by the Rap1 protein, which additionally recruits Rif1 and Rif2 (Hardy et al., 1992Hardy C.F. Sussel L. Shore D. A RAP1-interacting protein involved in transcriptional silencing and telomere length regulation.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, Wotton and Shore, 1997Wotton D.

A novel Rap1p-interacting factor, Rif2p, cooperates with Rif1p to regulate telomere length in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) to promote end protection (Bonetti et al., 2010Bonetti D. Clerici M. Anbalagan S. Martina M. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Shelterin-like proteins and Yku inhibit nucleolytic processing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000966Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and regulate the frequency of telomerase action (Teixeira et al., 2004Teixeira M.T. Arneric M. Sperisen P. Lingner J. Telomere length homeostasis is achieved via a switch between telomerase- extendible and -nonextendible states.Cell. 2004; 117: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Rap1 also interacts with Sir3 and Sir4 that, together with the histone deacetylase Sir2, initiate heterochromatin formation in subtelomeric regions (Moretti et al., 1994Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Evidence that a complex of SIR proteins interacts with the silencer and telomere-binding protein RAP1.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The distribution of Rif1 and Rif2 along telomere repeats may not be equal, and it has been suggested that Rif2 is enriched at the distal tip of the chromosome end, whereas Rif1 remains centromere proximal (McGee et al., 2010McGee J.S. Phillips J.A. Chan A. Sabourin M. Paeschke K. Zakian V.A. Reduced Rif2 and lack of Mec1 target short telomeres for elongation rather than double-strand break repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, the loss of Rif2 precedes the loss of Rif1 during telomere shortening (McGee et al., 2010McGee J.S. Phillips J.A. Chan A. Sabourin M. Paeschke K. Zakian V.A. Reduced Rif2 and lack of Mec1 target short telomeres for elongation rather than double-strand break repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is transcribed at telomeres in a conserved manner from yeast to humans (Azzalin et al., 2007Azzalin C.M. Reichenbach P. Khoriauli L. Giulotto E. Lingner J. Telomeric repeat containing RNA and RNA surveillance factors at mammalian chromosome ends.Science. 2007; 318: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, Feuerhahn et al., 2010Feuerhahn S.

Panza A. Redon S. Iglesias N. Li Z. Lingner J. The Rat1p 5′ to 3′ exonuclease degrades telomeric repeat-containing RNA and promotes telomere elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). TERRA is an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcript that harbors sequence elements from the subtelomere and telomeric repeats (Luke et al., 2008Luke B. Panza A. Redon S. Iglesias N. Li Z. Lingner J. The Rat1p 5′ to 3′ exonuclease degrades telomeric repeat-containing RNA and promotes telomere elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In yeast, TERRA levels are kept low by Rat1, a nuclear 5′-3′ RNA exonuclease (Luke et al., 2008Luke B. Panza A. Redon S. Iglesias N. Li Z. Lingner J. The Rat1p 5′ to 3′ exonuclease degrades telomeric repeat-containing RNA and promotes telomere elongation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The Sir2/Sir3/Sir4 complex also restricts TERRA expression, presumably via transcriptional repression (Iglesias et al., 2011Iglesias N. Redon S. Pfeiffer V. Dees M. Lingner J. Luke B. Subtelomeric repetitive elements determine TERRA regulation by Rap1/Rif and Rap1/Sir complexes in yeast.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rif1 and Rif2 additionally contribute to TERRA repression and genetic interactions suggest that this is Rat1-mediated (Iglesias et al., 2011Iglesias N. Redon S. Pfeiffer V. Dees M. Lingner J. Luke B. Subtelomeric repetitive elements determine TERRA regulation by Rap1/Rif and Rap1/Sir complexes in yeast.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In human cells, TERRA levels and localization are cell-cycle regulated but its localization is perturbed in cancer cell lines that employ the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism of telomere maintenance (Flynn et al., 2015Flynn R.L. Cox K.E. Jeitany M. Wakimoto H. Bryll A.R. Ganem N.J. Bersani F. Pineda J.R. Suvà M.L.

Biol. 2010; 30: 4808-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The nature of TERRA’s cell-cycle regulation remains to be clarified. It has been proposed that TERRA forms physiologically relevant RNA-DNA hybrids at telomeres (Arora and Azzalin, 2015Arora R. Azzalin C.M.

Commun. 2017; 8: 14015Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In human ALT cancer cell lines, as well as in the yeast equivalents (type II survivors), both TERRA levels and RNA-DNA hybrid abundance at telomeres are upregulated (Arora et al., 2014Arora R. Lee Y.

Moreover, when telomeres become short during replicative senescence, TERRA abundance increases (Cusanelli et al., 2013Cusanelli E. Romero C.A. Chartrand P.

RNA-DNA hybrids formed in a transcription-dependent manner are referred to as R-loops and lead to three-stranded nucleic acid structures, whereby the hybrid results in the displacement of one strand of DNA (Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). When not resolved, R-loops pose a threat to genome stability by causing replication fork stalling and may trigger the formation of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2008Aguilera A.

In yeast, there are multiple measures in place to protect the genome from RNA-DNA hybrid accumulation. Among these are the RNase H1 and H2 enzymes, which digest the RNA moiety of the hybrid (Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. Ribonuclease H: the enzymes in eukaryotes.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), helicases like Sen1 and Pif1 that preferentially unwind hybrid molecules (Boulé and Zakian, 2007Boulé J.B.

RNA-DNA hybrids accumulate at yeast telomeres following the ablation of RNase H activity (Balk et al., 2013Balk B. Maicher A. Dees M. Klermund J. Luke-Glaser S. Bender K. Luke B.

Lingner J. TERRA promotes telomere shortening through exonuclease 1-mediated resection of chromosome ends.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002747Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In telomerase-negative yeast, the elevated presence of RNA-DNA hybrids correlates with increased rates of HDR at telomeres and hence a delayed onset of replicative senescence (Balk et al., 2013Balk B. Maicher A. Dees M. Klermund J. Luke-Glaser S. Bender K. Luke B. Telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids affect telomere-length dynamics and senescence.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, short telomeres are particularly prone to processing and eventual HDR in pre-senescent cells in order to prevent premature senescence (Fallet et al., 2014Fallet E. Jolivet P. Soudet J. Lisby M. Gilson E. Teixeira M.T. Length-dependent processing of telomeres in the absence of telomerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3648-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that TERRA may be involved in forming R-loops at critically short telomeres to promote HDR (Balk et al., 2013Balk B. Maicher A. Dees M. Klermund J. Luke-Glaser S. Bender K. Luke B. Telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids affect telomere-length dynamics and senescence.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, Rippe and Luke, 2015Rippe K. Luke B. TERRA and the state of the telomere.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that critically short telomeres accumulate TERRA and TERRA R-loops, the latter of which are important to ensure that activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) occurs and prevents early senescence onset. We have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. Our data indicate that the inability of cells to remove TERRA R-loops at critically short telomeres helps to ensure a cis regulatory mechanism to promote HDR specifically at short, and not long, telomeres, to prevent premature senescence. To understand how TERRA regulation and function are related, we measured its levels by qRT-PCR after releasing G1-arrested cells into the cell cycle (Figures 1A and 1B). TERRA levels peaked 60 min post-release (Figure 1B), corresponding to the S phase (Figure 1A). In agreement, TERRA levels increased in hydroxyurea (HU)-arrested cells (S phase), as compared to both α-factor (G1) and nocodazole (G2/M)-treated samples (Figures S1A and S1B). We used the S9.6 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids of at least 6–8 bp (Phillips et al., 2013Phillips D.D. Garboczi D.N. Singh K. Hu Z. Leppla S.H. Leysath C.E.

We created an auxin-inducible degron (AID) version of the largest RNAPII subunit, Rpb1 (RPB1AID), to rapidly degrade RNAPII and extinguish TERRA transcription upon the addition of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) (Morawska and Ulrich, 2013Morawska M. Ulrich H.D. An expanded tool kit for the auxin-inducible degron system in budding yeast.Yeast. 2013; 30: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar; Figures 1D and 1E). The increase of telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids (Figure 1F) as well as TERRA levels (Figure S1E) was abolished upon RNAPII degradation in S phase-arrested cells. We failed to detect an S phase-specific increase in telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids at modified telomere 7L∗ (Figure S1F), which is defective for TERRA production (Balk et al., 2013Balk B. Maicher A. Dees M. Klermund J. Luke-Glaser S. Bender K. Luke B. Telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids affect telomere-length dynamics and senescence.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), whereas other telomeres in the same strain accumulated RNA-DNA hybrids in the S phase. Although the S phase in S. cerevisiae is short, it can be segmented using varying HU concentrations (Clarke et al., 2001Clarke D.J. Segal M. Jensen S. Reed S.I. Mec1p regulates Pds1p levels in S phase: complex coordination of DNA replication and mitosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When G1-arrested cells are released into different concentrations of HU, we detect varying amounts of replication (Figure 1G) and Sic1 degradation, indicating passage through “Start” at the G1/S transition (Figure 1H). TERRA and R-loops accumulate when cells are released into high concentrations of HU (250 mM corresponding to limited replication) (Figures 1I and 1J) and decrease as genome duplication progresses (75 mM HU). The intra-S phase regulation of R-loops may be telomere-specific, as we did not observe similar trends when analyzing R-loops at either the actin or rDNA loci (Figure S1G).

Here, we map and functionally characterize axonal projections from oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus to midbrain DA regions. Electrophysiological recordings of DA neurons reveal that both the application of oxytocin and optogenetic stimulation of oxytocinergic terminals suffice to increase DA neuron activity in the VTA but downregulate it in SNc. This biased modulation is mediated by oxytocin and vasopressin G-protein-coupled receptors. Oxytocin release directly activates DA neurons and indirectly inhibits them through local GABA neurons, but the relative magnitudes of the two mechanisms differ in VTA and SNc. Oxytocin-modulated DA neurons give rise to canonical striatal projections. Since hypothalamic oxytocinergic projections also target the striatum, oxytocin is poised to bias the balance of DA tone through multiple sites in vertebrate reward circuits.

In the vertebrate basal ganglia, timed release of the neuromodulator dopamine (DA) supports complex, goal-directed actions (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010Bromberg-Martin E.S. Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O.

The majority of midbrain neurons that produce DA reside in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The core projections of VTA DA neurons target ventral striatal (vStr) areas, subserving reward-based learning, while SNc DA neurons primarily target motor action-associated dorsal striatum (dStr). Genetically guided tracing experiments have facilitated the identification of input and output wiring of DA neurons in the VTA and SNc (Beier et al., 2015Beier K.T. Steinberg E.E. DeLoach K.E. Xie S.

The results of functional experiments, including calcium imaging of DA terminals, further support the preferential links of VTA DA signaling to reward and SNc-derived DA tone to locomotion (Howe and Dombeck, 2016Howe M.W.

Oxytocin (Oxt) is synthesized and released by neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). This neuropeptide and hormone is linked to the reward system through its effects on social behaviors, including social reward, social learning, pair bond formation, parenting, and mating (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001Gimpl G.

Numerous studies demonstrate an indirect or downstream interaction of Oxt and DA signaling. A key example is Oxt release into the vStr, which promotes affiliative social behavior (Liu and Wang, 2003Liu Y. Wang Z.X.

Wang Z. The neurobiology of pair bonding.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). However, the only current evidence for a direct Oxt regulation of DA neuron activity focuses on prolactin induction in the arcuate nucleus (Briffaud et al., 2015Briffaud V. Williams P. Courty J. Broberger C. Excitation of tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons by oxytocin: crosstalk in the control of lactation.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 4229-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Prior results suggest the possibility that Oxt also acts in the midbrain. Behavioral studies show that activation of Oxt receptors (OxtRs) in the VTA is important for social reward (Song et al., 2016Song Z. Borland J.M. Larkin T.E. O’Malley M. Albers H.E. Activation of oxytocin receptors, but not arginine-vasopressin V1a receptors, in the ventral tegmental area of male Syrian hamsters is essential for the reward-like properties of social interactions.Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2016; 74: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Oxt in the VTA may generally influence reward-based behavior, since Oxt infusions there suppress sucrose intake (Mullis et al., 2013Mullis K. Kay K. Williams D.L. Oxytocin action in the ventral tegmental area affects sucrose intake.Brain Res. 2013; 1513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent trans-synaptic tracing analysis showed that Oxt neurons from the PVN project to VTA DA neurons (Beier et al., 2015Beier K.T. Steinberg E.E. DeLoach K.E. Xie S. Miyamichi K. Schwarz L. Gao X.J. Kremer E.J. Malenka R.C. Luo L. Circuit architecture of VTA dopamine neurons revealed by systematic input-output mapping.Cell. 2015; 162: 622-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), while another study demonstrated that Oxt could regulate the activity of a subset of unclassified VTA neurons (Tang et al., 2014Tang Y. Chen Z. Tao H. Li C. Zhang X. Tang A. Liu Y. Oxytocin activation of neurons in ventral tegmental area and interfascicular nucleus of mouse midbrain.Neuropharmacology. 2014; 77: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, Oxt may directly modulate VTA DA neurons. Whether Oxt projections also target SNc DA neurons has remained unexplored. One of the two brain regions enriched in Oxt somata, the PVN, sends monosynaptic projections to the SNc (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012Watabe-Uchida M. Zhu L. Ogawa S.K. Vamanrao A. Uchida N. Whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2012; 74: 858-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), where Oxt infusions reduce locomotor activity (Angioni et al., 2016Angioni L. Cocco C. Ferri G.L. Argiolas A. Melis M.R. Sanna F. Involvement of nigral oxytocin in locomotor activity: a behavioral, immunohistochemical and lesion study in male rats.Horm. Behav. 2016; 83: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Despite experimental support for the existence of midbrain-targeting Oxt projections and behavioral effects of Oxt infusions, the functional impact of Oxt on the activity of DA neurons in either VTA or SNc has not been examined. In the central nervous system, Oxt binds to a single G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (OxtR) primarily coupled to Gαq protein effectors, but, at higher concentrations, Oxt is able to recruit Gαi subunits (Busnelli et al., 2012Busnelli M. Saulière A. Manning M. Bouvier M. Galés C. Chini B. Functional selective oxytocin-derived agonists discriminate between individual G protein family subtypes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 3617-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Binding to Gαq-coupled OxtR stimulates the phospholipase C pathway to enhance neuronal firing (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F.

Neuromodulation by oxytocin and vasopressin.Neuron. 2012; 76: 142-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Oxt can also bind with lower affinity to the three vasopressin (Avp) receptors V1aR, V1bR, and V2R (Tribollet et al., 1988Tribollet E. Barberis C. Jard S. Dubois-Dauphin M. Dreifuss J.J.

Oxtr transcripts have been found in rodent VTA and SNc (Peris et al., 2017Peris J. MacFadyen K. Smith J.A. de Kloet A.D. Wang L. Krause E.G.

If these areas express both OxtR and AvpR, then the activation of either receptor by Oxt could result in a net increase in neuronal activity. To dissect the mechanisms of oxytocinergic modulation of DA neurons in the VTA and SNc, we used a combination of anatomical, optogenetic, and electrophysiological approaches. Here, we show that Oxt controls neuronal activity in midbrain DA regions through direct and polysynaptic effects. These effects are driven by Oxt release itself, which acts on several Oxt-sensing receptors, including Oxt and Avp GPCRs. Our results place DA signaling under prominent control of a neuropeptide that is known to regulate social behavior and interact with reward signaling. To determine whether Oxt neurons project to midbrain DA regions, we unilaterally injected green retrobeads (GRBs) into either the VTA or the SNc of postnatal day 25–30 (P25–P30) mice expressing tdTomato under control of the Oxt promoter (Oxt i-Cre; Ai14) (Figures 1A–1F). We validated the specificity of this line by imaging the overlap between tdTomato and Oxt immunofluorescent (IF) labeling in the PVN (695/732 tdTomato+ neurons were Oxt+, 3 mice) (Figure 1A). GRB+ cells were observed in the ipsilateral PVN, as well as in the striatum and lateral hypothalamus (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012Watabe-Uchida M. Zhu L. Ogawa S.K. Vamanrao A. Uchida N. Whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2012; 74: 858-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), but not in the SON (Figures 1D and 1E; Figure S1A). Similar numbers of PVN neurons were labeled following GRB injections targeting the VTA or the SNc (VTAtarget, 90.8 ± 12.2 neurons/mouse; SNctarget, 108.0 ± 12.5 neurons/mouse; p = 0.548, Mann-Whitney test, n = 5 mice/group) (Figures 1E and 1F). Approximately 20% of GRB+ neurons in the PVN were tdTomato+, providing evidence for a direct oxytocinergic PVN projection to midbrain DA regions (proportion tdTomato+/GRB+ in the VTA, 0.237 ± 0.022; SNc, 0.239 ± 0.016; p = 0.691, Mann-Whitney test, n = 5 mice/group) (Figure 1F). The proportion of Oxt neurons in these PVN-arising efferents is consistent with a recent trans-synaptic tracing analysis of PVN outputs (Beier et al., 2015Beier K.T. Steinberg E.E. DeLoach K.E. Xie S. Miyamichi K. Schwarz L. Gao X.J. Kremer E.J. Malenka R.C. Luo L. Circuit architecture of VTA dopamine neurons revealed by systematic input-output mapping.Cell. 2015; 162: 622-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the same set of Oxt PVN neurons project to both VTA and SNc, we injected both GRBs and red retrobeads (RRBs) separately into the VTA and SNc of wild-type mice (Figure S1B). After 7–9 days, we evaluated the overlap between RB+ cells and Oxt neurons in the PVN (Figures 1G and 1H; Figure S1B). Both GRBs and RRBs were found in PVN Oxt neurons, at similar proportions as for single-color RB labeling. However, few GRB+/RRB+ neurons overlapped with Oxt neurons, demonstrating that Oxt projections to the VTA and SNc are largely separate (25.75 ± 4.77 Oxt+ neurons/mouse project to the VTA; 37.50 ± 6.97 Oxt+ neurons/mouse project to the SNc; 2.25 ± 0.73 Oxt+ neurons/mouse project to both regions, n = 4 mice, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests, p < 0.001) (Figures 1G and 1H). For examining the projection of PVN Oxt neurons to midbrain DA regions, we relied on Oxt i-Cre mice injected with a Cre-dependent recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) expressing eYFP into the PVN (Figure 1I). Here, 452/491 eYFP+ neurons were labeled for Oxt IF (3 mice) (Figure 1I). In addition to the well-described projections to amygdala and striatum (Knobloch et al., 2012Knobloch H.S. Charlet A. Hoffmann L.C. Eliava M. Khrulev S. Cetin A.H. Osten P. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Stoop R. Grinevich V. Evoked axonal oxytocin release in the central amygdala attenuates fear response.Neuron. 2012; 73: 553-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), we observed eYFP+ axons in both the VTA and the SNc as well as in the lateral hypothalamus (Figure 1J; Figures S1C and S1D). We observed a mediolateral linear trend in the density of virally transduced axons, with the peak of expression in dorsolateral SNc and the poorly defined reticular area along its border (eYFP+ axonal density, VTA, 553.9 ± 86.4 mm/mm3; SNc, 783.7 ± 92.8 mm/mm3; reticular SNc, 1,515.9 ± 231.9 mm/mm3, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA and post hoc test for linear trend, 3 mice) (Figures 1J and 1K; Figures S1C and S1D). Thus, both retrograde and anterograde tracing results confirm that PVN oxytocinergic efferents directly project to the VTA and SNc. To evaluate which neurons in DA regions are capable of responding to Oxt, we investigated Oxt-sensing receptor expression in the VTA and SNc. We analyzed tissue immunofluorescently double labeled for OxtR and the canonical marker of DA neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Figure 2A). An ∼2-fold greater proportion of TH+ somata co-localized with OxtR+ puncta in the VTA versus in the SNc (∼55% of VTA TH+ cells were OxtR IF+, but only ∼26% in the SNc, p < 0.05, unpaired t test) (Figure 2B). Significantly fewer OxtR puncta were observed following IF in tissue where OxtR was conditionally knocked out from DAT+ neurons, confirming the specificity of receptor labeling. We also used a previously characterized OxtR antibody to confirm expression in the VTA and SNc (Marlin et al., 2015Marlin B.J. Mitre M. D’amour J.A. Chao M.V. Froemke R.C. Oxytocin enables maternal behaviour by balancing cortical inhibition.Nature. 2015; 520: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (Figures S2A and S2B). To refine and corroborate the results of IF assays, we carried out quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays for mRNA of Oxtr and Avpr1a in the VTA and SNc. DA and GABA neurons were identified by labeling for Th and Slc32a1 (vesicular GABA transporter, Vgat) (Figures 2C and 2F). In the VTA, we observed co-localization of Oxtr with both Th and Vgat probes (proportion of Th+ cells expressing Oxtr, 6.86% ± 2.81%; proportion of Vgat+ cells expressing Oxtr, 8.38% ± 0.46%, n = 3 mice) (Figures 2D and 2E; Figure S2C). We observed a higher degree of co-localization of Avpr1a with Th and Vgat in the VTA (proportion of Th+ cells expressing Avpr1a, 25.70% ± 8.97%; proportion of Vgat+ cells expressing Avpr1a, 29.77% ± 6.02%) (Figures 2F–2H; Figure S2D). Since a subset of Oxt neurons co-releases Avp in lactating rats (Mezey and Kiss, 1991Mezey E. Kiss J.Z. Coexpression of vasopressin and oxytocin in hypothalamic supraoptic neurons of lactating rats.Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether neurons in reporter mice expressing Cre recombinase under Avp promoter (Avp i-Cre) are Oxt+. Despite the presence of Avpr1a in the VTA, we confirmed that <1% of PVN Oxt neurons (6/688 neurons, 2 mice) co-express Avp, consistent with a previous study (Knobloch et al., 2012Knobloch H.S. Charlet A. Hoffmann L.C. Eliava M. Khrulev S. Cetin A.H. Osten P. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Stoop R. Grinevich V. Evoked axonal oxytocin release in the central amygdala attenuates fear response.Neuron. 2012; 73: 553-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) (Figures S2E and S2F). In the SNc, few Th+ cells were positive for Oxtr or Avpr1a (Oxtr, 3.72% ± 0.39%; Avpr1a, 3.03% ± 1.14%); likewise, few Vgat+ cells co-localized with Oxtr or Avpr1a (Oxtr, 5.50% ± 0.16%; Avpr1a, 1.75% ± 0.53%) (Figures 2D–2H). Unexpectedly, we identified dense Oxtr+ puncta, distributed in the reticular part of the SNc, which co-localized with the Vgat+ cells (11.3% ± 2.04%) (Figures 2C–2E). These data support the notion that Oxt may regulate DA and GABA neurons in the VTA via OxtR and V1aR; furthermore, it may indirectly influence DA neurons in the SNc by modulating dorsolateral SNc reticular GABA neurons. This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that the greatest density of PVN oxytocinergic axons is in the most dorsolateral aspect of SNc (Figures 1J and 1K). Oxt neurons are classified into magnocellular and parvocellular subtypes, distinct in morphology, amount of Oxt production, and electrophysiological properties (Eliava et al., 2016Eliava M.

Magnocellular Oxt neurons can be distinguished from parvocellular ones by a longer latency to spike in response to positive current injections and a transient outward rectification following relief from hyperpolarization (Eliava et al., 2016Eliava M. Melchior M. Knobloch-Bollmann H.S. Wahis J. da Silva Gouveia M. Tang Y. Ciobanu A.C. Triana del Rio R. Roth L.C.

To determine the subtype that gives rise to these midbrain projections, we injected GRBs into either the VTA or the SNc of Oxt i-Cre; Ai14 mice and recorded PVN Oxt neurons. PVN tdTomato+/GRB+ neurons in both GRBVTA- and GRBSNc-injected mice lacked this transient outward rectification and showed a short latency to spike. We found that they also had relatively small somata (Figures 3A and 3C ). In contrast, Oxt+/GRB− neurons with large somata showed transient outward rectification and had longer latencies to action potential firing when depolarized (Figures 3B and 3C). We further compared soma area of Oxt+/GRB+ and Oxt+/GRB− neurons in confocal images from Figure 1 and found that Oxt+/GRB+ neurons have smaller somata (Oxt+/GRB+ neurons, 174.26 ± 6.58 μm2; Oxt+/GRB− neurons, 215.12 ± 2.32 μm2; p < 0.0001, unpaired t test, n = 79 Oxt+/GRB+ neurons and 764 Oxt+/GRB− neurons from 2 GRBVTA- and 2 GRBSNc-injected mice) (Figure 3D). Together with prior reports of differences between magno- and parvocellular neurons (Eliava et al., 2016Eliava M. Melchior M. Knobloch-Bollmann H.S. Wahis J. da Silva Gouveia M. Tang Y. Ciobanu A.C.

To reveal the functional consequences of Oxt signaling for DA neurons, we recorded tdTomato+ neurons in slices prepared from DAT i-Cre; Ai14 mice (Figure S3A). DA neurons tended to be tonically active, with firing rates (FRs) around 1–2 Hz and membrane potential “sag” in response to hyperpolarizing current injections (Guzman et al., 2009Guzman J.N.

Physiol. 2008; 586: 2157-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Figures S3B and S3C). Consistent with the view that Oxt primarily acts at the Gαq-coupled receptors in the central neural system (Grinevich et al., 2016Grinevich V. Knobloch-Bollmann H.S. Eliava M. Busnelli M. Chini B. Assembling the puzzle: pathways of oxytocin signaling in the brain.Biol. Psychiatry. 2016; 79: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), VTA DA neurons increased FR in the presence of 1 μM bath-applied Oxt, recovering back to baseline following removal of the peptide (control, 0.70 ± 0.16 Hz; Oxt, 0.94 ± 0.18 Hz; washout, 0.71 ± 0.18 Hz; p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests, n = 22 neurons, 15 mice) (Figures 4A and 4C ). Oxt-responsive neurons were defined here and throughout as those exhibiting at least a 20% change from baseline activity level in response to Oxt application—for these neurons, Oxt-mediated enhancement in firing was approximately 2-fold (210.5% ± 22.0% of baseline activity) (Figure 4C). The observed effect on tonic activity in the presence of Oxt was accompanied by a modest decrement in afterhyperpolarization and action potential height (Figure S3D). To confirm that this modulation did not depend on the intracellular recording configuration, we recapitulated this observation using cell-attached recordings of DAT+ neurons (Figure S3E). In contrast, the FRs of SNc DA neurons during Oxt application showed a more heterogeneous set of responses, correlated with the mediolateral positions of the neurons. Medial SNc DA neurons did not show a significant FR modulation in response to Oxt application (control, 0.87 ± 0.29 Hz; Oxt, 1.02 ± 0.27 Hz; washout, 0.80 ± 0.30 Hz; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.270, n = 8 neurons, 8 mice) (Figure 4D). However, lateral SNc DA neurons reversibly decreased FR in the presence of Oxt (control, 0.91 ± 0.18 Hz; Oxt, 0.49 ± 0.14 Hz; washout, 0.91 ± 0.22 Hz; p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests, n = 14 neurons, 12 mice) (Figures 4B and 4D). In the lateral SNc, Oxt decreased the FR of Oxt-sensitive DAT+ neurons by ∼70% (31.8% ± 7.9% of baseline firing rate) (Figure 4D). For lateral SNc DA neurons recorded in cell-attached mode, spontaneous activity was also inhibited by Oxt (Figure S3F). Oxt narrowed the width and increased the height of SNc DA neuron action potentials (Figure S3D). Regardless of the anatomical distinction of VTA versus SNc, the lateral location of a DA neuron predicted a decrement in FR in response to Oxt, while a medial location was associated with an increase in FR (Figure 4E). This divergent neuromodulatory regulation of tonic activity was largely sex invariant (VTA FR change: ♂ 0.23 ± 0.10 Hz, ♀ 0.24 ± 0.09 Hz, p = 0.919, unpaired t test, n = 11 neurons/group; SNc FR change: ♂ −0.71 ± 0.23 Hz, ♀ −0.25 ± 0.12 Hz, p = 0.101, unpaired t test, n = 12 and 10 neurons/group). To validate the results of Oxt application experiments, we used a specific and selective OxtR agonist WAY267464 while recording VTA or lateral SNc DAT+ neurons. Just as for Oxt, bath-applied WAY267464 increased the FR of VTA DA neurons (control, 1.39 ± 0.19 Hz; WAY267464, 1.61 ± 0.23 Hz; p < 0.05, paired t test, n = 12 neurons, 8 mice) and decreased the FR of lateral SNc DA neurons (control, 1.52 ± 0.19 Hz; WAY267464, 1.26 ± 0.28 Hz; p < 0.05, paired t test, n = 13 neurons, 8 mice) (Figures 4F and 4G). These FR changes corresponded to a 153.7% ± 25.7% enhancement for agonist-responsive DAT+ neurons in the VTA and an over 2-fold decrease in activity for SNc DAT+ neurons (38.7% ± 4.5% of baseline FR). Next, we investigated whether endogenous Oxt release is sufficient to regulate the activity of midbrain DA neurons. To selectively control release, we relied on Oxt i-Cre mice injected with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing a fusion of ChR2 and either mCherry (ChR2-mCherry) or eYFP (ChR2-eYFP) into the PVN (Figure 5A). A single medial injection provided dense and specific coverage of PVN Oxt neurons: 712/839 ChR2+ neurons from 5 mice overlapped with Oxt IF (Figure 5A; Figures S4A and S4B). Virally labeled axons were observed in the VTA and SNc, corroborating anterograde mapping experiments. PVN ChR2+ neurons reliably responded to pulses of 470 nm light (Figure 5B). Since high-frequency stimulation is required to induce Oxt release (Knobloch et al., 2012Knobloch H.S. Charlet A. Hoffmann L.C. Eliava M. Khrulev S. Cetin A.H. Osten P. Schwarz M"

We examined the impact of germline heterozygous frameshift Chd8 mutation on neurodevelopment in mice. Chd8+/del5 mice displayed normal social interactions with no repetitive behaviors but exhibited cognitive impairment correlated with increased regional brain volume, validating that phenotypes of Chd8+/del5 mice overlap pathology reported in humans with CHD8 mutations. We applied network analysis to characterize neurodevelopmental gene expression, revealing widespread transcriptional changes in Chd8+/del5 mice across pathways disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurogenesis, synaptic processes and neuroimmune signaling. We identified a co-expression module with peak expression in early brain development featuring dysregulation of RNA processing, chromatin remodeling and cell-cycle genes enriched for promoter binding by Chd8, and we validated increased neuronal proliferation and developmental splicing perturbation in Chd8+/del5 mice. This integrative analysis offers an initial picture of the consequences of Chd8 haploinsufficiency for brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2733713504,"Through an integration of genomic and proteomic approaches to advance understanding of long noncoding RNAs, we investigate the function of the telomeric transcript, TERRA. By identifying thousands of TERRA target sites in the mouse genome, we demonstrate that TERRA can bind both in cis to telomeres and in trans to genic targets. We then define a large network of interacting proteins, including epigenetic factors, telomeric proteins, and the RNA helicase, ATRX. TERRA and ATRX share hundreds of target genes and are functionally antagonistic at these loci: whereas TERRA activates, ATRX represses gene expression. At telomeres, TERRA competes with telomeric DNA for ATRX binding, suppresses ATRX localization, and ensures telomeric stability. Depleting TERRA increases telomerase activity and induces telomeric pathologies, including formation of telomere-induced DNA damage foci and loss or duplication of telomeric sequences. We conclude that TERRA functions as an epigenomic modulator in trans and as an essential regulator of telomeres in cis."

However, recent studies indicate that this process re-activates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in which amyloid promotes microglia-mediated removal of synapses (Hong et al., 2016Hong S. Beja-Glasser V.F. Nfonoyim B.M. Frouin A. Li S. Ramakrishnan S. Merry K.M. Shi Q. Rosenthal A. Barres B.A. et al.Complement and microglia mediate early synapse loss in Alzheimer mouse models.Science. 2016; 352: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Synaptic loss, an early and highly predictive correlate of cognitive decline (Terry et al., 1991Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. DeTeresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A. Katzman R. Physical basis of cognitive alterations in Alzheimer’s disease: synapse loss is the major correlate of cognitive impairment.Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar), occurs not only in AD but also in other distinct neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of toxic protein aggregates. This accumulation classifies these disorders as proteinopathies. Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) reveals that most genes associated with risk to develop such disorders are highly expressed in microglia, which implies that they could modulate immune and phagocytic functions in disease states (Derecki et al., 2014Derecki N.C. Katzmarski N. Kipnis J. Meyer-Luehmann M. Microglia as a critical player in both developmental and late-life CNS pathologies.Acta Neuropathol. 2014; 128: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This hypothesis suggests that they may confer susceptibility to develop the diseases by modulating microglia-mediated protein aggregates clearance rather than production. We previously demonstrated that risk genes associated with late-onset AD do not affect amyloid production, which suggests that these predisposing genetic factors contribute to disease development through different mechanisms (Bali et al., 2012Bali J. Gheinani A.H. Zurbriggen S. Rajendran L. Role of genes linked to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease risk in the production of β-amyloid peptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 15307-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data implicate microglia in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains unknown whether an intrinsic dysfunction in microglia can promote pathological synaptic pruning leading to abnormal synapse loss. Microglia, the scavenger cells of the brain, play a key role as moderators of protein aggregates clearance, which occurs intracellularly through enzymatic degradation following phagocytosis or extracellularly through degradation by secreted enzymes (Vekrellis et al., 2000Vekrellis K.

However, no evidence so far existed to support a role for loss of TDP-43 in microglia in the pathogenesis of the disease. We wanted to confirm whether the enhanced clearance observed upon Tardbp knockdown could be also replicated with human Aβ. To this end, TDP-43-depleted BV2 cells were incubated overnight with conditioned medium derived from HeLa cells overexpressing the Swedish mutation of the human Amyloid Precursor Protein (sweAPP). This assay ensured that BV2 cells were exposed to medium containing high levels of human Aβ. Consistent with our findings from the murine Aβ screen, TDP-43 depletion resulted in a higher clearance capacity of all the Aβ species measured, compared to a scrambled control (Figure 1A). We achieved efficient TDP-43 depletion using either siRNA pools or single oligos (Figure 1B), with consistent results on amyloid clearance (Figure S1E). To determine whether enhanced phagocytosis was the mechanism that mediated this enhanced clearance, we measured the internalization of fluorescently labeled Aβ peptide, a cargo previously reported to be phagocytosed by microglia (Paresce et al., 1996Paresce D.M. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Microglial cells internalize aggregates of the Alzheimer’s disease amyloid beta-protein via a scavenger receptor.Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In a validation experiment, the internalization of the Aβ peptide was followed in time lapse with the pH-dependent LysoTracker dye, to ensure that the cargo was trafficked to intracellular acidic compartments (Movie S1; Figurea S2A and S2B). TDP-43 depletion significantly enhanced intracellular levels of fluorescent Aβ (Figures 1C and 1D). Consistent with the enhanced uptake, we found a similar effect using fluorescently labeled dextran (Figures 1E and 1F) and transferrin (Figures 1G and 1H), which target uptake-mediated cargo. These results indicate that TDP-43 depletion in microglia increases the overall phagocytic activity. Next, we determined whether the increased uptake was functionally followed by enhanced intracellular degradation. For that, we quantified the fluorescent signal of internalized Aβ40 3 hr after the uptake (T = 3 hr) and found a significant reduction in intracellular fluorescence, despite a higher uptake as measured by the initial amount (T = 0 hr) (Figures 1I and 1J). Since TDP-43 depletion increased intracellular degradation and amyloid is sorted to the lysosomal compartment for degradation in microglia (Cole et al., 1992Cole G.M. Bell L. Truong Q.B. Saitoh T. An endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation of amyloid precursor protein.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1992; 674: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we examined whether increased lysosomal function occurs after TDP-43 depletion. We found higher levels of acidic late endosomal/lysosomal structures indicated by the pH-sensitive LysoTracker staining (Figures 1K and 1L). In addition, increased levels of lysosomal markers, such as LAMP1 and LAMP2, also accompanied the increased changes in acidic organelles in both BV2 cells (Figure 1M) and primary microglia cultures depleted of TDP-43 (Figures S3A–S3C). TDP-43 loss was recently shown to promote the nuclear translocation of TFEB, a transcription factor regulating lysosomal biogenesis (Xia et al., 2016Xia Q. Wang H. Hao Z. Fu C. Hu Q. Gao F. Ren H. Chen D. Han J. Ying Z. Wang G. TDP-43 loss of function increases TFEB activity and blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this was the case in microglia cells depleted of TDP-43, we assessed a subset of CLEAR (coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation) genes transcripts, downstream of TFEB, by RT-PCR. We found that the expression of Lamp1, CtsD, CtsB, Clcn7, vATP6v1h, Psap, and Psen2 in TDP-43-depleted cells was higher than in scrambled control (Figure S3D). Overall, these data identify and validate TDP-43 as a regulator of microglial phagocytosis and clearance of Aβ. We then determined the physiological relevance of these findings in vivo by generating a microglial-specific inducible conditional TDP-43 knockout mouse line (cKO). We crossed mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible CRE recombinase (CreER) under the control of the endogenous Cx3cr1 microglia-specific promoter (Cx3cr1creER-YFP; Parkhurst et al., 2013Parkhurst C.N. Yang G. Ninan I. Savas J.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Lafaille J.J. Hempstead B.L. Littman D.R. Gan W.B. Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor.Cell. 2013; 155: 1596-1609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar) with Tardbpfloxed mice (Chiang et al., 2010Chiang P.M. Ling J. Jeong Y.H. Price D.L. Aja S.M. Wong P.C. Deletion of TDP-43 down-regulates Tbc1d1, a gene linked to obesity, and alters body fat metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16320-16324Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). We confirmed that Tardbp transcript levels were significantly downregulated specifically in microglia isolated from cKO mice upon tamoxifen administration compared to WT controls, whereas overall cortical levels remained unchanged (Figures S4A and S4B). In addition, nuclear TDP-43 depletion was also confirmed at the protein level, in CRE-treated microglial primary cultures prepared from Tardbpfloxed mice (Figures S4C and S4D). We then confirmed enhanced phagocytic uptake upon TDP-43 depletion in vivo by injecting Aβ42 oligomers in the cortex (100 μM, as prepared in Fa et al., 2010Fa M. Orozco I.J. Francis Y.I. Saeed F. Gong Y. Arancio O. Preparation of oligomeric beta-amyloid 1-42 and induction of synaptic plasticity impairment on hippocampal slices.J. Vis. Exp. 2010; : 1884PubMed Google Scholar) and quantifying amyloid uptake 24 hr later (Figures 2B–2E). Interestingly, we observed a significant increase of microglia cells in close proximity to the amyloid core in cKO mice compared to WT littermates, whereas no differences occurred in the area surrounding the Aβ core (Figures 2D and 2F). In the light of all our findings indicating that TDP-43 depletion in microglia enhances the phagocytic uptake of Aβ, we hypothesized that this would promote clearance to reduce the total amyloid burden in a mouse model of AD. To this end, we crossed our Cx3cr1CreER;Tardbpfloxed mice with mice overexpressing human APP carrying the Arctic and Swedish mutations (APParc, Knobloch et al., 2007Knobloch M. Konietzko U. Krebs D.C. Nitsch R.M. Intracellular Abeta and cognitive deficits precede beta-amyloid deposition in transgenic arcAbeta mice.Neurobiol. Aging. 2007; 28: 1297-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Again, in this mouse model of AD, Aβ levels measurement revealed a significant reduction in cKO;APParc compared to WT;APParc littermates (Figure 3A) in the SDS fraction of brain homogenates and showed a similar trend in the TBS fraction (Figures S5A and S5B), confirming our in vitro results that TDP-43 depletion in microglia enhanced Aβ clearance. We found no differences in sAPPβ levels, a soluble intermediate product in the generation of Aβ, indicating that the amyloidogenic processing of APP was not affected, as also suggested by comparable levels of the full-length APP (Figure 3A; Figures S5A and S5C). These results definitely show that TDP-43 depletion in microglia promotes Aβ clearance, rather than affecting production. To investigate whether the enhanced Aβ clearance had any bearing on the amyloid load, we performed ThioS staining and observed a significant reduction in the cortex of cKO;APParc mice compared to WT (Figures 3B–3D), with no change in plaque size (Figure S5D). Levels of Iba1 and CD45 markers in microglia surrounding the plaques were comparable in cKO and WT controls (Figures S5E–S5G). Since amyloid oligomers and plaques are considered the primary cause of synaptotoxicity in AD patients, we hypothesized that enhancing microglial-mediated amyloid clearance should preserve synapses. To our surprise, despite the reduction in amyloid load, we found a significant decrease in cortical synaptic markers in these mice as assayed by western blot (Figure 3E). Specifically, PSD95, a scaffold protein located in dendritic spines, was significantly reduced (Figure 3F), while levels of MAP2, a dendritic structural protein, were comparable between WT and cKO mice. These results suggest a specific reduction in dendritic spines rather than a general decrease in neuronal branches (Figure 3G). Consistently, levels of synapsin and synaptophysin were also reduced (Figures 3H and 3I). In addition, quantification of immunoreactive puncta for the synaptic marker vGlut1 also confirmed a drastic reduction in glutamatergic terminals (Figures 3J and 3K). These data show that microglia lacking TDP-43 can mediate enhanced removal and clearance of amyloid in an AD mouse model, but also in parallel, induce significant synapse loss. Overall these findings suggest that abnormally phagocytic microglia remove not only amyloid but also synapses. Microglia are shown to re-activate synaptic pruning in the presence of Aβ oligomers (Hong et al., 2016Hong S. Beja-Glasser V.F. Nfonoyim B.M. Frouin A. Li S. Ramakrishnan S. Merry K.M. Shi Q. Rosenthal A. Barres B.A. et al.Complement and microglia mediate early synapse loss in Alzheimer mouse models.Science. 2016; 352: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). Since we observed synapse loss in mice depleted of microglial TDP-43 in APP transgenic model, we next asked whether amyloid is required for the synapse loss to occur. To answer this question, we quantified the levels of synaptic markers in the cortex of WT and cKO mice where no human APP gene was overexpressed and thus no amyloid load was present. Here again, we found a significant decrease in vGlut1 and PSD95 (Figures 4A–4C). Since demyelination can occur in many neurodegenerative disorders, we also assayed levels of myelin-binding protein (MBP) isoforms and found a significant decrease (Figures 4A and 4D). The decrease in PSD95 was significant despite no changes in MAP2 levels, indicative of a selective synapse loss rather than general neuronal death (Figures 4A and 4E). Consistent with these findings, we observed a significant decrease in cortical dendritic spine density in cKO mice (Figures 4F and 4G). vGlut1 immunohistochemistry also revealed a significant decrease in mice depleted of microglial TDP-43 compared to controls (Figures 4H and 4I). These results conclusively show that synapse loss occurs due to microglial TDP-43 depletion in mice, independent of amyloid load. To directly assess the role of microglia in synapse elimination in these mice, we quantified synapse engulfment through 3D reconstruction of confocal acquisitions. Since we observed synaptic immunoreactive puncta within CD68-positive phagocytic structures inside microglia cells (Figure S6), our signal co-localization was specific. We then quantified PSD95 immunoreactive puncta within and surrounding microglia cells. There was a significant increase in the fraction of synaptic marker engulfed by TDP-43 depleted microglia compared to WT controls (Figures 4J and 4K). We also observed a significant increase in the phagocytic marker CD68 (Figure 4L). The cells had increased size and total volume of CD68-positive structures, despite no change in number of structures (Figures 4M–4O). Overall, these data show that abnormal microglial phagocytosis induced by TDP-43 depletion mediates synapse loss, regardless of the presence of amyloid. In line with our findings, we predicted that enhanced microglia-mediated clearance would affect cognitive decline by targeting synapses yet simultaneously reducing amyloid plaque load. This dual function could complicate the diagnosis of AD, which has been a topic of discussion for a very long time—whether amyloid load correlates with the cognitive decline (Braak and Braak, 1998Braak H.

We evaluated the prevalence of AD in a large cohort (n = 698) of ALS patients that typically exhibit TDP-43 pathology (Table S1). We selected an age cutoff of 65 years or older, as individuals over the age of 65 are at increased risk of sporadic AD. The prevalence of AD in ALS patients aged 65 to 74 years was comparable to what is expected in the normal population (reference to Hebert et al., 2013Hebert L.E. Weuve J. Scherr P.A. Evans D.A. Alzheimer disease in the United States (2010-2050) estimated using the 2010 census.Neurology. 2013; 80: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar); however, the AD prevalence was considerably lower in ALS patients aged 75 years and above (Figure 5A). Notably, cognitive evaluation revealed a subtle cognitive dysfunction in non-AD ALS patients older than 75 years, despite excluding patients with over-lapping FTLD (Figure 5B). These findings suggest that TDP-43 pathology is associated with reduced amyloid burden and may underlie subtle cognitive deficits in non-AD ALS patients. These"

Here we present two cryo-EM snapshots of the Thermobifida fusca type I-E Cascade: (1) unwinding 11 bp of dsDNA at the seed-sequence region to scout for sequence complementarity, and (2) further unwinding of the entire protospacer to form a full R-loop. These structures provide the much-needed temporal and spatial resolution to resolve key mechanistic steps leading to Cas3 recruitment. In the early steps, PAM recognition causes severe DNA bending, leading to spontaneous DNA unwinding to form a seed-bubble. The full R-loop formation triggers conformational changes in Cascade, licensing Cas3 to bind. The same process also generates a bulge in the non-target DNA strand, enabling its handover to Cas3 for cleavage. The combination of both negative and positive checkpoints ensures stringent yet efficient target degradation in type I CRISPR-Cas systems."

How homeostasis is maintained and impacts tumor surveillance is unknown. Here, we find that different immune mononuclear phagocytes share a conserved steady-state program during differentiation and entry into healthy tissue. IFNγ is necessary and sufficient to induce this program, revealing a key instructive role. Remarkably, homeostatic and IFNγ-dependent programs enrich across primary human tumors, including melanoma, and stratify survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals enrichment of homeostatic modules in monocytes and DCs from human metastatic melanoma. Suppressor-of-cytokine-2 (SOCS2) protein, a conserved program transcript, is expressed by mononuclear phagocytes infiltrating primary melanoma and is induced by IFNγ. SOCS2 limits adaptive anti-tumoral immunity and DC-based priming of T cells in vivo, indicating a critical regulatory role. These findings link immune homeostasis to key determinants of anti-tumoral immunity and escape, revealing co-opting of tissue-specific immune development in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2727413563,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects Latinos at twice the rate seen in populations of European descent. We recently identified a risk haplotype spanning SLC16A11 that explains ∼20% of the increased T2D prevalence in Mexico. Here, through genetic fine-mapping, we define a set of tightly linked variants likely to contain the causal allele(s). We show that variants on the T2D-associated haplotype have two distinct effects: (1) decreasing SLC16A11 expression in liver and (2) disrupting a key interaction with basigin, thereby reducing cell-surface localization. Both independent mechanisms reduce SLC16A11 function and suggest SLC16A11 is the causal gene at this locus. To gain insight into how SLC16A11 disruption impacts T2D risk, we demonstrate that SLC16A11 is a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter and that genetic perturbation of SLC16A11 induces changes in fatty acid and lipid metabolism that are associated with increased T2D risk. Our findings suggest that increasing SLC16A11 function could be therapeutically beneficial for T2D. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

Using in vivo cellular resolution imaging in voluntarily head-restrained rats, we examined the responses of neurons in frontal and parietal cortices during a pulse-based accumulation of evidence task. Neurons exhibited activity that predicted the animal's upcoming choice, previous choice, and graded responses that reflected the strength of the accumulated evidence. The pulsatile nature of the stimuli enabled characterization of the responses of neurons to a single quantum (pulse) of evidence. Across the population, individual neurons displayed extensive heterogeneity in the dynamics of responses to pulses. The diversity of responses was sufficiently rich to form a temporal basis for accumulated evidence estimated from a latent variable model. These results suggest that heterogeneous, often transient sensory responses distributed across the fronto-parietal cortex may support working memory on behavioral timescales. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

Drug-resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a serious problem that threatens to worsen the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic (World Health Organization, 2014World Health OrganizationGlobal Tuberculosis Report 2014. WHO, 2014Google Scholar). Although current six-month therapy for drug-susceptible TB can achieve a cure rate of >90%, the treatment of drug-resistant strains is more protracted (≥2 years) and involves the use of costly and less effective second-line drugs that have significant side effects (Zumla et al., 2013Zumla A. Raviglione M. Hafner R. von Reyn C.F. Tuberculosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Isoniazid (INH) is a frontline TB drug that has been a mainstay of TB therapy since its introduction in 1952 (Bernstein et al., 1952Bernstein J. Lott W.A. Steinberg B.A. Yale H.L. Chemotherapy of experimental tuberculosis. V. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (nydrazid) and related compounds.Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1952; 65: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar). However, resistance occurs frequently with in vitro rates of about 1 in 10−5–10−6, which translates to high levels of clinical resistance ranging from 9.5% to 62%, based on geography and disease burden (Jenkins et al., 2011Jenkins H.E. Zignol M. Cohen T.

WHO, 2014Google Scholar). INH is a pro-drug that is activated by a catalase-peroxidase enzyme (KatG) to produce a radical that attacks nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to form a covalent adduct. This adduct inhibits the enoyl-ACP reductase, InhA (Rozwarski et al., 1998Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Modification of the NADH of the isoniazid target (InhA) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), an enzyme required for the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids that are used to form mycolic acids (Vilchèze et al., 2000Vilchèze C. Morbidoni H.R. Weisbrod T.R. Iwamoto H. Kuo M. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Inactivation of the inhA-encoded fatty acid synthase II (FASII) enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase induces accumulation of the FASI end products and cell lysis of Mycobacterium smegmatis.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4059-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Because INH is activated by the non-essential KatG, resistance to INH often arises through loss-of-function mutations in the katG gene (Heym et al., 1995Heym B. Alzari P.M. Honoré N. Cole S.T. Missense mutations in the catalase-peroxidase gene, katG, are associated with isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Mol.

The catalase-peroxidase gene and isoniazid resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Indeed, the most common cause of INH resistance is the loss-of-function mutation KatG-S315T, which has been found in as many as 94% of INH-resistant and up to 82% of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb clinical isolates (Torres et al., 2015Torres J.N.

Zadorozhny V. et al.Novel katG mutations causing isoniazid resistance in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates.Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2015; 4: e42Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the inhA gene and its promoter region, i.e., the c-15t base change, further complicate the treatment of drug-resistant TB, conferring resistance not only to INH but also to the second-line TB drug ethionamide (ETH) (Banerjee et al., 1994Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. inhA, a gene encoding a target for isoniazid and ethionamide in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), with reported frequencies of 35% and 55% in INH- and ETH-resistant clinical isolates, respectively (Vilcheze and Jacobs, 2014Vilcheze C.

Spectr. 2014; 2 (MGM2-0014-2013)Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After 65 years of use, the widespread and very high levels of INH resistance underscore the urgent clinical need for the development of alternative cell wall-active antibiotics for TB. Mycolic acids are critical for viability and virulence of Mtb. Though these long-chain (C60–90) α-branched-β-hydroxylated fatty acids are primarily found esterified to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan cell wall core, they are also present as trehalose monomycolate and dimycolate esters in the cell envelope (Barry et al., 1998Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Mycolic acids: structure, biosynthesis and physiological functions.Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In Mtb, mycolic acid biosynthesis occurs through the concerted action of more than 20 enzymes that are components of different multi-enzyme complexes (Takayama et al., 2005Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Pathway to synthesis and processing of mycolic acids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Therefore, this pathway represents an important reservoir of novel targets for the development of new TB drugs, especially in the context of the emergence of drug resistance. Polyketide synthases (PKS) are an important family of enzymes that have not been exploited as drug targets for any microbial pathogen. The Mtb H37Rv genome has about 24 PKS encoding genes (Cole et al., 1998Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry 3rd, C.E. et al.Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the complete genome sequence.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6506) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have now linked most of the mycobacterial PKSs to participating in complex lipid biosynthestic pathways in Mtb (Chopra and Gokhale, 2009Chopra T. Gokhale R.S. Polyketide versatility in the biosynthesis of complex mycobacterial cell wall lipids.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 459: 259-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Quadri, 2014Quadri L.E. Biosynthesis of mycobacterial lipids by polyketide synthases and beyond.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 179-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These PKS-derived lipid metabolites form essential components of the uniquely lipid-rich and complex cell wall of Mtb, which has been proposed as a means for it to survive under harsh conditions in host macrophages while also imparting an intrinsic resistance against many anti-microbial agents (Bhatt et al., 2007Bhatt A.

In Mtb, Pks13 performs the final assembly step of mycolic acid synthesis, i.e., the Claisen-type condensation of a C26 α-alkyl branch and C40–60 meromycolate precursors (Portevin et al., 2004Portevin D. De Sousa-D’Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C.

It is comprised of five domains, including two acyl carrier protein domains, a β-ketoacyl-synthase, an acyltransferase, and a C-terminal thioesterase (TE) domain, that together contain all of the activities required for the condensation of two long-chain fatty acids. This activity has been shown to be essential both in vitro and in vivo (Portevin et al., 2004Portevin D. De Sousa-D’Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffé M. Guilhot C.

Biol. 2013; 9: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We recently discovered a small molecule that was active against Mtb H37Rv (TAM1; Figure 1A) and identified that Pks13 was the target through whole-genome sequencing and recombineering of the resistance mutations (Ioerger et al., 2013Ioerger T.R.

In another study, a series of thiophenes were identified that kill Mtb by targeting the N-terminal ACPN domain of Pks13. Wilson et al., 2013Wilson R. Kumar P. Parashar V. Vilchèze C. Veyron-Churlet R. Freundlich J.S. Barnes S.W. Walker J.R. Szymonifka M.J. Marchiano E. et al.Antituberculosis thiophenes define a requirement for Pks13 in mycolic acid biosynthesis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, propose that the compounds function by blocking the interaction of ACPN with FadD32 protein, which transfers the meromycolyl chain. These results substantiate Pks13 as a druggable target for Mtb and highlight its potential for the development of new TB drugs that interfere with the critical pathway of mycolic acid synthesis. In this paper, we describe the structure-based development of a highly potent and very safe lead compound, TAM16 (Table 1), which targets Pks13. It is active against MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mtb clinical strains in vitro, demonstrating a lack of cross-resistance with existing TB therapeutics. By inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis, it synergizes with other TB drugs, like rifampicin (RIF), likely by augmenting their penetration into Mtb. Importantly, in murine TB infection models, it demonstrates efficacy equal to INH. Furthermore, unlike INH, which shows a relative high frequency of resistance, TAM16 shows 100-fold lower frequency of resistance. These properties, combined with the excellent pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity profiles, will likely allow us to convert this lead into a first-line drug.Table 1Preliminary SAR of TAM1 and Its AnalogsCompoundP1P2P3P4IC50 (μM)∗Values are shown as mean ± SD of three independent measurements.MIC (μM)TAM1OH0.26 ± 0.032.3TAM2OH0.12 ± 0.024.4TAM3OH0.24 ± 0.024.1TAM4OH0.28 ± 0.034.6TAM5OH0.71 ± 0.0513.3TAM6OH1.57 ± 0.157.3TAM7NoneOH20 ± 1.920TAM8OH11.9 ± 2.3>40TAM9OH0.26 ± 0.040.4TAM10OH6.6 ± 0.7NITAM11OH19.6 ± 1.45.2TAM12OH0.29 ± 0.010.2TAM13OH0.17 ± 0.021.2TAM14MeO35.8 ± 2.2NDTAM15H2.0 ± 0.116TAM16OH0.19 ± 0.010.09TAM17OH0.36 ± 0.044TAM18OH0.33 ± 0.030.5TAM19H, C6-OH0.57 ± 0.031TAM20H, C6-OH0.45 ± 0.041.1TAM21OH0.42 ± 0.0410TAM22OH>10>10TAM23OH0.38 ± 0.012.5TAM24OH2.1 ± 0.30.5IC50 values were determined using the Mtb Pks13-TE domain as described in the methods section.

MeO, methoxy; NI, no inhibition; ND, not determined. Two laboratory-derived mutant strains resistant to TAM1 were found to harbor non-synonymous mutations, i.e., either D1607N or D1644G, both located in the TE domain of Pks13. To characterize the precise mechanism of action of TAM1 on the TE activity, a recombinant-expression plasmid was constructed to produce the domain for biochemical analysis. The pure recombinant protein, consisting of the TE domain of the Pks13 (Pks13-TE), was enzymatically active and produced diffraction-quality crystals complexed to TAM1. An enzyme assay was developed for the TE activity of Pks13 using the fluorescent fatty acid ester, 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate (4-MUH) (Richardson and Smith, 2007Richardson R.D. Smith J.W. Novel antagonists of the thioesterase domain of human fatty acid synthase.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 2120-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Pks13-TE was able to cleave the ester of 4-MUH, and kinetic analysis indicated a Michaelis constant (Km) ∼20 μM and kcat/Km ∼ 7.2 × 102 M−1 min−1 (Table S1). TAM1 inhibited the Pks13-TE activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.26 μM (Figure 1A; Table S1). As a first step to structure-guided medicinal chemistry on the benzofuran inhibitor, we solved the crystal structure of Pks13-TE complexed with TAM1 and refined it to high resolution (2.0 Å; Table S2). The crystals contained two monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (designated A and B). The overall structure of Pks13-TE consists of a core domain and a lid domain (Figure 1B). The larger core possesses a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold comprised of a central seven-stranded β sheet (β1–β7) flanked by four α helices (α1–α3 and α11) with the N-terminal β1 strand anti-parallel to other β strands (Nardini and Dijkstra, 1999Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Alpha/beta hydrolase fold enzymes: the family keeps growing.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The lid domain (residues 1575–1645) is inserted between strands β5 and β6 and consists of four α helices, α4–α7, along with two short helices, α8 and α9, (residues 1665–1675) present between the strands β6 and β7 of the core domain. Based on the analysis with VAST server (Gibrat et al., 1996Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Surprising similarities in structure comparison.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), the Pks13-TE lid domain appears to be relatively unique among TE structures reported to date. The Pks13-TE active-site pocket is formed at the interface between the lid and core domains. The catalytic triad was identified to be Ser1533, Asp1560, and His1699, and the oxyanion hole is formed by the amide N-atoms of Leu1534 and Ala1477. Extending from the active site is a deep (∼30 Å) hydrophobic groove that spans the full length of the lid domain, with a total surface area of ∼1290 Å2 (Figure S1A). A similarly located surface groove (∼20 Å) in the α-helical lid domain of bovine palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1, 15% identity with Pks13-TE), contained the substrate palmitic acid (Bellizzi et al., 2000Bellizzi 3rd, J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. The crystal structure of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and the molecular basis of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We observed unexpected electron density in this pocket of apo-Pks13-TE structure that could be built as an eight-carbon fragment of polypropylene glycol (PPG, C8O5), an additive in the crystallization buffer. The fragment is located in the fatty acyl chain-binding site based on the superimposition of Pks13-TE structure with the bovine PPT1 and human FAS TE (hFAS-TE) structures (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang W. Chakravarty B. Zheng F. Gu Z. Wu H. Mao J. Wakil S.J. Quiocho F.A. Crystal structure of FAS thioesterase domain with polyunsaturated fatty acyl adduct and inhibition by dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 15757-15762Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, unlike the Pks13-TE acyl chain-binding site, the bovine PPT1 and hFAS-TE is not surface exposed. The PPG binding pocket is connected at the catalytic site to a series of tunnel-like regions that could also bind an acyl chain (Figure S1B). The more elaborate system of binding grooves and tunnels is likely related to the very long carbon chains (C80–90) that make up the mycolic acid precursor, compared to PPT1 and hFAS (Figure S1C). TAM1 binds in the fatty acyl chain-binding groove at the entrance of the Pks13-TE active site, effectively blocking access of the substrate to the catalytic center of the enzyme (Figures 1B–1D). Several differences were seen between the apo- and TAM1-bound structures of Pks13-TE, the most significant being in the side chain of Phe1670. Phe1670 is located at the end of helix α8 directly adjacent to the acyl binding pocket. The phenyl ring of Phe1670 flips by about 80° in the TAM1 structure, compared to the apo protein, to form a slightly off-plane van der Waals stacking interaction with the furan ring (Figure S2A). The four different substituents attached to the benzofuran scaffold (P1, P2, P3, and P4; Figure 1A) were found to interact with residues that line the substrate-binding cleft. Indeed, most of the binding interactions occur between amino acids from helix α7 of the lid domain and the two supporting helices α8–α9 along with the loop that connects them to strand β6 of the core domain (Figures 1B and 1D). Overall, the structure showed that the phenyl group of TAM1 (P1) is solvent exposed; P2 ethyl ester is partially solvent exposed, while P3 piperidine and P4 OH are completely buried in Pks13-TE. The Pks13-TE structure shows that the D1644G mutation confers resistance through the loss of a direct H bond between a carboxylate oxygen and the P4 OH of TAM1. The crystal structure of the D1607N mutant (Figure S2B; Table S2) explained its more subtle effect on binding, through the loss of ion pair interaction between the carboxylate of Asp1607 on helix α6 and the guanidinium of Arg1641 (3 Å) located on the parallel helix, α7. Without this interaction, α7 shifts away from the substrate-binding groove by about 3 Å, moving Asp1644 out of hydrogen-bonding distance from the P4 OH of TAM1. TAM1 was modified using structure-guided approaches to improve the potency and pharmacological properties (Table 1; Figure 2; STAR Methods; Table S3). Briefly, the two major pharmacological liabilities of TAM1were the phenyl at P1, which was hydroxylated in mouse liver microsomes (MLMs) to yield primarily the 4-OH (Figure S3A), and the P2 ester, which was cleaved to the inactive acid in mouse serum. The structure of the Pks13-TE-TAM1 complex indicated that the side chain amide of Gln1633 was positioned in close proximity (∼4 Å) to the para-position of the P1 phenyl ring, suggesting that 4-OH form of the inhibitor would retain enzyme inhibitory activity. Indeed, the P1 4-OH-containing analog, TAM16, had greatly improved metabolic stability (Figure S3), showed significant improvement in enzyme potency, and exhibited >20-fold improvement in Mtb potency compared with TAM1 (Table 1). The structure also indicated that the bioisosteric replacement of the ester with a methyl amide that would be stable in serum would be tolerated in the binding pocket. Indeed, the methyl amide of TAM12 was stable and showed similar enzyme-inhibitory activity (IC50 0.3 μM) as the ethyl ester analog TAM9; however, it exhibited 2-fold better whole-cell activity (Table 1). Among P3 groups, the piperidine was the most potent of the P3 substituents synthesized. Structures of P3 substituted analogs showed that five-, six-, and seven-membered rings at P3 led to variations in the van der Waals and stacking interactions with the planar side chain of Tyr1674, and these interactions were abolished in TAM6 with acyclic dimethyl amine at P3. Thus, among the P3 analogs, the piperidine group was optimally located sandwiched between Tyr1663 and Tyr1674, and its protonated N appears to be a bifurcated hydrogen donor, forming an intra-molecular hydrogen bond with the P2 carbonyl oxygen (2.9 Å) and another with the side chain oxygen of Asn1640 (2.9 Å). We also explored alterations to the P4 OH group. All P4 analogs at C-5 showed a dramatic loss in enzyme potency presumably due to loss of hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Asp1644. The resulting molecule, TAM16, was the most potent and stable inhibitor (IC50 0.19 μM, minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 0.09 μM) (Figures 2 and S3B).Figure S3Metabolic Stability of TAM1 Analogs, Related to Table 3Show full caption(A) Metabolic stability studies of TAM12 in mouse liver microsomes showed that TAM12 was hydroxylated at P1 phenyl.

Resistant mutants emerged at frequencies of 7 × 10−7 and ∼8 × 10−8 at 10× and 20× MIC, which were ∼100-fold lower than the frequency observed for INH (1 × 10−6). Sequencing of two resistant mutants revealed point mutations in pks13 that resulted in a single non-synonymous amino acid substitution in Pks13 (D1644G or D1644Y), and they retained sensitivity to INH and RIF (MICs 0.2 and 0.04 μM, respectively). We determined MIC values of TAM16 against 38 clinical Mtb strains representing a wide range of mutations covering all known molecular mechanisms involved in imparting resistance against first- and second-line TB drugs that form the core component of TB treatment regimen (Tables S4 and S5). TAM16 was highly active against pan-susceptible clinical isolates of Mtb (MICs 0.06–0.250 μM). Most importantly, TAM16 was potent against all MDR and XDR clinical isolates of Mtb evaluated (MIC range of 0.05–0.42 μM; Table 2). The lack of cross-resistance of TAM16 with current TB drugs shows the importance of developing new drugs with distinct modes of action.Table 2TAM16 MIC Values for Mtb Strains with Different Drug-Susceptibility Profiles, Related to Tables S4 and S5Strain and resistance statusaDetailed description of the strains with their drug-resistance phenotypes is given in Tables S4 and S5.Number of strainsMIC90bThe lowest concentration of drug that inhibited growth of more than 90% of the bacterial population was considered to be the MIC90.

https://openalex.org/W2728824044,"Motor learning is accompanied by widespread changes within the motor cortex, but it is unknown whether these changes are ultimately funneled through a stable corticospinal output channel or whether the corticospinal output itself is plastic. We investigated the consistency of the relationship between corticospinal neuron activity and movement through in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in mice learning a lever-press task. Corticospinal neurons exhibited heterogeneous correlations with movement, with the majority of movement-modulated neurons decreasing activity during movement. Individual cells changed their activity across days, which led to changed associations between corticospinal activity and movement. Unlike previous observations in layer 2/3, activity accompanying learned movements did not become more consistent with learning; instead, the activity of dissimilar movements became more decorrelated. These results indicate that the relationship between corticospinal activity and movement is dynamic and that the types of activity and plasticity are different from and possibly complementary to those in layer 2/3."
https://openalex.org/W2663084651,"Using in vivo calcium imaging in a mouse model of neuropathic pain, the authors found a persistent increase in the activity of somatosensory cortex pyramidal neurons following peripheral nerve injury. Repeated pharmacogenetic activation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons after injury not only corrected this abnormal cortical activity but also prevented the development of chronic pain. Neuropathic pain involves long-lasting modifications of pain pathways that result in abnormal cortical activity. How cortical circuits are altered and contribute to the intense sensation associated with allodynia is unclear. Here we report a persistent elevation of layer V pyramidal neuron activity in the somatosensory cortex of a mouse model of neuropathic pain. This enhanced pyramidal neuron activity was caused in part by increases of synaptic activity and NMDA-receptor-dependent calcium spikes in apical tuft dendrites. Furthermore, local inhibitory interneuron networks shifted their activity in favor of pyramidal neuron hyperactivity: somatostatin-expressing and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons reduced their activity, whereas vasoactive intestinal polypeptide–expressing interneurons increased their activity. Pharmacogenetic activation of somatostatin-expressing cells reduced pyramidal neuron hyperactivity and reversed mechanical allodynia. These findings reveal cortical circuit changes that arise during the development of neuropathic pain and identify the activation of specific cortical interneurons as therapeutic targets for chronic pain treatment."

Although it has been shown that cells can traffic metabolic enzymes via EVs, much remains to be elucidated with regard to their intrinsic metabolic activity. Accordingly, herein we assessed the ability of neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC)-derived EVs to consume and produce metabolites. Our metabolomics and functional analyses both revealed that EVs harbor L-asparaginase activity, catalyzed by the enzyme asparaginase-like protein 1 (Asrgl1). Critically, we show that Asrgl1 activity is selective for asparagine and is devoid of glutaminase activity. We found that mouse and human NSC EVs traffic Asrgl1. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that NSC EVs function as independent metabolic units that are able to modify the concentrations of critical nutrients, with the potential to affect the physiology of their microenvironment."

To provide adaptive immunity, cells assemble a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided nucleoprotein complex that recognizes specific foreign DNA targets. After target DNA recognition, a CRISPR-specific nuclease degrades the foreign nucleic acids. CRISPR systems also confer immunity against future infections by acquiring foreign DNA sequences as new spacers into the CRISPR locus (Amitai and Sorek, 2016Amitai G. Sorek R. CRISPR-Cas adaptation: insights into the mechanism of action.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The ability to program and multiplex DNA/RNA targeting with diverse CRISPR-Cas systems has enabled leveraging of this microbial immune strategy for use in diverse biotechnological and medical applications (Hsu et al., 2014Hsu P.D.

Intense interest in emerging CRISPR-Cas systems has driven the development of high-throughput methods for characterizing crRNA-guided binding and cleavage activities. Deep sequencing is frequently used to identify off-target binding (e.g., chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) and cleavage (e.g., Digenome-Seq, BLESS) (Kim et al., 2015Kim D. Bae S.

Alternative strategies include in vivo fluorescent reporters for CRISPR-Cas protein binding or for the repair of resulting DNA double strand breaks (Kim et al., 2015Kim D. Bae S. Park J. Kim E. Kim S. Yu H.R. Hwang J. Kim J.-I. Kim J.-S. Digenome-seq: genome-wide profiling of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects in human cells.Nat.

Biol. 2014; 2: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These methods frequently detect off-target binding and cleavage activities but have several limitations as well (reviewed for Cas9 in Bolukbasi et al., 2016Bolukbasi M.F. Gupta A. Wolfe S.A. Creating and evaluating accurate CRISPR-Cas9 scalpels for genomic surgery.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, both GFP production and DNA break repair efficiency may vary with cell-cycle stage and genomic context. Similarly, pull-down methods can be influenced by antibody quality, the degree of chemical crosslinking, and the chromatin state of a given target. Most of these strategies are also limited to identifying genomic off-target DNA cleavage sites thereby making it difficult to place the results in a quantitative biophysical framework. These methods aim to identify off-target sites in vivo but are not optimal for probing the molecular mechanisms underlying CRISPR-Cas activities. Here, we describe a chip-hybridized association-mapping platform (CHAMP) for comprehensively profiling protein-nucleic acid interactions on sequenced next generation sequencing (NGS) chips. The most widely adopted NGS sequencers fluorescently image clusters of DNA molecules covalently affixed to the surface of a microfluidic chip. CHAMP leverages these chips—that would normally be discarded after sequencing—to quantitatively measure protein-DNA interactions. Importantly, CHAMP does not require any hardware or software modifications to older NGS sequencers, as has been reported previously (Buenrostro et al., 2014Buenrostro J.D. Araya C.L. Chircus L.M. Layton C.J. Chang H.Y. Snyder M.P. Greenleaf W.J. Quantitative analysis of RNA-protein interactions on a massively parallel array reveals biophysical and evolutionary landscapes.Nat.

Instead, it uses modern and ubiquitous Illumina instruments to generate chips and sequencing data. Protein-DNA profiling experiments are then performed independently on a standard fluorescence microscope. In short, NGS sequencing provides information about the position and identities of millions of different DNA molecules, while the microscopy experiments quantitatively measure binding interactions of the proteins to a library of DNA molecules. We used CHAMP to quantitatively profile interactions between the T. fusca type I-E CRISPR-Cas (Cascade) effector complex and a diverse library of genomic and synthetic target DNA molecules. Type I systems comprise ∼50% of bacterial CRISPRs and have been used to control gene expression and cell fate (Luo et al., 2015Luo M.L. Mullis A.S. Leenay R.T. Beisel C.L.

Targeted DNA degradation using a CRISPR device stably carried in the host genome.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CHAMP profiling revealed that Cascade recognizes an extended, 6-nt protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Quantitative profiling of off-target DNA-binding sequences reveals a 3-nt periodicity in Cascade-DNA interactions, observed in synthesized libraries and human genomic DNA. Cas3 recruitment was sensitive to the identity of the PAM and PAM-proximal DNA-RNA mismatches, establishing a novel DNA-guided proofreading mechanism. These results were used to develop a predictive biophysical framework that accurately reproduced in vivo interference experiments. Using CHAMP, we also profile CRISPR-Cas binding in human genomic DNA, paving the way for rapid and quantitative determination of off-target binding sites in patient-specific genomes. More broadly, this study provides an experimental and computational framework for comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions for diverse CRISPR systems and other DNA-binding proteins on both synthetic and genomic DNA libraries. CHAMP leverages used MiSeq chips that are generated via the Illumina sequencing pipeline (Figure 1). At the end of a DNA sequencing run, the surfaces of these chips are decorated with ∼20 million spatially registered, unique DNA clusters. CHAMP uses high-throughput fluorescence imaging to measure the association between fluorescently labeled protein complexes and each DNA cluster (Figure 1A). The MiSeq sequencer is ubiquitous in nearly all NGS cores and genomics labs, produces long (∼300 bp) reads, and the MiSeq chips also contain integrated microfluidic ports. To prepare chips for CHAMP, the DNA clusters are first regenerated to remove any fluorescent nucleotides that can otherwise confound imaging (Figure S1). A fluorescent oligonucleotide primer is then hybridized to a subset of the DNA clusters and used as an alignment marker in the downstream image-processing pipeline (Figure 1A). Next, fluorescently labeled proteins are incubated in the chip and imaged using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. The images are then analyzed using the CHAMP software pipeline, which maps each fluorescent cluster to the underlying DNA sequence, as reported by the Illumina sequencer (Figure S2; STAR Methods). CHAMP’s strength lies in its platform independence and its software pipeline, which quantifies protein association with each DNA sequence (Figure 1; STAR Methods).Figure S1Overview of the CHAMP Experimental Platform, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) MiSeq chips are imaged via prism-based total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy on a custom-built microscope stage.

Using CHAMP, we profiled the PAM specificity and off-target binding affinity of the thermophilic T. fusca type I-E CRISPR-Cas (Cascade) complex (Figure 1B). Experiments were carried out on regenerated MiSeq chips that contained a synthetic oligonucleotide library encoding substitutions within the PAM and the target DNA sequence. DNA binding was imaged at 11 Cascade concentrations ranging from 63 pM to 630 nM (see the STAR Methods). At each concentration, the thermophilic Cascade complex was first incubated in the chip at 60°C to promote DNA binding. Next, unbound complexes were flushed out of the chip, and DNA-bound Cascade was rapidly cooled to room temperature and labeled in situ with fluorescent anti-FLAG antibodies (Figures 1A and S1). The T. fusca Cascade complex included a triple FLAG epitope on the C terminus of the Cas6 subunit. The epitope tag did not alter DNA binding by the T. fusca Cascade, as reported previously for the E. coli complex (Szczelkun et al., 2014Szczelkun M.D. Tikhomirova M.S. Sinkunas T. Gasiunas G. Karvelis T. Pschera P. Siksnys V. Seidel R. Direct observation of R-loop formation by single RNA-guided Cas9 and Cascade effector complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We did not observe significant Cascade loss or photobleaching during image collection (∼15 min per protein concentration) (Figure S2F). Apparent Kd values were determined by fitting the fluorescence intensities of each DNA cluster at the 11 Cascade concentrations to the Hill equation (Figure 1D; STAR Methods). Non-specific DNA binding was observed via a random DNA sequence that was also included in the chip. This negative control sequence had an apparent Kd that was lower than our highest measured concentration (Figure 1D, dashed curve). We used these fits to define apparent binding affinity (ABA), the difference in apparent ΔG between the negative control sequence and a sequence of interest. Positive values indicate stronger binding, and negative values were discarded as non-specific DNA binding. DNA sequences with at least five unique fluorescent clusters were included in the analysis. This cutoff established an average error of ∼0.2 kBT for the apparent binding affinity, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature (Figure S4B). We sequenced ∼16 million target DNA sequences, giving complete coverage of all possible 6-nt PAM variants, as well as all single- and double-nucleotide substitutions along the entire target DNA (Figures 1E and 1F). Paired-end reads of linearly amplified synthetic oligonucleotide libraries were used to minimize biases and errors from library construction, synthesis, and sequencing. To avoid chip-specific biases, we performed experiments on two independent MiSeq chips, which recapitulated the measured ABAs (r = 0.88) (Figure 1G). This CHAMP dataset resulted in ∼36,000 unique DNA sequences with ABAs that were above the non-specific DNA binding threshold (Figure 1H). With this dataset, we next set out to define the principles guiding Cascade-DNA interactions. In all CRISPR-Cas systems, the protospacer adjacent moti (PAM) flanks target DNA that is complementary to the crRNA. The PAM is crucial for facilitating interrogation of the target DNA by the Cascade complex. Diverse PAMs can also bias CRISPR-Cas systems toward DNA degradation (interference) or spacer acquisition (adaptive immunity) (Heler et al., 2015Heler R. Samai P. Modell J.W. Weiner C. Goldberg G.W.

Early studies proposed that Cascade recognizes a 3-nt PAM (Marraffini, 2015Marraffini L.A.

USA. 2011; 108: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However, recent structural and sequencing studies of the E. coli Cascade complex suggested that Cse1 is sensitive to an extended PAM (Hayes et al., 2016Hayes R.P. Xiao Y. Ding F. van Erp P.B.G. Rajashankar K. Bailey S. Wiedenheft B. Ke A.

Cell. 2016; 62: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, we used CHAMP to determine the apparent binding affinity of Cascade toward 6-nt PAMs when the target DNA is fully complementary to the corresponding crRNA (Figure 2A). CHAMP profiling of all 4,096 unique 6-nt PAMs resulted in 950 sequences that had a non-zero ABA. In order visualize the complete set of all PAM preferences, we adapted sequence specificity landscapes (called PAM landscapes here, Figure 2B) (Carlson et al., 2010Carlson C.D. Warren C.L. Hauschild K.E. Ozers M.S. Qadir N. Bhimsaria D. Lee Y. Cerrina F. Ansari A.Z. Specificity landscapes of DNA binding molecules elucidate biological function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4544-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PAM landscape displays all PAM-dependent ABAs as a series of concentric rings (Figure 2B, top). The highest-affinity sequence for the first three PAM positions (A−3A−2G−1) is included in the center of the concentric rings. This innermost dataset displays the ABAs for all 6-nt PAM sequences that contain a perfect match to the highest affinity 3-nt “minimal” PAM (N−6N−5N−4A−3A−2G−1 for T. fusca Cascade: 64 unique sequences). The height and color of each bar on the individual rings corresponds to the ABA. A gray line above each peak represents the SD of each measurement, as determined by bootstrap analysis. The vertical bars are sorted from the highest to lowest affinity sequences for each minimal PAM. When paired with AAG, variation in the −6 to −4 position contributes minimally to the ABA. The next ring in the landscape shows ABAs for 6-nt PAMs that vary from A-3A-2G-1 by a single nucleotide in the first three positions (e.g., N−6N−5N−4C−3A−2G−1). The final ring shows PAMs that vary from A−3A−2G−1 by 2 nt (e.g., N−6N−5N−4C−3C−2G−1). We did not detect any measurable binding affinity to PAMs with three substitutions relative to A−3A−2G−1, and these PAMs are thus not displayed in Figure 2B. This representation gives a high-level overview of the entire PAM sequence space, reducing the high-dimensionality of CHAMP datasets for rapidly comparing the binding affinity to various PAMs. We determined the relative importance of each base in the extended PAM b"

New antibiotics with novel targets are greatly needed. Bacteria have numerous essential functions, but only a small fraction of such processes—primarily those involved in macromolecular synthesis—are inhibited by current drugs. Targeting metabolic enzymes has been the focus of recent interest, but effective inhibitors have been difficult to identify. We describe a synthetic azetidine derivative, BRD4592, that kills Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) through allosteric inhibition of tryptophan synthase (TrpAB), a previously untargeted, highly allosterically regulated enzyme. BRD4592 binds at the TrpAB α–β-subunit interface and affects multiple steps in the enzyme's overall reaction, resulting in inhibition not easily overcome by changes in metabolic environment. We show that TrpAB is required for the survival of Mtb and Mycobacterium marinum in vivo and that this requirement may be independent of an adaptive immune response. This work highlights the effectiveness of allosteric inhibition for targeting proteins that are naturally highly dynamic and that are essential in vivo, despite their apparent dispensability under in vitro conditions, and suggests a framework for the discovery of a next generation of allosteric inhibitors."

Here we report comprehensive profiling of 121 cases of pediatric T-ALL using transcriptome and/or targeted capture sequencing, through which we identified new recurrent gene fusions involving SPI1 (STMN1-SPI1 and TCF7-SPI1). Cases positive for fusions involving SPI1 (encoding PU.1), accounting for 3.9% (7/181) of the examined pediatric T-ALL cases, showed a double-negative (DN; CD4-CD8-) or CD8+ single-positive (SP) phenotype and had uniformly poor overall survival. These cases represent a subset of pediatric T-ALL distinguishable from the known T-ALL subsets in terms of expression of genes involved in T cell precommitment, establishment of T cell identity, and post-β-selection maturation and with respect to mutational profile. PU.1 fusion proteins retained transcriptional activity and, when constitutively expressed in mouse stem/progenitor cells, induced cell proliferation and resulted in a maturation block. Our findings highlight a unique role of SPI1 fusions in high-risk pediatric T-ALL."

In C. elegans, post-synaptic Neurexin (NRX-1) and pre-synaptic Neuroligin (NLG-1) mediate a retrograde synaptic signal that inhibits acetylcholine (ACh) release at neuromuscular junctions. Here, we show that the retrograde signal decreases ACh release by inhibiting the function of pre-synaptic UNC-2/CaV2 calcium channels. Post-synaptic NRX-1 binds to an auxiliary subunit of pre-synaptic UNC-2/CaV2 channels (UNC-36/α2δ), decreasing UNC-36 abundance at pre-synaptic elements. Retrograde inhibition is mediated by a soluble form of NRX-1’s ectodomain, which is released from the post-synaptic membrane by the SUP-17/ADAM10 protease. Mammalian Neurexin-1α binds α2δ-3 and decreases CaV2.2 current in transfected cells, whereas Neurexin-1α has no effect on CaV2.2 reconstituted with α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Collectively, these results suggest that α-Neurexin binding to α2δ is a conserved mechanism for regulating synaptic transmission. The synaptic adhesion molecules Neurexin and Neuroligin alter the development and function of synapses and are linked to autism in humans. In C. elegans, post-synaptic Neurexin (NRX-1) and pre-synaptic Neuroligin (NLG-1) mediate a retrograde synaptic signal that inhibits acetylcholine (ACh) release at neuromuscular junctions. Here, we show that the retrograde signal decreases ACh release by inhibiting the function of pre-synaptic UNC-2/CaV2 calcium channels. Post-synaptic NRX-1 binds to an auxiliary subunit of pre-synaptic UNC-2/CaV2 channels (UNC-36/α2δ), decreasing UNC-36 abundance at pre-synaptic elements. Retrograde inhibition is mediated by a soluble form of NRX-1’s ectodomain, which is released from the post-synaptic membrane by the SUP-17/ADAM10 protease. Mammalian Neurexin-1α binds α2δ-3 and decreases CaV2.2 current in transfected cells, whereas Neurexin-1α has no effect on CaV2.2 reconstituted with α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Collectively, these results suggest that α-Neurexin binding to α2δ is a conserved mechanism for regulating synaptic transmission. Synaptic transmission is mediated by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs), which are filled with neurotransmitter. SV fusion is triggered by a local calcium transient, produced by activation of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs). Secreted neurotransmitter activates receptors embedded in the post-synaptic membrane, thereby depolarizing or hyperpolarizing post-synaptic cells. Synaptic signals occur with extremely high spatial and temporal precision. Fusion of SVs in pre-synaptic terminals is restricted to a spatial domain extending ∼300 nm from activated CaVs (Watanabe et al., 2013Watanabe S. Liu Q. Davis M.W. Hollopeter G. Thomas N. Jorgensen N.B. Jorgensen E.M. Ultrafast endocytosis at Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions.eLife. 2013; 2: e00723Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similarly, post-synaptic receptor activation is limited to a domain extending ∼100 nm from the site of SV fusion (Raghavachari and Lisman, 2004Raghavachari S. Lisman J.E. Properties of quantal transmission at CA1 synapses.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Given these tiny spatial domains, postsynaptic currents are activated ∼150 μs after the pre-synaptic action potential (Sabatini and Regehr, 1996Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Timing of neurotransmission at fast synapses in the mammalian brain.Nature. 1996; 384: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The extreme spatial and temporal precision of synaptic transmission is likely a consequence of tight physical coupling of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Physical coupling of the pre- and postsynaptic cells is mediated by transsynaptic adhesion molecules. Over the past several years, several families of synaptic adhesion molecules have been identified. Among these, Neurexin (NX) and Neuroligin (NL) proteins play a prominent role. Mammals have three NX genes, each encoding long (α) and short (β) isoforms, and four NL genes. Mammalian NX proteins are typically pre-synaptic, while NL proteins are post-synaptic. When expressed in non-neuronal cells, NX induces formation of post-synaptic elements in contacting neurons, whereas NL induces pre-synaptic elements (Graf et al., 2004Graf E.R. Zhang X. Jin S.X.

Neuroligin expressed in nonneuronal cells triggers pre-synaptic development in contacting axons.Cell. 2000; 101: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). NX and NL’s synaptogenic activities are thought to be mediated by induced clustering of pre- and post-synaptic proteins caused by trans-synaptic contact (Dean et al., 2003Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Neurexin mediates the assembly of pre-synaptic terminals.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Because they form a physical link across the synapse, NX and NL have the capacity to mediate bi-directional signaling between pre- and post-synaptic cells. Consistent with this idea, pre-synaptic NX has been shown to promote clustering of post-synaptic GABAA, AMPA, and NMDA receptors (Aoto et al., 2013Aoto J. Martinelli D.C. Malenka R.C. Tabuchi K.

By controlling post-synaptic receptor abundance, pre-synaptic NX plays an important role in regulating the strength of synaptic signals (i.e., by directly altering the size of quantal responses). Other studies suggest that post-synaptic NL alters pre-synaptic properties. Overexpression of NL or PSD95 (which binds NL) increases formation of trans-synaptic NX-NL complexes and increases release probability in rat hippocampal neurons (Futai et al., 2007Futai K. Kim M.J.

Post-synaptic NL3 decreases excitatory input to Parvalbumin expressing interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Polepalli et al., 2017Polepalli J.S. Wu H. Goswami D. Halpern C.H.

Neurosci. 2017; 20: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These studies support the idea that NX-NL signaling regulates pre-synaptic function; however, little is known about the biochemical basis for these pre-synaptic effects. To address this question, we have studied a C. elegans retrograde signal whereby muscles inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) release from motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) (Simon et al., 2008Simon D.J. Madison J.M. Conery A.L. Thompson-Peer K.L. Soskis M. Ruvkun G.B. Kaplan J.M. Kim J.K. The microRNA miR-1 regulates a MEF-2-dependent retrograde signal at neuromuscular junctions.Cell. 2008; 133: 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This retrograde signal is induced by inactivation of a muscle microRNA (miR-1) and is abolished by mutations inactivating the transcription factor MEF-2 (a miR-1 target), or those inactivating NRX-1/α-NX and NLG-1/NL (Hu et al., 2012Hu Z. Hom S. Kudze T. Tong X.J. Choi S. Aramuni G. Zhang W. Kaplan J.M.

At this synapse, NL is pre-synaptic and NX is post-synaptic, opposite to the polarity observed at mammalian synapses. Other examples of reversed polarity include pre-synaptic NLG-1 in worms (Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

This flipped polarity is not observed at all C. elegans synapses. For example, at GABAergic NMJs, NRX-1 and NLG-1 are pre- and post-synaptic, respectively (Maro et al., 2015Maro G.S. Gao S.

Here, we show that post-synaptic NRX-1 inhibits ACh release by directly binding to and inhibiting the function of α2δ subunits associated with pre-synaptic N-type (CaV2) calcium channels. Because the retrograde signal inhibits ACh release, we hypothesized that trans-synaptic NX-NL complexes regulate pre-synaptic voltage-activated calcium (CaV) channels. To test this idea, we first asked which CaVs are responsible for ACh release at NMJs. The C. elegans genome encodes one N-type (UNC-2/CaV2) and one L-type (EGL-19/CaV1) calcium channel. How these CaVs contribute to synaptic transmission has not been fully characterized (Figure 1A). To block release coupled to UNC-2/CaV2, we analyzed excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) in unc-2-null mutants. Because egl-19-null mutants are inviable, we utilized an antagonist (Nemadipine) to block EGL-19/CaV1-mediated release (Kwok et al., 2006Kwok T.C. Ricker N. Fraser R. Chan A.W. Burns A. Stanley E.F. McCourt P. Cutler S.R. Roy P.J. A small-molecule screen in C. elegans yields a new calcium channel antagonist.Nature. 2006; 441: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Nemadipine treatment (10 μM) completely blocked voltage-activated EGL-19/CaV1 calcium current in body muscles (Figures S1A and S1B), confirming that Nemadipine is an effective EGL-19 antagonist (Lainé et al., 2011Lainé V. Frøkjær-Jensen C. Couchoux H. Jospin M. The alpha1 subunit EGL-19, the alpha2/delta subunit UNC-36, and the beta subunit CCB-1 underlie voltage-dependent calcium currents in Caenorhabditis elegans striated muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36180-36187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using these tools, we asked whether UNC-2 and EGL-19 are required for ACh release at NMJs. Transmission at this synapse is mediated by graded ACh release, whereby release varies with the strength of depolarization (Liu et al., 2009Liu Q. Hollopeter G. Jorgensen E.M. Graded synaptic transmission at the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 10823-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When activity is low, transmission consists of spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) that result from single SV fusions (Liu et al., 2005Liu Q. Chen B. Yankova M. Morest D.K. Maryon E. Hand A.R. Nonet M.L. Wang Z.W. Pre-synaptic ryanodine receptors are required for normal quantal size at the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), hereafter designated tonic release. Direct depolarization of motor neurons evokes the synchronous release of several hundred SVs. Which CaV is required for evoked ACh release? Evoked EPSCs were nearly completely eliminated in unc-2-null mutants, whereas the amplitude of evoked responses was unaffected by Nemadipine treatment (Figures 1B and 1C). Thus, the vast majority of SV fusions during evoked responses are coupled to UNC-2/CaV2. Next, we asked which CaV mediates tonic ACh release. The mEPSC rate was significantly reduced in unc-2 mutants (57% wild-type [WT]) and by Nemadipine treatment (60% untreated controls) (Figures 1B and 1D). mEPSCs were nearly completely eliminated in Nemadipine-treated unc-2 mutants (Figures 1B and 1D). mEPSC amplitudes were unaltered in unc-2 mutants and in Nemadapine-treated animals (Figure 1E), suggesting that muscle sensitivity to ACh had not been altered. To confirm EGL-19’s role in promoting tonic release, we constructed transgenic animals in which an egl-19-null mutation is complemented by a transgene that restores EGL-19 expression only in body muscles [designated EGL-19(N–M+)]. Compared to WT controls, the mEPSC rate was significantly reduced in EGL-19(N–M+) animals and was not further reduced by Nemadapine treatment (Figures S1C and S1D). These results confirm that EGL-19/CaV1 functions in neurons to promote ACh release and that Nemadapine’s effects on mEPSC rate are mediated by inhibiting EGL-19 function in neurons. Thus, tonic ACh release comprises a mixture of SV fusions coupled to both UNC-2/CaV2 and EGL-19/CaV1. CaVs are heteromeric complexes containing pore forming (α1) and auxiliary (β and α2δ) subunits. Mammals have four predicted α2δ encoding genes (CACNA2D1–4). α2δ subunits play redundant roles promoting CaV1 and 2 trafficking to (and retention in) the plasma membrane (Bernstein and Jones, 2007Bernstein G.M.

Physiol. 1999; 519: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). α2δ subunits also have modest effects on gating, accelerating inactivation and deactivation of CaV1 and 2 (Felix et al., 1997Felix R.

Molecular diversity of the calcium channel alpha2delta subunit.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In rat hippocampal neurons, α2δ-1 localizes CaV2.1 or CaV2.2 in the active zone, thereby promoting the coupling of CaV2 to SV exocytosis and enhancing synaptic transmission (Hoppa et al., 2012Hoppa M.B. Lana B. Margas W. Dolphin A.C. Ryan T.A. α2δ expression sets pre-synaptic calcium channel abundance and release probability.Nature. 2012; 486: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The C. elegans genome encodes two α2δ subunits, UNC-36 and TAG-180. A prior study suggested that UNC-36/α2δ is an essential auxiliary subunit for UNC-2/CaV2 (Saheki and Bargmann, 2009Saheki Y. Bargmann C.I. Pre-synaptic CaV2 calcium channel traffic requires CALF-1 and the alpha(2)delta subunit UNC-36.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking UNC-36/α2δ have a behavioral phenotype very similar to unc-2 mutants and unc-36 mutants have a dramatic decrease in the pre-synaptic localization of GFP-tagged UNC-2 channels (Saheki and Bargmann, 2009Saheki Y. Bargmann C.I. Pre-synaptic CaV2 calcium channel traffic requires CALF-1 and the alpha(2)delta subunit UNC-36.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Conflicting results have been reported for UNC-36 effects on EGL-19/CaV1 channels (Lainé et al., 2011Lainé V. Frøkjær-Jensen C. Couchoux H. Jospin M. The alpha1 subunit EGL-19, the alpha2/delta subunit UNC-36, and the beta subunit CCB-1 underlie voltage-dependent calcium currents in Caenorhabditis elegans striated muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36180-36187Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Gao and Zhen, 2011Gao S. Zhen M. Action potentials drive body wall muscle contractions in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 2557-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether UNC-36 is required for UNC-2 and EGL-19 function in neurons, we recorded tonic and evoked EPSCs from unc-36 mutants. We found that unc-36 and unc-2 mutants exhibit very similar electrophysiological phenotypes. Evoked EPSCs (which consist of SV fusions coupled to UNC-2/CaV2) were dramatically reduced in unc-36 mutants (Figures 1B and 1C). Tonic release (which is mediated by both UNC-2 and EGL-19) was reduced but not eliminated in unc-36 mutants (Figures 1B and 1D). The residual mEPSCs in unc-36 mutants were eliminated by Nemadipine treatment, indicating that unc-36 mutations decreased tonic release coupled to UNC-2/CaV2 channels (Figures 1B and 1D). The mEPSC rate observed in unc-36; unc-2 double mutants was indistinguishable from that found in either single mutant (Figure 1D), suggesting that UNC-36/α2δ effects on mEPSC rate are mediated by altered UNC-2/CaV2 function. Collectively, these results suggest that UNC-36/α2δ subunits are required for the function of pre-synaptic UNC-2/CaV2 but not for EGL-19/CaV1. If UNC-36/α2δ is an auxiliary subunit for UNC-2/CaV2, UNC-36 should be localized to pre-synaptic terminals. To visualize UNC-36 localization, we constructed a chimeric protein (mngUNC-36) in which a fluorescent protein (mNeonGreen) was inserted after the amino-terminal signal peptide sequence. A transgene expressing mngUNC-36 in all neurons (using the snb-1 promoter) rescued unc-36 mutant defects in synaptic transmission (Figure 2A), suggesting that the fluorescent tag did not interfere with UNC-36 function. To determine its subcellular localization, we expressed mngUNC-36 in the DA and DB cholinergic motor neurons (using the unc-129 promoter). DA/DB neurons receive synaptic input in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and form NMJs with body muscles in the dorsal nerve cord (DNC) (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, expression in DA/DB neurons provides a simple means for distinguishing axonal (DNC) and dendritic (VNC) protein localization. The mngUNC-36 protein formed fluorescent puncta in the DA/DB dorsal cord axons, whereas diffuse fluorescence was observed in DA/DB ventral cord dendrites (Figure 2B). The axonal mngUNC-36 puncta were strongly co-localized with a SV protein (UNC-57/Endophilin), confirming that mngUNC-36 is localized to pre-synaptic elements (Figures 2B and 2E). The apparent pre-synaptic localization of mngUNC-36 could result from increased axonal volume at pre-synaptic elements. To test this possibility, we compared the subcellular localization of mngUNC-36 with soluble mCherry (also expressed in DA/DB neurons). We found that the axonal puncta fluorescence (measured as ΔF/F) of mngUNC-36 was significantly greater than soluble mCherry (Figures 2C and 2D). Similarly, mngUNC-36 co-localization with UNC-57/Endophilin was significantly greater than with mCherry (Figure 2E). Collectively, these results suggest that mngUNC-36 is enriched at pre-synaptic nerve terminals and that this synaptic enrichment cannot be accounted for by increased axonal volume at synaptic varicosities. If mngUNC-36 accumulation at pre-synaptic terminals is mediated by association with UNC-2/CaV2, mngUNC-36 puncta fluorescence should be diminished in mutants lacking UNC-2/CaV2 channels. Consistent with this idea, mngUNC-36 puncta intensity was significantly reduced in unc-2 mutants (Figures 2F and 2G). Decreased puncta fluorescence in unc-2 mutants could result from decreased expression of the unc-129 promoter (which drives mngUNC-36 expression). To address this possibility, we used the unc-129 promoter to co-express mCherry and mngUNC-36 in DA/DB neurons. We found that mCherry puncta intensity was unaltered in unc-2 mutants (Figures S2A and S2B). When mngUNC-36 puncta fluorescence (ΔF/F) was normalized to the co-expressed mCherry, we observed a significant decrease in mngUNC-36 synaptic enrichment in unc-2 mutants (Figure S2C). Thus, the unc-2 mutation decreased the pre-synaptic accumulation of mngUNC-36, and this effect cannot be explained by decreased expression of the unc-129 promoter, nor by a change in the size of synaptic varicosities. To further test the idea that UNC-36 associates with UNC-2/CaV2, we analyzed unc-10 RIM mutants. In mouse and fly neurons, the active zone protein RIM is required to localize CaV2 to nerve terminals (Graf et al., 2012Graf E.R. Valakh V. Wright C.M. Wu C. Liu Z. Zhang Y.Q. DiAntonio A. RIM promotes calcium channel accumulation at active zones of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16586-16596Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I. Liu X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. RIM proteins tether Ca2+ channels to pre-synaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain interaction.Cell. 2011; 144: 282-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Consequently, if UNC-36 associates with UNC-2/CaV2, unc-10 mutants should have decreased pre-synaptic UNC-36 abundance. As expected, mngUNC-36 puncta intensity was significantly reduced in unc-10 mutants (Figures 2F and 2G). Decreased synaptic mngUNC-36 levels in unc-2 and unc-10 mutants could be a secondary consequence of decreased synaptic transmission in these mutants. To address this possibility, we examined mngUNC-36 fluorescence in unc-13 mutants, which have a nearly complete block in SV exocytosis (Richmond et al., 1999Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. UNC-13 is required for synaptic vesicle fusion in C. elegans.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We found that mngUNC-36 puncta intensity was not significantly reduced in unc-13 mutants (Figures 2F and 2G), indicating that decreased synaptic transmission cannot account for diminished synaptic mngUNC-36 levels in unc-2 and unc-10 mutants. Thus, mngUNC-36 is localized to pre-synaptic terminals in a manner that requires endogenously expressed UNC-2/CaV2. Collectively, these results support the idea that UNC-36 is an auxiliary subunit that physically associates with pre-synaptic UNC-2/CaV2. Retrograde inhibition of ACh release could reflect a decrease in SV fusions coupled to UNC-2/CaV2 or EGL-19/CaV1. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed tonic release in mir-1 mutants lacking either UNC-2 or EGL-19. As previously reported, the mEPSC rate was significantly reduced in mir-1 mutants (50% WT controls). This effect was abolished in mir-1; unc-2 double mutants but was unaffected when EGL-19/CaV1 channels were blocked with Nemadipine (Figures 3A and 3B ). Similarly, the mEPSC rate observed in mir-1; unc-36 double mutants was indistinguishable from that observed in either single mutant, suggesting that miR-1 and UNC-36/α2δ function together to regulate tonic release (Figures 3C and 3D). Collectively, these results support the idea that the retrograde signal inhibits tonic release by altering the function of UNC-2/CaV2 while having little effect on release mediated by EGL-19/CaV1. Thus far, our results suggest that the retrograde signal (which is mediated by trans-synaptic NLG-1/NRX-1 complexes) (Hu et al., 2012Hu Z. Hom S. Kudze T. Tong X.J. Choi S. Aramuni G. Zhang W. Kaplan J.M. Neurexin and neuroligin mediate retrograde synaptic inhibition in C. elegans.Science. 2012; 337: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) inhibits synaptic transmission by selectively inhibiting release coupled to UNC-2/CaV2. A simple model to explain these results would be that NLG-1/NRX-1 complexes directly interact with pre-synaptic UNC-2. Because α2δ subunits have an extensive extra-cellular domain that extends into the synaptic cleft, we hypothesized that post-synaptic NRX-1 might directly bind to pre-synaptic UNC-36. We did several experiments to test this idea. When co-expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, GFP-tagged UNC-36 and MYC-tagged NRX-1 were co-immunoprecipitated (Figure 4A). To determine whether this interaction is conserved, we repeated these binding experiments with the corresponding mammalian proteins. Here again, we found that MYC-tagged mouse NX-1α was recovered in immunoprecipitates formed with HA-tagged α2δ-1, -2, and -3 proteins (Figure 4B). These co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that NX-1α binds with highest apparent affinity to α2δ-3 (Figure 4C). To estimate the affinity of the NX-1α/α2δ-3 complex, we used recombinant bovine NX-1α protein (btNX-1α), which is 99% identical to the mouse protein, as a competitor to interfere with co-immunoprecipitation (Figures 4D and 4E). These competition experiments indicate that NX-1α binds α2δ-3 with an apparent KD ∼40 nM (Figure 4E). By contrast, high concentrations of an unrelated protein (BSA) had no effect on co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 4F), confirming that NX-1α binds specifically to α2δ-3. Which NX-1α domains are required for α2δ-3 binding? The α-NX ecto-domain contains six laminin-like globular repeats (LG 1–6) and three EGF-like repeats (E1–3) (Figure 5A). First, we divided the ecto-domain into three fragments (Ecto1–3), finding that α2δ-3 co-immunoprecipitated with Ecto1 (LG1/E1/LG2) and 3 (LG5/E3/LG6) but failed to interact with Ecto2 (LG3/E2/LG4) (Figure 5B). Next, we identified the domains within Ecto1 and 3 required for binding. The isolated LG1 and 5 domains co-immunoprecipitated with α2δ-3, whereas LG2 and 6 lacked binding activity (Figures S3A and S3B). To confirm that these domains are required for binding to α2δ-3, we deleted LG1 and 5 from the full-length NX-1α and found that this mutant protein (ΔLG1/5) failed to bind α2δ-3 (Figure 5C)."

We surveyed the Gdf5 locus for regulatory regions in transgenic mice and fine-mapped separate enhancers controlling expression in joints versus growing ends of long bones. A large downstream regulatory region contains a novel growth enhancer (GROW1), which is required for normal Gdf5 expression at ends of developing bones and for normal bone lengths in vivo. Human GROW1 contains a common base-pair change that decreases enhancer activity and colocalizes with peaks of positive selection in humans. The derived allele is rare in Africa but common in Eurasia and is found in Neandertals and Denisovans. Our results suggest that an ancient regulatory variant in GROW1 has been repeatedly selected in northern environments and that past selection on growth phenotypes explains the high frequency of a GDF5 haplotype that also increases arthritis susceptibility in many human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2734161211,"Obesity confers an independent risk for carcinogenesis. In the liver, steatosis often proceeds cancer formation; however, the mechanisms by which steatosis promotes carcinogenesis is unknown. We hypothesize that steatosis alters the microenvironment to promote proliferation of tumor initiating cells (TICs) and carcinogenesis. We used several liver cancer models to address the mechanisms underlying the role of obesity in cancer and verified these findings in patient populations. Using bioinformatics analysis and verified by biochemical assays, we identified that hepatosteatosis resulting from either Pten deletion or transgenic expression of HCV core/NS5A proteins, promotes the activation of Wnt/β-catenin. We verified that high fat diet lipid accumulation is also capable of inducing Wnt/β-catenin. Caloric restriction inhibits hepatosteatosis, reduces Wnt/β-catenin activation and blocks the expansion of TICs leading to complete inhibition of tumorigenesis without affecting the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss regulated protein kinase B (AKT) activation. Pharmacological inhibition or loss of the Wnt/β-catenin signal represses TIC growth in vitro, and decreases the accumulation of TICs in vivo. In human liver cancers, ontology analysis of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)-defined Wnt signature genes indicates that Wnt signaling is significantly induced in tumor samples compared with healthy livers. Indeed, Wnt signature genes predict 90% of tumors in a cohort of 558 patient samples. Selective depletion of macrophages leads to reduction of Wnt and suppresses tumor development, suggesting infiltrating macrophages as a key source for steatosis-induced Wnt expression. These data established Wnt/β-catenin as a novel signal produced by infiltrating macrophages induced by steatosis that promotes growth of tumor progenitor cells, underlying the increased risk of liver tumor development in obese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2626751135,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a ligand-gated Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel. Whereas physiological stimuli, such as chemotactic agents, evoke controlled Ca2+ signals via TRPM2, pathophysiological stimuli such as reactive oxygen species and genotoxic stress result in prolonged TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ entry and, consequently, apoptosis. To date, adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose (ADPR) has been assumed to be the main agonist for TRPM2. Here we show that 2'-deoxy-ADPR was a significantly better TRPM2 agonist, inducing 10.4-fold higher whole-cell currents at saturation. Mechanistically, this increased activity was caused by a decreased rate of inactivation and higher average open probability. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry, we detected endogenous 2'-deoxy-ADPR in Jurkat T lymphocytes. Consistently, cytosolic nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT-2) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-glycohydrolase CD38 sequentially catalyzed the synthesis of 2'-deoxy-ADPR from nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and 2'-deoxy-ATP in vitro. Thus, 2'-deoxy-ADPR is an endogenous TRPM2 superagonist that may act as a cell signaling molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2656029942,"A fluorescent biosensor to monitor thioredoxin (Trx) redox activity called TrxRFP1 was developed by genetically linking Trx1 to the redox-sensitive red fluorescent protein rxRFP1. TrxRFP1 was used to detect redox dynamics induced by various chemicals, serum, or epidermal growth factor. Thioredoxin (Trx) is one of the two major thiol antioxidants, playing essential roles in redox homeostasis and signaling. Despite its importance, there is a lack of methods for monitoring Trx redox dynamics in live cells, hindering a better understanding of physiological and pathological roles of the Trx redox system. In this work, we developed the first genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor for Trx redox by engineering a redox relay between the active-site cysteines of human Trx1 and rxRFP1, a redox-sensitive red fluorescent protein. We used the resultant biosensor—TrxRFP1—to selectively monitor perturbations of Trx redox in various mammalian cell lines. We subcellularly localized TrxRFP1 to image compartmentalized Trx redox changes. We further combined TrxRFP1 with a green fluorescent Grx1-roGFP2 biosensor to simultaneously monitor Trx and glutathione redox dynamics in live cells in response to chemical and physiologically relevant stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2726337332,"The C-type lectin domain containing group 14 family members CLEC14A and CD93 are proteins expressed by endothelium and are implicated in tumour angiogenesis. CD248 (alternatively known as endosialin or tumour endothelial marker-1) is also a member of this family and is expressed by tumour-associated fibroblasts and pericytes. Multimerin-2 (MMRN2) is a unique endothelial specific extracellular matrix protein that has been implicated in angiogenesis and tumour progression. We show that the group 14 C-type lectins CLEC14A, CD93 and CD248 directly bind to MMRN2 and only thrombomodulin of the family does not. Binding to MMRN2 is dependent on a predicted long-loop region in the C-type lectin domain and is abrogated by mutation within the domain. CLEC14A and CD93 bind to the same non-glycosylated coiled-coil region of MMRN2, but the binding of CD248 occurs on a distinct non-competing region. CLEC14A and CD248 can bind MMRN2 simultaneously and this occurs at the interface between endothelium and pericytes in human pancreatic cancer. A recombinant peptide of MMRN2 spanning the CLEC14A and CD93 binding region blocks CLEC14A extracellular domain binding to the endothelial cell surface as well as increasing adherence of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to the active peptide. This MMRN2 peptide is anti-angiogenic in vitro and reduces tumour growth in mouse models. These findings identify novel protein interactions involving CLEC14A, CD93 and CD248 with MMRN2 as targetable components of vessel formation."
https://openalex.org/W2726524491,"We provide evidence that the IFN-regulated member of the Schlafen (SLFN) family of proteins, SLFN5, promotes the malignant phenotype in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our studies indicate that SLFN5 expression promotes motility and invasiveness of GBM cells, and that high levels of SLFN5 expression correlate with high-grade gliomas and shorter overall survival in patients suffering from GBM. In efforts to uncover the mechanism by which SLFN5 promotes GBM tumorigenesis, we found that this protein is a transcriptional co-repressor of STAT1. Type-I IFN treatment triggers the interaction of STAT1 with SLFN5, and the resulting complex negatively controls STAT1-mediated gene transcription via interferon stimulated response elements. Thus, SLFN5 is both an IFN-stimulated response gene and a repressor of IFN-gene transcription, suggesting the existence of a negative-feedback regulatory loop that may account for suppression of antitumor immune responses in glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2728403644,"Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to maintain both viability and uncontrolled proliferation. Although an interplay between the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic rewiring in cancer is beginning to emerge, it remains unclear how this metabolic plasticity occurs. Here, we report that in prostate cancer cells (PCCs) microRNAs (miRNAs) greatly contribute to deregulation of mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) oxidation via carnitine system modulation. We provide evidence that the downregulation of hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-129-5p and hsa-miR-378 induced an increase in both expression and activity of CPT1A, CACT and CrAT in malignant prostate cells. Moreover, the analysis of human prostate cancer and prostate control specimens confirmed the aberrant expression of miR-124-3p, miR-129-5p and miR-378 in primary tumors. Forced expression of the miRNAs mentioned above affected tumorigenic properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion, in PC3 and LNCaP cells regardless of their hormone sensitivity. CPT1A, CACT and CrAT overexpression allow PCCs to be more prone on FA utilization than normal prostate cells, also in the presence of high pyruvate concentration. Finally, the simultaneous increase of CPT1A, CACT and CrAT is fundamental for PCCs to sustain FA oxidation in the presence of heavy lipid load on prostate cancer mitochondria. Indeed, the downregulation of only one of these proteins reduces PCCs metabolic flexibility with the accumulation of FA-intermediate metabolites in the mitochondria. Together, our data implicate carnitine cycle as a primary regulator of adaptive metabolic reprogramming in PCCs and suggest new potential druggable pathways for prevention and treatment of prostate cancer."

Although autophagy is known to be influenced by systemic intercellular signals, the proteins that control autophagy are largely thought to function within individual cells. Here, we report that Drosophila macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr), a complement ortholog, plays an essential role during developmental cell death and inflammation by influencing autophagy in neighboring cells. This function of Mcr involves the immune receptor Draper, suggesting a relationship between autophagy and the control of inflammation. Interestingly, Mcr function in epithelial cells is required for macrophage autophagy and migration to epithelial wounds, a Draper-dependent process. This study reveals, unexpectedly, that complement-related from one cell regulates autophagy in neighboring cells via an ancient immune signaling program."

https://openalex.org/W2725443874,"Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a paediatric bone cancer with high metastatic potential. Cellular plasticity resulting from dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization, typically regulated via the Rho pathway, is a prerequisite for metastasis initiation. Here, we interrogated the role of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene EWS-FLI1 in cytoskeletal reprogramming. We report that EWS-FLI1 strongly represses the activity of the Rho-F-actin signal pathway transcriptional effector MRTFB, affecting the expression of a large number of EWS-FLI1-anticorrelated genes including structural and regulatory cytoskeletal genes. Consistent with this finding, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed strong overlaps in myocardin-related transcription factor B (MRTFB) and EWS-FLI1 chromatin occupation, especially for EWS-FLI1-anticorrelated genes. Binding of the transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP)-1, enrichment of TEAD-binding motifs in these shared genomic binding regions and overlapping transcriptional footprints of MRTFB and TEAD factors led us to propose synergy between MRTFB and the YAP/TEAD complex in the regulation of EWS-FLI1-anticorrelated genes. We propose that EWS-FLI1 suppresses the Rho-actin pathway by perturbation of a MRTFB/YAP-1/TEAD transcriptional module, which directly affects the actin-autoregulatory feedback loop. As spontaneous fluctuations in EWS-FLI1 levels of Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo, associated with a switch between a proliferative, non-migratory EWS-FLI1-high and a non-proliferative highly migratory EWS-FLI1-low state, were recently described, our data provide a mechanistic basis for the underlying EWS-FLI1-dependent reversible cytoskeletal reprogramming of Ewing sarcoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2592543002,"Introduction The clinical application of upper limb (UL) three-dimensional movement analysis (3DMA) in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP) remains challenging, despite its benefits compared to conventional clinical scales. Moreover, knowledge on UL movement pathology and how this relates to clinical parameters remains scarce. Therefore, we investigated UL kinematics across different manual ability classification system (MACS) levels and explored the relation between clinical and kinematic parameters in children with uCP. Patients and methods Fifty children (MACS: I = 15, II = 26, III = 9) underwent an UL evaluation of sensorimotor impairments (grip force, muscle strength, muscle tone, two-point discrimination, stereognosis), bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment, AHA), unimanual capacity (Melbourne Assessment 2, MA2) and UL-3DMA during hand-to-head, hand-to-mouth and reach-to-grasp tasks. Global parameters (Arm Profile Score (APS), duration, (timing of) maximum velocity, trajectory straightness) and joint specific parameters (angles at task endpoint, ROM and Arm Variable Scores (AVS)) were extracted. The APS and AVS refer respectively to the total amount of movement pathology and movement deviations of wrist, elbow, shoulder, scapula and trunk. Results Longer movement durations and increased APS were found with higher MACS-levels (p<0.001). Increased APS was also associated with more severe sensorimotor impairments (r = -0.30-(-0.73)) and with lower AHA and MA2-scores (r = -0.50-(-0.86)). For the joint specific parameters, stronger movement deviations distally were significantly associated with increased muscle weakness (r = -0.32-(-0.74)) and muscle tone (r = 0.33-(-0.61)); proximal movement deviations correlated only with muscle weakness (r = -0.35–0.59). Regression analysis exposed grip force as the most important predictor for the variability in APS (p<0.002). Conclusion We found increased movement pathology with increasing MACS-levels and demonstrated the adverse impact of especially muscle weakness. The lower correlations suggest that 3DMA provides additional information regarding UL motor function, particularly for the proximal joints. Integrating both methods seems clinically meaningful to obtain a comprehensive representation of all aspects of a child’s UL functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2724527698,"Glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway both play a central role in the degradation of glucose in all domains of life. Another metabolic route that can facilitate glucose breakdown is the gluconate shunt. In this shunt glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate kinase catalyze the two-step conversion of glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway intermediate 6-phosphogluconate. Despite the presence of these enzymes in many organisms, their only established role is in the production of 6-phosphogluconate for the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In this report we performed metabolic profiling on a strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacking the zinc-responsive transcriptional repressor Loz1 with the goal of identifying metabolic pathways that were altered by cellular zinc status. This profiling revealed that loz1Δ cells accumulate higher levels of gluconate. We show that the altered gluconate levels in loz1Δ cells result from increased expression of gcd1. By analyzing the activity of recombinant Gcd1 in vitro and by measuring gluconate levels in strains lacking enzymes of the gluconate shunt we demonstrate that Gcd1 encodes a novel NADP+-dependent glucose dehydrogenase that acts in a pathway with the Idn1 gluconate kinase. We also find that cells lacking gcd1 and zwf1, which encode the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, have a more severe growth phenotype than cells lacking zwf1. We propose that in S. pombe Gcd1 and Idn1 act together to shunt glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway, creating an alternative route for directing glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway that bypasses hexokinase and the rate-limiting enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2729551435,"The nuclear receptor NOR-1 (NR4A3) has recently been involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins associated with neointimal thickening and the vascular control of hemostasis. We sought to find as-yet unidentified NOR-1 target genes in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). An in silico analysis identified putative NOR-1 response elements in the proximal promoter region of several genes encoding for ECM proteins, including vitronectin (VTN). Lentiviral overexpression of NOR-1 strongly increased VTN mRNA and protein levels, whereas NOR-1 silencing significantly reduced VTN expression. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis studies, as well as EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation, identified the NBRE(−202/−195) site in the VTN promoter as an essential element for NOR-1 responsiveness. Furthermore, NOR-1 and VTN colocalized in VSMCs in human atherosclerotic lesions. VTN levels were increased in cell supernatants from VSMCs that overexpress NOR-1. Cell supernatants from VSMCs overexpressing NOR-1 induced cell migration to a greater extent than supernatants from control cells, and this effect was attenuated when cell supernatants were preincubated with anti-VTN blocking antibodies or VTN was silenced in supernatant-generating cells.

https://openalex.org/W2728198809,"Loss of the epithelial intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) in murine β cells leads to irregular insulin vesicles and decreased insulin levels. Because mitochondria are central in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the relationship between keratins and β-cell mitochondrial function and morphology was investigated. β cells in murine K8-knockout (K8-/-) islets of Langerhans have increased numbers of mitochondria, which are rounder and have diffuse cristae, as seen by electron microscopy. The mitochondrial network in primary cultured K8-/- β cells is more fragmented compared with K8+/+ mitochondria, correlating with decreased levels of mitofusin 2 and the mitofusin 2- and keratin-binding protein trichoplein. K8-/- β-cell mitochondria have decreased levels of total and mitochondrial cytochrome c, which correlates with a reduction in electron transport complexes I and IV. This provokes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reduction of ATP and insulin amount, as seen in K8-/- β cells. Mitochondria in K8 wild-type β cells and MIN6 insulinoma cells overexpressing K8 and 18 are more stationary compared with mitochondria in keratin-deficient cells. In conclusion, keratins, likely through trichoplein-mitofusin interactions, regulate both structural and dynamic functions of β-cell mitochondria, which could have implications for downstream insulin secretion.-Silvander, J.

https://openalex.org/W2725687459,"Imagine that you have a bag of candy. Every once in a while, you grab a few pieces and eat them without thinking too much about it. They taste good, maybe vaguely like strawberries. You think the candy might be a pale pink. Now, you grab another handful. This time, you take a closer look and are surprised to find out that most of them are white and sweet, though unflavored—and all of the strawberry taste comes from a few rare bright pink candies. Averaging across populations can give a great idea of that population’s central tendencies, though it can mask important differences among the individuals within that population, and it tells you nothing about the organization or behavior within any particular individual. It’s a pretty simple concept when applied to a dozen pieces of candy, but it’s much more complex when thousands or even millions of cells are involved. Yet the capacity to interrogate biological phenomena on a single-cell level is increasingly feasible and has already changed our understanding of cellular function and differentiation—not to mention challenging the prevailing notions of several established cell types. The most popular way to examine single cells has so far been to quantify RNA in real time as cells transcribe it. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been the closest thing to an industry standard in this still-emerging field (Tang et al., 2010Tang F. Barbacioru C. Nordman E. Li B. Xu N. Bashkirov V.I. Lao K. Surani M.A. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 516-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), but its drawbacks include low throughput and massive, high-dimensional datasets that can be hard to interpret. Some recently described microfluidic devices have helped to overcome the throughput difficulty. For example, the groups of J. Christopher Love and Alex Shalek developed the Seq-Well platform, comprised of wells with sub-nanoliter volumes and semipermeable membranes, to better capture and analyze hundreds of cells at the same time with single-cell resolution (Gierahn et al., 2017Gierahn T.M. Wadsworth 2nd, M.H. Hughes T.K. Bryson B.D. Butler A. Satija R. Fortune S. Love J.C. Shalek A.K. Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Another approach to increase throughput, CROP-seq, uses pooled CRISPR-based screens to insert unique tags into each cell’s genome followed by RNA-seq to track how those edited genes were transcribed (Datlinger et al., 2017Datlinger P. Rendeiro A.F. Schmidl C. Krausgruber T. Traxler P. Klughammer J. Schuster L.C. Kuchler A. Alpar D. Bock C. Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This strategy effectively combines the old bulk method of investigating entire pools of cells at the same time with the new paradigm of understanding what each of those cells is doing. Alternatively, instead of improving RNA sequencing, some researchers have sought to use visual methods to image and quantify RNA in situ. These image-based approaches, mostly based on the well-known fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, have the additional advantage of being able to track where in the cell the transcription is happening. While the information generated by these techniques can be easier to understand and offer unique spatial insight, they share some difficulties with methods based on RNA-seq, especially low throughput. One reported extension of FISH, termed MERFISH, alters the underlying chemistry of the FISH technique and expands the number of relevant fluorescent wavelengths. This technique can profile more than 100,000 human single cells in less than a day, a 100-fold increase in throughput over previously described methods (Moffitt et al., 2016Moffitt J.R. Hao J. Wang G. Chen K.H. Babcock H.P. Zhuang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 11046-11051Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A unique challenge of optical systems compared with sequencing-based systems is the inability to study opaque or physically inaccessible cells. However, recent work from Long Cai’s group described a system called MEMOIR, where these obscured cells record lineage information with molecular “scratchpads,” which can later be read and interpreted with FISH (Frieda et al., 2017Frieda K.L. Linton J.M. Hormoz S. Choi J. Chow K.K. Singer Z.S. Budde M.W. Elowitz M.B. Cai L. Nature. 2017; 541: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). MEMOIR was demonstrated to reconstruct the lineage of different cells that proliferated from the same pool of mouse embryonic stem cells. While the field is still a long way from applying personalized single-cell omics to precision medicine, it has already produced some new fundamental insights into how cells behave. A recent study from Sarah Teichmann’s group (Lönnberg et al., 2017Lönnberg T. Svensson V. James K.R. Fernandez-Ruiz D. Sebina I. Montandon R. Soon M.S.F. Fogg L.G. Nair A.S. Liligeto U.N. et al.Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2: eaal2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) explored the bifurcation between commitments to different T cell lineages during infection with Plasmodium (the causative agent of malaria) by sequencing RNA transcribed in single naive T cells. One critical finding is that T cell lineages are not mutually exclusive within a given T cell population; instead, multiple T cell subtypes can exist in the same population if single naive cells are exposed to different differentiation factors. And an ambitious project from the Science for Life laboratory in Sweden combined RNA-seq with immunofluorescence to update the Human Protein Atlas with a 3D spatial distribution of where proteins localize in human cells (Thul et al., 2017Thul P.J. Åkesson L. Wiking M. Mahdessian D. Geladaki A. Blal H.A. Alm T. Asplund A. Björk L. Breckels L.M. et al.Science. 2017; 356: eaal3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). These methods and technologies may help us understand some of the most intractable problems in biology: Why do some cells mutate to become cancerous?; What explains the (seemingly stochastic) rise of bacterial “persister” cells in response to antibiotic treatment?; And are there any undiscovered cell types lurking within us? Each starts with a single cell."

The experimental design method was applied to response surface modeling and the optimization of the operational parameters of the photoelectro-catalytic degradation of landfill leachate using TiO2 as a photo-anode. The variables considered were the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration, pH and the potential bias. Two dependent parameters were either directly measured or calculated as responses: chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and total organic carbon (TOC) removal. The results of this investigation reveal that the optimum conditions are an initial pH of 10.0, 4377.98mgL-1 initial COD concentration and 25.0 V of potential bias. The model predictions and the test data were in satisfactory agreement. COD and TOC removals of 67% and 82.5%, respectively, were demonstrated. Under the optimal conditions, GC/MS showed 73 organic micro-pollutants in the raw landfill leachate which included hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and esters. After the landfill leachate treatment processes, 38 organic micro-pollutants disappeared completely in the photoelectrocatalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W2730785852,"System biology provides the basis to understand the behavioral properties of complex biological organisms at different levels of abstraction. Traditionally, analysing systems biology based models of various diseases have been carried out by paper-and-pencil based proofs and simulations. However, these methods cannot provide an accurate analysis, which is a serious drawback for the safety-critical domain of human medicine. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to formally analyze biological networks and pathways. In particular, we formalize the notion of reaction kinetics in higher-order logic and formally verify some of the commonly used reaction based models of biological networks using the HOL Light theorem prover. Furthermore, we have ported our earlier formalization of Zsyntax, i.e., a deductive language for reasoning about biological networks and pathways, from HOL4 to the HOL Light theorem prover to make it compatible with the above-mentioned formalization of reaction kinetics. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework, we present the formal analysis of three case studies, i.e., the pathway leading to TP53 Phosphorylation, the pathway leading to the death of cancer stem cells and the tumor growth based on cancer stem cells, which is used for the prognosis and future drug designs to treat cancer patients."

However, multiple lines of clinical evidence indicate that SAHA might be sometimes ineffective on certain solid tumors including pancreatic cancer. In this study, we have found for the first time that RUNX2/mutant p53/TAp63-regulatory axis has a pivotal role in the determination of SAHA sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells. According to our present results, MiaPaCa-2 cells responded poorly to SAHA. Forced depletion of mutant p53 stimulated SAHA-mediated cell death of MiaPaCa-2 cells, which was accomapanied by a further accumulation of γH2AX and cleaved PARP. Under these experimental conditions, pro-oncogenic RUNX2 was strongly down-regulated in mutant p53-depleted MiaPaCa-2 cells. Surprisingly, RUNX2 silencing augmented SAHA-dependent cell death of MiaPaCa-2 cells and caused a significant reduction of mutant p53. Consistent with these observations, overexpression of RUNX2 in MiaPaCa-2 cells restored SAHA-mediated decrease in cell viability and increased the amount of mutant p53. Thus, it is suggestive that there exists a positive auto-regulatory loop between RUNX2 and mutant p53, which might amplify their pro-oncogenic signals. Intriguingly, knockdown of mutant p53 or RUNX2 potentiated SAHA-induced up-regulation of TAp63. Indeed, SAHA-stimulated cell death of MiaPaCa-2 cells was partially attenuated by p63 depletion. Collectively, our present observations strongly suggest that RUNX2/mutant p53/TAp63-regulatory axis is one of the key determinants of SAHA sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer cells."

CHGA is dysregulated in several cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Here, we sought to identify common polymorphisms in the CHGA promoter and to explore the mechanistic basis of their plausible contribution to regulating CHGA protein levels in circulation. Resequencing of the CHGA promoter in an Indian population (n = 769) yielded nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): G−1106A, A−1018T, T−1014C, T−988G, G−513A, G−462A, T−415C, C−89A, and C−57T. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated strong LD among SNPs at the −1014, −988, −462, and −89 bp positions and between the −1018 and −57 bp positions. Haplotype analysis predicted five major promoter haplotypes that displayed differential promoter activities in neuronal cells; specifically, haplotype 2 (containing variant T alleles at −1018 and −57 bp) exhibited the highest promoter activity. Systematic computational and experimental analyses revealed that transcription factor c-Rel has a role in activating the CHGA promoter haplotype 2 under basal and pathophysiological conditions (viz. inflammation and hypoxia). Consistent with the higher in vitro CHGA promoter activity of haplotype 2, individuals carrying this haplotype had higher plasma CHGA levels, plasma glucose levels, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. In conclusion, these results suggest a functional role of the CHGA promoter haplotype 2 (occurring in a large proportion of the world population) in enhancing CHGA expression in haplotype 2 carriers who may be at higher risk for cardiovascular/metabolic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2733127495,"A conserved segment, i.e. a segment of chromosome unbroken during evolution, is an important operational concept in comparative genomics. Until now, algorithms that are designed to identify conserved segments often return synteny blocks that overlap, synteny blocks that include micro-rearrangements or synteny blocks erroneously short. Here we present definitions of conserved segments and synteny blocks independent of any heuristic method and we describe four new post-processing strategies to refine synteny blocks into accurate conserved segments. The first strategy identifies micro-rearrangements, the second strategy identifies mono-genic conserved segments, the third returns non-overlapping segments and the fourth repairs incorrect ruptures of synteny. All these refinements are implemented in a new version of PhylDiag that has been benchmarked against i-ADHoRe 3.0 and Cyntenator, based on a realistic simulated evolution and true simulated conserved segments."
