https://openalex.org/W2014845493,"Various lines of evidence (1, 3, 4) have suggested that
the primary effect of lethal and mutagenic doses of ultraviolet radiations upon living cells may be partially reversible, or at least compensated within the cell. In
connection with a general study of the photochemistry
of nucleic acid derivatives, we have discovered that, under
certain conditions, the initial photodecomposition product
of the pyrimidine, uracil, and the corresponding product
of the ribose nucleotide, uridine, may spontaneously revert
to the initial substances, uracil and uridine, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2038069770,"MOST of the anti-histaminic drugs are local anæsthetics1. Procaine, too, has an anti-histaminic action2. Euler has demonstrated the presence of large amounts of histamine in certain nerves3. We have investigated the influence of histamine on the nerve block caused by procaine and some of the anti-histaminics. In the frog nerve–muscle preparation, we have found that a nerve block caused by, for example, pyribenzamine can be removed by washing with a solution containing, besides the blocking concentration of the local anæsthetic, a certain concentration of histamine. If the nerve is placed in contact with the mixture of histamine and blocking agent solution, no block results even when the concentration of the blocking agent is quite sufficient for producing block if applied alone. Two typical experiments follow."

https://openalex.org/W2055961026,"ONE of the more important aspects of the chemistry of protein fibres is the study of cross-linking reactions, each of which may be regarded as a potential process for industrial use. Low-temperature setting processes, for example, consist in cross-linking the mercapto groups of reduced wool fibres with oxidizing agents, metal salts or organic compounds containing two or more reactive halogen atoms in the molecule1. It has now been found that even more successful cross-linking of reduced fibres may be obtained with allyl isothiocyanate, presumably because it is capable of combining with amino- and hydroxyl- as well as mercapto-groups2."

https://openalex.org/W2049503486,"THE pyloric gland has long been known to exist in ascidians and is recognized to be of general occurrence in the tunicates with the exception of the Larvacea, but its function has not been determined with certainty. The organ usually forms a system of branching and anastomosing tubules enveloping the rectum and part of the intestine, and opening into the gut between the stomach and the intestine by a single duct. Varicose swellings in the tubules are found in many genera. Chandelon1, Isert2, Sokólska3, and van Weel4, among others, believed the pyloric gland to be digestive in function, contributing enzymes to the intestinal contents. They based their conclusion on the presence, in the walls of the tubules, of vacuoles which discharge into the lumen of the tubules. Todaro5, Colton6 and Azéma7 were among those who regarded the pyloric gland as an excretory organ."

A few days later, R. P. Dales, of this Department, found a second but smaller specimen which was, however, incomplete. Both specimens were dug up from near the mean low-tide mark in a region where the sand overlying the clay contains a high proportion of shell debris."
https://openalex.org/W2031298431,"IN using ionization chambers to study extensive showers, it is necessary to assume some value for the specific ionization of shower particles in order to convert the number of ions collected (which is the quantity measured by the chamber) to the number of particles passing through the chamber, and hence the shower density. There seems to be no general agreement between different workers as to the best figure to assume for this purpose. A survey of the literature reveals that values range from 50 to 100 ion pairs/cm, for air. Many are in the vicinity of 85 ion pairs/cm. for argon, or its equivalent of about 65 ion pairs/cm. for air or nitrogen. This figure corresponds to the specific ionization averaged over electrons of all energies, including those near the minimum of the ionization loss—energy curve. The average energy of extensive shower particles is in the region of 100 MeV., and it therefore seems reasonable to take a larger value for the specific ionization of such particles. Carmichael1 has, in fact, suggested that discrepancies between the extensive shower spectrum obtained by Geiger-counter methods and that found from the size distribution of large bursts could be partly due to an under-estimation of the sizes of bursts in the latter case for the above reason. Carmichael suggests that a value of specific ionization at least 1·4 times greater is necessary to obtain agreement."
https://openalex.org/W2036942443,"IN a recent crystallographic study of adenine hydrochloride, Broomhead1 has concluded that the central or C4—C5 bond distance of 1·44 A. is probably significantly greater than those of the other C—C or C—N bonds in the molecule. This conclusion is based on two-dimensional Fourier projections and, as the author states, it is not absolutely certain that the discrepancy cannot be attributed to experimental error. Nevertheless, the result appears to be in accordance with the anomalous second dissociation constant which I have observed2, namely, pK'a1 = 4.15, pK'a2 = 9·80. The former value is of the order to be expected for the amino-group, but the latter, which can only be attributed to the —NH— group of iminazole ring, is considerably lower than those observed for the corresponding dissociations in benziminazole and in other purine derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1979560415,"IN 1939, Lissak1 showed that extracts of sympathetic nerves contained a Sympathomimetic substance with an adrenaline-like action on various biological preparations. In a series of papers, von Euler2,3,4 has demonstrated that this type of extract is largely noradrenaline. His chief sources of material were cattle and horses. Lissak5 further showed that if a postganglionic sympathetic nerve was stimulated electrically, and the cut end of the nerve allowed to hang beneath the surface of acidified saline during the passage of the current, the saline assumed Sympathomimetic properties from diffusion into it of an adrenaline-like substance from the nerve."

Nevertheless we believe that the effect of urethane on malignant cell proliferation can be explained by its effect on the respiratory enzyme system."

The ants were usually in a posture of defence ; but whether they were defending the nest, attacking prey, or merely hurrying over the surface of the nest or the roads which surround it, the flagella of the antennæ were indistinctly shown in the photographs. The photographs concerned were taken at 1/500–1/1,000 sec."
