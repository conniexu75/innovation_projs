https://openalex.org/W2731989040,"Chromosomes in proliferating metazoan cells undergo marked structural metamorphoses every cell cycle, alternating between highly condensed mitotic structures that facilitate chromosome segregation, and decondensed interphase structures that accommodate transcription, gene silencing and DNA replication. Here we use single-cell Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture) analysis to study chromosome conformations in thousands of individual cells, and discover a continuum of cis-interaction profiles that finely position individual cells along the cell cycle. We show that chromosomal compartments, topological-associated domains (TADs), contact insulation and long-range loops, all defined by bulk Hi-C maps, are governed by distinct cell-cycle dynamics. In particular, DNA replication correlates with a build-up of compartments and a reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 to S and G2 phase. Whole-genome three-dimensional structural models reveal a radial architecture of chromosomal compartments with distinct epigenomic signatures. Our single-cell data therefore allow re-interpretation of chromosome conformation maps through the prism of the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2732286909,"Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins are retro-translocated through the membrane into the cytosol, where they are poly-ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome-a pathway termed endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Proteins with misfolded domains in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen or membrane are discarded through the ERAD-L and ERAD-M pathways, respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both pathways require the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, a multi-spanning membrane protein with a cytosolic RING finger domain. Hrd1 is the crucial membrane component for retro-translocation, but it is unclear whether it forms a protein-conducting channel. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of S. cerevisiae Hrd1 in complex with its endoplasmic reticulum luminal binding partner, Hrd3. Hrd1 forms a dimer within the membrane with one or two Hrd3 molecules associated at its luminal side. Each Hrd1 molecule has eight transmembrane segments, five of which form an aqueous cavity extending from the cytosol almost to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, while a segment of the neighbouring Hrd1 molecule forms a lateral seal. The aqueous cavity and lateral gate are reminiscent of features of protein-conducting conduits that facilitate polypeptide movement in the opposite direction-from the cytosol into or across membranes. Our results suggest that Hrd1 forms a retro-translocation channel for the movement of misfolded polypeptides through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2693288463,"Heterochromatic DNA domains have important roles in the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability by silencing repetitive DNA elements and transposons. From fission yeast to mammals, heterochromatin assembly at DNA repeats involves the activity of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) associated with the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Typically, sRNAs, originating from long noncoding RNAs, guide Argonaute-containing effector complexes to complementary nascent RNAs to initiate histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, respectively) and the formation of heterochromatin. H3K9me is in turn required for the recruitment of RNAi to chromatin to promote the amplification of sRNA. Yet, how heterochromatin formation, which silences transcription, can proceed by a co-transcriptional mechanism that also promotes sRNA generation remains paradoxical. Here, using Clr4, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of mammalian SUV39H H3K9 methyltransferases, we design active-site mutations that block H3K9me3, but allow H3K9me2 catalysis. We show that H3K9me2 defines a functionally distinct heterochromatin state that is sufficient for RNAi-dependent co-transcriptional gene silencing at pericentromeric DNA repeats. Unlike H3K9me3 domains, which are transcriptionally silent, H3K9me2 domains are transcriptionally active, contain modifications associated with euchromatic transcription, and couple RNAi-mediated transcript degradation to the establishment of H3K9me domains. The two H3K9me states recruit reader proteins with different efficiencies, explaining their different downstream silencing functions. Furthermore, the transition from H3K9me2 to H3K9me3 is required for RNAi-independent epigenetic inheritance of H3K9me domains. Our findings demonstrate that H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 define functionally distinct chromatin states and uncover a mechanism for the formation of transcriptionally permissive heterochromatin that is compatible with its broadly conserved role in sRNA-mediated genome defence."
https://openalex.org/W2732383222,"The impact of crude oil pollution on early life stages (ELS) of fish, including larvae and embryos, has received considerable attention in recent years. Of the organic components present in crude oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered the main class of compounds responsible for toxic effects in marine organisms. Although evidence suggests that they are more toxic, alkylated PAHs remain much less studied than their unsubstituted congeners. Recently, it was established that embryos of Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) are particularly sensitive to dispersed crude oil, and it was hypothesized that this was caused by direct interaction with crude oil droplets, which adhered to the chorion of exposed embryos. Such a phenomenon would increase the potential for uptake of less water-soluble compounds, including alkylated PAHs. In the current study, we compared the uptake of parent and alkylated PAHs in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock embryos exposed to dispersed crude oil at a range of environmentally relevant concentrations (10-600 μg oil/liter seawater). Although the species are biologically very similar, the cod chorion does not become fouled with oil droplets, even when the two species are exposed to dispersions of crude oil droplets under similar conditions. A close correlation between the degree of fouling and toxicological response (heart defects, craniofacial malformation) was observed. Oil droplet fouling in haddock led to both quantitative and qualitative differences in PAH uptake. Finally, kinetic data on a large suite of PAHs showed differential elimination, suggesting differential metabolism of unsubstituted versus alkylated compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2728885373,"We have characterized nine mcr-1-harboring plasmids from clinical Escherichia coli isolates previously described in Argentina and Canada. Three of these plasmids carried a mcr-1-variant called here mcr-1.5. All these E. coli isolates were not clonally related and were recovered in different years and locations. However, their mcr-1-harboring plasmids showed high identity among them and to others characterized in other countries, which strongly suggests that this plasmid-type is playing an important role in spreading this mechanism of resistance to polymyxins."
https://openalex.org/W2733946382,"To study how the interaction between N-linked glycans and the surrounding amino acids influences oligosaccharide processing, we used protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a glycoprotein bearing 5 N-glycosylation sites, as a model system and expressed it transiently in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-S cell line. PDI was produced as both secreted Sec-PDI and endoplasmic reticulum-retained glycoprotein (ER)-PDI, to study glycan processing by ER and Golgi resident enzymes. Quantitative site-specific glycosylation profiles were obtained, and flux analysis enabled modeling site-specific glycan processing. By altering the primary sequence of PDI, we changed the glycan/protein interaction and thus the site-specific glycoprofile because of the improved enzymatic fluxes at enzymatic bottlenecks. Our results highlight the importance of direct interactions between N-glycans and surface-exposed amino acids of glycoproteins on processing in the ER and the Golgi and the possibility of changing a site-specific N-glycan profile by modulating such interactions and thus the associated enzymatic fluxes. Altering the primary protein sequence can therefore be used to glycoengineer recombinant proteins.—Losfeld, M.-E., Scibona, E., Lin, C.-W., Villiger, T. K., Gauss, R., Morbidelli, M., Aebi, M.

https://openalex.org/W2727476476,"Internet-connected devices, especially mobile devices such as smartphones, have become widely accessible in the past decade. Interaction with such devices has evolved into frequent and short-duration usage, and this phenomenon has resulted in a pervasive popularity of casual games in the game sector. On the other hand, development of casual games has become easier than ever as a result of the advancement of development tools. With the resulting fierce competition, now both acquisition and retention of users are the prime concerns in the field. In this study, we focus on churn prediction of mobile and online casual games. While churn prediction and analysis can provide important insights and action cues on retention, its application using play log data has been primitive or very limited in the casual game area. Most of the existing methods cannot be applied to casual games because casual game players tend to churn very quickly and they do not pay periodic subscription fees. Therefore, we focus on the new players and formally define churn using observation period (OP) and churn prediction period (CP). Using the definition, we develop a standard churn analysis process for casual games. We cover essential topics such as pre-processing of raw data, feature engineering including feature analysis, churn prediction modeling using traditional machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forests) and two deep learning algorithms (CNN and LSTM), and sensitivity analysis for OP and CP. Play log data of three different casual games are considered by analyzing a total of 193,443 unique player records and 10,874,958 play log records. While the analysis results provide useful insights, the overall results indicate that a small number of well-chosen features used as performance metrics might be sufficient for making important action decisions and that OP and CP should be properly chosen depending on the analysis goal."
https://openalex.org/W2727970915,"Ion channels regulate a variety of physiological processes and represent an important class of drug target. Among the many methods of studying ion channel function, patch clamp electrophysiology is considered the gold standard by providing the ultimate precision and flexibility. However, its utility in ion channel drug discovery is impeded by low throughput. Additionally, characterization of endogenous ion channels in primary cells remains technical challenging. In recent years, many automated patch clamp (APC) platforms have been developed to overcome these challenges, albeit with varying throughput, data quality and success rate. In this study, we utilized SyncroPatch 768PE, one of the latest generation APC platforms which conducts parallel recording from two-384 modules with giga-seal data quality, to push these 2 boundaries. By optimizing various cell patching parameters and a two-step voltage protocol, we developed a high throughput APC assay for the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7. By testing a group of Nav1.7 reference compounds’ IC50, this assay was proved to be highly consistent with manual patch clamp (R > 0.9). In a pilot screening of 10,000 compounds, the success rate, defined by > 500 MΩ seal resistance and >500 pA peak current, was 79%. The assay was robust with daily throughput ~ 6,000 data points and Z’ factor 0.72. Using the same platform, we also successfully recorded endogenous voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 in primary T cells. Together, our data suggest that SyncroPatch 768PE provides a powerful platform for ion channel research and drug discovery."

https://openalex.org/W2732278206,"Growing international and national focus on quantitatively measuring and improving ocean health has increased the need for comprehensive, scientific, and repeated indicators to track progress towards achieving policy and societal goals. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is one of the few indicators available for this purpose. Here we present results from five years of annual global assessment for 220 countries and territories, evaluating potential drivers and consequences of changes and presenting lessons learned about the challenges of using composite indicators to measure sustainability goals. Globally scores have shown little change, as would be expected. However, individual countries have seen notable increases or declines due in particular to improvements in the harvest and management of wild-caught fisheries, the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), and decreases in natural product harvest. Rapid loss of sea ice and the consequent reduction of coastal protection from that sea ice was also responsible for declines in overall ocean health in many Arctic and sub-Arctic countries. The OHI performed reasonably well at predicting near-term future scores for many of the ten goals measured, but data gaps and limitations hindered these predictions for many other goals. Ultimately, all indicators face the substantial challenge of informing policy for progress toward broad goals and objectives with insufficient monitoring and assessment data. If countries and the global community hope to achieve and maintain healthy oceans, we will need to dedicate significant resources to measuring what we are trying to manage."
https://openalex.org/W2727274968,"Anthropogenic climate change is causing a wide range of stresses in aquatic ecosystems, primarily through warming thermal conditions. Lakes, in response to these changes, are experiencing increases in both summer temperatures and ice-free days. We used continuous records of lake surface temperature and air temperature to create statistical models of daily mean lake surface temperature to assess thermal changes in mountain lakes. These models were combined with downscaled climate projections to predict future thermal conditions for 27 high-elevation lakes in the southern Rocky Mountains. The models predict a 0.25°C·decade-1 increase in mean annual lake surface temperature through the 2080s, which is greater than warming rates of streams in this region. Most striking is that on average, ice-free days are predicted to increase by 5.9 days ·decade-1, and summer mean lake surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.47°C·decade-1. Both could profoundly alter the length of the growing season and potentially change the structure and function of mountain lake ecosystems. These results highlight the changes expected of mountain lakes and stress the importance of incorporating climate-related adaptive strategies in the development of resource management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2728452403,"For about 30 years, researchers developed prognostic scores and searched for prognostic factors to predict outcomes for cancer patients. The ""Combs Prognostic Score"" for re-irradiation in recurrent glioma was recently validated and results showed that the score is a significant (p < .001) and reliable predictor for patients undergoing re-irradiation (re-RT). We sought to enhance the score and generated a novel scoring approach, taking into account the information on resection of recurrent tumors, KPS, and tumor volume.The prognostic score was generated based on 209 patients treated between 2002 and 2016 for recurrent glioma at the department of radiation oncology at the Klinikum rechts der Isar, Munich. To further enhance the previously validated Combs Prognostic Score, which uses the prognostic factors primary histology, time between primary RT and re-RT, and age, we added KPS, tumor volume (PTV) and re-resection into the scoring scheme.The median follow-up time was 3.5 months. 67.5% were WHO IV gliomas with a median OS after re-RT of 7.9 months, 17.7% were WHO III gliomas with an OS of 11.3 months and 14.8% were WHO I/II gliomas with an OS of 14.7 months. Multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic factors KPS (p < .001) and showed a tendency to significance for tumor volume (p = .067) and re-resection (p = .064). The new prognostic score demonstrated a high significance (p < .001).The ""New Combs Prognostics Score"" is a significant and useful tool to predict the overall effect of re-RT in patients with recurrence gliomas. This modified score offers an even better way to classify patients in clinical routine and prospective clinical trials investigating re-irradiation."

Plasma was irradiated directly to a culture medium containing plated cells for 5 s or 10 s. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and alizarin red staining were applied to assess osteoblastic differentiation. The plasma-generated radicals were detected directly using an electron spin resonance-spin trapping technique. Results show that plasma irradiation under specific conditions increased ALP activity and enhanced mineralization, and demonstrated that the yield of radicals was increased in an irradiation-time-dependent manner. Appropriate plasma irradiation stimulated the osteoblastic differentiation of the cells. This process offers the potential of promoting bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2730468399,"The current study delineated how male proposers’ facial attractiveness affect female responders’ fairness considerations and their subsequent decision outcome during the Ultimatum Game (UG). Event Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 17 female subjects, who played the role as responders and had to decide whether to accept offers from either attractive or unattractive male proposers. Behavioral data (Acceptance Ratio and Response time) revealed that, more offers were accepted from attractive-face conditions; subjects typically responded quicker to unfair offers from unattractive proposers as compared with slower to unfair offers from attractive proposers. The ERP data demonstrated similar N2 amplitudes elicited by both attractive and unattractive faces, and a larger early frontal LPP elicited by the attractive faces compared with unattractive ones, but no significant differences of both late posterior LPP and typical parietal LPP amplitudes were observed between these two face conditions, which was different from our previous study with similar paradigm but male participants. The results suggest that, in comparison to males, females might not experience the potential attention bias towards unattractive opposite-sex faces and are less likely to possess an enhanced processing and evaluation of those faces. This phenomenon might be explained by endogenous gender differences in mate preference. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P300 responses during an offer presentation were further measured in both attractive-face and unattractive-face conditions and the results demonstrated that the amplitudes elicited by fair and unfair offers were not statistically different in the former condition, but were different in the latter condition. More specifically, unfair offers generated larger FRN and smaller P300 than fair ones in the unattractive-face condition. Findings suggest that, although females tend to possess less salient evaluation of male’s facial attractiveness, the attractiveness of male proposers would still attenuate female responders’ fairness consideration during the UG."
https://openalex.org/W2730790350,"In this work a design for self-tuning non-linear Fuzzy Proportional Integral Derivative (FPID) controller is presented to control position and speed of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) fully-actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) to follow desired trajectories. Non-linearity that results from the hydrodynamics and the coupled AUV dynamics makes the design of a stable controller a very difficult task. In this study, the control scheme in a simulation environment is validated using dynamic and kinematic equations for the AUV model and hydrodynamic damping equations. An AUV configuration with eight thrusters and an inverse kinematic model from a previous work is utilized in the simulation. In the proposed controller, Mamdani fuzzy rules are used to tune the parameters of the PID. Nonlinear fuzzy Gaussian membership functions are selected to give better performance and response in the non-linear system. A control architecture with two feedback loops is designed such that the inner loop is for velocity control and outer loop is for position control. Several test scenarios are executed to validate the controller performance including different complex trajectories with and without injection of ocean current disturbances. A comparison between the proposed FPID controller and the conventional PID controller is studied and shows that the FPID controller has a faster response to the reference signal and more stable behavior in a disturbed non-linear environment."
https://openalex.org/W2953216728,"Potential bias introduced during DNA isolation is inadequately explored, although it could have significant impact on downstream analysis. To investigate this in human brain, we isolated DNA from cerebellum and frontal cortex using spin columns under different conditions, and salting-out. We first analysed DNA using array CGH, which revealed a striking wave pattern suggesting primarily GC-rich cerebellar losses, even against matched frontal cortex DNA, with a similar pattern on a SNP array. The aCGH changes varied with the isolation protocol. Droplet digital PCR of two genes also showed protocol-dependent losses. Whole genome sequencing showed GC-dependent variation in coverage with spin column isolation from cerebellum. We also extracted and sequenced DNA from substantia nigra using salting-out and phenol / chloroform. The mtDNA copy number, assessed by reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome, was higher in substantia nigra when using phenol / chloroform. We thus provide evidence for significant method-dependent bias in DNA isolation from human brain, as reported in rat tissues. This may contribute to array “waves”, and could affect copy number determination, particularly if mosaicism is being sought, and sequencing coverage. Variations in isolation protocol may also affect apparent mtDNA abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2730369721,"Several mitochondrial tRNA mutations have been associated with hypertension, but their pathophysiology remains poorly understood. In this report, we identified a novel homoplasmic 3253T→C mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene in a Han Chinese family with maternally inherited hypertension. The m.3253T→C mutation affected a highly conserved uridine at position 22 at the D-stem of tRNALeu(UUR), introducing a G-C base pairing (G13-C22) at the D-stem and a tertiary base pairing (C22-G46) between the D-stem and the variable loop. We therefore hypothesized that the m.3253T→C mutation altered both the structure and function of tRNALeu(UUR). Using cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines derived from this Chinese family, we demonstrated that the m.3253T→C mutation perturbed the conformation and stability of tRNALeu(UUR), as suggested by faster electrophoretic mobility of mutated tRNA relative to the wild-type molecule. Northern blot analysis revealed an ∼45% decrease in the steady-state level of tRNALeu(UUR) in the mutant cell lines carrying the m.3253T→C mutation, as compared with control cell lines. Moreover, an ∼35% reduction in aminoacylation efficiency of tRNALeu(UUR) was observed in the m.3253T→C mutant cells. These alterations in tRNALeu(UUR) metabolism impaired mitochondrial translation, especially for those polypeptides with a high proportion of Leu(UUR) codons, such as ND6. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the m.3253T→C mutation decreased the activities of mitochondrial complexes I and V, markedly diminished mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potential, and increased the production of reactive oxygen species in the cells.

https://openalex.org/W2726163440,"Fruit set involves the developmental transition of an unfertilized quiescent ovary in the pistil into a fruit. While fruit set is known to involve the activation of signals (including various plant hormones) in the ovary, many biological aspects of this process remain elusive. To further expand our understanding of this process, we identified genes that are specifically expressed in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) pistils during fruit set through comprehensive RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis using 17 different tissues including pistils at six different developmental stages. First, we identified 532 candidate genes that are preferentially expressed in the pistil based on their tissue-specific expression profiles. Next, we compared our RNA-seq data with publically available transcriptome data, further refining the candidate genes that are specifically expressed within the pistil. As a result, 108 pistil-specific genes were identified, including several transcription factor genes that function in reproductive development. We also identified genes encoding hormone-like peptides with a secretion signal and cysteine-rich residues that are conserved among some Solanaceae species, suggesting that peptide hormones may function as signaling molecules during fruit set initiation. This study provides important information about pistil-specific genes, which may play specific roles in regulating pistil development in relation to fruit set."
https://openalex.org/W2731630186,"Much of cover crop research to date focuses on key indicators of impact without considering the implications over multiple years, in the absence of a systems-based approach. To evaluate the effect of three years of autumn cover crops on subsequent processing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production in 2010 and 2011, a field split-split-plot factorial design trial with effects of cover crop type, urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer rate (0 or 140 kg N ha-1 preplant broadcast incorporated) and tomato cultivar (early vs. late) was conducted. The main plot factor, cover crop, included a no cover crop control, oat (Avena sativa L.), winter cereal rye (hereafter referred to as rye) (Secale cereale L.), oilseed radish (OSR) (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiferus Metzg Stokes), and mix of OSR and rye (OSR + rye) treatments. Cover crop biomass of 0.5 to 2.8 and 1.7 to 3.1 Mg ha-1 was attained in early Oct. and the following early May, respectively. In general, OSR increased soil mineral N during cover crop growth and into the succeeding summer tomato growing season, while the remaining cover crops did not differ from the no cover crop control. The lack of a cover crop by N rate interaction in soil and plant N analyses at harvest suggests that growers may not need to modify N fertilizer rates to tomatoes based on cover crop type. Processing tomato fruit quality at harvest (rots, insect or disease damage, Agtron colour, pH, or natural tomato soluble solids (NTSS)) was not affected by cover crop type. In both years, marketable yield in the no cover crop treatment was lower or not statistically different than all planted cover crops. Partial profit margins over both years were 1320 $ ha-1 higher with OSR and $960 higher with oat compared to the no cover crop control. Thus, results from a systems-based approach suggest that the cover crops tested had no observed negative impact on processing tomato production and have the potential to increase marketable yield and profit margins."

Although brain serotonin and dopamine are well known to be involved in regulating feeding, it is unknown whether meal timing during energy restriction affects these neurotransmitter systems. We studied the effect of a 4 wk hypocaloric diet with either 50% of daily calories consumed at breakfast (BF group) or at dinner (D group) on hypothalamic and thalamic serotonin transporter (SERT) binding and on striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding. The BF and D groups lost a similar amount of weight. Striatal DAT and thalamic SERT binding increased in the BF group, while decreasing in the D group after the diet (ΔDAT 0.37 ± 0.63 vs. −0.53 ± 0.77, respectively; P = 0.005; ΔSERT 0.12 ± 0.25 vs. −0.13 ± 0.26 respectively, P = 0.032). Additional voxel-based analysis showed an increase in DAT binding in the ventral striatum in the BF group and a decrease in the dorsal striatum in the D group. During weight loss, striatal DAT and thalamic SERT binding increased weight independently when 50% of daily calories were consumed at breakfast, whereas it decreased when caloric intake was highest at dinner.

TB involves a multi-host system where sheep, traditionally considered a rare host of this infection, have been recently included. The aims of this study were to develop an experimental TB infection model in sheep with a Mycobacterium caprae field strain isolated from a tuberculous diseased ewe, and to use this to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two vaccines against TB in sheep, the live-attenuated M. bovis BCG vaccine (Danish strain) and a heat-inactivated M. bovis (HIMB) vaccine. Methods Eighteen 2 month-old lambs were experimentally challenged with M. caprae by the endotracheal route (1.5 × 103 CFU). They were separated per treatment group into parenterally vaccinated with a live BCG Danish strain vaccine (n = 6), orally vaccinated with a suspension of HIMB (n = 6) and unvaccinated controls (n = 6). Clinical, immunological, pathological and bacteriological parameters of infection were measured. Results All lambs were successfully infected and developed gross TB lesions in the respiratory system. The BCG vaccine conferred considerable protection against experimental TB in lambs, as measured by a reduction of the gross lesion volumes and bacterial load. However, HIMB vaccinated animals did not show protection. Conclusions This study proposes a reliable new experimental model for a better understanding of tuberculosis in sheep. BCG vaccination offers an effective prospect for controlling the disease. Moreover alternative doses and/or routes of administration should be considered to evaluate the efficacy of the HIMB vaccine candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2734183401,"Hsp70 is a protein chaperone that prevents protein aggregation and aids protein folding by binding to hydrophobic peptide domains through a reversible mechanism directed by an ATPase cycle. However, Hsp70 also binds U-rich RNA including some AU-rich elements (AREs) that regulate the decay kinetics of select mRNAs and has recently been shown to bind and stabilize some ARE-containing transcripts in cells. Previous studies indicated that both the ATP- and peptide-binding domains of Hsp70 contributed to the stability of Hsp70–RNA complexes and that ATP might inhibit RNA recruitment. This suggested the possibility that RNA binding by Hsp70 might mimic features of its peptide-directed chaperone activities. Here, using purified, cofactor-free preparations of recombinant human Hsp70 and quantitative biochemical approaches, we found that high-affinity RNA binding requires at least 30 nucleotides of RNA sequence but is independent of Hsp70's nucleotide-bound status, ATPase activity, or peptide-binding roles. Furthermore, although both the ATP- and peptide-binding domains of Hsp70 could form complexes with an ARE sequence from VEGFA mRNA in vitro, only the peptide-binding domain could recover cellular VEGFA mRNA in ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitations. Finally, Hsp70-directed stabilization of VEGFA mRNA in cells was mediated exclusively by the protein's peptide-binding domain.

Furthermore, although both the ATP- and peptide-binding domains of Hsp70 could form complexes with an ARE sequence from VEGFA mRNA in vitro, only the peptide-binding domain could recover cellular VEGFA mRNA in ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitations. Finally, Hsp70-directed stabilization of VEGFA mRNA in cells was mediated exclusively by the protein's peptide-binding domain. Together, these findings indicate that the RNA-binding and mRNA-stabilizing functions of Hsp70 are independent of its protein chaperone cycle but also provide potential mechanical explanations for several well-established and recently discovered cytoprotective and RNA-based Hsp70 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2726178299,"Rhizocephala, a group of parasitic castrators of other crustaceans, shows remarkable morphological adaptations to their lifestyle. The adult female parasite consists of a body that can be differentiated into two distinct regions: a sac-like structure containing the reproductive organs (the externa), and a trophic, root like system situated inside the hosts body (the interna). Parasitism results in the castration of their hosts, achieved by absorbing the entire reproductive energy of the host. Thus, the ratio of the host and parasite sizes is crucial for the understanding of the parasite’s energetic cost. Using advanced imaging methods (micro-CT in conjunction with 3D modeling), we measured the volume of parasitic structures (externa, interna, egg mass, egg number, visceral mass) and the volume of the entire host. Our results show positive correlations between the volume of (1) entire rhizocephalan (externa + interna) and host body, (2) rhizocephalan externa and host body, (3) rhizocephalan visceral mass and rhizocephalan body, (4) egg mass and rhizocephalan externa, (5) rhizocephalan egg mass and their egg number. Comparing the rhizocephalan Sylon hippolytes, a parasite of caridean shrimps, and representatives of Peltogaster, parasites of hermit crabs, we could match their different traits on a reconstructed relationship. With this study we add new and significant information to our global understanding of the evolution of parasitic castrators, of interactions between a parasitic castrator and its host and of different parasitic strategies within parasitic castrators exemplified by rhizocephalans."
https://openalex.org/W2730582188,"Although human saliva contains the monoamine serotonin, which plays a key role in the modulation of emotional states, the association between salivary serotonin and empathic ability remains unclear. In order to elucidate the associations between salivary serotonin levels, trait empathy, and the sharing effect of emotions (i.e., sharing emotional experiences with others), we performed a vignette-based study. Participants were asked to evaluate their happiness when they experience several hypothetical life events, whereby we manipulated the valence of the imagined event (positive, neutral, or negative), as well as the presence of a friend (absent, positive, or negative). Results indicated that the presence of a happy friend significantly enhanced participants’ happiness. Correlation analysis demonstrated that salivary serotonin levels were negatively correlated with happiness when both the self and friend conditions were positive. Correlation analysis also indicated a negative relationship between salivary serotonin levels and trait empathy (particularly in perspective taking), which was measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Furthermore, an exploratory multiple regression analysis suggested that mothers’ attention during childhood predicted salivary serotonin levels. Our findings indicate that empathic abilities and the social sharing of happiness decreases as a function of salivary serotonin levels."
https://openalex.org/W2733671984,"Abstract Double strand breaks (DSBs) represent highly deleterious DNA damage and need to be accurately repaired. Homology directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) are the two major DSB repair pathways that are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. The choice between these pathways is largely based on 5′ to 3′ DNA resection, and NHEJ proceeds only if resection has not initiated. In yeast, yKu70/80 (Ku) rapidly localizes to the break, protecting DNA ends from nuclease accessibility and recruits additional NHEJ factors, including Nej1 and Lif1. Cells harboring the nej1-V338A mutant exhibit NHEJ-mediated repair deficiencies and hyper-resection 0.15 kb from the DSB that was dependent on the nuclease activity of Dna2-Sgs1. The integrity of Nej1 is also important for inhibiting long-range resection, 4.8 kb from the break, and for preventing the formation of large genomic deletions at sizes > 700 bp around the break. Nej1V338A localized to an HO-induced DSB similarly to WT Nej1 indicating that the Nej1-Lif1 interaction becomes mainly critical for blocking hyper-resection after their recruitment to the DSB. This work highlights that Nej1 inhibits 5′ DNA hyper-resection mediated by Dna2-Sgs1, a function distinct from its previously reported role in supporting Dnl4 ligase activity and has implications for repair pathway choice and resection regulation upon DSB formation."
https://openalex.org/W2725083004,"Space travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to impairments in cardiac function. We used a mouse model to determine short- and long-term cardiac effects to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading; HU), continuous low-dose rate γ-irradiation, or a combination of HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation.Cardiac tissue was obtained from female, C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months following the completion of a 21 day exposure to HU or a 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation (average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h to a total of 0.04 Gy), or a 21 day simultaneous exposure to HU and low-dose rate γ-irradiation. Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group.The combination of HU and γ-irradiation demonstrated the strongest increase in reduced to oxidized glutathione ratios 7 days and 1 month after treatment, but a difference was no longer apparent after 9 months. On the other hand, no significant changes in 4-hydroxynonenal adducts was seen in any of the groups, at the measured endpoints. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Inflammatory marker, CD-2 protein content was significantly decreased in all groups 4 months after treatment. No significant differences were observed in α-smooth muscle cell actin protein content, collagen type III protein content or % total collagen.This study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. Results from the late observation time points suggest that the hearts had mostly recovered from these two experimental conditions. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2725683446,"NK3 homeobox 1 (Nkx3.1), a transcription factor expressed in the prostate epithelium, is crucial for maintaining prostate cell fate and suppressing tumor initiation. Nkx3.1 is ubiquitously expressed in luminal cells of hormonally intact prostate but, upon androgen deprivation, exclusively labels a type of luminal stem cells named castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells (CARNs). During prostate cancer initiation, Nkx3.1 expression is frequently lost in both humans and mouse models. Therefore, investigating how Nkx3.1 expression is regulated in vivo is important for understanding the mechanisms of prostate stem cell specification and cancer initiation. Here, using a transgenic mouse line with destabilized GFP, we identified an 11-kb genomic region 3′ of the Nkx3.1 transcription start site to be responsible for alterations in Nkx3.1 expression patterns under various physiological conditions. We found that androgen cell-autonomously activates Nkx3.1 expression through androgen receptor (AR) binding to the 11-kb region in both normal luminal cells and CARNs and discovered new androgen response elements in the Nkx3.1 3′ UTR. In contrast, we found that, in Pten−/− prostate tumors, loss of Nkx3.1 expression is mediated at the transcriptional level through the 11-kb region despite functional AR in the nucleus. Importantly, the GFP reporter specifically labeled CARNs in the regressed prostate only in the presence of cell-autonomous AR, supporting a facultative model for CARN specification.

In particular, androgen deprivation via castration in mice induced prostate regression accompanied by apoptosis in the majority of luminal cells and loss of Nkx3.1 expression in the ones that survived (1.Bieberich C.J.

Notably, a small subset of the surviving luminal cells retained Nkx3.1 expression in the regressed prostate. Those cells, named castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells (CARNs), were shown to behave as luminal stem cells that contribute to prostate regeneration upon androgen readministration and could also serve as a cell of origin for prostate cancer (5.Wang X.

How CARNs are specified is unclear; the retention of their Nkx3.1 expression could be due to an intrinsically different cellular program from other luminal cells or, alternatively, stochastically determined by the local microenvironment. Another important question concerning Nkx3.1 expression arises from studies of prostate cancer. Under prostate tumor–initiating conditions, such as the loss of Pten, luminal Nkx3.1 expression is abolished in both human samples and mouse models (19.Kim M.J. Cardiff R.D. Desai N.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2884-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We reason that studying Nkx3.1 transcriptional regulation by analysis of the Nkx3.1 gene locus should shed light on the above questions. A pioneer study using transgenic LacZ reporter mice discovered that a 32-kb fragment containing 20 kb upstream and 12 kb downstream of the Nkx3.1 transcription start site (TSS) could drive the endogenous Nkx3.1 expression pattern in most organs during embryogenesis (4.Chen H. Mutton L.N. Prins G.S. Bieberich C.J. Distinct regulatory elements mediate the dynamic expression pattern of Nkx3.1.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Within this fragment, the downstream-most 5-kb region acted as a urogenital enhancer that partially restored prostatic Nkx3.1 expression (4.Chen H. Mutton L.N. Prins G.S. Bieberich C.J. Distinct regulatory elements mediate the dynamic expression pattern of Nkx3.1.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we hypothesize that change of Nkx3.1 expression in adult prostate in vivo is regulated transcriptionally through its 3′ local genomic region. Our data below support this hypothesis by testing it in the contexts of both prostate regression–regeneration and Pten loss–induced cancer initiation. They also support a facultative model for CARN specification. To test the hypothesis that change of prostatic Nkx3.1 expression is mediated transcriptionally through its 3′ genomic sequence in vivo, we took a transgenic reporter mouse approach by constructing an ∼11-kb DNA fragment containing the 240-bp Nkx3.1 proximal promoter, the 4-kb Nkx3.1 gene sequence, and its adjacent 3′ 6.5-kb intergenic region (Fig. 1A). In addition, for visualizing loss of Nkx3.1 expression under androgen deprivation and tumor initiation conditions, we inserted the d2EGFP sequence encoding a destabilized GFP (24.Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.C. Kain S.R. Generation of destabilized green fluorescent protein as a transcription reporter.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34970-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) with an SV40 poly(A) sequence right after the start codon (Fig. 1A). With a half-life of 2 h, the d2EGFP should dynamically report the Nkx3.1 transcriptional activities in vivo. The final construct (named Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP) was used for pronuclear injection, and five independent transgenic mouse lines were obtained. A robust GFP signal was observed specifically in the adult prostate; four of the five lines showed strong to moderate GFP expression in various prostate lobes, whereas one line showed weak expression (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1). For subsequent analyses, we focused on transgenic line 18 (Ntg18) because it displayed the strongest expression in all lobes of the prostate (Fig. 1B). We next examined reporter gene expression during embryogenesis and prostate development. No GFP was observed in somites of E10.5 embryos in any of the lines, consistent with a previous report showing that key elements for somite Nkx3.1 expression lie in the 5′ region of the gene locus (4.Chen H. Mutton L.N. Prins G.S. Bieberich C.J. Distinct regulatory elements mediate the dynamic expression pattern of Nkx3.1.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We also did not detect GFP in E18.5 prostate buds, where cells mostly expressed the basal marker CK5 (Fig. 1C). GFP began to be expressed in the prostate around neonatal stage P4. By neonatal stage P8, GFP was expressed throughout the prostate epithelium, which contained basal (CK5+), luminal (CK18+) and intermediate cells (CK5+CK18+) and co-localized with Nkx3.1 expression (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2A). Throughout the adult stage, GFP expression was persistently present in the luminal layer and co-localized with Nkx3.1 expression (Fig. 1, E and F). The proportions of luminal cells that were GFP+ in the anterior, ventral, and dorsal-lateral prostate lobes (AP, VP, and DLP, respectively) were 98.2% (n = 2019 of 2055), 67.2% (n = 839 of 1248), and 87.1% (n = 1283 of 1473), respectively (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. S2, B–D). Notably, ∼5.8% (n = 95 of 1638) of basal cells were also GFP+ (Fig. 1, G and H), in agreement with the percentage of Nkx3.1+ basal cells reported previously (4.Chen H. Mutton L.N. Prins G.S. Bieberich C.J. Distinct regulatory elements mediate the dynamic expression pattern of Nkx3.1.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5.Wang X. Kruithof-de Julio M.

Overall, Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP recapitulates the endogenous Nkx3.1 expression pattern in adult prostate homeostasis. To test whether androgen regulates Nkx3.1 expression through the 11-kb region, we castrated Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP mice at 8 weeks of age and performed three rounds of androgen-mediated serial prostate regression–regeneration (Fig. 2A). We found that the GFP signal was dramatically decreased in the regressed prostate (Fig. 2, B and C), consistent with loss of Nkx3.1 expression in most luminal cells upon androgen deprivation. Importantly, cells that retained GFP expression were strictly luminal and expressed Nkx3.1 (Fig. 2C), and they comprised 1.4% (n = 29 of 2053) of all luminal cells (Fig. 2K), suggesting that they correspond to the previously identified CARNs (5.Wang X. Kruithof-de Julio M. Economides K.D. Walker D. Yu H. Halili M.V. Hu Y.P. Price S.M. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. A luminal epithelial stem cell that is a cell of origin for prostate cancer.Nature. 2009; 461: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Upon androgen readministration, the GFP signal was again detected in most luminal cells (95.6%, n = 1883 of 1970) of the regenerated prostate, and the same results were observed for both one-round and three-round regeneration experiments (Fig. 2, D, E, and K). These data demonstrate that the Nkx3.1 11-kb region is fully responsive to androgen regulation. Androgen-regulated luminal Nkx3.1 expression could be mediated cell-autonomously through luminal AR and/or through paracrine signals induced by stromal AR. To distinguish these two possibilities, we analyzed prostate in the midst of regression. We found that, 2 weeks after castration of Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP mice (Fig. 2A), the shrinking prostate showed a mosaic GFP expression pattern, with the GFP+ regions overlapping with luminal nuclear AR signals (Fig. 2F). To further confirm the cell-autonomous role of androgen, we deleted AR specifically in luminal cells using the CK18-CreERT2 driver (25.Van Keymeulen A. Mascre G. Youseff K.K. Harel I. Michaux C.

Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) by tamoxifen induction of 8-week-old CK18-CreERT2; ARflox/Y mice. Two weeks after induction, AR-null luminal cells could be identified as clusters with condensed nuclei and enhanced membrane CK18 expression, as we reported previously (26.Xie Q. Liu Y. Cai T. Horton C. Stefanson J. Wang Z.A. Dissecting cell-type-specific roles of androgen receptor in prostate homeostasis and regeneration through lineage tracing.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14284Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and we found that Nkx3.1 expression was diminished in those cells (Fig. 2G). Direct staining of AR and Nkx3.1 in adjacent sections also confirmed this result (supplemental Fig. S3A). Importantly, we found that the GFP signal was significantly reduced in AR-null luminal cells of tamoxifen-induced CK18-CreERT2; ARflox/Y; Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP mice (Fig. 2H and supplemental Fig. S3B), indicating that luminal cell-autonomous AR directly activates Nkx3.1 transcription through the 11-kb region. To determine whether such a mechanism also applies to CARNs, we ablated AR specifically in CARNs using the Nkx3.1CreERT2/+ driver (5.Wang X. Kruithof-de Julio M. Economides K.D. Walker D. Yu H. Halili M.V. Hu Y.P. Price S.M. Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. A luminal epithelial stem cell that is a cell of origin for prostate cancer.Nature. 2009; 461: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) in the fully regressed prostate and analyzed GFP reporter activity. In Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; ARflox/Y; Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP mice that first underwent castration and then tamoxifen induction (Fig. 2I), the percentage of GFP+ luminal cells in the regressed prostate was dramatically reduced by almost 10-fold to 0.16% (n = 4 of 2450) (Fig. 2, J and K), and no Nkx3.1+ cells were found by immunofluorescence staining. Therefore, Nkx3.1 expression in both luminal cells and CARNs are transcriptionally regulated by cell-autonomous AR through the 11-kb region. To confirm that AR interacts with the Nkx3.1 3′ gene locus, we next performed quantitative ChIP (qChIP) analyses across a 17-kb Nkx3.1 region that encompasses both 7-kb upstream and 10-kb downstream sequences to its TSS (Fig. 3A). We chose to analyze this region because it was shown previously to be capable of driving prostatic Nkx3.1 expression (4.Chen H. Mutton L.N. Prins G.S. Bieberich C.J. Distinct regulatory elements mediate the dynamic expression pattern of Nkx3.1.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consistent with our reporter mouse data, we found that AR had low affinity for the region 5′ to the Nkx3.1 TSS but, instead, occupied multiple loci in the 3′ 11-kb region (Fig. 3A). In particular, our statistical analysis (see “Experimental procedures”) highlighted two binding sites with the highest affinity in the 3′ UTR (“Peak+3kb”) and the intron (“Peak+1kb”), respectively (Fig. 3A). To test whether these two peaks could serve as transcriptional enhancers, we performed a luciferase reporter assay by transfection of synthetic constructs containing an E4TATA minimal promoter in combination with the peak regions into prostate LnCaP cells (Fig. 3B), which express AR and are androgen-responsive (27.Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. LNCaP model of human prostatic carcinoma.Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar). Upon dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment, luciferase activity for the construct containing the ∼290-bp Peak+3kb sequence was significantly enhanced, whereas no difference was observed for the construct containing the Peak+1kb sequence (Fig. 3C). To test any potential spatial effect of the binding site arrangement, we also generated constructs in which the Peak+1kb and Peak+3kb sequences were positioned downstream of the luciferase sequence and obtained similar results (supplemental Fig. S4). We next used the FIMO software (28.Grant C.E. Bailey T.L. Noble W.S. FIMO: scanning for occurrences of a given motif.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 1017-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) to search for potential AR-responsive elements (AREs) within the Peak+3kb fragment based on the AR DNA-binding consensus motif obtained from TRANSFAC (29.Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knüppel R. TRANSFAC: a database on transcription factors and their DNA binding sites.Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Three new candidate AREs were identified, with ARE1 being a composite site containing two 6-bp half-sites with one overlapping nucleotide and ARE2 and ARE3 both being optimal palindromic sequences 15 bp in length (Fig. 3D). In a series of luciferase assays using synthetic reporters containing six copies of the individual predicted AREs (Fig. 3B), we found that both ARE2 and ARE3, but not ARE1, significantly enhanced luciferase activities upon DHT treatment (Fig. 3E). Cumulatively, these molecular analyses support that AR directly binds to the 11-kb region, particularly the Nkx3.1 3′ UTR, to activate Nkx3.1 transcription. Finally, we sought to address the question how loss of the tumor suppressor Pten leads to down-regulation of Nkx3.1 expression in prostate tumors (19.Kim M.J. Cardiff R.D. Desai N. Banach-Petrosky W.A. Parsons R. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Cooperativity of Nkx3.1 and Pten loss of function in a mouse model of prostate carcinogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We generated lineage-marked Pten-null prostate cell clones that were identifiable as YFP+ or phospho-Akt+ by tamoxifen-induction of CK18-CreERT2; Ptenflox/flox; R26R-YFP/+ mice and confirmed that Nkx3.1 immunostaining was abolished in those cells (Fig. 4A). Notably, this phenomenon is not due to AR loss because strong nuclear AR staining was still present in the Pten-null cells (Fig. 4B). Many potential causes could result in this phenotype, including decrease of Nkx3.1 transcription, Nkx3.1 mRNA degradation/modification, and Nkx3.1 protein degradation. To determine whether Pten regulation of Nkx3.1 expression occurs at the transcriptional level, we analyzed GFP reporter expression in tamoxifen-induced CK18-CreERT2; Ptenflox/flox; Nkx3.1(11)-d2EGFP mice. Pten-null clones were identified by positivity of phospho-Akt staining 2 weeks after induction (Fig. 4, C and D). Strikingly, the GFP signal was abolished in those cells but not in neighboring wild-type cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Triple staining of AR, phospho-Akt, and GFP also confirmed the above findings (supplemental Fig. S5). To determine whether the nuclear AR is functional in Pten-null cells, we isolated wild-type and Pten-null luminal cells by flow-sorting of YFP+ cells from tamoxifen-induced CK18-CreERT2; R26R-YFP/+ and CK18-CreERT2; Ptenflox/flox; R26R-YFP/+ mice, respectively, and performed qRT-PCR for several well-established prostate AR target genes: Crabp1, Fkbp5, Mme, Msmb, Pbsn, and Pgap2 (23.Mulholland D.J.

In this study, immune-induced AA mice were used as an animal model, and the immunosuppressive agent, Ciclosporin A (CsA), was used as a positive control. Multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined by bead-based multiplex flow cytometry. The T-cell subsets were assessed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Western blot analysis was used to estimate the protein expression levels of specific transcription factors for T helper cells (Th1, Th2 and Th17) and key molecules of the Janus-activated kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) signaling pathway. DGBX treatment could significantly increase the production of whole blood cells in peripheral blood (PB); inhibit the expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells; increase the differentiation of Th2 and Tregs cells; regulate the expression levels of T-bet, GATA-3, RORγ and proinflammatory cytokines; and decrease the expression levels of key molecules in the Jak/Stat signaling pathway. These results indicate that DGBX can regulate the differentiation of T lymphocytes, resulting in immunosuppressive and hematogenic functions on AA mice. DGBX might be a good candidate for inclusion in a randomized study for AA with more data on the possible side effects and doses used in humans. Ultimately, it may be used for applications of traditional medicine against AA in modern complementary and alternative immunosuppressive therapeutics."

We tested whether the effect of cue validity on attention performance differed when cues were angry, happy, or neutral faces. Moreover, we used scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting the capture of early visual attention (P1, N170) to test whether effects were strengthened when neurocognitive responses to angry or happy cues were enhanced (larger P1 and N170 amplitudes). Twenty-five participants completed a modified flanker task using emotional face cues to measure the effects of emotion on conflict interference. Attention performance was enhanced following valid versus invalid cues, but effects did not differ by emotion cue type. However, for participants showing relatively larger N170 amplitudes to angry face cues, attention performance was specifically disrupted on those trials. Conversely, participants with relatively larger N170 amplitudes to happy face cues showed facilitated performance across all valid trials. These findings suggest that individual neurocognitive sensitivities to emotion predict the impact of emotional content on the basic attentional phenomenon of cue validity."

The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of moderate alcohol intake on thermogenic brown/beige adipocyte formation and glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as the involvement of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in the entire process. C57BL6 male mice were supplemented with 8% (w/v) alcohol in water for 1 or 4 mo. Alcohol intake prevented body weight gain, induced the formation of uncoupling protein 1-positive beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue, and increased thermogenesis in mice, which is associated with decreased serum glucose and triacylglycerol levels. Mechanistically, alcohol intake increased RA levels in serum and adipose tissue, which was associated with increased expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 subfamily A1 (Aldh1a1). When RA receptor-α signaling was conditionally blocked in platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α-positive adipose progenitors, the effects of alcohol on beige adipogenesis were largely abolished. Finally, moderate alcohol prevented high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. In conclusion, moderate alcohol intake induces thermogenic brown/beige adipocyte formation and promotes glucose and lipid oxidation via elevation of RA signaling.-Wang, B., Wang, Z., de Avila, J.

https://openalex.org/W2728962627,"Trypanosoma brucei, protozoan parasites that cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), depend on ornithine uptake and metabolism by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for survival. Indeed, ODC is the target of the WHO “essential medicine” eflornithine, which is antagonistic to another anti-HAT drug, suramin. Thus, ornithine uptake has important consequences in T. brucei, but the transporters have not been identified. We describe these amino acid transporters (AATs). In a heterologous expression system, TbAAT10-1 is selective for ornithine, whereas TbAAT2-4 transports both ornithine and histidine. These AATs are also necessary to maintain intracellular ornithine and polyamine levels in T. brucei, thereby decreasing sensitivity to eflornithine and increasing sensitivity to suramin. Consistent with competition for histidine, high extracellular concentrations of this amino acid phenocopied a TbAAT2-4 genetic defect. Our findings established TbAAT10-1 and TbAAT2-4 as the parasite ornithine transporters, one of which can be modulated by histidine, but both of which affect sensitivity to important anti-HAT drugs.—Macedo, J.

https://openalex.org/W2730546402,"Eukaryotic protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is a PP2A-type protein phosphatase that is part of a conserved complex with regulatory factors PSY2 and PP4R2. Various lines of Arabidopsis thaliana with mutated PP4 subunit genes were constructed to study the so far completely unknown functions of PP4 in plants. Mutants with knocked out putative functional homolog of the PSY2 LIKE (PSY2L) gene were dwarf and bushy, while plants with knocked out PP4R2 LIKE (PP4R2L) looked very similar to WT. The psy2l seedlings had short roots with disorganized morphology and impaired meristem. Seedling growth was sensitive to the genotoxin cisplatin. Global transcript analysis (RNA-seq) of seedlings and rosette leaves revealed several groups of genes, shared between both types of tissues, strongly influenced by knocked out PSY2L. Receptor kinases, CRINKLY3 and WAG1, important for growth and development, were down-regulated 3–7 times. EUKARYOTIC ELONGATION FACTOR5A1 was down-regulated 4–6 fold. Analysis of hormone sensitive genes indicated that abscisic acid levels were high, while auxin, cytokinin and gibberellic acid levels were low in psy2l. Expression of specific transcription factors involved in regulation of anthocyanin synthesis were strongly elevated, e.g. the master regulator PAP1, and intriguingly TT8, which is otherwise mainly expressed in seeds. The psy2l mutants accumulated anthocyanins under conditions where WT did not, pointing to PSY2L as a possible upstream negative regulator of PAP1 and TT8. Expression of the sugar-phosphate transporter GPT2, important for cellular sugar and phosphate homeostasis, was enhanced 7–8 times. Several DNA damage response genes, including the cell cycle inhibitor gene WEE1, were up-regulated in psy2l. The activation of DNA repair signaling genes, in combination with phenotypic traits showing aberrant root meristem and sensitivity to the genotoxic cisplatin, substantiate the involvement of Arabidopsis PSY2L in maintenance of genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2725975736,"Exposure to a small number of high-energy heavy charged particles (HZE ions), as found in the deep space environment, could significantly affect astronaut health following prolonged periods of space travel if these ions induce mutations and related cancers. In this study, we used an in vivo mutagenesis assay to define the mutagenic effects of accelerated 56Fe ions (1 GeV/amu, 151 keV/μm) in the mouse kidney epithelium exposed to doses ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 Gy. These doses represent fluences ranging from 1 to 8 particle traversals per cell nucleus. The Aprt locus, located on chromosome 8, was used to select induced and spontaneous mutants. To fully define the mutagenic effects, we used multiple endpoints including mutant frequencies, mutation spectrum for chromosome 8, translocations involving chromosome 8, and mutations affecting non-selected chromosomes. The results demonstrate mutagenic effects that often affect multiple chromosomes for all Fe ion doses tested. For comparison with the most abundant sparsely ionizing particle found in space, we also examined the mutagenic effects of high-energy protons (1 GeV, 0.24 keV/μm) at 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. Similar doses of protons were not as mutagenic as Fe ions for many assays, though genomic effects were detected in Aprt mutants at these doses. Considered as a whole, the data demonstrate that Fe ions are highly mutagenic at the low doses and fluences of relevance to human spaceflight, and that cells with considerable genomic mutations are readily induced by these exposures and persist in the kidney epithelium. The level of genomic change produced by low fluence exposure to heavy ions is reminiscent of the extensive rearrangements seen in tumor genomes suggesting a potential initiation step in radiation carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2726801788,"GPS measurements are used to investigate the continental rift system of North Island, New Zealand, and to develop a model for short-term deformation involving flexing of an elastic upper crust caused by episodic changes in mantle viscosity and melt fraction. Direct observation of mantle flow dynamics beneath spreading oceanic crusts is difficult, but similar processes occur below rifts in the continental crust and so can be inferred from satellite observations of the moving crust. Simon Lamb et al. use ten years of continuous GPS measurements from a back-arc continental rift system in North Island, New Zealand, to investigate the dynamics of mantle flow beneath seafloor 'spreading centres'. They observe deformation, which they conclude to be the result of flexure of an elastic upper crust pulled downwards or pushed upwards along the rift axis by a driving force at depth. They propose that this flexure is caused by melt-induced episodic changes in mantle viscosity. In their model, a drop in melt fraction due to melt extraction raises the mantle viscosity and drives subsidence, whereas melt accumulation reduces viscosity and allows uplift. Oceanic crust is created by the extraction of molten rock from underlying mantle at the seafloor ‘spreading centres’ found between diverging tectonic plates. Modelling studies have suggested that mantle melting can occur through decompression as the mantle flows upwards beneath spreading centres1, but direct observation of this process is difficult beneath the oceans. Continental rifts, however—which are also associated with mantle melt production—are amenable to detailed measurements of their short-term kinematics using geodetic techniques. Here we show that such data can provide evidence for an upwelling mantle flow, as well as information on the dimensions and timescale of mantle melting. For North Island, New Zealand, around ten years of campaign and continuous GPS measurements in the continental rift system known as the Taupo volcanic zone reveal that it is extending at a rate of 6–15 millimetres per year. However, a roughly 70-kilometre-long segment of the rift axis is associated with strong horizontal contraction and rapid subsidence, and is flanked by regions of extension and uplift. These features fit a simple model that involves flexure of an elastic upper crust, which is pulled downwards or pushed upwards along the rift axis by a driving force located at a depth greater than 15 kilometres. We propose that flexure is caused by melt-induced episodic changes in the vertical flow forces that are generated by upwelling mantle beneath the rift axis, triggering a transient lower-crustal flow. A drop in the melt fraction owing to melt extraction raises the mantle flow viscosity and drives subsidence, whereas melt accumulation reduces viscosity and allows uplift—processes that are also likely to occur in oceanic spreading centres."

Fruit production was lower in the system without drainage, regardless of the N and K concentrations, compared to the recommended 10–20% drainage of the volume of nutrient solution applied. Higher K concentrations in the nutrient solution did not affect plant production in the system without drainage for the substrate with an initial K concentration of 331.3 mg L-1. Fruit yield was higher without drainage at a nutrient-solution N concentration of 10.7 mmol L-1. The upper EC limit of the substrate solution in the system without drainage was exceeded 181 days after planting.

Patients with ARDS and DAD have been reported to have a poorer prognosis than those without DAD. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival predictors in patients with ARDS and DAD. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all ARDS patients who underwent an open lung biopsy which showed evidence of DAD from January 2006 to June 2015 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, medication, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Results A total of 64 ARDS patients with DAD were eligible for analysis and divided into known etiology (n = 17, 26.6%) and unknown etiology groups (n = 47, 73.4%). There was no significant difference in hospital mortality rate between the two groups (71.9% vs. 70.6%, p = 0.890). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at the time of a diagnosis of ARDS, and SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and positive end expiratory pressure level when the biopsy was performed were associated with hospital mortality. Multivariate analysis showed that the SOFA score on the day of the biopsy was an independent predictor of hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.413, 95% confidence interval 1.127–1.772; p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in the use, dose, duration and timing from ARDS to glucocorticoid therapy between the survivors and nonsurvivors.

Methods Patients with T1D receiving insulin degludec underwent at-home CGM assessments. Indices for glycemic variability before and after breakfast included fasting glucose levels and the range of post-breakfast glucose elevation. For comparison, the patients were classified into those with NAH and those without. The optimal cut-off values for the relevant parameters were determined to predict NAH using ROC analysis. Results The study included a total of 31 patients (mean HbA1c values, 7.8 ± 0.7%), and 16 patients (52%) had NAH. Those with NAH had significantly lower fasting glucose levels than did those without (82 ± 48 mg/dL vs. 144 ± 69 mg/dL; P = 0.009). The change from pre- to post-breakfast glucose levels was significantly greater among those with NAH (postprandial 1-h, P = 0.028; postprandial 2-h, P = 0.028). The cut-off values for prediction of NAH were as follows: fasting glucose level <84 mg/dL (sensitivity 0.80/specificity 0.75/AUC 0.80; P = 0.004), 1-h postprandial elevation >69 mg/dL (0.75/0.67/0.73; P = 0.033), and 2-h postprandial elevation >99 mg/dL (0.69/0.67/0.71; P = 0.044). Conclusions The results suggest that fasting glucose level of < 84 mg/dL had approximately 80% probability of predicting the occurrence of NAH in T1D receiving insulin degludec. It was also shown that the occurrence of hypoglycemia led to greater post-breakfast glucose fluctuations and steeper post-breakfast glucose gradients."

The aim of this study is to compare unipolar voltage amplitudes (UnipV) with scar on delayed enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DE-CMR). Methods Heart failure patients who underwent DE-CMR and electro-anatomic mapping were included. Thirty-three endocardial mapped patients and 27 epicardial mapped patients were investigated. UnipV were computed peak-to-peak. Electrograms were matched with scar extent of the corresponding DE-CMR segment using a 16-segment/slice model. Non-scar was defined as 0% scar, while scar was defined as 1–100% scar extent. Results UnipVs were moderately lower in scar than in non-scar (endocardial 7.1 [4.6–10.6] vs. 10.3 [7.4–14.2] mV; epicardial 6.7 [3.6–10.5] vs. 7.8 [4.2–12.3] mV; both p<0.001). The correlation between UnipV and scar extent was moderate for endocardial (R = -0.33, p<0.001), and poor for epicardial measurements (R = -0.07, p<0.001). Endocardial UnipV predicted segments with >25%, >50% and >75% scar extent with AUCs of 0.72, 0.73 and 0.76, respectively, while epicardial UnipV were poor scar predictors, independent of scar burden (AUC = 0.47–0.56). UnipV in non-scar varied widely between patients (p<0.001) and were lower in scar compared to non-scar in only 9/22 (41%) endocardial mapped patients and 4/19 (21%) epicardial mapped patients with scar. Conclusion UnipV are slightly lower in scar compared to non-scar. However, significant UnipV differences between and within patients and large overlap between non-scar and scar limits the reliability of accurate scar assessment, especially in epicardial measurements and in segments with less than 75% scar extent."

https://openalex.org/W2733666736,"Two types of natural hybrids were discovered in populations of three Hexagrammos species (Teleostei: Hexagrammidae) distributed off the southern coast of Hokkaido in the North Pacific Ocean. Both hybrids reproduce by hybridogenesis, in which the maternal haploid genome is transmitted to offspring without recombination and the paternal haploid genome is eliminated during gametogenesis. While natural hybrids are unisexual and reproduce hemiclonally by backcrossing with the paternal species (BC-P), artificial F1-hybrids between the pure species produce recombinant gametes. Thus, despite having the same genome composition, the natural hybrids and the F1-hybrids are not genetically identical. Here, to clarify the differences between both hybrids, we examined the karyotypes of the three Hexagrammos species, their natural hybrids, the artificial F1-hybrids, and several backcrosses. Artificial F1-hybrids have karyotypes and chromosome numbers that are intermediate between those of the parental species. Conversely, the natural hybrids differed from F1-hybrids by having several large metacentric chromosomes and microchromosomes. Since the entire maternal haploid genome is inherited by the natural hybrids, maternal backcrosses (BC-M) between natural hybrids and males of the maternal species (H. octogrammus; Hoc) have a hemiclonal Hoc genome with large chromosomes from the mother and a normal Hoc genome from the father. However, the large chromosomes disappear in offspring of BC-M, probably due to fissuring during gametogenesis. Similarly, microsatellite DNA analysis revealed that chromosomes of BC-M undergo recombination. These findings suggest that genetic factors associated with hemiclonal reproduction may be located on the large metacentric chromosomes of natural hybrids."

In these studies, participants were asked to reach in darkness with their right hand to a proprioceptive target (tactile stimulation on the finger tip) while their gaze was varied. They either moved their left, stimulated hand towards a target location or kept it stationary at this location where they received a touch on the fingertip to which they reached with their right hand. When the stimulated hand was moved, reach errors varied as a function of gaze relative to target whereas reach errors were independent of gaze when the hand was kept stationary. The present study further examines whether (a) the availability of proprioceptive online information, i.e. reaching to an online versus a remembered target, (b) the time of the effector movement, i.e. before or after target presentation, or (c) the target distance from the body influences gaze-centered coding of proprioceptive reach targets. We found gaze-dependent reach errors in the conditions which included a movement of the stimulated hand irrespective of whether proprioceptive information was available online or remembered. This suggests that an effector movement leads to gaze-centered coding for both online and remembered proprioceptive reach targets. Moreover, moving the stimulated hand before or after target presentation did not affect gaze-dependent reach errors, thus, indicating a continuous spatial update of positional signals of the stimulated hand rather than the target location per se. However, reaching to a location close to the body rather than farther away (but still within reachable space) generally decreased the influence of a gaze-centered reference frame."
