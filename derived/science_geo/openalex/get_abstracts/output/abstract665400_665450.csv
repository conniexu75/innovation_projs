To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection, we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results, we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies, we propose that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication."
https://openalex.org/W3115676412,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly altered peoples’ daily lives, and it continues spreading as a crucial concern globally. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are related to individuals’ adherence to government measures. This study evaluated KAP toward COVID-19 among university students in Japan between May 22 and July 16, 2020, via an online questionnaire, and it further investigated the associated determining KAP factors. Among the eligible respondents (n = 362), 52.8% were female, 79.0% were undergraduate students, 32.9% were students whose major university subjects were biology-related, 35.4% were from the capital region, and 83.7% were Japanese. The overall KAP of university students in Japan was high. All respondents (100%) showed they possessed knowledge on avoiding enclosed spaces, crowded areas, and close situations. Most respondents showed a moderate or higher frequency of washing their hands or wearing masks (both at 96.4%). In addition, 68.5% of respondents showed a positive attitude toward early drug administration. In the logistic regressions, gender, major subjects, education level, nationality, residence, and psychological factors (private self-consciousness and extroversion) were associated with knowledge or attitudes toward COVD-19 (p &lt; 0.05). In the logistic and multiple linear regressions, capital regions, high basic knowledge, high information acquisition, correct information explanations contributed positively to preventative action (p &lt; 0.05). Non-capital regions, male gender, non-bio-backgrounds, high public self-consciousness, high advanced knowledge, incorrect information explanations, and high extroversion contributed negatively to self-restraint (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, self-restraint was decreasing over time. These findings clarify the Japanese university students’ KAP and the related factors in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they may help university managers, experts, and policymakers control the future spread of COVID-19 and other emerging infections."
https://openalex.org/W3111687703,"In mammalian animal models, high-resolution kinematic tracking is restricted to brief sessions in constrained environments, limiting our ability to probe naturalistic behaviors and their neural underpinnings. To address this, we developed CAPTURE (Continuous Appendicular and Postural Tracking Using Retroreflector Embedding), a behavioral monitoring system that combines motion capture and deep learning to continuously track the 3D kinematics of a rat's head, trunk, and limbs for week-long timescales in freely behaving animals. CAPTURE realizes 10- to 100-fold gains in precision and robustness compared with existing convolutional network approaches to behavioral tracking. We demonstrate CAPTURE's ability to comprehensively profile the kinematics and sequential organization of natural rodent behavior, its variation across individuals, and its perturbation by drugs and disease, including identifying perseverative grooming states in a rat model of fragile X syndrome. CAPTURE significantly expands the range of behaviors and contexts that can be quantitatively investigated, opening the door to a new understanding of natural behavior and its neural basis."

Megakaryocytes (MKs) are large (50–100 μm in diameter), rare (0.05%–0.1%), polyploid hematopoietic cells that, in adults, predominantly reside in the bone marrow (BM), where they are responsible for platelet production (Ebaugh and Bird, 1951Ebaugh Jr., F.G. Bird R.M. The normal megakaryocyte concentration in aspirated human bone marrow.Blood. 1951; 6: 75-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MKs are also involved in coagulation, homeostasis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and innate immunity (Cunin and Nigrovic, 2019Cunin P. Nigrovic P.A. Megakaryocytes as immune cells.J. Leukoc.

Along with their roles in the BM, recent studies have detected numerous MKs in the lungs that express multiple immune receptors and mediators, suggestive of important but undefined, functions (Lefrançais and Looney, 2019Lefrançais E.

Thus, the varied and critical roles of MKs call for a thorough understanding of their development, biology, and contribution to health and disease. Development of the human hematopoietic system begins early, from 3–4 weeks post-conception (WPC), and occurs at multiple sites in the embryo, including the yolk sac (YS), aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and the fetal liver (FL) (Ivanovs et al., 2017Ivanovs A.

So far, most of the studies of human hematopoietic development in vivo have focused on erythrocytes and progenitor cells (Emerson et al., 1989Emerson S.G. Thomas S. Ferrara J.L. Greenstein J.L.

With the advance of single-cell technologies, we and others have recently defined the transcriptomic features of multiple hematopoietic cells in human embryos, including HSCs, lymphoid progenitors, and macrophages (Bian et al., 2020Bian Z.

However, because of the extreme rarity of MKs in early development and the limited accessibility of human embryonic and fetal tissues, the process of megakaryopoiesis is relatively understudied. Early observations noted the presence of cells with MK morphology at multiple sites in developing human embryos (Allen Graeve and de Alarcon, 1989Allen Graeve J.L. de Alarcon P.A.

The Human yolk sac and yolk sac tumors. Springer, 1993Crossref Google Scholar). However, these cells differed markedly from their adult counterparts; for example, human FL MKs are smaller and less mature and have lower ploidy than adult BM MKs (Allen Graeve and de Alarcon, 1989Allen Graeve J.L. de Alarcon P.A.

At present, the molecular and cellular features of early MKs from human embryos remain unknown. Because of the scarcity of fetal tissues and the difficulty of isolating sufficient cells for analysis, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), have become an important tool for the study of early human development (Rossant and Tam, 2017Rossant J.

A variety of MK differentiation protocols have been established from hPSCs and are used to generate functional platelets (Borst et al., 2017Borst S. Sim X. Poncz M. French D.L. Gadue P.

Haemost. 2017; 15: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By applying these models, we and others have identified several key regulators of human megakaryopoiesis in vitro, including c-MYC, RUNX1, MEIS1, TAL1, GATA1, and FLI1 (Iizuka et al., 2015Iizuka H.

One aim of such studies is to facilitate generation of platelets from hPSC-derived MKs for clinical use. However, to date, producing platelets in this way is highly inefficient and results in poor-quality products, calling into question the extent to which the MK derivation protocols recapitulate key features of in vivo megakaryopoiesis. Without detailed knowledge of MK generation in human embryos, we cannot properly evaluate hPSC-based models. To fill these important gaps in our understanding of early human megakaryopoiesis, here we aimed to characterize the molecular characteristics, heterogeneity, and developmental trajectories of MKs in human embryos. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of cells from embryonic YS and FL, we identified several subpopulations of MKs with distinct patterns of gene expression that could potentially reflect early functional specification. We also found that the hESC-based differentiation model can simulate early human megakaryopoiesis, including emergence of a subpopulation of MKs expressing immune-related genes. Finally, we identified THBS1 expression as an early marker that can be used to identify MK precursor endothelial cells. To characterize primary MKs from healthy human embryos at the transcriptomic level, we performed droplet-based scRNA-seq (10X Genomics) using cells collected from two YS specimens at 4 WPC and two FL specimens at 8 WPC using different enrichment methods (Figures 1A and S1A; Table S1). From the YS samples, we captured 11,021 cells in total, enabling us to identify nine cell clusters defined by their expression of established marker genes: MKs, erythrocytes, MK-erythroid progenitors, two subpopulations of YS-derived myeloid-biased progenitors (Bian et al., 2020Bian Z. Gong Y. Huang T. Lee C.Z.W. Bian L. Bai Z. Shi H. Zeng Y. Liu C. He J. et al.Deciphering human macrophage development at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2020; 582: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), macrophages, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and mesenchymal cells (Figures 1B and S1B–S1D). In the MK population, we observed specific expression of genes encoding platelet factor 4 (PF4) and pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we detected specific expression of KLF1, GYPA, and ALAS2 in erythrocytes (Erys); GATA1, GATA2, and CD34 in MK-erythroid progenitor (MEPs); CD34 and SPINK2 in YS-derived myeloid-biased progenitors (YSMPs); C1QA and CD14 in macrophages (Macs); CDH5 in endothelial cells (ECs); EPCAM and AFP in epithelial cells (Epis); and ACTC1 in mesenchymal cells (Mes) (Figures 1C and S1E; Tables S2A and S3A). We also validated the identity of these cell clusters using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Figure S1F). In MKs, the major biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were enriched were related to “platelet activation” and “regulation of actin cytoskeleton,” consistent with their known functions (Figure 1D). Interestingly, within the MK population (defined by expression of the MK markers CD41a and CD42b), we observed two distinct morphologies: some MKs (16 of 29) possessed numerous cytoplasmic blebs, similar to the previously reported diploid platelet-forming cells in the mouse YS (Figures 1E and 1F, bottom; Potts et al., 2014Potts K.S. Sargeant T.J. Markham J.F. Shi W. Biben C. Josefsson E.C. Whitehead L.W. Rogers K.L. Liakhovitskaia A.

Mouse prenatal platelet-forming lineages share a core transcriptional program but divergent dependence on MPL.Blood. 2015; 126: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), implying that this type of MK might be in the process of producing platelets; in contrast, the remaining MKs (13 of 29) exhibited relatively “smooth” cell membranes (Figures 1E and 1F, top), perhaps indicative of a less mature or functionally distinct state. In addition, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated Erys and Macs exhibited the expected morphologies (Figures S1G–S1I). To closely examine the transcriptional landscape of the MK population from the YS, we next identified the top 10 most highly expressed transcription factors (TFs) and cell surface marker genes (Figure 1G). Among the top 10 TFs were several with established essential roles in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, such as NFE2, GFI1B, LYL1, GATA1, and MYLK (Chiu et al., 2019Chiu S.K. Orive S.L. Moon M.J.

We also discovered abundant expression of several genes with previously unrecognized roles in MKs, such as the TFs FHL2 and ELF1 and the cell surface markers RHAG and PTCRA (Figure 1G). Thus, MKs from the human YS abundantly express several canonical MK-related genes and potential novel regulators of human megakaryopoiesis that warrants further study. Because early megakaryopoiesis in mammals occurs in the YS and FL (Palis, 2016Palis J. Hematopoietic stem cell-independent hematopoiesis: emergence of erythroid, megakaryocyte, and myeloid potential in the mammalian embryo.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590: 3965-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we also collected cells from the FL at 8 WPC for comparative analysis (Figure 1A; Table S1). In total, we isolated 17,677 cells and identified 15 cell populations, including MKs, Erys, and Monocyte-Macs (Figures 2A and S2A–S2C), in keeping with a recent study of hematopoiesis in human FL (Popescu et al., 2019Popescu D.M. Botting R.A. Stephenson E. Green K. Webb S. Jardine L. Calderbank E.F. Polanski K. Goh I. Efremova M. et al.Decoding human fetal liver haematopoiesis.Nature. 2019; 574: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The expression of established markers in each cell population was clear (Figure 2B; Tables S2B and S3B); in MKs, we again saw specific PF4 and PPBP expression as well as enrichment of “platelet activation” and “coagulation” (Figures 2B and S2D). Morphologically, FACS-isolated MKs, Erys, and Macs from FL exhibited the expected phenotypes (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2E–S2G). Interestingly, we found that FL contained a significantly smaller proportion of haploid MKs and a significantly greater proportion of 8N or more polyploid MKs (around 15%) than the YS (around 1.7%) (Figure 2E). These findings are consistent with previous report in mice (Potts et al., 2015Potts K.S. Sargeant T.J. Dawson C.A. Josefsson E.C. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Taoudi S. Mouse prenatal platelet-forming lineages share a core transcriptional program but divergent dependence on MPL.Blood. 2015; 126: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To explore the potential differences between megakaryopoiesis in the YS and FL, we examined significantly differentially expressed genes among MKs from these two sources. We found that several glycolysis-associated genes, such as ENO1 and PKM, were expressed more highly in MKs from the YS than in those from the FL (Figure 2F; Table S3C). Consistent with these observations, we saw enrichment of “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” in MKs from the YS (Figure 2G). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) also revealed enrichment of the “glycolysis” pathway in MKs from the YS (Figure 2H). In contrast, consistent with the high proliferative activity of cells from the FL (Calvanese et al., 2019Calvanese V. Nguyen A.T. Bolan T.J. Vavilina A. Su T. Lee L.K. Wang Y. Lay F.D. Magnusson M.

In accordance with these observations, we detected higher expression of the cell cycle-related genes HMGB1, CDK1, and MKI67 in FL MKs compared with YS MKs (Figure 2F). Interestingly, although the β-globin-encoding gene HBB was specifically expressed in MKs from the FL, expression of HBE1, which encodes hemoglobin subunit epsilon 1, was higher in MKs from the YS (Figures 2F and S2H). “Leaky” expression of such typical erythroid genes has been reported previously in fetal MKs (Elagib et al., 2018Elagib K.E.

We found distinct features of MKs from human YS and from FL. We envision that the differentially expressed genes and distinct metabolic fingerprints and cell cycle signatures might be applied to distinguish megakaryopoiesis in these two sites and shed light on the functional development of MKs through embryogenesis. To further characterize cellular heterogeneity, we pooled all MKs from the YS and FL for detailed analysis. Six transcriptionally heterogeneous subpopulations of MKs were identified in the YS and FL (Figures 3A–3D and S3A; Table S2C). We then assessed the expression of marker genes in each subpopulation and characterized the gene sets enriched in the different MK clusters (Figures 3B and 3C; Table S3D). MK1 showed enrichment of GO terms related to glycolysis (Figure 3C), whereas MK2 exhibited enriched GO terms including “positive regulation of cell cycle” (Figures 3C and S3B). MK3 highly expressed genes associated with “blood coagulation” and might therefore represent a subset of MKs dedicated to early platelet production (Figure 3C). Indeed, the top 10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in the MK3 subpopulation included CCL5, which reportedly increases MK ploidy and subsequent proplatelet formation in a CCR5-dependent manner (Figure 3B; Machlus et al., 2016Machlus K.R.

The Swedish Fracture Register (SFR) is a national quality register collecting data prospectively on fractures, at the time of care-seeking. In the present study the incidence of all different fractures, regardless of location, in adults’ ≥ 16 years treated at the only care provider for patients with fractures within a catchment area of approximately 550,000 inhabitants, during 2015‒2018 are described. Age, gender, and fracture location (according to AO/OTA classification) was used for the analyses and presentation of fracture incidences. During the 4-year study period, 23,917 individuals sustained 27,169 fractures. The mean age at fracture was 57.9 years (range 16‒105 years) and 64.5% of the fractures occurred in women. The five most common fractures accounted for more than 50% of all fractures: distal radius, proximal femur, ankle, proximal humerus, and metacarpal fractures. Seven fracture incidence distribution groups were created based on age- and gender-specific incidence curves, providing visual and easily accessible information on fracture distribution. This paper reports on incidence of all fracture locations based on prospectively collected data in a quality register. The knowledge on fracture incidence related to age and gender may be of importance for the planning of orthopaedic care, involving both in- and out-patients as well as allocating surgical resources. Further, this might be useful for organizing preventive measures, especially in countries with similar socioeconomic structure and fracture burden."

https://openalex.org/W3111826110,"Single-cell transcriptomics has been widely applied to classify neurons in the mammalian brain, while systems neuroscience has historically analyzed the encoding properties of cortical neurons without considering cell types. Here we examine how specific transcriptomic types of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) projection neurons relate to axonal projections and encoding properties across multiple cognitive tasks. We found that most types projected to multiple targets, and most targets received projections from multiple types, except PFC→PAG (periaqueductal gray). By comparing Ca2+ activity of the molecularly homogeneous PFC→PAG type against two heterogeneous classes in several two-alternative choice tasks in freely moving mice, we found that all task-related signals assayed were qualitatively present in all examined classes. However, PAG-projecting neurons most potently encoded choice in cued tasks, whereas contralateral PFC-projecting neurons most potently encoded reward context in an uncued task. Thus, task signals are organized redundantly, but with clear quantitative biases across cells of specific molecular-anatomical characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3116091107,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected physical and mental health worldwide. Pregnant women already exhibit an elevated risk for depression compared to the general public, a pattern expected to be exacerbated by the pandemic. Certain lifestyle factors, including moderate exercise, may help support mental health during pregnancy, but it is unclear how the pandemic may impact these associations across different locations. Here, we test whether: (i) reported exercise routine alterations during the pandemic are associated with depression scores; and, (ii) the likelihood of reporting pandemic-related exercise changes varies between women living in metro areas and those in non-metro areas. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from the COVID-19 And Reproductive Effects (CARE) study, an online survey of pregnant women in the United States. Participants were recruited April-June 2020 (n = 1,856). Linear regression analyses assessed whether reported COVID-19-related exercise change was associated with depression score as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey. Logistic regression analyses tested whether a participant’s Rural-Urban Continuum Code classification of “metro” was linked with higher odds of reporting exercise changes compared to a “non-metro” classification. Results Women who reported exercise changes during the pandemic exhibited significantly higher depression scores compared to those reporting no changes. Moreover, individuals living in metro areas of all sizes were significantly more likely to report exercise changes compared to women living in non-metro areas. Conclusions These results suggest that the ability to maintain an exercise routine during the pandemic may help support maternal mental health. It may therefore be prudent for providers to explicitly ask patients how the pandemic has impacted their exercise routines and consider altered exercise routines a potential risk factor for depression. An effort should also be made to recommend exercises that are tailored to individual space restrictions and physical health."
https://openalex.org/W3111631684,"Recent fMRI experiments identified an attention-related region in the macaque temporal cortex, here called the floor of the superior temporal sulcus (fSTS), as the primary cortical target of superior colliculus (SC) activity. However, it remains unclear which aspects of attention are processed by fSTS neurons and how or why these might depend on SC activity. Here, we show that SC inactivation decreases attentional modulations in fSTS neurons by increasing their activity for ignored stimuli in addition to decreasing their activity for attended stimuli. Neurons in the fSTS also exhibit event-related activity during attention tasks linked to detection performance, and this link is eliminated during SC inactivation. Finally, fSTS neurons respond selectively to particular visual objects, and this selectivity is reduced markedly during SC inactivation. These diverse, high-level properties of fSTS neurons all involve visual signals that carry behavioral relevance. Their dependence on SC activity could reflect a circuit that prioritizes cortical processing of events detected subcortically."
https://openalex.org/W3113840428,"Objective Rapid testing is paramount during a pandemic to prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study investigates whether testing strategies based on sample pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods In a mathematical modelling approach conducted in May 2020, six different testing strategies were simulated based on key input parameters such as infection rate, test characteristics, population size, and testing capacity. The situations in five countries were simulated, reflecting a broad variety of population sizes and testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements were time and number of tests required, number of cases identified, and number of false positives. Findings The performance of all tested methods depends on the input parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen one tenth of each country’s population at an infection rate of 1%, realistic optimised testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy, and 10 in Germany. This is ca. eight times faster compared to individual testing. When infection rates are lower, or when employing an optimal, yet more complex pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also reduce the number of false positive diagnoses by a factor of up to 100. Conclusions The results of this study provide a rationale for adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of testing for SARS-CoV-2, hence saving time and resources compared with individual testing."

In order to characterize the volatile components in nine different aroma types of Fenghuang Dancong tea, the Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS) were employed. In addition, the similarity analysis and cluster analysis (CA) were performed to compare the aroma characteristics and establish the correlation between the nine types of teas. The principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) method were employed to determine the volatile components with a high contribution to the overall aroma of each type of tea. The results presented a total of 122 volatile aroma components including 24 kinds of alcohol, 23 kinds of esters, 15 kinds of olefins, 12 kinds of aldehydes, 12 kinds of ketones, 13 kinds of alkanes and 23 kinds of other components from the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Of these volatile aroma components, 22 types were common with linalool, dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide I, linalool oxide II, etc. The similarity of the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea was found between 46.79% and 95.94%. The CA indicated that the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea could be clustered into four categories when the ordinate distance reached to 10. The PCA demonstrated that decane, octadecane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, dehydrolinalool, geraniol and nerol were the important aroma components to Fenghuang Dancong Tea. OPLS-DA proved that 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, dehydrolinalool, phenylacetaldehyde, nerolidol, linalool oxide I and hexanal were the key differential compounds between the various types of tea samples. This study provides a theoretical basis for characterizing the volatile aroma components in the main types of Fenghuang Dancong tea as well as the similarity and correlation between various types of Fenghuang Dancong tea."
https://openalex.org/W3113364570,"Beck’s theory suggests that forming negative self-cognitions is a key early step in the development of depression. However, others have suggested the reverse, arguing that depression leads to development of negative self-beliefs. As such, there is debate about whether these cognitions are precursors to, or alternatively are caused by, depression. Although Beck’s theory is supported in older adolescents, it has not been clearly seen in younger adolescents. This study aimed to assess the relation between two major self-cognitions (self-esteem and self-criticism) and depressive symptoms in early adolescence. Two-hundred and forty-three Australian adolescents (mean age = 12.08, 52% female) completed measures of self-esteem, self-criticism and depressive symptoms at baseline, then approximately 12- and 24-months later. Growth-curve modelling was used to assess changes in the variables. Cross-lagged analysis assessed whether either of the self-cognition variables predicted depressive symptoms, or if depressive symptoms predicted self-cognitions. Results indicated that self-criticism and depressive symptoms increased over the time period, while self-esteem decreased, and these changes were all related. Self-esteem predicted depressive symptoms from Time 2 to Time 3, while depressive symptoms predicted self-esteem from Time 1 to Time 2. Self-criticism did not predict depressive symptoms, nor did depressive symptoms predict self-criticism. These links appeared largely independent of gender. Self-esteem and depressive symptoms during the early adolescent period thus appear to have a somewhat reciprocal relation, while self-criticism does not appear to predict the development of depression. As such, while low self-esteem does appear to have an important role of in the development of depression in this age group, it is not strictly predictive, nor is this effect seen across all negative self-cognitions."
https://openalex.org/W3113909660,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder that is often accompanied with many co-morbidities. Recent genetic studies have identified various pathways from hundreds of candidate risk genes with varying levels of association to ASD. However, it is unknown which pathways are specific to the core symptoms or which are shared by the co-morbidities. We hypothesised that critical ASD candidates should appear widely across different scoring systems, and that comorbidity pathways should be constituted by genes expressed in the relevant tissues. We analysed the Simons Foundation for Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database and four independently published scoring systems and identified 292 overlapping genes. We examined their mRNA expression using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and validated protein expression levels using the human protein atlas (HPA) dataset. This led to clustering of the overlapping ASD genes into 2 groups; one with 91 genes primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS geneset) and another with 201 genes expressed in both CNS and peripheral tissues (CNS+PT geneset). Bioinformatic analyses showed a high enrichment of CNS development and synaptic transmission in the CNS geneset, and an enrichment of synapse, chromatin remodelling, gene regulation and endocrine signalling in the CNS+PT geneset. Calcium signalling and the glutamatergic synapse were found to be highly interconnected among pathways in the combined geneset. Our analyses demonstrate that 2/3 of ASD genes are expressed beyond the brain, which may impact peripheral function and involve in ASD co-morbidities, and relevant pathways may be explored for the treatment of ASD co-morbidities."

Herein, we examined the effects of TSP1 on hypoxia-induced damages and wound-healing activity in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Exosomal protein expression was determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and HCE cell migration and motility were examined through wound-healing assay and time-lapse microscopy. Reestablishment of cell junctions by TSP1 was assessed through confocal microscopy and 3D image reconstruction. Our results show that CoCl2-induced hypoxia promoted HCE cell death by paraptosis. TSP1 protected these cells against paraptosis by attenuating mitochondrial membrane potential depletion, swelling and dilation of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and mitochondrial fission. Exosomes isolated from HCE cells treated with TSP1 contained wound healing-associated proteins that were taken up by HCE cells to promote tissue remodeling and repair. TSP1 protected HCE cells against hypoxia-induced damages and inhibited paraptosis progression by promoting cell migration, cell-cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These findings indicate that TSP1 ameliorates hypoxia-induced paraptosis in HCE cells and promotes wound healing and remodeling by regulating exosomal protein expression. TSP1 may, therefore, play important roles in the treatment of hypoxia-associated corneal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3116169620,"The hilly red soil region of southern China suffers from severe soil erosion that has led to soil degradation and loss of soil nutrients. Estimating the content and spatial variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) and assessing the influence of topography and land-use type on SOC and STN after years of soil erosion control are important for vegetation restoration and ecological reconstruction. A total of 375 topsoil samples were collected from Changting County, and their SOC and STN distributions were studied by using descriptive statistics and geostatistical methods. Elevation, slope, aspect and land-use type were selected to investigate the impacts of natural and human factors on the spatial heterogeneity of SOC and STN. The mean SOC and STN concentrations were 15.85 and 0.98 g kg -1 with moderate spatial variations, respectively. SOC and STN exhibited relatively uniform distributions that decreased gradually from the outside parts to the center of the study area. The SOC and STN contents in the study area were still at moderate and low levels after years of erosion control, which suggests that soil nutrient improvement is a slow process. The lowest SOC and STN values were at lower elevations in the center of Changting County. The results indicated that the SOC and STN contents increased most significantly with elevation and slope due to the influence of topography on the regional natural environment and soil erosion in the eroded hilly region. No significant variations were observed among different slope directions and land-use types."

Ultimately, the study group consisted of 18,144 children and adolescents aged 6.5–17.5 years. Body mass was measured on medical scales with an accuracy of ± 100 g and height measurement was taken using a height meter with an accuracy of ± 0.1 cm three times. Underweight, overweight and obesity were calculated according to WHO, IOTF and CDC BMI international references. There were differences in the incidence of underweight between the classifications: 16.8% according to IATF, 5.3% according to WHO and 9.9% according to CDC. There were also differences in the incidence of overweight and obesity between the classifications: 13% according to IOTF, 19.7% according to WHO and 14.1% according to CDC. In the CDC and WHO studies, a significantly higher prevalence of childhood obesity (4.0% and 4.7%, respectively) was observed compared with IOTF (2.1%). The prevalence of overweight and obesity in this study was higher among boys compared to girls.

https://openalex.org/W3114532591,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. AUD is associated with a variety of physiological changes and is a substantial risk factor for numerous diseases. We aimed to characterize systemic alterations in immune responses using a well-established mouse model of chronic intermittent alcohol exposure to induce alcohol dependence. We exposed mice to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor for 4 weeks and analyzed the expression of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17 by different immune cells in the blood, spleen and liver of alcohol dependent and non-dependent control mice through multiparametric flow cytometry. We found increases in IFN-γ and IL-17 expression in a cell type- and organ-specific manner. Often, B cells and neutrophils were primary contributors to increased IFN-γ and IL-17 levels while other cell types played a secondary role. We conclude that chronic alcohol exposure promotes systemic pro-inflammatory IFN-γ and IL-17 responses in mice. These responses are likely important in the development of alcohol-related diseases, but further characterization is necessary to understand the initiation and effects of systemic inflammatory responses to chronic alcohol exposure."

Multiple tests protocols have been authorized by the food and drugs administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization (EUA). The majority of these protocols are based on the gold-standard RT-qPCR test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is still a widespread lack of testing in the US and many of the clinical diagnostics protocols require extensive human labor and materials that could face supply shortages and present biosafety concerns. Given the need to develop alternative reagents and approaches to provide nucleic-acid testing in the face of heightened demand and potential shortages, we have developed a simplified SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol adapted for its use in research laboratories with minimal molecular biology equipment and expertise. The protocol utilizes TRIzol to purify the viral RNA from different types of clinical specimens, requires minimal BSL-1 precautions and, given its high sensitivity, can be easily adapted to pooling samples strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3117141050,"Youth who self-harm report high levels of trait impulsivity and identify impulsive behaviour as a proximal factor directly preceding a self-harm act. Yet, impulsivity is a multidimensional construct and distinct impulsivity-related facets relate differentially to self-harm outcomes. Studies have yet to examine if and how a multidimensional account of impulsivity is meaningful to individual experiences and understandings of self-harm in youth. We explored the salience and context of multidimensional impulsivity within narratives of self-harm, and specifically in relation to the short-term build-up to a self-harm episode. Fifteen community-based adolescents (aged 16–22 years) attending Further Education (FE) colleges in the UK took part in individual face-to-face sessions (involving exploratory card-sort tasks and semi-structured interviews) which explored factors relating to self-harm, impulsivity and the broader emotional, developmental and cognitive context. Session data were analysed thematically. Two overarching themes, and associated subthemes, were identified: ‘How I respond to strong negative emotions’; and ‘Impulse versus deliberation- How much I think through what I’m doing before I do it’. Self-harm was typically a quick, impulsive act in the context of overwhelming emotion, underpinned by cognitive processing deficits. The dynamic tension between emotion-based impulsivity and controlled deliberation was articulated in the immediate moments before self-harm. However, impulsive responses were perceived as modifiable. Where self-harm patterns were established, these related to habitual behaviour and quick go-to responses. Young people identified with a multidimensional conception of impulsivity and described the impulsive context of a self-harm act as dynamic, contextual, and developmentally charged. Findings have implications for youth-focused work. Card-task frameworks are recommended to scaffold and facilitate discussion with young people, particularly where topics are sensitive, complex and multifactorial."

https://openalex.org/W3115110558,"The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region has unique meteorological characteristics, with low air temperature, low air pressure, low humidity, little precipitation, and strong diurnal variation. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic CE-QUAL-W2 model was configured for the Pangduo Reservoir to better understand the thermal structure and diurnal variation inside the reservoir under the local climate and hydrological conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Observation data were used to verify the model, and the results showed that the average error of the 6 profile measured monthly from August to December 2016 was 0.1°C, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.173°C. The water temperature from August 2016 to September 2017 was simulated by inputting measured data as model inputs. The results revealed that the reservoir of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was a typical dimictic reservoir and the water mixed vertically at the end of March and the end of October. During the heating period, thermal stratification occurred, with strong diurnal variation in the epilimnion. The mean variance of the diurnal water temperature was 0.10 within a 5 m water depth but 0.04 in the whole water column. The mixing mode of inflow changed from undercurrent, horizontal-invaded flow and surface layer flow in one day. In winter, the diurnal variation was weak due to the thermal protection of the ice cover, while the mean variance of diurnal water temperature was 0.00 within both 5 m and the whole water column. Compared to reservoirs in areas with low altitude but the same latitude, significant differences occurred between the temperature structure of the low-altitude reservoir and the Pangduo Reservoir (P&lt;0.01). The Pangduo Reservoir presented a shorter stratification period and weaker stratification stability, and the annual average SI value was 26.4 kg/m 2 , which was only 7.5% that of the low-altitude reservoir. The seasonal changes in the net heat flux received by the surface layers determined the seasonal cycle of stratification and mixing in reservoirs. This study provided a scientific understanding of the thermal changes in stratified reservoirs under the special geographical and meteorological conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, this model can serve as a reference for adaptive management of similar dimictic reservoirs in cold and high-altitude areas."
https://openalex.org/W3117072689,"Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of cardiovascular risk factors, and its prevalence is becoming alarmingly high in Ethiopia. Studies uncovered as community pharmacy professionals (CPPs) have not yet well integrated into public health programs and priorities. In low income setting like Ethiopia, evidence regarding the roles CPPs in preventing and management of MetS is dearth. Objective The study was aimed to assess community pharmacy professionals’(CPPs) opinions about metabolic syndrome, describe their perception level towards the effectiveness of the main interventions and explore their extent of involvement in counseling patients with the metabolic syndrome in Gondar town, Northwestern Ethiopia. Method A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among pharmacists and druggists working in community medication retail outlets (CMROs) in Gondar town, northwestern Ethiopia from April 1 to May 31, 2019. Data were collected using a self-administered pre-tested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize different variables, and presented in tables and figure. An independent t-test and one way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) were used to compare mean scores. A 5% level of significance was used. Result Out of the 75 CPPs approached, 65(40 pharmacists and 25 druggists) completed the survey giving a response rate of 86.7%. Smoking cessation practice was identified to be low. There were a statistically significant difference (t = 2.144, P = 0.036) in the involvement towards counseling patients between CPPs who claimed to work in pharmacy (mean = 3.96 out of 5 points Likert scale) and drug stores (mean = 3.80 out of 5 points Likert scale). Conclusion The study concluded that the overall involvement of professionals in counseling patients, opinion about metabolic syndrome, and perception towards the effectiveness of the intervention was found to be more or less positive. However, the provision of services, such as monitoring therapy, selling equipment for home blood pressure and glucose monitoring and documenting patient care services needs to be encouraged. Given proper education and training, the current study hope that community pharmacists could be an important front-line contributors to contain this emerging epidemic in Gondar town as well as in the entire nation."
https://openalex.org/W3113471156,"Beta cell apoptosis induced by proinflammatory cytokines is one of the hallmarks of diabetes. Small molecules which can inhibit the cytokine-induced apoptosis could lead to new drug candidates that can be used in combination with existing therapeutic interventions against diabetes. The current study evaluated several effects of bergenin, an isocoumarin derivative, in beta cells in the presence of cytokines. These included (i) increase in beta cell viability (by measuring cellular ATP levels) (ii) suppression of beta cell apoptosis (by measuring caspase activity), (iii) improvement in beta cell function (by measuring glucose-stimulated insulin secretion), and (iv) improvement of beta cells mitochondrial physiological functions. The experiments were carried out using rat beta INS-1E cell line in the presence or absence of bergenin and a cocktail of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon- gamma) for 48 hr. Bergenin significantly inhibited beta cell apoptosis, as inferred from the reduction in the caspase-3 activity (IC 50 = 7.29 ± 2.45 μM), and concurrently increased cellular ATP Levels (EC 50 = 1.97 ± 0.47 μM). Bergenin also significantly enhanced insulin secretion (EC 50 = 6.73 ± 2.15 μM) in INS-1E cells, presumably because of the decreased nitric oxide production (IC 50 = 6.82 ± 2.83 μM). Bergenin restored mitochondrial membrane potential (EC 50 = 2.27 ± 0.83 μM), decreased ROS production (IC 50 = 14.63 ± 3.18 μM), and improved mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (EC 50 = 1.39 ± 0.62 μM). This study shows for the first time that bergenin protected beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis and restored insulin secretory function by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. To sum up, the above mentioned data highlight bergenin as a promising anti-apoptotic agent in the context of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3113755472,"Background Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the receptor that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses for entry into lung cells. Because ACE-2 may be modulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there is concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Aim This study sought to analyze the association of COVID-19 pneumonia with previous treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed 684 consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and tested by polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients were split into two groups, according to whether (group 1, n = 484) or not (group 2, n = 250) COVID-19 was confirmed. Multivariable adjusted comparisons included a propensity score analysis. Results The mean age was 63.6 ± 18.7 years, and 302 patients (44%) were female. Hypertension was present in 42.6% and 38.4% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.28). Treatment with ARBs was more frequent in group 1 than group 2 (20.7% vs. 12.0%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23–2.98; P = 0.004). No difference was found for treatment with ACEIs (12.7% vs. 15.7%, respectively; OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52–1.26; P = 0.35). Propensity score-matched multivariable logistic regression confirmed a significant association between COVID-19 and previous treatment with ARBs (adjusted OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.38–4.04; P = 0.002). Significant interaction between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of COVID-19 was observed in patients aged &gt; 60 years, women, and hypertensive patients. Conclusions This study suggests that ACEIs and ARBs are not similarly associated with COVID-19. In this retrospective series, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia more frequently had previous treatment with ARBs compared with patients without COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3117005408,"Only a handful of studies have leveraged agent-based models (ABMs) to examine public health outcomes and policy interventions associated with uneven urban food environments. While providing keen insights about the role of ABMs in studying urban food environments, these studies underutilize real-world data on individual behavior in their models. This study provides a unique contribution to the ABM and food access literature by utilizing survey data to develop an empirically-rich spatially-explicit ABM of food access. This model is used to simulate and scrutinize individual travel behavior associated with accessing food in low-income neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment in Detroit (Michigan), U.S. In particular, the relationship between trip frequencies, mode of travel, store choice, and distances traveled among individuals grouped into strata based on selected sociodemographic characteristics, including household income and age, is examined. Results reveal a diversified picture of not only how income and age shape food shopping travel but also the different thresholds of tolerance for non-motorized travel to stores. Younger and poorer population subgroups have a higher propensity to utilize non-motorized travel for shopping than older and wealthier subgroups. While all groups tend to travel considerable distances outside their immediate local food environment, different sociodemographic groups maintain unique spatial patterns of grocery-shopping behavior throughout the city and the suburbs. Overall, these results challenge foundational tenets in urban planning and design, regarding the specific characteristics necessary in the built environment to facilitate accessibility to urban amenities, such as grocery stores. In neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment, sociodemographic conditions play a more important role than the built environment in shaping food accessibility and ultimately travel behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3113792114,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a progressive disease that develops in a subset of patients who undergo surgery for retinal detachment repair, and results in significant vision loss. PVR is characterized by the migration of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells into the vitreous cavity, where they undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and form contractile membranes within the vitreous and along the retina, resulting in recurrent retinal detachments. Currently, surgical intervention is the only treatment for PVR and there are no pharmacological agents that effectively inhibit or prevent PVR formation. Here, we show that a single intravitreal injection of the polyether ionophore salinomycin (SNC) effectively inhibits the formation of PVR in a mouse model with no evidence of retinal toxicity. After 4 weeks, fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated development of mean PVR grade of 3.5 (SD: 1.3) in mouse eyes injected with RPE cells/DMSO (vehicle), compared to mean PVR grade of 1.6 (SD: 1.3) in eyes injected with RPE cells/SNC (p = 0.001). Additionally, immunohistochemistry analysis showed RPE cells/SNC treatment reduced both fibrotic (αSMA, FN1, Vim) and inflammatory (GFAP, CD3, CD20) markers compared to control RPE cells/DMSO treatment. Finally, qPCR analysis confirmed that Tgfβ , Tnfα , Mcp1 (inflammatory/cytokine markers), and Fn1 , Col1a1 and Acta2 (fibrotic markers) were significantly attenuated in the RPE cells/SNC group compared to RPE/DMSO control. These results suggest that SNC is a potential pharmacologic agent for the prevention of PVR in humans and warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3114635931,"Drug induced liver injury (DILI) and cell death can result from oxidative stress in hepatocytes. An initial pattern of centrilobular damage in the APAP model of DILI is amplified by communication from stressed cells and immune system activation. While hepatocyte proliferation counters cell loss, high doses are still lethal to the tissue. To understand the progression of disease from the initial damage to tissue recovery or death, we computationally model the competing biological processes of hepatocyte proliferation, necrosis and injury propagation. We parametrize timescales of proliferation ( α ), conversion of healthy to stressed cells ( β ) and further sensitization of stressed cells towards necrotic pathways ( γ ) and model them on a Cellular Automaton (CA) based grid of lattice sites. 1D simulations show that a small α / β (fast proliferation), combined with a large γ / β (slow death) have the lowest probabilities of tissue survival. At large α / β , tissue fate can be described by a critical γ / β* ratio alone; this value is dependent on the initial amount of damage and proportional to the tissue size N . Additionally, the 1D model predicts a minimum healthy population size below which damage is irreversible. Finally, we compare 1D and 2D phase spaces and discuss outcomes of bistability where either survival or death is possible, and of coexistence where simulated tissue never completely recovers or dies but persists as a mixture of healthy, stressed and necrotic cells. In conclusion, our model sheds light on the evolution of tissue damage or recovery and predicts potential for divergent fates given different rates of proliferation, necrosis, and injury propagation."
https://openalex.org/W3115461291,"Regional differences in socioeconomic factors are important for assessing the regional development of an area. While much research has focused on the overall patterns of regional differences within independent cities and areas, the hierarchical spatiotemporal structures of megacity regions have seldom been discussed. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the multilevel regional differences within megacity regions. Employing GDP, population and total retail sales as socioeconomic indicators, the spatiotemporal patterns of socioeconomic trends are identified. A hierarchical clustering approach that utilizes socioeconomic similarities is proposed for the identification of the spatiotemporal patterns of individual cities. At the megacity regional level, gravity centers and pathways are constructed to evaluate spatial imbalances and temporal change intensities. Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as its study area, this research produces results that show diverse spatiotemporal patterns among the individual cities, revealing high/low starting point and high/low growth rate modes in terms of city interactions. From the perspective of the entire GBA, the spatial imbalance of GDP is the highest of the factors, followed by the spatial imbalance of the total retail sales of the region and, finally, by that of its population. Total retail sales exhibit the highest level of temporal change intensity, followed by GDP and population. In terms of the contribution of the various cities to the overall regional changes, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong dominate the spatiotemporal changes in the gravity centers, while Foshan and Dongguan show significant potential to contribute to these socioeconomic patterns. These results provide effective guidance for the sustainable development of megacity regions."
https://openalex.org/W3117037317,"Background Few studies have explored evidence-based practice (EBP) knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of health professional graduates transitioning into the workforce. This study evaluated changes in these EBP domains in physiotherapists after one year of working. Method A mixed methods design was used. Participants completed two psychometrically-tested EBP questionnaires at two timepoints. The Evidence-Based Practice Profile questionnaire collected self-report EBP data (Terminology, Relevance, Confidence, Practice, Sympathy) and the Knowledge of Research Evidence Competencies collected objective data (Actual Knowledge). Changes were calculated using descriptive statistics (paired t-tests, 95% CI, effect sizes). Qualitative interview data collected at one timepoint were analysed using a descriptive approach and thematic analysis, to examine the lived experience of participants in the context of their first employment. The aim of the mixed methods approach was a broader and deeper understanding of participants’ first year of employment and using EBP. Results Data were analysed from 50 participants who completed both questionnaires at the two timepoints. After one year in the workforce, there was a significant decrease in participants’ perceptions of Relevance (p&lt;0.001) and Confidence with EBP (p&lt;0.001) and non-significant decreases in the other domains. Effect sizes showed medium decreases for Relevance (0.69) and Confidence (0.57), small decreases in Terminology (0.28) and Practice (0.23), and very small decreases in Sympathy (0.08) and Actual Knowledge (0.11). Seven themes described participants experience of using EBP in their first working year. Conclusions After a year in the workplace, confidence and perceptions of relevance of EBP were significantly reduced. A subtle interplay of features related to workplace culture, competing demands to develop clinical skills, internal and external motivators to use EBP and patient expectations, together with availability of resources and time, may impact early graduates’ perceptions of EBP. Workplace role models who immersed themselves in evidence discussion and experience were inspiring to early graduates."
https://openalex.org/W3117722479,"Introduction One argument for introducing research in bachelor`s degree in health care is to ensure the quality of future health care delivery. The requirements for research-based education have increased, and research on how research-based education is experienced is limited, especially in bachelor health care education programmes. The aim of this study was to explore how occupational therapy students and faculty members experienced and perceived research-based education. Methods This qualitative, interpretative description consisted of three focus group interviews with occupational therapy students in their final year (n = 8, 6 and 4), and three focus group interviews with faculty members affiliated with occupational therapy programmes in Norway (n = 5, 2 and 5). Interviewing both students and faculty members enabled us to explore the differences in their experiences and perceptions. Results Five integrative themes emerged from the analysis: “introducing research early”, “setting higher expectations”, “ensuring competence in research methods”, “having role models” and “providing future best practice”. Research was described as an important aspect of the occupational therapy bachelor program as it helps ensure that students achieve the necessary competence for offering future best practice. Students expressed a need to be introduced to research early in the program, and they preferred to have higher expectations regarding use of research. Competence in research methods and the importance of role models were also highlighted. Conclusions Undergraduate health care students are expected to be competent in using research. Findings from our study demonstrated that the participants perceived the use of research during training as important to ensure future best practice. Increasing the focus on research in the programme’s curricula and efforts to improve students’ formal training in research-specific skills could be a starting point towards increased use of research in the occupational therapy profession."
https://openalex.org/W3113673799,"Industrial-technological innovation (ITI) has become an important requirement for the sustainable development of China. ITI development requires a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic complexity associated with ITI systems. Previous research into ITI systems is based primarily on static methods that isolate system components, and ignore feedback on adjustments made. Based on systems thinking, this paper develop six archetypes (“Limit to Growth,” “Success to the Successful,” “Tragedy of the Commons,” “Fixes that Fail,” “Accidental Adversaries,” and “Shifting the Burden”) and an ITI system integration model. The model visualizes the ITI system as a whole and identifies bottlenecks that may affect ITI development. This conceptual model provides a more effective method of judgment, which can better explain the operational mechanism of the ITI system and improve the system’s operational characteristics. Finally, we evaluate the ITI system and propose that self-organization is a key lever of a systemic intervention framework for ITI."
https://openalex.org/W3113674118,"Backward-moving kinematic waves (KWs) (e.g., stop-and-go traffic conditions and a shock wave) cause unsafe driving conditions, decreases in the capacities of freeways, and increased travel time. In this paper, a sequential filtering method is proposed to detect KWs using data collected in a connected environment, which can aid in developing a traffic control strategy for connected vehicles to stop or dampen the propagation of these KWs. The proposed method filters out random fluctuation in the data using ensemble empirical mode decomposition that considers the spectral features of KWs. Then, the spatial movements of KWs are considered using cross-correlation to identify potential candidate KWs. Asynchronous changes in the denoised flow and speed are used to evaluate candidate KWs using logistic regression to identify the KWs from localized reductions in speed that are not propagated upstream. The findings from an empirical evaluation of the proposed method showed strong promise for detecting KWs using data in a connected environment, even at 30% of the market penetration rates. This paper also addresses how data resolution of the connected environment affects the performance in detecting KWs."
https://openalex.org/W3114333243,"Objective To determine the penetration of heated tobacco products (HTPs) into the youth market in Taiwan, with a particular focus on the correlation between IQOS use and the usage of other tobacco products. Methods Data from the 2018 Global Youth Tobacco Survey were used to assess previous experience with and current use (within 30 days prior to survey completion) of IQOS products by Taiwanese students aged 12–18 years. Independent variables included the usage patterns of conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. The control variables included background information (gender, grade, monthly income/allowance, household educational level, smoking status at home and among close friends), access to free cigarettes, as well as exposure to cigarette advertisements and anti-tobacco courses. Logistic regression was used to identify tobacco usage patterns correlated with IQOS use. Results In 2018, 2.33% of Taiwan’s adolescents were currently using IQOS and 4.17% had tried IQOS. The use of conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes (individually and together) were associated with an elevated risk of the ever use and current use of IQOS. Conclusion Despite the fact that HTP products are not sold legally in Taiwan, the use of IQOS products by young people is far from negligible. We recommend amending the “Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act” to include regulations pertaining to the sale and marketing of HTPs."
https://openalex.org/W3116716583,"Background Cambodia has been well recognized for its success in the fight against the HIV epidemic. However, challenges remain in eliminating HIV infections in key populations, including women working in entertainment establishments, such as massage parlors, karaoke bars, or beer gardens. This study explored the prevalence of HIV and identified factors associated with HIV infection among female entertainment workers (FEWs) in Cambodia. Methods This national biological and behavioral survey was conducted in 2016 in Phnom Penh and 17 provinces. We used a two-stage cluster sampling method to recruit FEWs for HIV testing performed on-site and face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. We investigated factors associated with HIV infection using multiple logistic regression. Results This study included 3149 FEWs with a mean age of 26.2 years (SD 5.7). The adjusted prevalence of HIV was 3.2% (95% CI 1.76–5.75). In the multiple logistic regression model, the odds of HIV infection were significantly higher among FEWs in the age group of 31 to 35 (AOR 2.72, 95% CI 1.36–8.25) and 36 or older (AOR 3.62, 95% CI 1.89–10.55); FEWs who were not married but living with a sexual partner (AOR 3.00, 95% CI 1.16–7.79); FEWs who had at least ten years of formal education (AOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17–0.83); FEWs who reported having abnormal vaginal discharge (AOR 3.51, 95% CI 1.12–9.01), genital ulcers or sores (AOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.09–3.17), and genital warts (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 1.44–6.33) in the past three months; and FEWs who reported using illicit drugs (AOR 3.28, 95% CI 1.20–4.27) than their respective reference group. The odds of HIV infection were significantly lower among FEWs working in karaoke bars (AOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14–0.50) and beer gardens (AOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09–0.54) than among freelance FEWs. Conclusions The prevalence of HIV among FEWs in Cambodia remains much higher than that in the general population. These findings indicate that differentiated strategies to address HIV and other sexually transmitted infections should be geared towards FEWs working as freelancers or in veiled entertainment venues such as massage parlors and freelance sex workers. Prevention efforts among venue-based FEWs should be sustained."

Here, we describe a robust platform to generate anti-IDs using rabbit single B cell sorting-culture and cloning technology by immunizing rabbits with therapeutic drug Fab fragment and sorting complementarity determining regions (CDRs) specific B cells using designed framework control as a negative gate to exclude non-CDRs-specific B cells. The supernatants of cultured B cells were subsequently screened for binding to drug-molecule by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the positive hits of B cell lysates were selected for cloning of their immunoglobulin G (IgG) variable regions. The recombinant monoclonal anti-IDs generated with this method have high affinity and specificity with broad epitope coverage and different types. The recombinant anti-IDs were available for assay development to support pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity studies within 12 weeks from the start of rabbit immunization. Using this novel rapid and efficient in-house approach we have generated a large panel of anti-IDs against a series of 11 therapeutic antibody drugs and successfully applied them to the clinical assay development."

https://openalex.org/W3117228015,"Recently, human asparagine synthetase has been found to be associated with the mitotic spindle. However, this event cannot be seen in yeast because yeast takes a different cell division process via closed mitosis (there is no nuclear envelope breakdown to allow the association between any cytosolic enzyme and mitotic spindle). To find out if yeast asparagine synthetase can also (but hiddenly) have this feature, the coding sequences of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) and nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) were introduced downstream of ASN1 and ASN2 , encoding asparagine synthetases Asn1p and Asn2p, respectively, in the yeast genome having mCherrry coding sequence downstream of TUB1 encoding alpha-tubulin, a building block of the mitotic spindle. The genomically engineered yeast strains showed co-localization of Asn1p-GFP-NLS (or Asn2p-GFP-NLS) and Tub1p-mCherry in dividing nuclei. In addition, an activity-disrupted mutation was introduced to ASN1 (or ASN2 ). The yeast mutants still exhibited co-localization between defective asparagine synthetase and mitotic spindle, indicating that the biochemical activity of asparagine synthetase is not required for its association with the mitotic spindle. Furthermore, nocodazole treatment was used to depolymerize the mitotic spindle, resulting in lack of association between the enzyme and the mitotic spindle. Although yeast cell division undergoes closed mitosis, preventing the association of its asparagine synthetase with the mitotic spindle, however, by using yeast constructs with re-localized Asn1/2p have suggested the moonlighting role of asparagine synthetase in cell division of higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W3117812348,"Background There are few data on the on the care experiences of pregnant women with rifampicin-resistant TB. Objective To describe the treatment journeys of pregnant women with RR-TB—including how their care experiences shape their identities—and identify areas in which tailored interventions are needed. Methods In this qualitative study in-depth interviews were conducted among a convenience sample from a population of pregnant women receiving treatment for RR-TB. This paper follows COREQ guidelines. A thematic network analysis using an inductive approach was performed to analyze the interview transcripts and notes. The analysis was iterative and a coding system developed which focused on the care experiences of the women and how these experiences affected their perceptions of themselves, their children, and the health care system in which treatment was received. Results Seventeen women were interviewed. The women described multiple challenges in their treatment journeys which required them to demonstrate sustained resilience (i.e. to “be brave”). Care experiences required them to negotiate seemingly contradictory identities as both new mothers—“givers of life”—and RR-TB patients facing a complicated and potentially deadly disease. In terms of their “pregnancy identity” and “RR-TB patient identity” that emerged as part of their care experiences, four key themes were identified that appeared to have elements that were contradictory to one another (contradictory areas). These included: 1) the experience of physical symptoms or changes; 2) the experience of the “mothering” and “patient” roles; 3) the experience of the care they received for their pregnancy and their RR-TB; and 4) the experience of community engagement. There were also three areas that overlapped with both roles and during which identity was negotiated/reinforced and they included: 1) faith; 2) socioeconomic issues; and 3) long-term concerns over the child’s health. At times, the health care system exacerbated these challenges as the women were not given the support they needed by health care providers who were ill-informed or angry and treated the women in a discriminatory fashion. Left to negotiate this confusing time period, the women turned to faith, their own mothers, and the fathers of their unborn children. Conclusion The care experiences of the women who participated in this study highlight several gaps in the current health care system that must be better addressed in both TB and perinatal services in order to improve the therapeutic journeys for pregnant women with RR-TB and their children. Suggestions for optimizing care include the provision of integrated services, including specialized counseling as well as training for health care providers; engagement of peer support networks; provision of socioeconomic support; long-term medical care/follow-up for children born to women who were treated for RR-TB; and inclusion of faith-based services in the provision of care."

We categorized infants by enrollment before or after the simultaneous April 2012 introduction of RV and PCV, and compared diagnoses of diarrhea and pneumonia (grade 3/4), hospitalizations, and deaths from both disease conditions through the 12-month study visit by vaccine era/status across two sites (a city and a village) by Kaplan-Meier estimates.Two thousand six hundred and thirty-five HEU infants were included in this secondary analysis, of these 1689 (64%) were enrolled in Gaborone (344 pre-vaccine, 1345 vaccine) and 946 (36%) in Molepolole (209 pre-vaccine, 737 vaccine). We observed substantial reduction in hazard of hospitalization or death for reason of diarrhea and pneumonia in the vaccine era versus the pre-vaccine era in Molepolole (hazard ratio, HR = 0.44, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.28, 0.71) with smaller reduction in Gaborone (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.57, 1.45). Similar downward trends were observed for diagnoses of diarrhea and pneumonia separately during the vaccine versus pre-vaccine era.Although temporal confounding cannot be excluded, significant declines in the burden of diarrheal and respiratory illness were observed among HEU children in Botswana following the introduction of RV and PCV. RV and PCV may maximally benefit HEU children in rural areas with higher disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W3113459319,"Background Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B remains a prominent cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Brazil. Because two novel protein-based vaccines against serogroup B are available, the main purpose of this study was to provide data on the diversity and distribution of meningococcal vaccine antigen types circulating in Brazil. Methodology Genetic lineages, vaccine antigen types, and allele types of antimicrobial-associated resistance genes based on whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 145 Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B invasive strains recovered in Brazil from 2016 to 2018 were collected. Results A total of 11 clonal complexes (ccs) were identified among the 145 isolates, four of which were predominant, namely, cc461, cc35, cc32, and cc213, accounting for 72.0% of isolates. The most prevalent fHbp peptides were 24 (subfamily A/variant 2), 47 (subfamily A/variant 3), 1 (subfamily B/variant 1) and 45 (subfamily A/variant 3), which were predominantly associated with cc35, cc461, cc32, and cc213, respectively. The NadA peptide was detected in only 26.2% of the isolates. The most frequent NadA peptide 1 was found almost exclusively in cc32. We found seven NHBA peptides that accounted for 74.5% of isolates, and the newly described peptide 1390 was the most prevalent peptide exclusively associated with cc461. Mutated penA alleles were detected in 56.5% of the isolates, whereas no rpoB and gyrA mutant alleles were found. Conclusion During the study period, changes in the clonal structure of circulating strains were observed, without a predominance of a single hyperinvasive lineage, indicating that an epidemiologic shift has occurred that led to a diversity of vaccine antigen types in recent years in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3114698010,"The bacterial strain PO100/5 was isolated from a skin abscess taken from a pig ( Sus scrofa domesticus ) in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal. It was identified as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis using biochemical tests, multiplex PCR and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis. After genome sequencing and rpoB phylogeny, the strain was classified as C . ulcerans . To better understand the taxonomy of this strain and improve identification methods, we compared strain PO100/5 to other publicly available genomes from C . diphtheriae group. Taxonomic analysis reclassified it and three others strains as the recently described C . silvaticum , which have been isolated from wild boar and roe deer in Germany and Austria. The results showed that PO100/5 is the first sequenced genome of a C . silvaticum strain from livestock and a different geographical region, has the unique sequence type ST709, and could be could produce the diphtheriae toxin, along with strain 05–13. Genomic analysis of PO100/5 showed four prophages, and eight conserved genomic islands in comparison to C . ulcerans . Pangenome analysis of 38 C . silvaticum and 76 C . ulcerans genomes suggested that C. silvaticum is a genetically homogeneous species, with 73.6% of its genes conserved and a pangenome near to be closed (α &gt; 0.952). There are 172 genes that are unique to C . silvaticum in comparison to C . ulcerans . Most of these conserved genes are related to nutrient uptake and metabolism, prophages or immunity against them, and could be genetic markers for species identification. Strains PO100/5 (livestock) and KL0182 T (wild boar) were predicted to be potential human pathogens. This information may be useful for identification and surveillance of this pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W3033375810,"Increasing availability and quality of actual, as opposed to scheduled, open transport data offers new possibilities for capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the railway and other networks of social infrastructure. One way to describe such complex phenomena is in terms of stochastic processes. At its core, a stochastic model is domain-agnostic and algorithms discussed here have been successfully used in other applications, including Google's PageRank citation ranking. Our key assumption is that train routes constitute meaningful sequences analogous to sentences of literary text. A corpus of routes is thus susceptible to the same analytic tool-set as a corpus of sentences. With our experiment in Switzerland, we introduce a method for building Markov Chains from aggregated daily streams of railway traffic data. The stationary distributions under normal and perturbed conditions are used to define systemic risk measures with non-evident,valuable information about railway infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W3113998108,"Introduction Delivering integrated sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS) in emergencies is important in order to save lives of the most vulnerable as well as to combat poverty, reduce inequities and social injustice. More than 60% of preventable maternal deaths occur in conflict areas and especially among the internally displaced persons (IDP). Between 2016 and 2018, unprecedented violence erupted in the Kasaï’s region, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), called the Kamuina Nsapu Insurgency. During that period, an estimated three million of adolescent girls and women were forced to flee; and have faced growing threat to their health, safety, security, and well-being including significant sexual and reproductive health challenges. Between August 2016 and May 2017, the “Sous-Cluster sur les violences basées sur le genre (SC-VBG)” in DRC (2017) reported 1,429 Gender Based Violence (GBV) incidents in the 49 service delivery points in the provinces of Kasaï, Kasaï Central and Kasaï Oriental. Rape cases represented 79% of reported incidents whereas sexual assault and forced marriage accounted for respectively 11% and 4% of Gender Based Violence (GBV) among women and adolescent girls. This study aims to assess the availability of SRHS in the displaced camps in Kasaï; to evaluate the SRHS needs of young girls and women in the reproductive age (12–49). Studies of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have often included adolescent girls under the age of 15 because of high prevalence of child marriage and early onset of childbearing, especially in the humanitarian context. According to the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), about 16% of surveyed women got married by age 14 while the prevalence of early child marriage (marriage by 15) was estimated at 30%; to assess the use of SRHS services and identify barriers as well as challenges for SRH service delivery and use. Findings from this study will help provide evidence to inform towards more needs-based and responsive SRH service delivery. This is hoped for ultimately improve the quality and effectiveness of services, when considering service delivery and response in humanitarian settings. Data and methods We will conduct a mixed-methods study design, which will combine quantitative and qualitative approaches. Based on the estimation of the sample size, quantitative data will be drawn from the community-based survey (500 women of reproductive age per site) and health facility assessments will include assessments of 45 health facilities and 135 health providers’ interviews. Qualitative data will comprise materials from 30 Key Informant Interviews (KII) and 24 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), which are believed to achieve the needed saturation levels. Data analysis will include thematic and content analysis for the KIIs and FGDs using ATLAS.ti software for the qualitative arm. For the quantitative arm, data analysis will combine frequency and bivariate chi-square analysis, coupled with multi-level regression models, using Stata 15 software. Statistic differences will be established at the significance level of 0.05. We submitted this protocol to the national ethical committee of the ministry of health in September 2019 and it was approved in January 2020. It needs further approval from the Scientific Oversee Committee (SOC) and the Provincial Ministry of Health. Prior to data collection, informed consents will be obtained from all respondents."
https://openalex.org/W3114788951,"Background Cetuximab improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with KRAS wild type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Few data are available on factors impacting both efficacy and compliance to cetuximab treatment, which is, in combination with chemotherapy, a standard-of-care first-line treatment regimen for patients with KRAS wt mCRC. Patients and methods PREMIUM is a prospective, French multicenter, observational study that recruited patients with KRAS wt mCRC scheduled to receive cetuximab, with or without first-line chemotherapy, as part of routine clinical practice, between October 28, 2009 and April 5, 2012 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01756625). The main endpoints were the factors impacting on efficacy and compliance to cetuximab treatment. Predefined efficacy endpoints were PFS and safety. Results A total of 493 patients were recruited by 94 physicians. Median follow-up was 12.9 months. Median progression-free survival was 11 months [9.6–12]. In univariate analyses, ECOG performance status (PS), smoking status, primary tumor location, number of metastatic organs, metastasis resectability, surgery, folliculitis, xerosis and paronychia maximum grade, and acne preventive treatment were statistically significant. In multivariate analysis (Hazard Ratios of multivariate stepwise Cox models), ECOG PS, surgery, xerosis and folliculitis were positive prognostics factors for longer PFS. Among all patients, 69 (14%) were non-compliant. In multivariate analysis, no variables were statistically significant. The safety profile of cetuximab was consistent with previous studies. Conclusions ECOG PS &lt;2, surgical treatment performed, and maximum grade xerosis or folliculitis developed were predictive factors of cetuximab efficacy on KRAS wt mCRC patients. Unfortunately, we failed in identifying predictive factors for compliance in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3116938380,"Creating a complete picture of the regulation of transcription seems to be an urgent task of modern biology. Regulation of transcription is a complex process carried out by transcription factors (TFs) and auxiliary proteins. Over the past decade, ChIP-Seq has become the most common experimental technology studying genome-wide interactions between TFs and DNA. We assessed the transcriptional significance of cell line-specific features using regression analysis of ChIP-Seq datasets from the GTRD database and transcriptional start site (TSS) activities from the FANTOM5 expression atlas. For this purpose, we initially generated a large number of features that were defined as the presence or absence of TFs in different promoter regions around TSSs. Using feature selection and regression analysis, we identified sets of the most important TFs that affect expression activity of TSSs in human cell lines such as HepG2, K562 and HEK293. We demonstrated that some TFs can be classified as repressors and activators depending on their location relative to TSS."
