https://openalex.org/W2071342308,"Resonant ion-dip infrared spectroscopy has been used to record size-specific infrared spectra of C(6)H(6)-(H(2)O)n clusters with n = 1 through 7 in the O-H stretch region. The O-H stretch spectra show a dramatic dependence on cluster size. For the n = 3 to 5 clusters, the transitions can be divided into three types-attributable to free, pi hydrogen-bonded, and single donor water-water O-H stretches-consistent with a C(6)H(6)-(H(2)O)n structure in which benzene is on the surface of a cyclic (H(2)O)n cluster. In n = 6 and 7 clusters, the spectra show distinct new transitions in the 3500 to 3600 wave number region. After comparison of these results with the predictions of ab initio calculations on (H(2)O)n clusters, these new transitions have been assigned to double donor O-H stretches associated with the formation of a more compact, noncyclic structure beginning with (H(2)O)(6). This is the same size cluster for which ab initio calculations predict that a changeover to noncyclic (H(2)O)n structures will occur."

Nevertheless, greater amounts of algae accumulate in UVR-exposed habitats than in UVR-protected environments. Near-ultraviolet (UVA wavelengths of 320 to 400 nanometers) and mid-ultraviolet (UVB, wavelengths of 280 to 320 nanometers) radiation also inhibit algal consumers (Diptera: Chironomidae). Larval chironomids are more sensitive to UVB than sympatric algae. Differential sensitivity to UVB between algae and herbivores contributes to counterintuitive increases in algae in habitats exposed to UVB. These mesocosm experiments illustrate that predictions of the response of entire ecosystems to elevated UVB cannot be made on single trophic-level assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2034196372,"Ion microprobe studies of hydrous amphibole, biotite, and apatite in shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite (SNC) meteorites, probable igneous rocks from Mars, indicate high deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratios relative to terrestrial values. The amphiboles contain roughly one-tentn as much water as expected, suggesting that SNC magmas were less hydrous than previously proposed. The high but variable D/H values of these minerals are best explained by postcrystallization D enrichment of initially D-poor phases by martian crustal fluids with near atmospheric D/H (about five times the terrestrial value). These igneous phases do not directly reflect the D/H ratios of martian ""magmatic"" water but provide evidence for a D-enriched martian crustal water reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W2004040934,"Pseudotachylytes are typically interpreted to have formed by frictional melting during coseismic faulting within the upper to middle crust. Pseudotachylytes in the Bergen arcs of western Norway contain microlites including omphacite, garnet, plagioclase, and quartz. This eclogite facies assemblage is stable at temperatures of about 800 degrees C and pressures of 18 to 19 kilobars, corresponding to depths of 60 kilometers or more. The pseudotachylytes are exposed in Grenvillian granulites that locally underwent fluid-induced eclogitization and corresponding volume reduction of approximately 10 percent during the Caledonian continental collision. The pseudotachylytes may have formed as a result of the rapid relaxation of stresses caused by the eclogitization process."
https://openalex.org/W2014272490,"Optical spectroscopy of single impurity molecules in solids can be used as an exquisitely sensitive probe of the structure and dynamics of the specific local environment around the single molecule (the ""nanoenvironment""). Recently observed effects such as spectral diffusion, perturbations by external fields, changes in molecular photophysics, shifts in vibrational modes, optical modification of the absorption spectrum, dynamics due to amorphous system physics, and magnetic resonance of a single molecular spin attest to the vitality of and growing interest in this new field, which may lead to optical storage on the single-molecule level."

https://openalex.org/W2095502029,"Elemental carbon can be synthesized in a variety of geometrical forms, from three-dimensional extended structures (diamond) to finite molecules (C60 fullerite). Results are presented here on the magnetic susceptibility of the least well-understood members of this family, nanotubes and C60 fullerite. (i) Nanotubes represent the cylindrical form of carbon, intermediate between graphite and fullerite. They are found to have significantly larger orientation-averaged susceptibility, on a per carbon basis, than any other form of elemental carbon. This susceptibility implies an average band structure among nanotubes similar to that of graphite. (ii) High-resolution magnetic susceptibility data on C60 fullerite near the molecular orientational-ordering transition at 259 K show a sharp jump corresponding to 2.5 centimeter-gram-second parts per million per mole of C60. This jump directly demonstrates the effect of an intermolecular cooperative transition on an intramolecular electronic property, where the susceptibility jump may be ascribed to a change in the shape of the molecule due to lattice forces."
https://openalex.org/W2012564583,"Seismological results on the structure of the upper mantle below Europe reveal a marked contrast in seismic properties between Precambrian and younger parts of Europe. The Precambrian craton in eastern Europe is characterized by high shear-wave velocities, which can be explained by low temperatures. The transition to low seismic velocities below Phanerozoic Europe coincides with the crustal boundary zone of the craton and exists to depths of at least 140 kilometers. Despite the long and complex tectonic history of the plate boundary zone, the transition is remarkably sharp, which rules out any significant lateral transport of asthenospheric material across the suture zone."
https://openalex.org/W2055541758,"Magnetoreception by honeybees (Apis mellifera) is demonstrated by such activities as comb building and homing orientation, which are affected by the geomagnetic field. In other magnetoreceptive species, iron oxide crystals in the form of magnetite have been shown to be necessary for primary detection of magnetic fields. Here it is shown that trophocytes, which are apparently the only iron granule-containing cells in honeybees, contain super-paramagnetic magnetite. These cells are innervated by the nervous system, which suggests that trophocytes might be primarily responsible for magnetoreception. Electron microscopy also shows cytoskeletal attachments to the iron granule membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1991309195,"Water viscosity is inversely related to temperature. This simple physical relation couples two potential influences on organism performance. Seawater viscosity was manipulated, with and without temperature, to distinguish the physiological and mechanical effects of temperature on suspension feeding by ciliated echinoderm larvae. Change in viscosity alone accounted for half of the decline in the feeding rate at lower temperature. High viscosity shifted ingestion toward larger particles, which suggests that viscosity affects particle capture as well as rates of water processing. Temperature-induced change in viscosity, therefore, impacts suspension feeding independently of physiology and has implications for many small-scale biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2042633130,"Simultaneous advances in experimental and theoretical methods are providing new insights into the intermolecular interactions that control the dissolution of chemicals in water. Progress in theoretical methods and computer technology has greatly extended the range of computational techniques for modeling molecular clusters. Although water clusters have long been the subject of theoretical studies, only recently has it become feasible to perform accurate computational studies on water clusters and molecule-water clusters with more than two water molecules. On the experimental side, clusters of water molecules, and of water molecules with another chemical species, can now be constructed one molecule at a time. The properties of these unique [open quotes]aqueous solutions[close quotes] can be measured spectroscopically and form a rich test bed for guiding the development of detailed molecular descriptions of solvation. This article describes experiments being performed to elucidate the structure of water clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2042209913,"The electron-doped material Nd2-xCexCuO(4) becomes superconducting with a Ce(4+) composition around 0.16, but only after removal of a minuscule amount of extraneous oxygen. This enigmatic behavior was addressed here. A small fraction of copper in the CuO(2) planes of Nd2-xCexCuO(4) was substituted by cobalt-57, which serves as a microprobe of the chemical environment. Deoxygenation brought about little change in the MÃ¶ssbauer spectra both above and below the optimal superconducting concentration; however, for x = 0.16 a change was observed. In the latter, a major fraction of the magnetically split, five-coordinate species showed itself as a paramagnetically relaxed doublet upon deoxygenation. The abundance of the paramagnetically relaxed species corresponds closely to the diamagnetic volume fraction and thus provides a microscopic signature of the superconducting phase."
