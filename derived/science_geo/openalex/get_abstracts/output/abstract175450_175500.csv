https://openalex.org/W3125167984,"Recent advances in the precise control of ultracold atomic systems have led to the realisation of Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) and degenerate Fermi gases. An important challenge is to extend this level of control to more complicated molecular systems. One route for producing ultracold molecules is to form them from the atoms in a BEC. For example, a two-photon stimulated Raman transition in a (87)Rb BEC has been used to produce (87)Rb(2) molecules in a single rotational-vibrational state, and ultracold molecules have also been formed through photoassociation of a sodium BEC. Although the coherence properties of such systems have not hitherto been probed, the prospect of creating a superposition of atomic and molecular condensates has initiated much theoretical work. Here we make use of a time-varying magnetic field near a Feshbach resonance to produce coherent coupling between atoms and molecules in a (85)Rb BEC. A mixture of atomic and molecular states is created and probed by sudden changes in the magnetic field, which lead to oscillations in the number of atoms that remain in the condensate. The oscillation frequency, measured over a large range of magnetic fields, is in excellent agreement with the theoretical molecular binding energy, indicating that we have created a quantum superposition of atoms and diatomic molecules two chemically different species."

The mechanism by which ethanol causes fatty liver and liver injury is complex. We found that in both rat H4IIEC3 and McA-RH7777 hepatoma cell lines, ethanol induced transcription of a sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-regulated promoter via increased levels of mature SREBP-1 protein. This effect of ethanol was blocked by addition of sterols. This effect is likely mediated by acetaldehyde, because the effect was only seen in cell lines expressing alcohol dehydrogenase, and inhibition of ethanol oxidation by 4-methylpyrazole blocked the effect in the hepatoma cells. Furthermore, the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide enhanced the effect of ethanol in the hepatoma cells. Consistent with these in vitro findings, feeding mice a low fat diet with ethanol for 4 weeks resulted in a significant increase in steady-state levels of the mature (active) form of SREBP-1. Activation of SREBP-1 by ethanol feeding was associated with increased expression of hepatic lipogenic genes as well as the accumulation of triglyceride in the livers. These finding suggest that metabolism of ethanol increased hepatic lipogenesis by activating SREBP-1 and that this effect of ethanol may contribute to the development of alcoholic fatty liver.

Zakim D. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology: A Textbook of Liver Disease. 3rd. Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 911-913Google Scholar). Although previously considered to be a benign consequence of alcohol use, it is now known that fatty livers are unusually susceptible to the effects of endotoxin, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis and fibrosis (2Yang S.Q.

Furthermore, obesity, a well-known factor predisposing to fatty liver, has also been noted to be an independent risk factor for the development of cirrhosis in alcoholics (5Naveau S. Giraud V. Borotto E. Aubert A. Capron F. Chaput J.C. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In addition, fatty liver occurring in the absence of significant alcohol consumption may be associated with inflammation and fibrosis, a condition designated non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (6Teli M.R. James O.F. Burt A.D. Bennett M.K. Day C.P. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is increased interest in understanding the pathogenesis of fatty liver, with the hope that effective therapies against alcohol-induced liver injury might be targeted against the factors that maintain the steatosis. The mechanisms by which ethanol causes fatty liver appear to be complex. Historically, the main mechanism proposed was that reducing equivalents (NADH) generated during ethanol oxidation inhibit the NAD+-requiring steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and β-oxidation and, thereby, inhibit fatty acid oxidation (7Crabb D.W. . 1993; 11: 207-230Google Scholar, 8Grunnet N. Kondrup J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1986; 10: 64S-68SCrossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it was reported that, although the reductive stress on the liver abates over time in the ethanol-fed baboon model (reflected by a normalization of the ratio of lactate to pyruvate in the hepatic venous blood), fatty infiltration persists (9Salaspuro M.P. Shaw S. Jayatilleke E. Ross W.A. Lieber C.S. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Alternative explanations for the persistence of fatty liver include inhibition of lipoprotein export (possibly via formation of acetaldehyde protein adducts with tubulin) and oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation (10Grunnet N. Kondrup J. Dich J. Alcohol Alcohol. 1987; 1: 257-261Google Scholar, 11Reinke L.A. Lai E.K. DuBose C.M. McCay P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 1996; 20: 77A-85ACrossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although these mechanisms may contribute to the development of fatty liver, additional regulatory systems for fat metabolism have recently been elucidated, and may represent targets for ethanol toxicity. For example, we have demonstrated that ethanol blocks the ability of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α to activate transcription, in part due to impairment of its ability to bind target DNA sequences (13Galli A. Pinaire J. Fischer M. Dorris R. Crabb D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 68-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Crabb D.W. Keio. J. Med. 1999; 48: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α is a fatty acid receptor that coordinates a number of metabolic pathways that may serve to dispose of excess fatty acids (e.g. by inducing fatty acid oxidizing systems in the mitochondrion and peroxisomes, fatty acid transporters, and binding proteins as well as several apolipoproteins) (15Gearing K.L. Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Banner C.D. Tollet P. Stromstedt M. Rafter J.J. Berge R.K. Gustafsson J.A. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1284S-1288SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional mechanism that may underlie the development of alcoholic fatty liver is enhanced lipogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that a significant increase in hepatic lipogenesis occurs in chronically ethanol-treated animals (16Lieber C.S. Spritz N. DeCarli L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Carrasco M.P. Marco C. Segovia J.L. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Muramatsu M. Kuriyama K. Yuki T. Ohkuma S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 31: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and is associated with a significant increase of the activities of hepaticl-α-glycerophosphate acyltransferase, fatty acid synthase (FAS),1 and malic enzyme (ME) (18Muramatsu M. Kuriyama K. Yuki T. Ohkuma S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 31: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Joly J.G. Feinman L. Ishii H. Lieber C.S. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 337-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A study using KK-Ay mice, a model for obesity and overt diabetes, indicated that acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), ATP citrate lyase (ACL), ME, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were markedly increased following administration of ethanol (20Arakawa M. Taketomi S. Furuno K. Matsuo T. Iwatsuka H. J. Nutr. 1975; 105: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Others reported that the mRNA for the low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase was significantly increased in ethanol-fed rats (21Seitz H.K. Kuhn B. von Hodenberg E. Fiehn W. Conradt C. Simanowski U.A. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 487-493PubMed Google Scholar). Increased fatty acid synthesis could even be observed in non-hepatic cells overexpressing ADH and exposed to ethanol (22Galli A. Price D. Crabb D. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that the hepatic lipogenic pathway is activated after consumption of a mere 24 g of ethanol per day in humans (23Siler S.Q. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 70: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The battery of enzymes and proteins reported to be induced in liver by ethanol feeding are a subset of those regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2). SREBPs are synthesized as precursors (∼125 kDa) bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Upon activation, SREBPs are released from the membrane into the nucleus as a mature protein (∼ 68 kDa) by a sequential two-step cleavage process (24Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). A key role of SREBPs in regulating fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in liver was suggested by studies of transgenic mice overexpressing the constitutively active mature forms of SREBPs (25Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 26Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transgenic mouse studies have suggested that, broadly speaking, SREBP-1 plays an active role in regulating the transcription of genes involved in hepatic triglyceride synthesis (including ACC, FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD), ACL, ME, and l-α-glycerophosphate acyltransferase), whereas SREBP-2 is more involved in regulation of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (such as the low density lipoprotein receptor, HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, and squalene synthase). The livers from mice overexpressing SREBP-1 have massive fatty livers due to increased accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides (25Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). More interestingly, studies have shown that increased hepatic levels of nuclear SREBP-1c contribute to the development of fatty liver in two mouse models of diabetes (27Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Despite the overlap between genes induced by ethanol feeding and those regulated by SREBPs, there have been no studies that examine the effect of ethanol on SREBP activity. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of ethanol on the SREBP activation and transcriptional function in cultured hepatoma cells as well as in mice fed ethanol-containing diets. Most chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Trypsin and tissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. Delipidated fetal bovine serum was purchased from Sigma. CV-1 (African green monkey kidney) and rat hepatoma (H4IIEC3 and McA-RH7777) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol were obtained from Sigma. All radioisotopes were purchase from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The pSyn SRE plasmid, containing a generic TATA and three SRE elements (representing those found at −325 to −225 bp of the hamster HMG-CoA synthase promoter fused into the luciferase pGL2 Basic vector), was a kind gift of Dr. Timothy F. Osborne (University of California, Irvine, CA). The JS-15 plasmid (identical to pSyn SRE, except for a double-point mutation resulting in loss of sterol-regulated transcription) was a kind gift of Dr. Richard J. Deckelbaum (Columbia University, New York, NY). The cDNA probes for SREBP-1, FAS, SCD, ACL, ME, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were kind gifts of Dr. Jay D. Horton (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). All cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 63 μg/ml penicillin G. On the day for transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and switched to MEM supplemented 10% delipidated FBS serum. Ten μg of the reporter plasmid and 5 μg of pSV2CAT (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Four hours later the cells were exposed to PBS containing 15% glycerol for 3 min. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS, and fresh medium was added. When ethanol was present, the cells were incubated in a chamber containing a beaker of 1 liter of water containing ethanol at the same concentration to reduce the loss of ethanol from the cultures due to evaporation. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 150 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. Fifty microliters of cell extracts was incubated with luciferase assay reagent based on the original protocol of de Wet et al. (28de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured as described previously (29Crabb D.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear protein extracts from cells or animal livers were prepared as described previously (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar, 31Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Measurement of SREBP protein was performed using 100 μg of crude cell or liver nuclear protein, separated by electrophoresis in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were visualized using antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Detection of the protein bands was performed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL kit. Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver using an RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen Inc.). Equal aliquots of total RNA (40 μg) from each mouse liver was denatured with formaldehyde and formamide, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for hybridization. The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were hybridized with the indicated32P-labeled probes (∼1 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 h at 65 °C using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences), washed with 0.1% (w/v) SDS/0.1× SSC at 70 °C for 60 min, and exposed at −80 °C to Reflection NFE496 film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc.) with intensifying screens for 3–36 h at room temperature. The resulting bands were quantified by exposure of the filter to a PhosphorImager screen, and the results were normalized to the signal generated from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Mouse livers were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer. Lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v), evaporated under dry nitrogen, and dissolved in 5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin. Protein was assayed using a Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Colorimetric cholesterol and triglyceride assays were carried out using the Sigma Diagnostics Cholesterol and Triglyceride Reagents (Sigma Chemical Co.). 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed individually in a room with controlled temperature (20–22 °C), humidity (55–65%), and lighting (on at 6 a.m. and off at 6 p.m.). For animals on an ethanol-containing diet, animal cages were placed on heating pads to maintain body temperature because ethanol consumption can induce hypothermia. Liquid diets provide 1 kcal/ml (prepared by Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) and were based upon the Lieber-DeCarli formulation (32Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. Sorrell M.F. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Protein content was constant at 18% of calories, and each diet had identical mineral and vitamin content. The animals were divided into two dietary groups: (a) control diet (fat comprising 10% of total calories, 6% from cocoa butter, and 4% from safflower oil, 72% of calories as carbohydrate) and (b) ethanol-containing diet (identical to the control diet but with ethanol added to account for 27.5% of total calories and the caloric equivalent of carbohydrate (maltose-dextrin) removed). The animals were pair-fed for 4 weeks then sacrificed. The experimental protocols were approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee. Frozen sections of the liver were stained with Oil Red O. The paired t test was used to evaluate statistical differences in values between ethanol- and pair-fed mice. Both t tests and analysis of variance were used to analyze the in vitro data. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Effects of ethanol on cellular metabolism may be due directly to ethanol, or to the products of its oxidation, including NADH, acetaldehyde, and acetate. We chose two rat hepatoma cell lines and a non-hepatic cell line for study. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that H4IIEC3 expresses moderately high levels of class I (low K m) ADH and ALDH2 protein and enzyme activity (33Crabb D.W. Stewart M.J. Xiao Q. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1995; 19: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This line also expresses SREBP-1 and -2 (data not shown). Studies by others demonstrated that the amount of SREBP-1c mRNA was nearly 3-fold greater than that of SREBP-1a in the McA-RH7777 cells, the ratio that approaches that of normal rat liver (9:1) (34DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ou J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that McA-RH7777 cells have substantial protein expression of both ADH and ALDH2 (data not shown). CV-1 cells were chosen as a cell type known not to express ADH. We tested the cells for responsiveness to the effects of sterols on a SRE reporter gene, pSyn SRE-luciferase. pSV2-CAT was used as internal control. In each of three cell lines, the reporter activity was markedly reduced by incubation with sterol (10 μg/ml cholesterol plus 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) to 10–35% of control activity. Thus, each cell appears to express functional SREBP whose activity can be suppressed by sterol supplementation. The effect of ethanol on pSyn SRE expression was then tested in the three cell lines. The cells were transfected with the reporter, pSyn SRE-luciferase, and the internal control plasmid (pSV2CAT) and exposed to various concentrations of ethanol for 48 h then harvested for assay of reporter enzymes. As shown in Fig.1, ethanol markedly increased the activity of the SREBP reporter in both hepatoma cell lines but not in the CV-1 cells. Ethanol had no effect on the expression of luciferase from the parent plasmid, pGL2 Basic (data not shown). To confirm that the effect of ethanol was mediated by SREBPs, the hepatoma cells were also transiently transfected with JS-15, a pSyn SRE plasmid mutated in the SRE regions, resulting in insensitivity to sterol. Incubation of these cells with sterols did not down-regulate SRE expression, and ethanol had no effect on the activity of the reporter (data not shown). We further tested the effect of sterols on the ability of ethanol to activate the pSyn SRE-luciferase reporter. If the effect of ethanol were mediated through activation of SREBPs, it would be predicted to be blocked by supplemental sterols. In both H4IIEC3 and McA-RH7777 cells, addition of sterols completely blocked the effect of ethanol on activation of the pSyn SRE reporter activity (Fig.2). These data provide strong evidence that ethanol induced expression of the reporter by way of activation of one or more of the SREBP forms, which interacts with a sterol response element of the reporter. The lack of effect of ethanol on pSyn SRE-luciferase in CV-1 cells suggested that ethanol metabolism was required for this effect. This was further substantiated by the use of inhibitors of ethanol metabolism. We used the class I alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole and the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide. Fig. 3 shows that neither inhibitor significantly affected pSyn SRE-luciferase activity in McA-RH7777 cells in control experiments. However, 4-methylpyrazole nearly abolished the effect of ethanol on pSyn SRE-luciferase expression in McA-RH7777 cells, whereas cyanamide augmented the effect markedly. The results suggest that acetaldehyde generated from ethanol may be responsible for the ability of ethanol to activate pSyn SRE-luciferase. We further examined the effect of ethanol and acetaldehyde on the levels of the mature SREBP-1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4, Western analysis of nuclear extracts from hepatoma H4IIEC3 cell incubated with ethanol or acetaldehyde showed a substantial but transient increase in the amount of mature SREBP-1. The mass of the mature form of SREBP-1 was found to increase ∼2.5-fold after 30 min of exposure of the hepatoma cells to ethanol (Fig. 4 A). The amount of mature SREBP-1 returned to control levels within 1 h. Similarly, acetaldehyde treatment resulted in increase the mature form of SREBP-1 ∼2-fold after 30 or 45 min (Fig. 4 B), and the amount of mature SREBP-1 returned to control levels within 1 h. There was no discernable change in the mass of the precursor SREBP-1 protein. The amount of mature SREBP-2 protein was not altered by ethanol treatment (data not shown). To determine the effect of ethanol on SREBP in vivo, we first established the effects of ethanol feeding of mice using the usual liquid diet pair feeding protocol. The mice were fed a low fat, high carbohydrate diet (4% safflower oil, 6% cocoa butter, and 72% carbohydrate) or the low fat diet with ethanol substituted for 27.5% of the carbohydrate calories for 4 weeks. Ethanol intake had no apparent effect on the health status of the animals. A steady average 2- to 3-g increase in the body weight was observed in both groups during the entire 4-week study. As shown in Table I, no significant differences in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol were detected between ethanol- and pair-fed animals. Similar levels of hepatic cholesterol (esterified plus unesterified) levels were also found in both groups. However, hepatic triglycerides were significantly elevated by about 3.5-fold by ethanol feeding compared with pair-fed controls. The body weights did not vary between these groups, but the liver weights were significantly increased in the low fat diet plus ethanol group. Consistent with this observation, livers from ethanol-fed mice were significantly larger than livers from control group. Histological analysis showed prominent accumulation of lipid droplets in the livers of ethanol-fed mice, whereas lipid droplets were rare in the livers of control groups (Fig.5). Our data clearly demonstrate that ingestion of an ethanol-containing low fat diet for 4 weeks led to the development of fatty liver.Table IPhenotypic comparison of mice fed low fat diet with or without ethanolParameterLow fatLow fat plus ethanolBody weight (g)23.0 ± 1.322.3 ± 2.3Liver weight (g)1.30 ± 0.081.50 ± 0.131-aStatistically significant changes compared to the low fat control animals (p < 0.05).

In contrast to the level of the mature SREBP-1 protein, which was enhanced by ethanol feeding, no significant increase was observed in either the membrane-bound precursor protein levels of SREBP-1 or the corresponding mRNA (data not shown). This suggested that ethanol regulates the abundance of mature SREBP-1 protein mainly at a post-translational level. This is similar to the results observed with the hepatoma cells. To determine whether the ethanol-mediated induction of SREBP-1 maturation was associated with a corresponding increase in expression of genes known to be regulated by SREBPs, a series of Northern blot analyses were performed using total RNA from the livers of mice described in Table I. As shown in Fig.7, ethanol feeding increased the expression of mRNAs from several SREBP target genes by ∼2-fold (normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). These targets included the major enzyme of fatty acid synthesis, FAS, the enzymes that supply NADPH and acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis (ME and ACL, respectively), and the enzyme responsible for conversion of palmitate and stearate to palmitoleate and oleate, SCD. Two isoforms of SCD (SCD1 and SCD2) are currently known. SCD1 is the only SCD isoform found in liver (35Kaestner K.H. Ntambi J.M. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14755-14761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data mainly reflect SCD1 expression. We attempted to measure the abundance of ACC in the liver RNA samples, but the signal was too low to quantify. These findings suggest that the increase in the mature form of SREBP-1 by ethanol was associated with increased transcriptional activity of this factor, reflected in the increased mRNA levels of a battery of lipogenic genes. In the present study, we demonstrated that, in both rat H4IIEC3 and McA-RH7777 hepatoma cell lines, ethanol induced transcription of SRE-regulated promoter via increased levels of mature SREBP-1 protein. Expression of promoters was blocked by the presence of sterols known to inhibit the activation of SREBPs. This effect of ethanol is likely mediated by acetaldehyde, because inhibition of ethanol oxidation by 4-methylpyrazole, an inhibitor of the class I ADH known to be expressed in these cells, blocked the effect. Conversely, the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide enhanced the effect of ethanol. Furthermore, ethanol did not have any effect on an SRE- regulated promoter in CV-1 cells, which do not express ADH. Consistent with ourin vitro findings, feeding mice a low fat diet with ethanol for 4 weeks resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of the mature form of SREBP-1. Activation of SREBP-1 by ethanol feeding was associated with increased expression of several hepatic lipogenic genes known to be controlled by SREBP-1 as well as the accumulation of triglyceride in the livers. It is interesting to note that increased activity of these enzymes has already been reported in livers of ethanol-fed animals (18Muramatsu M. Kuriyama K. Yuki T. Ohkuma S. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 31: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Joly J.G. Feinman L. Ishii H. Lieber C.S. J. Lipid Res. 1973; 14: 337-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arakawa M. Taketomi S. Furuno K. Matsuo T. Iwatsuka H. J. Nutr. 1975; 105: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the increased activity is the result of increased levels of the corresponding mRNAs. The increase in SCD activity in turn is reflected in the increased amounts of palmitoleic and oleic acid in the triglyceride stored in the liver of ethanol-fed animals (36Tsukamoto H. Lew G. Larkin E.C. Largman C. Rao G.A. Lipids. 1984; 19: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The action of acetaldehyde could be due to increased rates of formation of the mature SREBP-1 or impairment of its further degradation. The current model of SREBP regulation holds that the 125-kDa precursors of SREBPs are anchored to intracellular membranes as a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a membrane protein with a sterol-sensing domain (24Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). When cells are deprived of sterols, SCAP is activated and escorts SREBPs to the Golgi complex. In the Golgi, SREBPs are activated by sequential proteolytic cleavage by two proteases, site 1 protease and site 2 protease. Thus, one effect of acetaldehyde could be to reduce the concentration of sterols that influence SCAP activity. One enzyme that metabolizes sterols is known to be inhibited by acetaldehyde, namely Δ4-3-ketosteroid 5-β-reductase, an enzyme participating in the bile salt synthetic pathway (37Zhu Y. Fillenwarth M.J. Crabb D. Lumeng L. Lin R.C. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lin R.C. Lumeng L. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Li C.J. Nanji A.A. Siakotos A.N. Lin R.C. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 40Lin R.C. Fillenwarth M.J. Du X. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is not known if other enzymes that participate in sterol metabolism aside from HMG-CoA reductase are affected by ethanol or acetaldehyde. When cells are overloaded with sterols, the SCAP·SREBP complex fails to move to the Golgi, and SREBPs are not processed. Our in vitro study showed that addition of sterols blocked the effect of ethanol on SRE-dependent gene expression in both hepatoma cell lines. This would be consistent with either an effect of acetaldehyde on sterol levels or with an effect mediated further downstream. It is well known that the mature form of SREBP-1 is ultimately disposed via the proteasomal pathway (24Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Exposure to ethanol could affect the level of the mature form of SREBP-1 via inhibition of proteasomal degradation. Ethanol has been shown to inhibit proteasomal protein degradation in rats fed ethanol chronically (41Bardag-Gorce F. Yuan Q.X. Li J. French B.A. Fang C. Ingelman-Sundberg M. French S.W. . 2000; 279: 23-29Google Scholar), although the mechanism for this action is unknown. Furthermore, the effect of ethanol appeared to be somewhat selective, because SREBP-1 but not SREBP-2 levels were increased in the cells and the mouse livers. An additional explanation could be the formation of acetaldehyde adducts with mature SREBP-1 and, subsequently, inhibition of SREBP-1 degradation, because acetaldehyde is known to form adducts with a number of proteins (36Tsukamoto H. Lew G. Larkin E.C. Largman C. Rao G.A. Lipids. 1984; 19: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 42Smith S.L. Jennett R.B. Sorrell M.F. Tuma D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Tuma D.J. Thiele G.M. Xu D. Klassen L.W. Sorrell M.F. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 872-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SREBPs are not only regulated by intracellular sterol levels but also by MAPK signaling (44Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schurmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the SREBPs are possibly substrates of MAPK (45Roth G. Kotzka J. Kremer L. Lehr S. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33302-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that ethanol plays a positive role in the regulating MAPK signaling pathway (46Reddy M.A. Shukla S.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 47Reddy M.A. Shukla S.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 149: 271-278Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 48Nguyen V.A. Chen J. Hong F. Ishac E.J. Gao B. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, ethanol could activate SREBPs indirectly via activation of MAPK. Clearly, additional study will be needed to understand the exact mechanism by which ethanol or acetaldehyde affects the SREBP pathway both in vitro and in vivo. The increased level of mature SREBP-1 after ethanol feeding was associated with increased mRNAs for multiple SREBP-regulated lipogenic enzymes and triglyceride accumulation in liver. However, we found that nuclear SREBP-2 levels were unchanged in livers from the ethanol feeding mice as compared with the pair-fed mice, and similar hepatic levels of total cholesterol were found in the control and ethanol-fed groups. These results are consistent with the previousin vitro and in vivo studies that SREBP-1 preferentially activates enzymes involved in lipogenesis, whereas SREBP-2 is primarily responsible for the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (24Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). However, earlier reports suggest that ethanol feeding increased cholesterol ester levels in rat liver (49Rao G.A. Riley D.E. Larkin E.C. Lipids. 1985; 20: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); it is possible that the failure to see an increase in cholesterol in the mice is a species-dependent effect or is related to other differences in diets. The importance of these findings is 3-fold. First, it was reported many years ago that, with continued alcohol feeding, the redox stress attributable to the generation of NADH by ADH and ALDH abates in the ethanol-fed baboon. However, fatty liver persisted in these animals. One explanation suggested by our studies is that the redox perturbation may contribute to the retention of fat early in the course of heavy alcohol use, but effects on transcription factors such as SREBP may be responsible for maintenance of increased levels of fat synthesis and fatty liver. In fact, activation of the lipogenic enzyme battery may perpetuate increased rates of fatty acid synthesis even between periods of heavy alcohol consumption. Second, the SREBP-regulated battery of enzymes include ACC. ACC not only supplies malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis by FAS, but the malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I. This enzyme is the major regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the liver, with a flux control coefficient of about 0.7–0.8 (50Spurway T.D. Sherratt H.A. Pogson C.I. Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the content of malonyl-CoA in the livers of animals fed ethanol has not been reported, but it is expected to rise with increased activity of ACC. This raises the possibility that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by malonyl-CoA contributes to the accumulation of fat in the liver, and this effect may be independent of the effect of ethanol on the redox state of the hepatocyte. The third point is that the SREBP pathway is amenable to manipulation by exogenous compounds, such as sterols. Thus, it may be possible to reduce the rate of fat synthesis and the severity of fatty liver by supplementing the diet of alcoholics with the appropriate sterols. Although the long term goal of treatment is abstinence from alcohol, there are conditions in which liver injury might be reduced by rapid control of fatty liver. Fatty livers are exquisitely sensitive to endotoxin, which in turn is felt to play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Resolution or control of fatty liver might reduce the sensitivity of this organ to ongoing injury from heavy drinking. We are grateful to Ruth Ann Ross for her excellent technical assistance."

Here we show parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney CASR mRNA levels increased 2-fold at 15 h after intraperitoneal injection of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) in rats. Human thyroid C-cell (TT) and kidney proximal tubule cell (HKC) CASR gene transcription increased ∼2-fold at 8 and 12 h after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. The human CASR gene has two promoters yielding alternative transcripts containing either exon 1A or exon 1B 5′-untranslated region sequences that splice to exon 2 some 242 bp before the ATG translation start site. Transcriptional start sites were identified in parathyroid gland and TT cells; that for promoter P1 lies 27 bp downstream of a TATA box, whereas that for promoter P2, which lacks a TATA box, lies in a GC-rich region. In HKC cells, transcriptional activity of a P1 reporter gene construct was 11-fold and of P2 was 33-fold above basal levels. 10−8m 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated P1 activity 2-fold and P2 activity 2.5-fold. Vitamin D response elements (VDREs), in which half-sites (6 bp) are separated by three nucleotides, were identified in both promoters and shown to confer 1,25(OH)2D3 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. This responsiveness was lost when the VDREs were mutated. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays with either in vitrotranscribed/translated vitamin D receptor and retinoid X receptor-α, or HKC nuclear extract, specific protein-DNA complexes were formed in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 on oligonucleotides representing the P1 and P2 VDREs. In summary, functional VDREs have been identified in the CASR gene and provide the mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D up-regulates parathyroid, thyroid C-cell, and kidney CASR expression.

Becker K.L. Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia2001: 478-489Google Scholar, 2Bringhurst F.R. Demay M.B. Kronenberg H.M. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Kronenberg H.M. Larsen P.R. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. 9th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 1155-1209Google Scholar). PTH synthesis and secretion are negatively regulated by serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels. In the kidney proximal tubule, the mitochondrial 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase, the key enzyme responsible for production of 1,25(OH)2D, is regulated by serum PTH, calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels. Classic feedback loops operate such that PTH synthesis and secretion, and 1,25(OH)2D production, initially stimulated by reductions in circulating calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels, are then shut off as the mineral ion and vitamin D metabolite concentrations normalize.The calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) that plays a critical role in this process is a glycoprotein with a predicted topology of a large extracellular domain, a seven-transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail (3Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butter R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar). This G protein-coupled receptor is expressed most abundantly in the parathyroid chief cells, along the length of the kidney tubule, and in thyroid C-cells. The CASR is activated by elevations in extracellular calcium concentration, leading to inhibition of PTH secretion and renal calcium reabsorption (4Brown E.M. Macleod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar).Potentially, two important regulators of CASR gene expression are extracellular calcium and 1,25(OH)2D. Two previous studies were unable to demonstrate an effect of extracellular calcium on parathyroid gland or whole kidney CASR mRNA in the rat in vivo (5Brown A.J. Zhang M. Finch J. Ritter C. McCracken R. Morrissey J. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F454-F460PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rogers K.V. Dunn C.V. Conklin R.L. Hadfield S. Petty B.A. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Fox J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This lack of modulation of CASR expression might be expected, given the constraints placed upon the CASR in tissues such as parathyroid gland or kidney, where it plays an essential role as a calciostat to sense very small changes in extracellular calcium concentration. Even modest alterations in the extracellular calcium set-point (this being defined as the extracellular calcium concentration for half-maximal stimulation of PTH secretion from the parathyroid gland or calcium reabsorption across the kidney tubule) brought about by changes in CASR synthesis could have major unwanted effects on overall calcium homeostasis.Previously, the effect of vitamin D status (depleted versusreplete) and/or treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 on parathyroid and kidney CASR mRNA levels has been examined in rats. One study found that vitamin D-depleted rats had a 40% reduction in parathyroid CASR mRNA relative to replete animals and administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 to vitamin D-replete rats further enhanced parathyroid and kidney CASR mRNA levels (5Brown A.J. Zhang M. Finch J. Ritter C. McCracken R. Morrissey J. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F454-F460PubMed Google Scholar). A second study found that administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 to rats up-regulated renal CASR mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner (7Yao J. Karnauskas A.J. Bushinsky D.A. Favus M.J. Bone. 1998; (abstr.): T265Google Scholar). One study failed to find evidence for vitamin D modulation of CASR expression (6Rogers K.V. Dunn C.V. Conklin R.L. Hadfield S. Petty B.A. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Fox J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 499-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although for methodological reasons small differences in CASR mRNA levels might have been missed.The human CASR is encoded by six exons (exons 2–7) of the gene (8Pollak M.R.

The gene sequence upstream of exon 1A has a TATA box, whereas the sequence upstream of exon 1B lacks a TATA box and is GC-rich. The precise transcriptional start sites of exons 1A and 1B have not been mapped, and functional cis-acting elements in the gene promoters have yet to be identified.In the present study, we have shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 up-regulates parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney CASR mRNA levels in vivo in the rat, and that 1,25(OH)2D3 up-regulates the endogenous CASR gene transcription in human thyroid and kidney cell lines. In addition, we have mapped the transcriptional start sites and identified functional vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in both promoters of the human CASR gene.DISCUSSIONWe have mapped the transcriptional start sites of promoters P1 and P2 of the human CASR gene. For P1 a TATA box is at nucleotide −26 and a CCAAT box is at −110 relative to the start site. For P2, the transcriptional start site lies between two Sp1 sites, but the mechanisms that control initiation site selection of such GC-rich promoters lacking a TATA box are not known. When transfected into COS-7 cells that do not express the CASR, both P1 and P2 demonstrated base-line transcriptional activity severalfold above that of the promoterless control. Whereas the activity of P1 in human proximal tubule cells (HKC) that do express the CASR was similar to that in COS-7 cells that do not express the CASR, that of P2 was markedly increased in the HKC cells, indicating that elements important for tissue-specific expression of the CASR gene are present in this promoter.Now that the CASR promoters have been defined, it is possible to focus on the regulation of the CASR at the transcriptional level. In the present study we have focused on the mechanism underlying the vitamin D stimulation of CASR expression (5Brown A.J. Zhang M. Finch J. Ritter C. McCracken R. Morrissey J. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F454-F460PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yao J. Karnauskas A.J. Bushinsky D.A. Favus M.J. Bone. 1998; (abstr.): T265Google Scholar) and show it to be a transcriptional one. First, we have demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 up-regulates parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney CASR mRNA levels in vivo. These observations confirm and extend previous findings (5Brown A.J. Zhang M. Finch J. Ritter C. McCracken R. Morrissey J. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F454-F460PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yao J. Karnauskas A.J. Bushinsky D.A. Favus M.J. Bone. 1998; (abstr.): T265Google Scholar). Second, we showed that human thyroid C-cell and kidney proximal tubule cell CASR gene transcription is increased by 1,25(OH)2D3. Third, VDREs were identified in both promoters of the CASR gene; one is 380 bp upstream of the P1 transcriptional start site, and the other is 166 bp upstream of the P2 transcriptional start site. VDREs have been identified in several vitamin D-responsive genes and typically consist of two 6-bp half-sites separated by 3 bp (25Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.R. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.-C. Thompson P.D.

The VDREs of the CASR conform to this arrangement; however, they are atypical in that the orientation of half-sites is inverted to that which is normally found. VDREs of this type are found in the 24-hydroxylase gene (27Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M. Shinki T. Kato S. Suda T. Yamamoto O. Noshiro M. Kato Y. J. Biol.

In the parathyroid, up-regulation of the CASR by 1,25(OH)2D would make the gland more responsive to extracellular calcium and for any given calcium concentration PTH secretion would be reduced. This would reinforce the direct negative effect of 1,25(OH)2D on PTH gene transcription (30Silver J. Naveh-Many T. Mayer H. Schmelzer H.J. Popovtzer M.M. J. Clin.

Parathyroid glands surgically removed from a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism who had been treated with a 1,25(OH)2D3 analogue intravenously showed up-regulation of CASR expression relative to parathyroid glands removed from similar patients not so treated (37Shiraishi K. Tsuchida M. Wada T. Yoshihiro S. Takai K. Suga A. Kaneda Y. Naito K. Am. J. Nephrol. 2001; 21: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although decreases in maximum PTH secretion are likely the result of the direct negative effect of 1,25(OH)2D on PTH gene transcription, the improvement in parathyroid gland responsiveness to calcium could be the result in part of increased expression of the CASR.In the kidney, changes in serum calcium regulate production of 1,25(OH)2D by affecting the activity of the proximal tubule mitochondrial cytochrome P450 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase. In thyroparathyroidectomized rats in which PTH and phosphate were maintained at constant levels, an inverse correlation was seen between serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels, suggesting that calcium regulates 1,25(OH)2D independently of PTH (38Trechsel V.

Calcium directly regulates 1,25(OH)2D3production in the human proximal tubular (HKC) cell line (23Bland R. Walker E.A. Hughes S.V. Stewart P.M. Hewison M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).The 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase enzyme is product-inhibited. Therefore, after production of 1,25(OH)2D, the enzyme will be inhibited by several mechanisms including the direct action of 1,25(OH)2D, the decreased level of serum PTH brought about by the action of 1,25(OH)2D on the PTH gene, and by the increased sensitivity to serum calcium brought about by increased proximal tubule expression of the CASR implied by the present study. In vitamin D deficiency, the reduced CASR expression would help to ensure a maximum efficiency of production of 1,25(OH)2D.In the distal nephron, the cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) and distal convoluted tubule, the CASR plays a key role in regulating Ca2+ and Mg2+ reabsorption. In the CTAL, the paracellular transport of cations is driven by a lumen-positive voltage gradient set up by the activity of the apical Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter and K+ channel (see Ref. 41Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A hormone such as PTH activates its receptor on the basolateral surface increasing intracellular cyclic AMP, which stimulates the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter and cation reabsorption. Activation of the CASR on the basolateral surface inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby inhibiting hormone-stimulated cation transport leading to increased divalent cation excretion. The CASR also participates in transcellular cation reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and increasing extracellular calcium or magnesium stimulates intracellular Ca2+ transients and inhibits adenylate cyclase activity inhibiting hormone (e.g.PTH)-stimulated cation uptake (42Bapty B.W.

Increased CASR expression in the CTAL and distal convoluted tubule in response to 1,25(OH)2D would stimulate calcium excretion.Indeed, the findings of the present study offer some insight into the special management problems of patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia caused by activating mutations in the CASR relative to other forms of hypoparathyroidism. Treatment with vitamin D metabolites fails to bring the serum calcium up toward the lower limit of normal, whereas calcium excretion is excessively stimulated potentially leading to nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and renal damage (44Pearce S.H.S. Williamson C. Kifor O. Bai M. Coulthard M.G. Davies M. Lewis-Barned N. McCredie D. Powell H. Kendall-Taylor P. Brown E.M. Thakker R.V. N. Engl. J.

With the demonstration of VDREs in the CASR gene, the mechanism underlying the exuberant hypercalciuric response to vitamin D metabolites in autosomal dominant hypocalcemia patients now becomes clearer. The renal CASR is already too sensitive to divalent cations in these patients, and the situation is exacerbated when CASR expression is stimulated by 1α-hydroxylated vitamin D metabolite administration.Hypercalcemia blunts renal concentrating ability, in part through CASR-activated signaling that antagonizes arginine vasopressin actions. Vitamin D up-regulation of the renal CASR is likely to underlie the increased basal and vasopressin-elicited water and urea permeabilities in the inner medullary cortical ducts of rats made hypercalcemic with dihydrotachysterol that mimics 1,25(OH)2D action (46Sands J.M. Flores F.X. Kato A. Baum M.A. Brown E.M. Ward D.T. Hebert S.C. Harris H.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F978-F985PubMed Google Scholar). However, in autosomal dominant hypocalcemia patients with activating CASR gene mutations, the normal counter-regulatory mechanisms are clearly often insufficient to protect against the vitamin D-stimulated hypercalciuria leading to nephrocalcinosis (44Pearce S.H.S. Williamson C. Kifor O. Bai M. Coulthard M.G. Davies M. Lewis-Barned N. McCredie D. Powell H. Kendall-Taylor P. Brown E.M. Thakker R.V. N. Engl. J.

In kindreds predisposed to idiopathic hypercalciuria and calcium nephrolithiasis, linkage of the trait to chromosome 12q12–14 markers near the VDR locus was found (47Scott P. Ouimet D. Valiquette L. Guay G. Proulx Y. Trouvé M.L. Gagnon B. Bonnardeux A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1007-1013PubMed Google Scholar). The same investigators found that markers flanking and within the CASR locus on chromosome 3q13.3–21 were not linked to idiopathic hypercalciuria (48Petrucci M. Scott P. Ouimet D. Trouvé M.L. Proulx Y. Valiquette L. Guay G. Bonnardeaux A. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 38-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Linkage studies in a genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming rat model, which demonstrates many of the features of human hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, suggested a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 7q in a part that encodes the VDR (49Hoopes R.Jr. Reid R. Thakker R. Szpirer C. Bushinsky D. Scheinman S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 563Google Scholar). The hypercalciuric rat demonstrates increased sensitivity of the VDR to 1,25(OH)2D3, leading to a defect in renal calcium absorption (50Yao J. Kathpalia P. Bushinsky D.A. Favus M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). From the findings of the present study, it would be predicted that elevated levels of CASR expression, secondary to enhanced vitamin D action, would be found in the hypercalciuric rat model, causing the increased urinary calcium excretion. Indeed, greater increases in 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated renal CASR mRNA levels were found in the hypercalciuric rats relative to normal rats (7Yao J. Karnauskas A.J. Bushinsky D.A. Favus M.J. Bone. 1998; (abstr.): T265Google Scholar).Loss of CASR function, as occurs in the inherited disorder neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism because of homozygous inactivation of the CASR gene (51Pollak M.R.

Thus, mutations in growth-regulating genes may secondarily alter the calcium set-point by decreasing expression of the CASR (63Cetani F. Picone A. Cerrai P. Vignali E. Borsari S. Pardi E. Viacava P.

Evidence for this comes from a mouse model in which a cyclin D1 transgene is under the control of the PTH gene regulatory region (65Imanishi Y. Hosokawa Y. Yoshimoto K. Schipani E. Mallya S.

Parathyroid gland CASR expression is reduced, the calcium set-point is shifted to the right, parathyroid enlargement occurs and serum calcium and PTH levels are increased. However, the specific genes and precise mechanisms involved in down-regulation of parathyroid CASR expression are not known.The antiproliferative effects of vitamin D metabolites on the parathyroid gland are well documented. Patients with inherited disorders in which there is homozygous inactivation of the VDR or its ligand (and the corresponding mouse models of these disorders) manifest marked parathyroid hyperplasia (see Ref. 66Panda D.K.

However, like the CASR gene, somatic mutation of the VDR gene does not contribute to parathyroid tumorigenesis (67Wu H.I. Arnold A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: S488Google Scholar, 68Brown S.B. Brierley T.T. Palanisamy N. Salusky I.B. Goodman W. Brandi M.L. Drueke T.B. Sarfati E. Urena P. Chaganti R.S.K. Pike J.W. Arnold A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

CXCR4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell lines. Disruption of either the sdf-1a or CXCR4 gene resulted in similar embryonic lethal mutations, underscoring a role for this receptor/ligand pair in hematopoiesis, vascularization, and neuronal development (3Nagasawa T.

In addition to roles in development and cancer, CXCR4 serves as a coreceptor, together with the cellular receptor CD4, for the entry of a subset of isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (7Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3624) Google Scholar). Entry is initiated when the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein binds CD4 (8Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C. Clapham P.R. Crawford D.H. Greaves M.F. Weiss R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). Association with CD4 induces a conformational change in the surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 that allows this glycoprotein to then associate with a chemokine receptor coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4 (9Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 10Wu L. Gerard N.P.

Association with the chemokine receptor is thought to induce a more dramatic rearrangement of the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41. This latter rearrangement results in the mixing of viral and cellular lipids and ultimately in the entry of the viral capsid into the target cell (11Doms R.W. Moore J.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F9-F14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most virions that are initially transmitted to a new host and those that predominate during most of infection utilize the CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 as a principal coreceptor. Coincident with a decline in immune function, HIV-1 isolates emerge that utilized CXCR4 (12Connor R.I. Sheridan K.E. Ceradini D. Choe S. Landau N.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Viruses that utilize CXCR4 can infect a larger pool of mostly naive CD4+ T lymphocytes that express CXCR4 but not CCR5 (13Bleul C.C., Wu, L. Hoxie J.A. Springer T.A. Mackay C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1925-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Most laboratory-adapted isolates of HIV-1 utilize CXCR4 exclusively because cell lines used in tissue culture for viral replication typically express CXCR4 but not CCR5 (14Choe H. Farzan M. Sun Y.

In addition to these receptors, a number of G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified that serve as coreceptors in tissue culture systems of HIV-1 infection. The role of these minor coreceptors remains unclear, but they have been useful in identifying properties common to HIV-1 coreceptors (15Choe H. Farzan M. Konkel M. Martin K. Sun Y. Marcon L.

The most prominent of these commonalties is the presence of a tyrosine-rich and acidic region in their amino termini (16Farzan M. Choe H. Martin K. Marcon L. Hofmann W. Karlsson G. Sun Y. Barrett P. Marchand N. Sullivan N. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This region of CCR5 plays a critical or necessary role in the entry of HIV-1 isolates that utilize this coreceptor (17Farzan M. Choe H. Vaca L. Martin K. Sun Y. Desjardins E. Ruffing N., Wu, L.

In contrast to CCR5, the tyrosine sulfate moieties of CXCR4 did not play a major role in the entry of the five HIV-1 isolates that were assayed. Finally, we observe an additional source of CXCR4 sulfate present at serine 18, a chondroitin sulfate chain, in some but not all cell lines. These data extend the role of amino-terminal tyrosine sulfates to the CXC-chemokine family and underscore a key difference in HIV-1 utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the canine thymic stromal cell line Cf2Th, the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, the human myeloid cell line U937, and the human T-lymphocyte cell line Jurkat were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL11554, ATCC CRL1430, ATCC CCL2, ATCC CRL1593, and ATCC TIB152, respectively). Codon-optimized and myc- and C9-tagged CXCR4 has been described previously (22Babcock G.J. Mirzabekov T. Wojtowicz W. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38433-38440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All the CXCR4 variants were made on codon-optimized CXCR4 by the PCR-based QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing the entire reading frame. The antibody 1D4, which recognizes the C9 tag, and the anti-myc tag antibody, 9E10, were provided by the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5, conjugated to phycoerythrin, was obtained from PharMingen. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing CXCR4 or CXCR4 variants by the calcium phosphate method; 1 day later, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), split at a 1:3 ratio, and labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate for 1 day. Cysteine and methionine labeling media contained 50 μCi each of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine per milliliter of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking both amino acids. Sulfate labeling media contains 125 μCi [35S]sulfate/ml sulfate-free media (ICN). In some cases, cells were treated with 3 μg/mlN-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin added to cell culture media 5 h before labeling and also added to the labeling media. Labeled cells were lysed in 1%N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Anatrace) in PBS containing protease inhibitor mixtures for mammalian cells (Sigma and Roche Biochemicals). After cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatant was immunoprecipitated by the 1D4 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1%N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside/PBS containing 0.5% SDS and once with PBS. Reducing Laemmli sample buffer was added, and samples were treated at 50 °C for 10–15 min before analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Typically, a 9-fold greater volume of [35S]sulfate-labeled samples was analyzed relative to samples radiolabeled with cysteine and methionine. Endogenous CXCR4 was immunoprecipitated using the anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 from HeLa cells lysed with 1% CHAPSO (Anatrace) in PBS. HIV-1 entry into Cf2Th cells expressing CD4 and wild-type or variant coreceptors has been described previously (14Choe H. Farzan M. Sun Y. Sullivan N. Rollins B. Ponath P.D., Wu, L. Mackay C.R. LaRosa G. Newman W. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Cell. 1996; 85: 1135-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Briefly, HIV-1 proviral DNA lacking a functional envelope gene and encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a reporter was cotransfected into HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding the envelope glycoproteins of the R5X4 isolates 89.6 or MCGP1 or of the X4 isolates CF402.1, SG3, or HXBc2. Viruses harvested from the cell culture supernatant corresponding to 10,000–20,000 cpm reverse transcriptase activity were incubated with target cells overnight. Cf2Th cells were transfected with 3.0 μg of pcDNA3.1-CD4 plasmid and a varying amount (0–1.0 μg) of wild-type or variant CXCR4-expressing plasmids in 6-well plates. The following day, cells were replated onto 6-well plates for FACS analysis and infection. Approximately 48 h after transfection, one set of cells was used to measure the receptor expression level, and the other sets were infected with reporter viruses. Expression of wild-type CXCR4 and the variants was measured by the 12G5 antibody (PharMingen) that recognizes domains other than the CXCR4 amino terminus (23McKnight A. Wilkinson D. Simmons G. Talbot S. Picard L. Ahuja M. Marsh M. Hoxie J.A. Clapham P.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infected cells were washed with PBS after overnight incubation with viruses, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured in the lysed cells ∼60 h after infection. Cells transfected and labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above and washed in 1%N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside/PBS and in PBS. Typically, immunoprecipitates from ∼1–5 × 106cells were digested in a total volume of 150 μl for 1.5 h at 37 °C with enzyme. To digest the high molecular weight smear coprecipitated with CXCR4, 10 milliunit chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4; Sigma) or 10 milliunits of heparinase (heparin lyase;Calbiochem), heparitinase I (heparin lyase I; Calbiochem), heparitinase II (heparin lyase II; Calbiochem), or a mixture of all three heparinases were used. Chondroitinase buffer contains 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm Tris, pH 8. Heparinase buffer contains 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmcalcium acetate, and 1 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Digests were washed once in PBS and analzyed by SDS-PAGE. Detection of O-glycans was performed using the glycoprotein deglycosylation kit (Calbiochem) orO-glycanase (Glyko). In the former case, 1 milliunit of N-acetylgalactosaminidase, 1.5 milliunits of 1,4-galactosaminidase, 40 milliunits ofN-acetylglucosaminidase, and 2 milliunits of neuraminidase were used together. Alternatively, 1 milliunit ofO-glycanase (Glyko) and 5 milliunits of neuraminidase (Roche Biochemicals) were used together. In each case, digestion ofO-glycan moieties of CCR5 was used to control for enzyme efficiency. Washed immunoprecipitates were digested with enzymes in a total volume of 50 μl for 2 h at 37 °C. After digestion, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Chondroitinase treatment of HeLa cells was performed by incubating 1 × 106 cells with 500 milliunits of chondroitin ABC lyase in 0.5 ml of medium. Binding experiments were performed with HEK293T transfected with wild-type CXCR4 or the variants or HeLa cells. Two days after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and incubated at 2 × 106 cells/ml in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% NaN3) containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) or 1:500 diluted Mega Bloc3 (CEL Associates, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature before being used for the binding experiment. Fifty μl of cells were incubated with 0.2 nm125I-SDF-1α (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0–300 nm unlabeled SDF-1α (Peprotech) in 50 μl of binding buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in binding buffer and once in binding buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. In parallel, FACS analysis was performed on 2 × 105 of the same cells stained with 12G5-phycoerythrin or the anti-myc antibody 9E10. The amino terminus of CCR5 contains at least three sulfated tyrosines that play a major role in the entry of HIV-1 viruses that utilize CCR5 as a coreceptor as well as in the association of CCR5 with its natural chemokine ligands (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 24Farzan M.

Amino-terminal tyrosine sulfation also participates in the ligand association of two additional chemotactic G-protein-coupled receptors: CCR2b and the C5a receptor (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Preobrazhensky A.A. Dragan S. Kawano T. Gavrilin M.A. Gulina I.V. Chakravarty L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5295-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to identify and determine a role of tyrosine sulfate of CXCR4, the other principal coreceptor of HIV-1. Fig. 1 demonstrates that CXCR4 efficiently incorporates sulfate. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding carboxyl-terminally tagged wild-type CXCR4 or a CXCR4 variant (FFF; see Table I) in which the three amino-terminal tyrosines had been altered to phenylalanine. Cells were divided and radiolabeled with either [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine or [35S]sulfate, and CXCR4 and FFF were immunoprecipitated with the antibody 1D4. As in the case of the C5a receptor (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), three forms of CXCR4 could be observed: (a) a predominant glycosylated form (indicated by the top arrowhead in Fig.1); (b) a smaller, less glycosylated form; and (c) a fragment smaller than the expected size of unmodified CXCR4 (Fig. 1, lane 1). Treatment with theN-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin reduced the mobility of the predominant form (lane 2), consistent with the previous observation of CXCR4 N-glycosylation (25Picard L. Wilkinson D.A. McKnight A. Gray P.W. Hoxie J.A. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. Virology. 1997; 231: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An identical pattern was also observed with the FFF variant (lanes 3 and 4). Only the predominant form of CXCR4 was observable in cells labeled with [35S]sulfate. Sulfate incorporation was markedly lower but still observable in the FFF variant as compared with wild-type CXCR4 (compare lanes 5and 6 to lanes 7 and 8 of Fig. 1). We conclude that one or more of the amino-terminal tyrosines of CXCR4 are sulfated and that additional sulfate moieties are present on the receptor.Table ICXCR4 variants used in this studyTable ICXCR4 variants used in this study We then investigated the role of this sulfation in HIV-1 entry and in SDF-1α association. Fig. 2 demonstrates that HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of various HIV-1 isolates that utilize CXCR4 is variably sensitive to alteration of the amino-terminal tyrosines of CXCR4. Little or no difference in the entry of viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the ELI, SG3, and HXBc2 isolates was observed in cells expressing comparable levels of CXCR4 or the FFF variant (Fig. 2A). Entry of the 89.6 and CF402.1 into cells expressing FFF was approximately 60% as efficient as entry into cells expressing CXCR4 (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the still efficient entry of 89.6 with the FFF CXCR4 variant, a CCR5 variant whose amino-terminal tyrosines have been altered to phenylalanine does not support any detectable entry by the 89.6 isolate (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). These data show that the role of tyrosine sulfate at the amino terminus of CXCR4 for HIV-1 entry varies among isolates and is less pronounced than what we have previously observed in the case of CCR5. In contrast to HIV-1 entry, alteration of CXCR4 amino-terminal tyrosines had a substantial effect on the binding of SDF-1α. Fig. 3shows that HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type CXCR4 bound SDF-1α much more efficiently than cells expressing comparable levels of the FFF variant (higher expression than wild-type CXCR4 in Fig.3A, lower expression than wild-type CXCR4 in Fig.3B), as determined by the amino-terminal tag antibody 9E10. The affinity of SDF-1α for the FFF variant was determined to be 4- to 5-fold lower than that of wild-type CXCR4 (Fig. 3A), and cells expressing the FFF variant bound less than half the125I-SDF-1α as cells expressing comparable levels of wild-type CXCR4 when incubated with 0.2 nm radiolabeled SDF-1α (Fig. 3, A and B). These data imply that sulfate groups on one or more of the amino-terminal tyrosines of CXCR4 contribute substantially to its association with SDF-1α. We also investigated the source of the residual sulfate observed on the FFF variant (Fig. 1, lane 8). Fig.4A demonstrates that this residual sulfate is not associated with extracellular tyrosines other than the three in the amino terminus. A CXCR4 variant in which every extracellular tyrosine has been altered to phenylalanine (FFFFFF; see Table I) and treated with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicaymycin still incorporates [35S]sulfate (Fig.4A, lanes 2 and 6) with an efficiency similar to that of the FFF variant. Also, a panel ofO-glycosidases that altered the mobility of CCR5 had no effect on the mobility or sulfate incorporation of CXCR4 or the FFF variant (data not shown). In contrast, a CXCR4 variant lacking residues 2–25 of its amino terminus (ΔNX4; see Table I) does not incorporate radiolabeled sulfate (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 7). As reported previously, a CCR5 variant with aspartic acids replacing its four amino-terminal tyrosines (DDDD-R5) also did not incorporate radiolabeled sulfate (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Note also that a diffuse high mobility smear was visible in [35S]sulfate lanes of wild-type CXCR4 and the FFFFFF variant but was not present in lanes containing ΔNX4 or DDDD-R5 (discussed below). We conclude that CXCR4 is sulfated at its amino-terminal tyrosines and at an additional amino-terminal location. Fig. 4B localizes this residual sulfation to one of two amino-terminal serines. Alteration to alanine of two threonines and one serine (residues 8, 9, and 13) at the very amino-terminal end of CXCR4 (variant FFF-TST/AAA; see Table I) did not alter the ability of the FFF variant to incorporate sulfate in transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). However, when serine 18 and serine 23 of the FFF variant were altered to alanine (FFAFA), no sulfate incorporation was detectable (lane 6). Note that this variant has also lost the diffuse high molecular weight sulfate smear present in all CXCR4 variants containing these serines. Sulfate incorporation was also not observed with an FFF variant in which serine 18 alone was altered to alanine (FFAFS; shown in Fig. 7A). We conclude that serine 18 is associated with two forms of sulfated molecules. First, serine 18 incorporates sulfate either directly or, more likely, in a small carbohydrate form that is not digested by standardO-glycosidases and that does not alter the mobility of CXCR4 on SDS-PAGE. Second, the diffuse high molecular weight sulfate signal associated with CXCR4 is also dependent on serine 18. Fig.5 clarifies the nature of this diffuse high molecular weight sulfate signal. As shown in Fig. 5A, the diffuse sulfate signal is much more pronounced in HeLa cells transfected with CXCR4 and labeled with [35S]sulfate than in HEK293T cells (compare lanes 1 and 4). This signal disappears if either serine 18 and 23 (YYAYA) or serine 18 alone (YYAYS) is altered to alanine (Fig. 5A). When immunoprecipitates of [35S]sulfate-labeled HeLa cells transfected with wild-type CXCR4 were treated with chondroitin ABC lyase, the high molecular weight sulfate signal disappeared, and the signal associated with CXCR4 increased (Fig 5B, lane 2). No effect was observed with cells incubated with chondroitinase buffer alone (lane 1) or with a series of heparan sulfate-cleaving enzymes (lanes 4–7). We conclude that the high mobility sulfate signal is the result of a chondroitin chain attached at serine 18 of CXCR4. We further conclude that CXCR4 modified by chondroitin is the major form of CXCR4 in HeLa cells. Fig. 5C further documents cell type variation associated with this glycosaminoglycan attachment. Sulfate signal associated with chondroitin chain modification could be observed in HeLa cells, to a lesser extent in Cf2Th canine thymocytes, and to an even lesser extent in HEK293T cells. No observable chondroitin modification was detected in U937 or Jurkat cell lines (Fig. 5C) or in primary lymphocytes (data not shown). Investigation of any potential role for this chondroitin sulfate chain in enhancing or inhibiting HIV-1 entry or SDF-1α binding did not yield positive results. Cf2Th cells expressing the YYAYS variant could be as efficiently infected by HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the HXBc2, 89.6, and ELI isolates as cells expressing wild-type CXCR4 (data not shown). Fig. 6documents the lack of effect chrondroitinase treatment had on the efficiency of SDF-1α association. Fig. 6A demonstrates that HeLa cells incubated with chondroitin ABC lyase before lysis lost most or all of their CXCR4-associated chondroitin, indicating that chondroitin-modified CXCR4 is largely present on the cell surface. However, chondroitinase-treated cells bound SDF-1α as efficiently as cells treated with chrondroitinase buffer alone (Fig. 6B). We conclude that the presence of chondroitin chain does not alter the ability of CXCR4 to bind SDF-1α or to serve as an HIV-1 coreceptor. Having localized the non-tyrosine source of the sulfate signal, we then sought to identify which of the three amino-terminal tyrosines were sulfated. Fig.7A demonstrates that most of the sulfate signal associated with tyrosine is localized to tyrosine 21. As expected, a CXCR4 variant in which serine 18 is altered to alanine (YYAYS) efficiently incorporates sulfate, whereas a CXCR4 variant in which three amino-terminal tyrosines and serine 18 are altered (FFAFS) incorporates no [35S]sulfate (lanes 3 and 4). If serine 18 and tyrosine 21 are altered (YYAFS), sulfate incorporation is substantially attenuated (lanes 5 and 6). If tyrosines 7 and 12 are altered to phenylalanine, but tyrosine 21 is left unaltered (FFAYS), only a modest reduction in sulfate incorporation is observed. These data indicate that the tyrosine 21 is efficiently sulfated and that one or both of tyrosines 7 and 12 are also less efficiently sulfated. We then assessed the relative contribution of the sulfate group at tyrosine 21. Fig. 7B shows that both CXCR4 variants in which tyrosine 21 has been altered to phenylalanine (FFAFS and YYAFS) bind SDF-1α substantially less efficiently than variants in which this tyrosine is present (YYAYS and FFAYS). The FFAYS variant, lacking the two most amino-terminal tyrosines, binds SDF-1α less efficiently than wild-type YYAYS but more efficiently than FFAFS or YYAFS. We conclude that the sulfate group at tyrosine 21 makes a substantial contribution to the efficiency of the SDF-1α association with CXCR4. Posttranslational modifications of the amino termini of CC-chemokine receptors, in particular tyrosine sulfation and O-glycosylation, play a critical role in the ability of these receptors to associate with their natural ligands (18Farzan M.

Craig S. Farzan M. Sogah D. Santo N.V. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1661-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In particular, tyrosine sulfation of CCR5 and CCR2b and O-glycosylation of CCR5 contribute to binding to their respective chemokine ligands (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 19Bannert N. Craig S. Farzan M. Sogah D. Santo N.V.

J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5295-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown that tyrosine sulfate moieties on the chemotactic receptor for C5a contribute to association and signaling through the C5a anaphylatoxin (20Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most or all chemokine receptors have a motif that is suggestive of tyrosine sulfation, and we have hypothesized that these sulfate moieties are critical to the function of chemokine receptors and related molecules (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Here we extend these observations to the first CXC-chemokine receptor, CXCR4. In particular, the sulfate group at tyrosine 21 clearly participates in SDF-1α association with CXCR4. We have also hypothesized that most or all HIV-1 coreceptors are tyrosine-sulfated. In the case of CCR5, the sulfate groups play an important role in the ability of CCR5 to support HIV-1 entry (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, we observe here that the tyrosine sulfate groups at the amino terminus of CXCR4 play a much less important role in entry of CXCR4-utilizing isolates than do tyrosine sulfate groups of CCR5 in the entry of all CCR5-dependent HIV-1 isolates assayed previously (including 89.6, JR-FL, YU2, and ADA). This is best observed in the case of the dual-tropic isolate 89.6, which can utilize both CCR5 and CXCR4. No detectable entry of the 89.6 virus was observed on cells expressing a CCR5 variant whose four amino-terminal tyrosines were altered to phenylalanine under conditions that carefully control for receptor expression (18Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In contrast, we show here that the analogous CXCR4 variant (denoted FFF here) allowed for efficient entry of the same isolate. The relative lack of sensitivity of the five HIV-1 isolates assayed here to alteration in the amino-terminal tyrosines of CXCR4 is consistent with their generally lower reliance on the amino terminus of CXCR4 than on the amino terminus of CCR5. We and others have found, for instance, that deletion of the CCR5 amino terminus ablates entry of all CCR5-dependent isolates assayed, whereas attenuated but still efficient entry of CXCR4-dependent isolates can be observed if the CXCR4 amino terminus is deleted (25Picard L. Wilkinson D.A. McKnight A. Gray P.W. Hoxie J.A. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. Virology. 1997; 231: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 2H. Choe, unpublished data.The underlying cause of this very consistent difference in the way viruses utilize CCR5 and CXCR4 remains unclear. In the process of describing the sulfate groups on CXCR4, we were able to identify two additional forms of sulfate, both associated with CXCR4 serine 18. Most cells appear to modify serine 18 with a sulfated group that appears not to significantly alter its mobility. This group may be a small tetrasaccharide stub characteristic of many “part time” proteoglycans, for example, α-thrombomodulin (26Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, in some cell lines, serine 18 is efficiently modified by an extended chondroitin sulfate chain. The sequence surrounding serine 18 (DGSG) is identical to many glycosaminoglycan attachment sites (for example versican and members of the syndecan family) and this sequence is conserved among human, macaque, cow, rat, mouse, and zebra fish CXCR4 (27Hirose J. Kawashima H. Yoshie O. Tashiro K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5228-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Ueno M. Yamada S. Zako M. Bernfield M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29134-29140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although we were not able to detect a contributing or inhibitory role for either the small sulfated group or the chrondroitin chain on serine 18, this evolutionary conservation suggests some role, perhaps during development, for this modification. It is noteworthy that the chondroitin modification of CXCR4 was not observed on any cells of lymphocytic origin, whereas it was observed in cells derived from other tissues. Further investigations into the role and distribution of this glycosaminoglycan modification are under way. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, CXCR4 is the first reported instance of a G-protein-coupled receptor that is modified by a glycosaminoglycan. CXCR4 is not likely to be the only CXC-chemokine receptor for which tyrosine sulfation plays an important role. Clear motifs for tyrosine sulfation are present at the amino terminus of CXCR1−CXCR6 as well as that of most CC-chemokine receptors. The general importance of tyrosine sulfation to the function of chemokine and chemotactic receptors suggests that regulation of this modification could be useful in the modulation of immune function or in disease states in which chemokine receptors participate."

The high level of functional expression and the low level of endogenous copper uptake will enable future structure-function analysis of this important protein. 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid peptide N-glycosidase F carboxyl-terminal FLAG amino-terminal FLAG intact cells membranes It has been estimated that about one-third of all known proteins contain metal cofactors, and the majority of these function as essential metalloenzymes. Copper is an essential micronutrient in humans, and it is required for cellular respiration, iron homeostasis, pigment formation, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, peptide biogenesis, connective tissue production, and antioxidant defense (1Culotta V.C.

The transport of copper into and out of cells has also received increased attention. Mutations in either of two human genes encoding copper-transporting P-type ATPases that are localized in the secretory pathway result in Menke's disease (ATP7A) and Wilson's disease (ATP7B), which cause intestinal copper absorption defects or maldistribution of hepatic copper, respectively (3DiDonato M. Sarkar B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Schaefer M. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G311-G314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two P-type ATPases are clearly essential for the controlled removal of copper from cells (9Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat.

The importance of these proteins was established in 1993; however, at that time the mechanism of copper uptake into mammalian cells was entirely unknown.An important series of studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, first appearing in 1994, provided the basis for our current ideas about the major copper entry mechanisms (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It was shown that a gene, CTR1, encoded a multispanning plasma membrane protein that was specifically required for high affinity copper transport into yeast. The CTR1 gene product is a protein composed of 406 amino acid residues. A second high affinity copper uptake protein, encoded by the CTR3 gene, was subsequently identified. The two gene products are functionally redundant and both contain three putative transmembrane segments; however, they are structurally quite different (16Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CTR3 is composed of 241 amino acid residues, and it lacks the MXXMXM motifs that are abundant in CTR1. CTR3 is relatively rich in Cys residues, containing 11 Cys residues in its sequence, although apparently only 4 of these residues may be important for function (16Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CTR1 is highly glycosylated (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has eight repeats of the MXXMXM motifs. It was speculated that the glycosylation had some functional significance (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Met motifs, which are regarded as potential metal-binding sites, are located in the amino-terminal tail that is thought to be in the predicted extracellular domain. The presence of these multiple sulfur-containing amino acid residues suggested a possible role in copper coordination. It should be borne in mind that the hydropathy analysis of these transporters suggests three transmembrane segments (see Fig. 1) and thus the amino and carboxyl termini are on opposite sides of the membrane. The reason that the amino terminus was placed on the outside in the initial models was because the Met domains were in the amino terminus, and since the proteins were copper uptake systems, copper binding was assumed to be the first step in the process. Obviously two alternatives exist, with the amino terminus at the extracellular surface and the carboxyl terminus in the cytosol, as assumed, or vice versa.In 1997 Zhou and Gitschier (17Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) identified the first human gene for copper uptake. This protein, hCTR1, was identified by complementation of a CTR1 growth defect in yeast on non-fermentable media and also rescued iron transport and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase defects. The gene was proposed to encode a high affinity copper uptake process and was found to be 29% identical at the primary structure level with Ctr1 from yeast. The human protein was, however, substantially smaller than the yeast protein, being composed of 190 amino acids as compared with 406 amino acids (see Fig. 1). hCTR1 is on the one hand a smaller protein, like yCtr3 (241 residues) but has Met motifs like yCtr1. The amino-terminal domain of hCTR1 has been described as having two Met motifs; however, the first of these is MXMXXM, rather than the usual MXXMXM, and the second is unusually methionine-rich in having the sequence MMMMXM. hCTR1 also has a methionine-rich sequence at the extracellular boundary of the second putative transmembrane segment that may be important for function. hCTR1, in contrast to CTR3, is a very Cys-poor protein having only two Cys residues, Cys-161 and Cys-189, in its sequence. The murine homolog of hCTR1, termed mCTR1, was isolated by Lee et al.(18Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) 3 years later and was shown to have 92% protein sequence identity with hCTR1. Mouse CTR1 (mCTR1) in fact has only 4 residues that differ from hCTR1 beyond the first 37 residues. Mouse CTR1 complemented yeast strains that were defective in high affinity copper uptake. The mammalian CTR1RNA was expressed in all tissues examined, with higher levels in kidney and liver and lower levels in brain and spleen (18Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recent studies (19Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) have established that expression of mammalian CTR1 is essential for embryonic development. It was shown that homozygous knock-outs resulted in embryonic lethality, whereas heterozygous animals exhibited tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. In a publication that appeared during the preparation of this article (21Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), an initial characterization of hCTR1 in mammalian cells was reported. The overexpression of hCTR1 in HEK 293 cells was described and evaluated by measuring 64Cu uptake. These authors showed time-dependent, saturable copper uptake with an apparent affinity of about 3 μm.We now describe the functional expression of hCTR1 in Sf9 cells following infection with baculovirus particles containing the cDNA for hCTR1. Heterologously expressed hCTR1 is delivered to the plasma membrane where it mediates saturable copper uptake. By utilizing mutagenic analysis of expressed hCTR1 molecules, we show that neither of the two Cys residues, Cys-161 or Cys-189, play a role in copper uptake and that glycosylation of hCTR1 is not required for function. By combining these results with experiments on proteolytic susceptibility and antibody accessibility, we provide strong evidence for a three-transmembrane segment model with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. The functional heterologous expression of hCTR1 in insect cells will enable a detailed investigation of the mechanism of this important transporter.DISCUSSIONIn the present work we have characterized the properties of hCTR1, the human copper uptake protein, following its expression in Sf9 cells. We provide evidence in support of a three transmembrane segment topology, with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. The protein is expressed in a functional form in this system, and we have initiated an analysis of residues that are potentially important in to the molecular mechanism of copper uptake.In recent years, initially in yeast and more recently in mammalian systems (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W. Vallee D. Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2001: 3105-3126Google Scholar, 5Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), it has become very clear that the cellular and organ levels of copper ions are highly regulated. Copper is an essential cofactor for a variety of cellular processes and at elevated levels is toxic to organisms. It is known that the proteins responsible for its removal, ATPases such as ATP7A and ATP7B, when disrupted result in severe human diseases, Menke's and Wilson's diseases, respectively (9Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 10Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat.

Genet. 1994; 3: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about plasma membrane copper uptake mechanisms. Recently, the protein responsible for mediating copper uptake into human cells was identified, and this protein was shown to complement copper uptake deficiency in yeast and to mediate copper uptake into mammalian cells (17Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 19Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This protein is closely related to the CTR family of proteins previously identified as mediating copper uptake in S. cerevisiae (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Membrane Topology of hCTR1The amino acid sequence of hCTR1 when examined by hydropathy analysis gives three clear transmembrane segments, which thus predicts either of the two topologies in Fig.4 A. The present work was undertaken to establish which of these orientations was correct, in a system where the hCTR1 molecule was functional. Recently, we have optimized baculovirus infection of insect cells for the characterization of structure-function relations in the renal Na+,K+-ATPase-ATPase (22Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Hu Y.K. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30734-30739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as ATP7B, the Wilson's disease protein (25Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that this system is also appropriate for the functional expression of hCTR1 and that hCTR1 expression in insect cells mediates copper uptake with a K m of ∼3.5 ± 1.3 μm, which is close to the K m values recently reported by Lee et al. (21Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).In order to distinguish between the two putative membrane orientations of hCTR1, we constructed substitution mutants at Asn-15 and Asn-112. Two different membrane orientations are predicted by hydropathy analysis of the hCTR1 amino acid sequence: one of the two consensus glycosylation sites would be extracellular (Asn-15), and the other would be intracellular (Asn-112) or vice versa (Fig. 4 A). In both models, the first putative transmembrane segment separates Asn-15 and Asn-112. Only extracellular sites of plasma membrane proteins become glycosylated at NXS and NXT consensus sequences in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data show that the correct orientation for hCTR1 is the first of the two models shown in Fig. 4 A. Expression of the substitution mutants reveals that the N15Q mutant has a lower molecular weight than the other substituted mutant (N112Q) and that the apparent mass of N15Q (23 kDa) is unaffected by treatment with PNGase F, which removes glycosylation moieties. The N112Q mutant, on the other hand, has the same molecular weight as the wild type protein and our cysteine-substituted mutants, and like these forms of the protein, its molecular mass is reduced by the treatment with PNGase F (Fig.4 C). Thus our data clearly suggest the first orientation shown in Fig. 4 A depicts the membrane orientation of hCTR1.Our transport data on the N15Q mutant also eliminate any essential involvement of protein glycosylation for the copper transport process. It was earlier observed that yCtr1 was highly glycosylated, and it was speculated that this glycosylation might play a role in transport (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This does not seem to be the case for hCTR1 in insect cells.To characterize further this suggested topology, we used hCTR1 molecules that contained the FLAG epitope fused to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of hCTR1. By probing cells that were expressing epitope-tagged hCTR1 with a FLAG antibody before and after disruption, we could ascertain which end of the molecule was extracellular and which was intracellular. As seen in Fig. 5, the FLAG antibody detects the amino-terminal epitope-tagged hCTR1 equally well whether labeled in whole cells or permeabilized cells. This suggests that the amino terminus is located outside the cell in agreement with our glycosylation data. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged hCTR1 was labeled much more extensively in the permeabilized cells as compared with the intact cells. This is the result we would expect if the FLAG epitope were located inside the cell. These data supply strong evidence that the first topological model in Fig. 4 A is correct.hCTR1 is susceptible to trypsin treatment, containing at least one cleavage site within the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2. This result lends support to the topology that has been suggested by the other results in this paper. We have demonstrated that the amino terminus of hCTR1 is located extracellular and its carboxyl terminus is intracellular. The loop between the first transmembrane and the second transmembrane segment is intracellular and has several putative tryptic cleavage sites. Trypsin treatment of hCTR1 in the absence of copper produces a stable 10-kDa fragment. The trypsin cleavage site is most likely after the first transmembrane domain for the following two reasons. The 10-kDa fragment is a carboxyl-terminal fragment as our carboxyl-terminal antibody recognizes it. The predicted mass of a carboxyl-terminal fragment cleaved by trypsin after Lys-52, the only extracellular cleavage site, is 15.4 kDa, 50% greater than the observed fragment. The predicted mass of a tryptic fragment cleaved after either Lys-87 or Arg-95 is 11.6 or 10.7 kDa, respectively. The observed size of the carboxyl-terminal fragment clearly agrees most closely with cleavage at these intracellular sites. This reasoning is supported by our observation that a tagged truncation of hCTR1 beginning at Val-62 has an apparent mobility of 16 kDa (Fig.7 B). Thus the cleavage site obtained with trypsin produces a considerably smaller fragment than the predicted cleavage at Lys-52 and is probably just after the peptide emerges from the membrane in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2. In the presence of 10 μm CuCl2, the full-length hCTR1 molecule is protected from digestion suggesting that a conformational change in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 has occurred following substrate binding. We are currently investigating the precise site(s) of cleavage, as this conformational change will be an important aspect of ligand-induced structural changes accompanying the transport process.The membrane orientation we have determined has been assumed in previous work on yeast (14Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and mammalian copper uptake proteins (18Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Presumably this is because the proteins mediate copper uptake, and the presence of the MXMXXM motifs (Met motifs) in the amino terminus suggests that this may be the site of initial copper binding by the protein. The present work puts this topology proposal on firm experimental ground.The Role of Cysteine Residues in hCTR1In the other closely related yeast proteins, CTR1 and CTR3 (16Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), there are numerous cysteine residues that may play a role in copper transport. hCTR1 has only two cysteine residues, and our work shows that neither is essential for function. The K m value for each of the cysteine-substituted mutants is similar to wild type hCTR1 in our system (see Table II). Neither of the two cysteines is conserved in other non-mammalian CTR1 proteins. Therefore, our work and the lack of conservation of these residues in closely related copper transport proteins suggests strongly that copper-protein interactions during transport must occur at other candidate copper-coordinating residues, such as methionine (in Met motifs) or histidine.Additionally, our cysteine substitution mutants do provide some evidence that the oligomerization of hCTR1 described previously (16Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,21Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) may be mediated through interactions at its carboxyl-terminal end. Because hCTR1 has only 190 amino acids and contains only three membrane segments, it has been suggested that the functional form of hCTR1 is probably a multimer. Pena et al. (16Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have shown that yCtr3 and more recently hCTR1 does indeed form multimers (21Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In the presence of cross-linker, stable multimers of hCTR1 can be obtained. The structure and interactions of these multimers is unknown. We provide evidence that suggests the carboxyl terminus of hCTR1 may play a role in the formation and stabilization of functional hCTR1 complexes. hCTR1 molecules expressed in insect cells form stable oligomers even in the presence of SDS in Laemmli gels (see Fig. 6). Treatment of NT-FLAG-tagged hCTR1 with β-mercaptoethanol dramatically reduces the amount of oligomerization seen in SDS gels (see Fig. 6), implying that S–S bridge formation may be involved in stabilizing these multimers. In support of this, the C189S mutant shows only monomeric species in SDS gels (see Fig. 6). However, since C189S is functional in copper transport (see Table II), the formation of such putative S–S bridges cannot be essential. In keeping with the idea that the carboxyl-terminal segment is involved in monomer-monomer interactions and stabilization of multimers, our CT-FLAG construct also shows predominantly monomeric species in SDS gels (data not shown), as if the epitope interferes with such interactions. Further experiments are underway to elucidate a functional role (if any) for multimerization. Currently, it appears that detergent stability of hCTR1 complexes may be facilitated by S–S bond formation, but such bonding is not essential for function. If functional hCTR1, by necessity, forms multimers, other interactions must occur to facilitate their formation in the native state.The agreement in the apparent affinities of hCTR1 for copper, following expression in mammalian cells and insect cells, coupled with the very low endogenous copper uptake activity of Sf9 cells, indicates that the baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells will be highly appropriate for the detailed characterization of hCTR1. In summary, we have shown that hCTR1, the protein responsible for mediating copper uptake into human cells, has an extracellular amino terminus and a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (see Fig.8). Mutation of the two putativeN-linked glycosylation sites or the two native cysteine residues has no significant effect on copper uptake in Sf9 cells. Mutagenesis reveals Asn-15 as a glycosylation site for hCTR1. Additionally, our data suggest that the intracellular carboxyl terminus may be involved in forming stable multimers. This protein has few of the typical consensus metal-binding sequences associated with copper-dependent proteins, and the heterologous expression of this protein in Sf9 cells offers the opportunity to begin to address important questions that relate to the mechanism of copper entry into mammalian cells and the organization as well as structure-function relations in hCTR1.Figure 8Model of hCTR1.

https://openalex.org/W2150003211,"Increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis at the site of blastocyst apposition in the uterus are two hallmarks of the implantation process. The present investigation shows that although the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flk-1, are primarily important for uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis prior to and during the attachment phase of the implantation process, VEGF in complementation with the angiopoietins and their receptor, Tie-2, directs angiogenesis during decidualization following implantation. Mice with null mutation for the gene encoding cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis, show implantation and decidualization failure. Using reporter and mutant mice, we show here that COX-2-derived prostaglandins (PGs) are important for uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis during implantation and decidualization, suggesting that one cause of the failure of these latter processes in Cox-2(−/−) mice is the deregulated vascular events in the absence of COX-2. The attenuation of uterine angiogenesis in these mice is primarily due to defective VEGF signaling and not due to the defective angiopoietin system. Increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis at the site of blastocyst apposition in the uterus are two hallmarks of the implantation process. The present investigation shows that although the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flk-1, are primarily important for uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis prior to and during the attachment phase of the implantation process, VEGF in complementation with the angiopoietins and their receptor, Tie-2, directs angiogenesis during decidualization following implantation. Mice with null mutation for the gene encoding cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis, show implantation and decidualization failure. Using reporter and mutant mice, we show here that COX-2-derived prostaglandins (PGs) are important for uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis during implantation and decidualization, suggesting that one cause of the failure of these latter processes in Cox-2(−/−) mice is the deregulated vascular events in the absence of COX-2. The attenuation of uterine angiogenesis in these mice is primarily due to defective VEGF signaling and not due to the defective angiopoietin system. vascular endothelial growth factor angiopoietin-1 prostaglandin carbarprostacyclin peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor retinoid X receptor platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 9-cis-retinoic acid Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels originate from pre-existing vessels, occurs primarily in the uterus and ovary in the adult during the reproductive cycle and pregnancy (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7230) Google Scholar). Increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis are essential for successful implantation and placentation. Vascular permeability and angiogenesis are profoundly influenced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 (2Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Brown L.F. Dvorak A.M. Claesson-Welsh L.

In mice, VEGF isoforms are shorter by one amino acid than those in humans. We have recently shown that VEGF isoforms and VEGF receptors are expressed differentially in the mouse uterus, suggesting a role for VEGF in uterine angiogenesis during implantation (8Halder J.B.

VEGF effects are complemented and coordinated by another class of angiogenic factors, the angiopoietins (9Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D.

In contrast to the agonistic functions of Ang-1, Ang-2 behaves as an antagonist. Thus, Ang-1 and Ang-2 are naturally occurring positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis, respectively. They interact with an endothelial cell-specific tyrosine kinase receptor, Tie-2 (16Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Claesson-Welsh L. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Vascular Growth Factors and Angiogenesis. 237. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 173-185Google Scholar). Recently two additional members of the angiopoietin family have been identified. Ang-3, which is expressed in mice, appears to function as an antagonist to Ang-1 activation of Tie-2 in a fashion similar to Ang-2 (17Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Ang-4, the human counterpart of Ang-3, functions as an agonist to Tie-2 (17Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J.A. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, definitive biological functions of Ang-3 and Ang-4 remain unclear. One of the prerequisites for the initiation of implantation is an increased endometrial vascular permeability at the site of blastocyst apposition. This is followed by progressive endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis at the implantation site. The mechanisms by which these increased uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis occur are still poorly understood. Furthermore, very limited information is available regarding the roles of angiopoietins in uterine angiogenesis. We have previously shown that estrogen and progesterone have different effects in vivo. Estrogen promotes uterine vascular permeability but profoundly inhibits angiogenesis, whereas progesterone stimulates angiogenesis with little effect on vascular permeability. These effects of estrogen and progesterone are mediated by differential spatiotemporal expression of VEGF and its receptors in the uterus (18Ma W. Tan J. Matsumoto H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We speculated that prostaglandins (PGs), because of their roles in angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation in other systems, also participate in uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis during implantation and decidualization. These lipid mediators are generated via the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. COX is the rate-limiting enzyme for conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the common substrate for various prostaglandin (PG) synthases (19Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COX exists in two isoforms that are encoded by two separate genes, Cox-1 andCox-2. Gene targeting experiments in mice have established distinct functions for these isoforms. Although COX-1-deficient females are fertile with specific parturition defects, COX-2-deficient females are largely infertile with abnormalities in ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization (20Matsumoto H.

Our recent evidence shows that COX-2-derived prostacyclin (PGI2) is the primary PG at the implantation site, and that this PG participates in implantation via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ (PPARδ) (24Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W-G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Although COX-2 is essential for normal blastocyst implantation and decidualization (21Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), it is not yet clear whether uterine vascular events are major targets for COX-2-derived PGs. We have exploited the availability of reporter and mutant mice to explore the role of COX-2 in uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis during implantation and decidualization. We present here molecular, genetic, physiologic, and pharmacological evidence that COX-2-derived PGs profoundly influence uterine angiogenesis. Our previous and present results provide evidence that whereas ovarian steroid hormones influence uterine vascular permeability and angiogenesis during the preimplantation period, COX-2-derived PGs direct these events during implantation and decidualization by differentially regulating VEGF and angiopoietin signaling. Adult CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Raleigh, NC). Flk-1-deficient mice were generated by disruption of the Flk-1 gene using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (12Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar). A targeting vector was constructed in which the translated portion of the first coding exon and the proximal part of the first intron of the Flk-1 gene were replaced by a promoterless β-galactosidase gene fromEscherichia coli, leaving the Flk-1 promoter intact. Therefore, β-galactosidase expression is used as a read-out for Flk-1 promoter activity. COX-2-deficient mice were generated as described previously (22Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D. Focht R.J. Johnston J.J. Jaffee B.D. Covington M.B. Contel N.R. Eng V.M. Collins R.J. Czerniak P.M. Gorry S.A. Trazskos J.M. Nature. 1995; 378: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar).Cox-2(−/−)×Flk-1(+/−)lacZ double mutant mice were generated by crossingFlk-1(+/−)lacZ females with Cox-2(−/−) males. PCR analysis of genomic DNA determined the genotype. Homozygosity of Cox-2 null mice was further confirmed by measuring blood urea nitrogen level (21Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). All mice were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City, KS) according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. In situhybridization was performed as described previously (8Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wang J. Dey S.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Sense or antisense 35S-labeled cRNA probes were generated using appropriate polymerases with mouse-specific cDNAs toAng-1, Ang-2, Ang-3, Tie-2, and Vegf 164. Ang-1, Ang-2, and Tie-2 cDNAs were kindly provided by Peter Carmeliet (Flanders InterUniversity Institute, Leuveen, Belgium). The Ang-3 probe was generated by PCR cloning using specific primers. The source of Vegf and Flk-1cDNAs were described previously (8Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wang J. Dey S.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Probes had specific activities of about 2 × 109 dpm/μg. In brief, frozen sections (10 μm) were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The sections were prehybridized and hybridized at 45 °C for 4 h in 50% formamide hybridization buffer containing the 35S-labeled antisense cRNA probes. RNase A-resistant hybrids were detected by autoradiography. Sections were post-stained with eosin and hematoxylin. Sections hybridized with the sense probes did not result in any positive hybridization. lacZ staining assessed the expression of β-galactosidase as described previously (26Hogan B.L.M. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). In brief, small pieces of tissues were fixed in 0.2% paraformaldehyde solution followed by infusion in 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight. Tissues were embedded in OCT and snap-frozen. Frozen sections were mounted onto glass slides and stained overnight at 37 °C using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Sections were counterstained with eosin. Pseudopregnancy in wild-type or Cox-2(−/−) mice was induced by mating with wild-type vasectomized males. Day 4 wild-type blastocysts were transferred into the uteri of day 4 pseudopregnant recipients (21Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K.

A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). On day 6 or 8, the implantation sites were collected after intravenous injections of Chicago Blue B dye solution in saline (27Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10159-10162Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). For reversal experiments, cPGI and PGE2(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were prepared in 10% ethanol, 90% saline. The first injection (4 μg/mouse, intraperitoneal) was given at 5:00 p.m. on the day of blastocyst transfer followed by single injections each day until mice were sacrificed. 9-Cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), purchased fromBiomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), was administrated (10 μg/mouse, intraperitoneal) alone or with cPGI following the same schedule.Cox-2(−/−) recipients were supplemented with exogenous progesterone (P4) (2 mg/mouse) from day 3 until sacrificed. Frozen longitudinal uterine sections (10 μm) were subjected to immunostaining using a rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody to PECAM (PECAM-1, BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) at a dilution of 1:50 using a Histostain-SP kit (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA) as described previously (17Valenzuela D.M.

Several studies have examined the expression of a number of gene products known to control angiogenesis in the uterus, including VEGF and its receptors, but without investigating uterine angiogenic status. Thus, our first objective was to delineate the normal pattern of angiogenesis in the mouse uterus during the peri-implantation period using a reporter mouse model. Flk-1 is an established marker of endothelial cell development and angiogenesis (18Ma W. Tan J. Matsumoto H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Yamashita J. Itoh H. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Yurugi T. Naito M. Nakao K. Nishikawa S.

Mice with the Flk-1 gene disrupted with an insertion of the E. coli β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene (12Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) were used to study uterine angiogenesis. Although the Flk-1(−/−)lacZ embryos die in utero, Flk-1(+/−)lacZ embryos are viable, andFlk-1(+/−)lacZ females have normal fertility. Thus,Flk-1(+/−)lacZ mice, hereafter termedFlk-1 lacZ, with β-galactosidase expression as a read-out for Flk-1 promoter activity and as an endothelial cell marker, served as a powerful genetic model to examine uterine angiogenesis during the peri-implantation period (Fig.1). The level ofFlk-1 lacZ expression was very low to undetectable on day 1 of pregnancy when the uterus is primarily under the influence of preovulatory estrogen. With rising progesterone levels from the newly formed corpora lutea thereafter, an increasing number oflacZ-stained blood vessels was noted in the stromal bed. This is consistent with our observation of steroidal regulation of uterine angiogenesis in mice (18Ma W. Tan J. Matsumoto H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On day 5 following implantation, a further increase in the number of lacZ-stained blood vessels was observed at the site of implantation. With the differentiation of the stroma into primary and secondary decidual zones at the implantation site on day 6, an interesting pattern of angiogenesis was noted. An increased number of lacZ-stained blood vessels was present in the secondary decidual zone, but the primary decidual zone was devoid of such blood vessels. On days 7 and 8, progressive increases in the density of lacZ-stained blood vessels were noted in the deciduum with higher density at the mesometrial pole of the implantation site, the presumptive site of placentation. Collectively, the results show that there is heightened angiogenesis in the stromal bed with the onset of implantation and during decidualization. VEGF is one of the primary inducers of vascular permeability and angiogenesis in the uterus (reviewed in Ref. 18Ma W. Tan J. Matsumoto H. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previously, we observed that the expression of Vegf 164, the most active and abundant VEGF isoform, is modest and restricted to the epithelial cells on days 1 and 2 but becomes localized to stromal cells at higher levels on days 3 and 4. The expression level further increases in decidualizing stromal cells from day 5 onward. Our previous observation also showed that the expression ofFlk-1 is low to undetectable on the first 2 days of pregnancy but shows progressive increases in the stromal bed from day 3 onward (8Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Again, the expression was absent in the primary decidual zone. Because angiopoietins coordinate with VEGF for full complementation of angiogenesis, our next objective was to determine whether the angiopoietin system was involved in this event during the peri-implantation period. We examined the spatiotemporal expression of Ang-1, Ang-2,Ang-3, and Tie-2 in the uterus on days 1–8 of pregnancy by in situ hybridization (Fig.2). On days 1–5, the expression levels of Ang-1, Ang-2, and Ang-3 were very low to undetectable in any uterine cell types. On day 6, althoughAng-1 expression was restricted to the secondary decidual cells and undifferentiated stromal cells away from the implanting embryo, Ang-2 expression was primarily observed in decidual cells close to the implanting embryo along the mesometrial and antimesometrial poles. Ang-3 expression was very low on this day. On day 7, Ang-1 expression became further restricted to a thin layer of undifferentiated stromal cells along the myometrium. The pattern of Ang-2 expression on day 7 was similar to that observed on day 6 but at much higher levels. Ang-3, whose expression was not detected on earlier days, became prominent on day 7 and followed the pattern of Ang-2 expression. On day 8, a very low level of expression of Ang-1 was detected only in a small number of stromal cells at the mesometrial pole just underneath the myometrium. In contrast, patterns of Ang-2 andAng-3 expression similar to those observed on day 7 persisted through day 8. However, the expression pattern ofTie-2, a receptor for the angiopoietins, was most similar to that observed for Flk-1 on days 1–8 (Fig. 1) (8Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,30Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Dey S.K. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our previous and present results suggest that although VEGF signaling is the primary stimulus for uterine angiogenesis prior to and during implantation, the coordinated interaction between VEGF and the angiopoietins signals increasing angiogenesis in the deciduum during the postimplantation period. COX-2-derived PGs are known to participate in angiogenesis in other systems and in tumors (31Seno H. Oshima M. Ishikawa T.O. Oshima H. Takaku K. Chiba T. Narumiya S. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 506-511PubMed Google Scholar, 32Masferrer J.L. Leahy K.M. Koki A.T. Zweifel B.S. Settle S.L. Woerner B.M. Edwards D.A. Flickinger A.G. Moore R.J. Seibert K.

Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to examine the role of COX-2-derived PGs in uterine angiogenesis during implantation and decidualization. We used COX-2-deficient mice as a model system to study the role of COX-2-derived PGs in uterine angiogenesis relevant to implantation and decidualization. Although implantation is mostly defective in Cox-2(−/−) mice, a small number of wild-type blastocysts, after transfer into day 4 pseudopregnant progesterone-treated Cox-2(−/−) recipients, shows some implantation-like reactions but fails to provoke normal vascular permeability (blue reaction) and decidual cell reaction (24Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W-G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that PGI2 is the most abundant PG followed by PGE2 at the implantation site. A PGI2 agonist, carbarprostacyclin (cPGI), functions as a ligand for PPARδ and facilitates its heterodimerization with RXR. When administered alone or in combination with an RXR agonist, cPGI can improve implantation in Cox-2(−/−) mice (24Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W-G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Thus, our first objective was to confirm our previous observation that cPGI (a more stable analogue of PGI2) plus an RXR agonist, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), improves poor implantation in Cox-2(−/−) mice (24Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W-G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar); then we compared uterine angiogenic status during inferior and improved implantation and decidualization in Cox-2(−/−) mice PPARs heterodimerize with RXRs for transcriptional regulation. Although cPGI alone modestly induces transcriptional activation of PPARδ, a combination of cPGI with 9-cis-RA, a ligand for RXR, leads to a profound synergistic transcriptional activation of PPARδ activity in vitro (24Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W-G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of cPGI and 9-cis-RA with that of the vehicle on angiogenesis and implantation in Cox-2(−/−) mice after transfer of wild-type blastocysts. As shown in TableI, 44 of 105 (42%) blastocysts had implanted in all wild-type recipients (n = 8) when examined on day 6. In contrast, only 39 of 256 (15%) blastocysts showed implantation in 9 of 19 Cox-2(−/−) control recipients, and the implantation sites were considerably smaller and pale-looking in appearance. Combined administration of cPGI and 9-cis-RA significantly improved the implantation rate (59 of 112 (53%) blastocysts implanted in all Cox-2(−/−)-treated recipients (n = 8)). In addition, the size of these sites was larger with more a distinct blue response. However, administration of 9-cis-RA alone was not very effective in rescuing implantation in Cox-2(−/−) mice (Table I). These results are consistent with our previous observation, suggesting that the effects of COX-2-derived PGI2 in implantation are mediated primarily via activation of PPARδ. Implantation sites obtained from Cox-2(−/−) mice on day 6 or day 8 with or without treatments with the agonists were further examined for angiogenic status.Table IImplantation of wild-type blastocysts transferred into pseudopregnant wild-type or Cox-2(−/−) mice treated with cPGI and 9-cis-RAGenotypeTreatmentNo. of recipientsNo. of mice with ISNo. of blastocysts transferredNo. of IS(%)(%)(+/+)Vehicle88 (100)1-aValues with different superscripts are significantly different (p < 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2058873141,"ALG-2-interacting proteinX (Alix), also known as AIP1, is a cytoplasmic protein ubiquitously expressed and concentrated in phagosomes and exosomes. Alix may regulate apoptosis since it bindsapoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2), a Ca2+-binding protein necessary for cell death, and also overexpression of its C-terminal half (Alix-CT) blocks death induced by several stimuli. This part of Alix contains a long proline-rich domain containing several potential SH3-binding sites. Using Alix as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse brain library, we have found that SH3p4, SH3p8, and SH3p13, collectively known as endophilins, bind to Alix. Co-immunoprecipitations and overlay experiments allowed us to demonstrate that endophilins bind to Alix-CT through an SH3/proline-rich domain interaction. We have narrowed the region of Alix interacting with endophilins down to 14 amino acids containing a PXRPPPP consensus sequence, also present in synaptojanin and germinal center kinase-like kinase, allowing their interaction to endophilins. We further show that overexpression of Alix-CT, which blocks cell death, leads to cytoplasmic vacuolization into tubulo-vesicular structures delineated by Alix-CT. This vacuolization phenomenon is greatly enhanced upon co-expression with endophilins and may be part of the protecting mechanism afforded by Alix-CT.

Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), an effect similar to that seen upon overexpression of the C-terminal half of Alix/AIP-1, which contains the ALG-2-interacting domain (4Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Even though Alix and ALG-2 functions remain obscure, these observations have suggested that both proteins participate in the cell death program. Alix is a 869-amino acid long cytoplasmic protein that is broadly conserved throughout species. Rim 20p, a homologue of Alix inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, was recently shown to interact with a transcription factor (Rim 101p) and, through SNF7p, with a cysteine protease (Rim 13p), thereby allowing cleavage of Rim 101p (5Xu W. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6917-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SNF7p/VPS32p is involved in endosomal trafficking (5Xu W. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6917-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Alix possesses no obvious enzymatic signature, but its last 150 amino acids are particularly rich in proline (32%), tyrosine, and glutamine residues and contain several Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding motives (PXXP) and two WW binding domains (PPXY). This 150-amino acid-long proline-rich domain (PRD) interacts with the second SH3 domain of SETA (SH3 domain expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes), also described as Ruk (7Chen B. Borinstein S.C.

Boulter J. Bogler O. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Expression of the SETA gene is associated with tumorigenic state in astrocytes. Overexpression of SETA proteins capable of binding Alix sensitized astrocytes to UV light-induced cell death, whereas parts of SETA not binding to Alix had no effect (7Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19275-19281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Ruk was described as an adapter protein, forming complexes with the p85α regulatory subunit of the class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, thereby inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity of the enzyme. This activity may explain how overexpressing SETA/Ruk induced apoptosis of cultured primary neurons from the peripheral nervous system (8Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B. Filonenko V. Matsuka G. Davies A.M. Waterfield M. Buchman V.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because the interaction between Alix and SETA/Ruk further suggested a role for Alix in controlling cell death, we searched for pathways that may be regulated by Alix. As a first step we screened for Alix-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid method. We found that Alix interacts with 3 proteins, SH3p4, SH3p8, and SH3p13, which all share almost identical SH3 domains and are known as endophilins or EEN proteins (for review, see Ref. 10Huttner W.B. Schmidt A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These proteins are known to regulate membrane shape during endocytosis, possibly through their lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity (11Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) or by regulating enzymes like synaptojanin and dynamin with which they interact through their SH3 domains (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 13Hill E. van Der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We narrowed the site of interaction on Alix down to a 14-mer peptide, which shows strong homologies to endophilin binding regions of synaptojanin and of the germinal center kinase-like kinase (14Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We also observed that, when overexpressed, the C-terminal half of Alix (Alix-CT), which is known to block cell death, induces the formation of, and accumulates around, a tubulo-vesicular cytoplasmic compartment containing endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. When the same Alix-CT is co-expressed with endophilins, the vacuoles/tubules are drastically enlarged and can even form very large spherical vacuoles with a diameter of up to several microns. Alix cDNA was cloned into the yeast expression vector pGBT9 containing the GAL-4 DNA binding domain (CLONTECH) to be used as bait in a two-hybrid screen of an adult mouse brain library cDNA (CLONTECH). The screen was performed in S. cerevisiae Y190 according to the matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol (CLONTECH). Yeast DNA from positive clones was recovered and transformed into DH5-α. Coding sequences for mouse SH3p4 and SH3p8 (accession numbers MMU58886 and MMU58885, respectively) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega) in-frame with the Myc epitope sequence located to the N terminus. ΔSH3p4 corresponds to SH3p4 lacking the last 37 amino acids, encompassing 60% of the SH3 domain and generated by using the unique EcoRV site. ΔSH3p8, which lacks the C-terminal fragment starting at aa 303, 4 amino acids upstream of the SH3 domain, was made using the unique SphI site of SH3p8. FLAG-Alix wild type corresponds to mouse Alix cDNA (MMAJ5073) subcloned into pCI FLAG. Alix-CT and -NT have been described in Missotten et al. (1Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Alix-CT corresponds to a fragment expanding from amino acid 468 to 869 of Alix, whereas Alix-NT correspond to amino acids 1–434. Both Alix cDNAs have been subcloned into pCI-FLAG vector. Alix ΔPP14 and Alix ΔPGY were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, two complementary primers were chosen for each deletion. The desired deletion was located within primers having 16–18 bases of correct sequences on both sides. Each couple of primers was extended during temperature cycling using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase with FLAG-Alix wild type construct as a template. Parental cDNA was then digested by the DpnI endonuclease, and newly synthesized mutation-containing cDNA was transformed intoXL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Complementary primers used for ΔPP14 variants were 5′-CCAGCCCCAAGAACCATGGTGCTTCCTGCAAACCG-3′ and 5′-CGGTTTGCAGGAGCACCATGGTTCTTGGGGCTGG-3′; the deletion extended from amino acids 748 to 761. The primers used to construct ΔPGY were 5′-GCCACAGGCTCAGGGATGCCAAATGCCCATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATGGGCATTTGGCATCCCTGAGCCTGTGGC-3′; in this case the deletion extended from amino acids 802 to 813. Alix lacking the proline-rich domain starting with Pro-717 (ΔPRD) was generated using a modification of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (15Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E78Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which allows the introduction simultaneously of mutations at multiple sites. Only one 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primer is required for a mutation site, and for simultaneous introductions, all primers need to be located on the same strand. Primers are extended in a PCR reaction where a Taq DNA ligase is added to repair a DNA break into the mutated strand. DpnI is added, and two additional PCR cycles are performed to synthesize strand complementary to the mutated strand. Using this modified protocol, we introduced two PmeI sites flanking the PRD of Alix, with primers 5′-CTGCAGCAGAGCATTGCCAGTTTAAACAGCGCTCCTTCAATCCCTC-3′ and 5′-CCCCCGCAGCAGTCCTACTATCCACAGCAGTAACGCTGCCACGTGA-3′ in FLAG-Alix wild type. The construct was then digested by PmeI and ligated. The resulting mutant, FLAG-Alix ΔPRD, lacks a fragment encompassing proline 717 to proline 867. Finally, a FLAG-Alix-CTΔPRD was generated by deleting the fragment located between the twoPvuII sites in FLAG-Alix ΔPRD; the deletion extended from amino acids 10 to 436 of Alix ΔPRD, giving a construct where the first 9 amino acids of Alix are linked to the Alix-CT deprived of the PRD domain. The complete coding regions of Alix, Myc-tagged SH3p4, or Myc-tagged ΔSH3p4 were subcloned in a bacterial expression vector (pGEX 6P-2, Amersham Biosciences) in fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 purified on GSH-Sepharose and cleaved away from GST with the PreScission protease according to the manufacturers' instructions. The polyclonal anti-Alix antibody was raised by injecting rabbits (Covalab, Lyon, France) with 200 μg of purified recombinant Alix. IgGs were purified on protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). Anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Sigma, respectively, and the goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was from Jackson Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against EEA1 and GM130 were from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Lamp1 and mtHSP70 were from BD PharMingen and Affinity Bioreagents, respectively. Mouse Anti-Grp78 monoclonal antibody against the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal KDEL sequence was from StressGen Biotechnologies. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. For transfections, cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104cells/cm2 onto plastic or on glass coverslips. The cells were transfected on the next day using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation 24 or 48 h after transfection. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (142.5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (complete, EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 ×g. One-third of each lysate was preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem). After discarding the beads, these lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Protein A-agarose was then added to the antibody-containing supernatants and incubated for a further hour at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before transfer to nylon membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with an anti-FLAG polyclonal primary antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were revealed with an anti-Myc polyclonal antibody followed by a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. HEK 293 cell lysates and mouse brain extracts were prepared as described in the previous and following paragraphs, respectively. Proteins (10 μg/lane) were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nylon membranes. Membranes were saturated in blocking solution (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with 10 μg/ml Myc-tagged recombinant purified protein in blocking solution. After 2.5 h, membranes were washed in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and the bound recombinant protein was revealed with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody followed by a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Adult mouse brain was homogenized in lysis buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors EDTA-free). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4 °C. Cytosolic protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Two hundred μg of these proteins were diluted in rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris base, 20 mm spermine, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer) and first separated according to their isoelectric points along non-linear IPG strips, 7 cm long, pH 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences). Sample loading was performed by in-gel re-swelling. The strips were equilibrated in a solution containing 1% dithiothreitol for 15 min followed by a solution containing 2.5% iodoacetamide for 10 min. The proteins were then separated according to their molecular mass using standard SDS-PAGE. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.02% saponin in TBS for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h with the indicated antibodies. Primary antibodies were revealed with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G coupled to Alexa 594 or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes), diluted in saponin/TBS. Nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) and observed with an Axiovert microscope (Zeiss) or a confocal laser-scanning microscope LSM 410 (Zeiss). We set out to identify and characterize Alix-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. A cDNA encoding full-length Alix was fused to the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 transcription factor and used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain (the same library as that used to search for ALG-2-interacting proteins in Missotten et al. (1Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)). Thirty-two positive clones were obtained of 4 million transformants. Two identical clones were found to code for full-length ALG-2. One clone coded for the C-terminal half of Alix (starting at aa 456), suggesting that this domain of the protein can form oligomers. Among 16 other clones, 8 coded for SH3p13 (4 different clones), 5 coded for SH3p4 (3 different clones), and 3 coded for SH3p8. The three proteins contain one C-terminal SH3 domain and are collectively known as endophilins since they are involved in endocytosis and are highly homologous (68% overall identity), sharing almost identical SH3 domains (16Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). They are also referred to as SHGL2 and endophilin I for SH3p4, which is brain-specific, SH3GL1 and endophilin II for SH3p8, which is ubiquitously expressed, SH3GL3 and endophilin III for SH3p13, which is expressed in brain and testis (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). All prays obtained encompass the SH3 domain, with the shortest clone starting at aa 124 for SH3p13, and at aa 155 for SH3p4 and SH3p8. None of the other clones obtained, which will be described elsewhere, coded for other SH3 domain-containing proteins, suggesting that endophilins are specific partners for Alix in vivo. To verify that the interaction between Alix and endophilins revealed using the yeast two-hybrid system reflects their ability to interact in intact cells, we overexpressed different forms of Alix (Fig. 1 A) and endophilins (SH3p4 or SH3p8) in HEK 293 cells and tested for their interactions by co-immunoprecipitations. Fig.2 shows the results of such an experiment using cells transiently co-transfected with expression vectors coding for Myc-tagged full-length or truncated SH3p8 and for FLAG-tagged full-length or truncated Alix (Alix-NT and Alix-CT, which correspond to the N-terminal half and C-terminal half of the protein, respectively (Fig. 1 A)). The overall expression of truncated and full-length Alix and SH3p8 was monitored in all cell extracts using a mixture of antibodies to Myc and to FLAG (Fig. 2 c). Alix proteins were immunoprecipitated from these homogenates using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, and the presence of full-length or truncated forms of Alix in the blotted immunoprecipitates was verified using a polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2 b). We used an anti-Myc antibody to test if Myc-tagged SH3p8 was present in the same immunoprecipitates. As seen in Fig. 2 a, SH3p8 does indeed co-precipitate with full-length Alix and with Alix-CT, which contains the PRD but not with the N-terminal half of the protein (Alix-NT). Binding of SH3p8 to Alix required an intact SH3 domain, as no endophilin lacking its SH3 domain (ΔSH3p8) was detected in Alix or Alix-CT immunoprecipitates. Using a similar set of experiments we have also demonstrated that SH3p4 co-immunoprecipitates with Alix and Alix-CT (not shown). These findings strongly suggest that Alix and endophilins bind through a PRD/SH3 interaction.Figure 2SH3p8 co-immunoprecipitates with the C-terminal half of Alix through its SH3 domain. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for FLAG-tagged Alix, Alix-CT, or Alix-NT together with plasmids coding for Myc-tagged SH3p8 or ΔSH3p8.a and b, FLAG-tagged Alix proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and blotted onto a nylon membrane. a, the presence of SH3p8 in the immunoprecipitate was tested with an anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. b, the presence of Alix proteins within the immunoprecipitates was verified with an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody.c, expression levels of the transfected proteins were controlled in total cell lysates using anti-FLAG and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further evidence for a direct interaction between endophilins and Alix is brought by overlay experiments; lysates from HEK 293 cells overexpressing different forms of Alix were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Nylon membranes. Purified Myc-tagged recombinant SH3p4 was incubated on the membrane, and its binding was revealed with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3 a). SH3p4 bound strongly to a protein migrating around 100 kDa in all cell lysates (gray arrow), which was identified as endogenously expressed Alix, since it is recognized by the polyclonal anti-Alix antibody (Fig. 3 c). The recombinant endophilin also bound to overexpressed full-length Alix (black arrow) and to its C-terminal half but not to its N-terminal half (not shown). The molecular mass of overexpressed Alix is higher than that of endogenous Alix due to 26 extra amino acids corresponding to two FLAG tags. Binding of endophilin to Alix occurs through an SH3/PRD interaction since (i) Alix ΔPRD, which lacks the C-terminal PRD, did not bind full-length SH3p4 (Fig. 3 a), and (ii) recombinant ΔSH3P4, which is truncated from its SH3 domain, did not bind any forms of Alix in the same HEK 293 cell extracts (Fig. 3 b). We noticed that Alix PRD contains a 14-amino acid sequence (aa 748–761) highly homologous to the demonstrated endophilin-binding site of synaptojanin 1 (18Gad H. Ringstad N. Low P. Kjaerulff O. Gustafsson J. Wenk M. Di Paolo G. Nemoto Y. Crun J. Ellisman M.H. De Camilli P. Shupliakov O. Brodin L. Neuron. 2000; 27: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and of the rat germinal center kinase-like kinase (14Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). This sequence of Alix represents the region of interaction with the SH3 domain of endophilin, since SH3p4 does not bind to Alix lacking these amino acids (Alix ΔPP14 in Fig.3 a). Deletion of other amino acids (802–813) within the PRD of Alix had no effect on endophilin binding (Alix ΔPGY in Fig.3 a). We also used the overlay assay to test if Alix expressed in adult mouse brain binds to SH3p4. In blotted brain homogenate supernatants, SH3p4 stained 1 band at 150 kDa and 2 doublets migrating at 100 and 75 kDa (Fig. 4 A). This pattern is in good agreement with that found by McPherson and co-workers (14Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

Based on molecular masses, they identified within the endophilin-binding proteins, synaptojanin at 145 kDa and dynamin and germinal center kinase-like kinase, both migrating at 100 kDa. We show that the lower band of the 100-kDa doublet binding SH3p4 was also recognized by anti-Alix antibodies (Fig. 4 A). The reason for the slightly higher molecular mass of Alix in brain compared with in HEK 293 cells is unknown. To further discriminate between 100-kDa brain proteins binding SH3p4, we performed an overlay assay on brain homogenates that had been separated on two-dimensional gels (Fig.4 B). In the 100-kDa range, SH3p4 two discrete spots with an isoelectric point in the range of the theoretical isoelectric point calculated for Alix (pI 6.15) (Fig. 4 B, a). On the same membrane, the polyclonal anti-Alix antibody recognized three spots, the two more acidic co-migrating exactly with those binding SH3p4 (Fig. 4 B, b). An antibody against synaptojanin (a kind gift of P. De Camilli) labeled the upper band migrating around 150 kDa (not shown). The proteins binding SH3p4, which migrate in the basic range, have not been identified. As described by others, we found that in HEK 293 cells, overexpressed Alix is cytoplasmic and concentrated in the perinuclear region and at the cell periphery in lamellipodia and filopodia (Fig. 5 A). A similar distribution was observed with Alix-NT (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, overexpressed Alix-CT containing the endophilin binding region is concentrated around perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 5,C, D, and E). These vesicles were also seen when Alix-CT was overexpressed in 3T3 fibroblasts, NG108 neuroblastoma cells, and post-mitotic cerebellar neurons (not shown). Using confocal microscopy, we observed that some Alix-CT-induced vesicles are parts of a tubulo-vesicular network with tubes of 400–800 nm in diameter (Fig. 5 D). To test which intracellular compartments may be affected by Alix-CT, we examined the distributions of various markers in Alix-CT-transfected cells. The distribution of EEA1, an established marker for early endosomes, Lamp1, a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes, GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, mtHSP70, a mitochondrial resident protein, and MitoTracker CMTMRos, a mitochondrial marker, did not significantly differ between untransfected cells and Alix-CT-transfected cells (not shown). This suggests that none of these compartments are strongly affected by Alix-CT overexpression. In contrast, an antibody recognizing KDEL-bearing proteins, which are resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, stained around some of the tubulo-vesicular structures. Therefore Alix-CT may impair the shape of the endoplasmic reticulum or modify intracellular protein trafficking (Fig. 5, E and F). A further indication that endophilin interacts with Alix in vivo came from the perfect co-localization seen with Alix and SH3p4 overexpressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Both overexpressed proteins co-localized in cell protrusions like lamellipodia, filopodia, and in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. Knowing that the endophilin-binding site lies within Alix-CT, we performed the same type of experiments as above to verify that Alix-CT and SH3p4 interact in situ. To our surprise, co-expression of the endophilin seemed to enhance cytoplasmic vacuolization induced by Alix-CT; staining with anti-Alix antibody revealed perinuclear vacuoles considerably bigger than those found in cells overexpressing Alix-CT alone (Fig. 6 C). 24–48 h after transfection, 2–10 perinuclear spherical vacuoles delineated by Alix-CT were seen. In most extreme cases, vacuoles could reach a diameter of up to 6 μm (Fig.6 E). Alix-CT was almost exclusively found around these very large vacuoles, whereas SH3p4 not only co-localized with Alix-CT but was also present in the rest of the cytoplasm (Fig. 6, C andD). As in the case of Alix-CT alone, of all the intracellular markers tested, only anti-KDEL antibodies decorated the periphery of some of the very large vacuoles, suggesting that some of these structures may represent endoplasmic reticular membrane or that intracellular trafficking may be impaired (Fig. 6, F andG). The “very large vacuole” phenotype requires an intact SH3 domain of endophilin since Alix-CT co-expressed with ΔSH3p4 only induced the formation of tubulo-vesicular structures having the appearance of those observed in cells expressing only Alix-CT (Fig.7 C). In this paradigm, we could not detect any co-localization of Alix-CT with ΔSH3p4 (Fig. 7,C and D), demonstrating the lack of interaction between these truncated proteins. This observation suggests that interaction between Alix-CT and endophilin is necessary for inducing a very large vacuole phenotype. Alix-CT lacking the PRD (Alix-CT ΔPRD) did not cause any vacuolization when overexpressed alone (not shown) or together with endophilins (Fig. 7, A and B). As in the case of Alix-CT tubulo-vesicular structures (Fig. 7,E and F), Alix-CT/endophilin-induced vacuoles were resistant to pretreatment of cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig.7, G and H). Such a treatment left Alix-CT and SH3p4 concentrated around the vacuoles, whereas the endophilin was completely washed away from the rest of the cytoplasm (Fig.7 H). Together these data show that Alix interacts with endophilins and suggest that it modifies intracellular compartmentalization, a function synergized by endophilins. By using Alix as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that it binds to SH3 domain-containing proteins, a result that was predictable in view of the multiple potential SH3 binding motives of the long Alix PRD. More surprising to us was the specificity of the interaction, since endophilins which are identical within their SH3 domains were the only SH3-containing proteins found in our screen. However, we did not find SETA/Ruk, previously described to bind to Alix PRD (7Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19275-19281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This could be because the SH3 domain of SETA/Ruk interacting with Alix lies within the first 151 amino acids of the 665-aa-long protein (9Borinstein S.C. Hyatt M.A. Sykes V.W. Straub R.E. Lipkowitz S. Boulter J. Bogler O. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and may be only rarely represented in the mouse brain library made of oligo-dT-primed inserts. Also surprising to us was the results of overlay assays suggesting that in HEK 293 cells and in brain Alix is the main endophilin interactor. Indeed, endophilins are known partners of metalloprotease disintegrins MDC5 and MDC 9 and of the β1-adrenergic receptor, which should be absent from our extracts since they are transmembrane proteins (20Howard L.

They also bind to the 145-kDa synaptojanin 1 and to two proteins migrating around 100 kDa, dynamin and germinal center kinase-like kinase (12Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We separated soluble brain extracts on two-dimensional gels to differentiate Alix from these latter proteins, and we found that the two more acidic, from three spots recognized by our anti-Alix antibody, bound endophilin. These Alix forms may reflect different phosphorylation states of the protein, which is a demonstrated substrate of Src inXenopus (22Che S. El-Hodiri H.M. Wu C.F. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Etkin L.D. Clark R.B. Kuang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5522-5531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for Ser/Thr kinases. Of the three forms of Alix, only the two more acidic ones bound to SH3p4, a finding that may suggest that endophilin binding depends on post-translational modifications of the protein. The polyphosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin, is involved in different steps of endocytosis, and free clathrin-coated vesicles accumulate in living lamprey synapses microinjected with a peptide blocking the SH3 domain of endophilin (18Gad H. Ringstad N. Low P. Kjaerulff O. Gustafsson J. Wenk M. Di Paolo G. Nemoto Y. Crun J. Ellisman M.H. De Camilli P. Shupliakov O. Brodin L. Neuron. 2000; 27: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This peptide, PP19, lying within the synaptojanin PRD is homologous to the endophilin-binding site of germinal center kinase-like kinase (14Ramjaun A.R. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Tong X.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28913-28919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and MDC9 (20Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and also to 14 amino acids of Alix PRD (aa 748–761) (Fig. 1 B). This Alix peptide contains the endophilin-binding site with a consensus PXRPPPP conserved in Xenopus and inCaenorhabditis elegans, reminiscent of the endophilin III binding motif PXRPPXPR that Cesareni and co-workers (23Cestra G. Castagnoli L. Dente L. Minenkova O. Petrelli A. Migone N. Hoffmuller U. Schneider-Mergener J. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32001-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) define using recombinant peptides. In our case, neither overexpression of Alix nor of Alix-CT, which both contain the endophilin-interacting site, had any detectable effect on dextran- or clathrin-mediated transferrin endocytosis (not shown). This lack of effect may suggest that Alix could interact and regulate endophilins not at the plasma membrane but in cytoplasmic compartments. Recently, Farsad et al. (24Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) demonstrate that endophilin B, a protein with homology to endophilin 1, is localized to the Golgi complex, thereby underscoring a potential role of endophilin family members in diverse tubulo-vesicular membrane-trafficking events in the cell. This hypothesis is in good agreement with our finding that overexpression of Alix-CT leads to accumulation of perinuclear tubulo-vesicular structures, which were transformed into a few very large vacuoles upon co-expression with endophilins. Overexpressing endophilins alone had no vacuolization effect, and endophilin lacking the SH3 domain did not synergize with Alix-CT. Furthermore, Alix-CT devoid of its PRD region and, therefore, unable to interact with endophilins had no vacuolating effect in HEK 293 cells. Our current hypothesis is that Alix-CT deforms intracellular membranes by interacting with and modifying the activity of endogenously expressed endophilin and that increasing the expression of endophilin further enhances this phenomenon. The intracellular membrane-deforming activity may be due to the lysophosphatidic acid-acyltransferase activity described for endophilin I, which may modify membrane curvature (10Huttner W.B. Schmidt A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) also show that recombinant SH3p4 binds directly to liposomes, deforming them into tubules with diameters of 20–100 nm. It will now be of interest to test if recombinant Alix-CT can activate endophilin in the liposome assay described above or if it can affect its lysophosphatidic acid-acyltransferase activity. It has been difficult to determine precisely which intracellular compartment Alix-CT and endophilins do affect. Proteomic studies demonstrate that Alix is highly enriched in phagosomes (25Garin J. Diez R. Kieffer S. Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Gagnon E. Sadoul R. Rondeau C. Desjardins M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) and in exosomes, these latter originating from multi-vesicular bodies that are intermediates between early and late endosomes (26Thery C. Boussac M. Veron P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Garin J. Amigorena S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). In our hands, neither early nor late endosomes were drastically affected by Alix-CT and endophilin overexpression. A marker of ER resident proteins (KDEL) was distributed around some Alix-CT/endophilin-induced tubulo-vesicular structures and vacuoles, suggesting that Alix-CT overexpression leads to swelling of parts of the ER or impairs trafficking of some ER proteins. Interestingly, the Alix-CT/endophilin-delineated structures induced by the overexpression were resistant to Triton-X100. Because we have not found any abnormal cholesterol concentration in Alix-CT-stained compartments (not shown), we favor the hypothesis that the resistance to detergent is due to Alix-CT and endophilins being caught in a mesh of cytoskeletal proteins stabilizing the tubules and vacuoles. Overexpression of the C-terminal half of Alix/AIP1 was shown by Vito et al.(4Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to impair apoptosis after serum deprivation, and we have recently observed a similar death-blocking effect of overexpressed Alix-CT in cerebellar post-mitotic neurons. 2I. M. Verna, S. Torch, and R. Sadoul, manuscript in preparation. One mechanism put forward by Vito et al. (4Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to explain this protective effect was that Alix-CT may sequester ALG-2, which is necessary for death to occur. However, we have not seen colocalization of ALG-2 with Alix-CT (not shown). Our demonstration that Alix-CT perturbs intracellular compartmentalization, possibly by binding to endophilins, begs the question of how localization and activity of the known actors of the death program may be affected by this vacuolization. We thank all our friends and colleagues, in particular, Claude Feuerstein for constant support, Fiona Hemming, Jean Marc Verna, Karin Sadoul, and Corinne Albiges-Rizo for comments on the manuscript, and Yves Usson for confocal microscopy analysis."

O-Fucose modifications are also predicted to occur on Notch ligands based on the presence of the C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus site (where S/T is the modified amino acid) in a number of the EGF repeats of these proteins. Here we establish that both mammalian and Drosophila Notch ligands are modified withO-fucose glycans, demonstrating that the consensus site was useful for making predictions. The presence of O-fucose on Notch ligands raised the question of whether Fringe, anO-fucose specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, was capable of modifying O-fucose on the ligands. Indeed, O-fucose on mammalian Delta1 and Jagged1 can be elongated with Manic Fringe in vivo, and Drosophila Delta and Serrate are substrates for Drosophila Fringe in vitro. These results raise the interesting possibility that alteration of O-fucose glycans on Notch ligands could play a role in the mechanism of Fringe action on Notch signaling. As an initial step to begin addressing the role of the O-fucose glycans on Notch ligands in Notch signaling, a number of mutations in predicted O-fucose glycosylation sites onDrosophila Serrate have been generated.

Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar). Deregulation of the Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in various human diseases, including CADASIL, T-cell leukemia, spondylocostal dystosis, and Alagille syndrome (2Bulman M.P. Kusumi K.

All Notch ligands are transmembrane proteins that share common structural features including a DSL domain, required for Notch binding, and multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF)1 repeats in their extracellular domains (5Fleming R.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Serrate/Jagged ligands are distinguished structurally from Delta ligands by a greater number of EGF repeats and the presence of a distinct extracellular cysteine-rich region near the transmembrane domain. Ligand binding triggers proteolytic processing events that result in release of the intracellular domain of Notch from the membrane and subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it participates in a transcriptional activator complex.Drosophila has only one Delta and one Serrate gene, but mammals have three Deltas and two Serrate/Jaggeds.During Drosophila development, Delta and Serrate are distinguished functionally by their sensitivity to Fringe (reviewed in Ref. 6Irvine K.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Fringe is a β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that elongates O-fucose on EGF repeats and acts as a key modulator of Notch signaling (7Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S.

The importance of the glycosyltransferase activity of Fringe in the modulation of Notch signaling has been demonstrated both by genetic studies inDrosophila and by Notch signaling assays in mammalian cells deficient in glycan biosynthesis (7Bruckner K.

Although Notch is a substrate of Fringe, it has not yet been demonstrated that glycosylation of Notch is actually sufficient to account for the influence of Fringe on Notch signaling.O-Fucose is a modification of serine or threonine residues that has typically been found to occur on EGF repeats containing the amino acid consensus sequence C2XXGG(S/T)C3, where C2and C3 are the second and third conserved cysteines of an EGF repeat (18Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for addition of O-fucose to these sites, proteinO-fucosyltransferase-1 (O-FucT-1), has recently been purified and cloned (19Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W.

O-Fucose in two contexts other than EGF repeats has also been described: one in whichO-fucose is attached to a threonine within a thrombospondin repeat (21Hofsteenge J. Huwiler K.G. Macek B. Hess D. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Peter-Katalinic J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6485-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and another where a O-fucose is attached to a peptide (PMP-C) isolated from Locusts (22Nakakura N.

Biol. 1996; 258: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). O-Fucose has been thought to be a rare modification, and to date has only been experimentally demonstrated to occur on 11 different proteins, of 6 main types (Table I). However, the C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus sequence exists in many other EGF repeat-containing proteins (16Moloney D.J. Shair L.H., Lu, F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol.

This raises the possibility that O-fucosylation occurs on both the Notch receptor and its ligands, and that modification of O-fucose saccharides on Notch ligands may contribute to the modulatory effects of Fringe on Notch signaling.Table IProteins with experimentally confirmed O-fucose modificationsProteinsReferencePlasminogen activatorsUrokinase, uPA49Kentzer E.J.

Open table in a new tab To begin to investigate these possibilities, we assayed bothDrosophila and mammalian Notch ligands for the presence ofO-fucose saccharides. Our results confirm that Notch ligands do possess O-fucose, and further show that thisO-fucose can be elongated by the glycosyltransferase activity of Fringe. Moreover, we found that O-fucosylation can occur on EGF repeats that do not match the C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus sequence forO-fucosylation. These observations suggest that the role ofO-fucosylation in the modulation of Notch signaling and other processes is likely to be broader and more complex than suggested previously.RESULTSSequence analysis reveals the presence of multiple C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus sites forO-fucosylation in EGF repeats of all Notch ligands (Fig.1, red circles). The published consensus sequence for O-fucosylation was derived from sequences of only five EGF repeats in proteins experimentally tested for the presence of O-fucose (18Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this sequence has been used to accurately predict the presence ofO-fucose on both Notch (16Moloney D.J.

If Notch ligands were modified by O-fucose, then they would also become prospective targets for the β1,3-N-acetylglycosaminyltransferase activity of Fringe. However, the C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus sequence was developed based on analysis of O-fucosylation, and the extent to which O-fucose monosaccharides on particular EGF repeats were further elongated by Fringe has not yet been determined. Preliminary indications suggest that Fringe elongates O-fucose on some EGF repeats, but not others (15Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Kumano K. Takahashi T. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Hence, we examined the possibility that Notch ligands were subject toO-fucosylation and further Fringe modification by analyzing the presence and structure of O-fucose saccharides on Notch ligands.Mammalian Delta1 and Jagged1 Can Be Modified by O-Fucose and Elongated by Manic Fringe in VivoTo examine whether mammalian Notch ligands were modified with O-fucose, rat Delta1-Fc or human Jagged1-Fc fusion proteins were transiently expressed in Lec1 Chinese hamster ovary cells. Lec1 cells are unable to synthesize complex or hybrid-type N-linked glycans and were used in these experiments to facilitate metabolic radiolabeling ofO-fucose saccharides (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Subsequent to metabolic labeling with [3H]fucose, Delta1-Fc and Jagged1-Fc proteins were purified from the cell medium and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Both proteins incorporated [3H]fucose. Because Lec1 cells do not synthesize hybrid or complex-typeN-glycans, these results strongly suggest the presence ofO-fucose on both of these Notch ligands (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 3). The presence of O-fucose was confirmed by gel-filtration chromatography of O-linked saccharides released from Delta1-Fc or Jagged1-Fc by alkali-induced β-elimination where the radiolabel was almost exclusively in the form of the monosaccharide, fucitol (Fig. 3, A and B).FIG. 2Mammalian Notch ligands Delta1 and Jagged1 are modified with O-fucose. Rat Delta1-Fc and human Jagged1-Fc were expressed in Lec1 cells in the absence or presence of Manic Fringe.

The labeled, O-fucose saccharides released from Delta1 or Jagged1 isolated from MFng-expressing Lec1 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 4) contained a significant amount of tetrasaccharide (Fig. 3, C and D). Some increase in the amount of di- and trisaccharide structures was also detected on Jagged1. The structure of the tetrasaccharide species (as well as the di- and trisaccharides) was confirmed by exoglycosidase sequencing with sialidase and β-galactosidase as described previously (16Moloney D.J.

Analysis of the resulting disaccharide by HPAEC showed it had the structure GlcNAcβ1,3fucitol (Fig. 3, E and F), confirming that MFng was forming the same structure on Delta1 and Jagged1 as was previously reported on Notch1 (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 16Moloney D.J.

Similar results were obtained when endogenous Jagged1 from Chinese hamster ovary cells was analyzed (data not shown). In summary, these results indicate thatO-fucose was present on the mammalian Notch ligands Delta1 and Jagged1 as a monosaccharide in Chinese hamster ovary cells that can be elongated to a disaccharide by the β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity of Fringe, and then further elongated by galactosyl- and sialyltransferases endogenously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.Drosophila Delta and Serrate Are Fringe Substrates in VitroNo analogue of Lec1 cells exists for culturedDrosophila cells. Hence, it is not possible to generate efficient metabolic radiolabeling of O-fucose saccharides. Thus, we took an alternate approach of expressing Notch ligands in cultured Drosophila cells, purifying them, and determining whether they serve as substrates for the glycosyltransferase activity of purified Fringe protein in vitro. In principle, such an experiment could support two important conclusions. First, because Fringe requires an O-fucose in the context of an EGF repeat for efficient glycosylation, the ability to serve as a Fringe substrate provides strong evidence that the protein was first modified byO-fucose. Second, in vitro labeling demonstrates that the protein was indeed a substrate for Fringe. To produce Notch ligand substrates for these assays, full-length, wild-type Serrate or Delta were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells under the control of a metallothionein promoter. These proteins were then immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the native proteins and protein A/G-agarose beads. In vitro glycosylation assays ofDrosophila Delta and Serrate proteins were then performed using affinity purified Drosophila Fringe and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as a sugar donor. The amount of Serrate and Delta proteins was monitored by Western blotting (Fig.4, A and B). The transfer of [3H]GlcNAc was detected by scintillation counting (not shown), as well as by fluorography of SDS-PAGE separated proteins (Fig. 4, A and B). This analysis demonstrated that both of the Drosophila Notch ligands, Delta and Serrate, were substrates for the glycosyltransferase activity of Fringe in vitro. This also provided evidence that both Serrate and Delta were modified with O-fucose inDrosophila S2 cells. Conversely, proteins lacking EGF repeats, such as the IgGs used for the immunoprecipitation and also present in the labeling reaction, were not substrates for Fringe.FIG. 4Drosophila Fringe modifies Delta and Serrate in vitro. Delta (A) and Serrate (B) proteins were purified fromDrosophila cell culture and incubated in vitrowith purified Fringe protein in the presence of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radiolabeling of Delta and Serrate was detected by SDS-PAGE with subsequent fluorography. The amount of protein was monitored by Western blotting. A, Delta protein radiolabeling: Western control and fluorograph, without (mock labeling) or with Fringe, as indicated. B, Serrate protein radiolabeling: Western control and fluorograph, without or with Fringe, as indicated. The lower molecular weight species are presumably protease fragments as they react with anti-Serrate antibodies and are radiolabeled by Fringe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To establish the identity of the saccharide product of the Fringe reaction on Notch ligands, O-linked saccharides were released from Fringe-modified Serrate and Delta proteins and then analyzed by HPAEC, revealing a disaccharide product that co-migrated with a GlcNAcβ1,3fucitol standard (Fig.5). This confirms that the substrate for the GlcNAc transferase activity of Fringe on Notch ligands was anO-fucose, and that Fringe specifically elongates thisO-fucose with a β1,3-linkedN-acetylglucosamine.FIG. 5Drosophila Fringe adds a β1,3-GlcNAc to O-fucose on Serrate and Delta. O-Fucose glycans were released from Fringe-modified Delta and Serrate (Fig. 4) and analyzed by HPAEC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The migration position of authentic standards is indicated:x, GlcNAcβ1,2fucitol; y, GlcNAcβ1,3fucitol;z, GlcNAcβ1,4fucitol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sites of O-Fucose Elongation by Fringe on Drosophila Serrate Protein and EGF Repeat 25 of NotchThe large number of potential sites for O-fucosylation of Notch and its ligands presents a challenge to the identification of the biologically relevant sites of Fringe action in its modulation of Notch signaling (Fig. 1). To begin to address this question, it was first necessary to identify whichO-fucose sites could actually be elongated by Fringe. We therefore conducted site-specific mutagenesis of Serrate, which contains only four intact EGF repeats that match the C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus (in EGF repeats 3, 5, 12, and 13) (Figs. 6 and7A). Four rounds of mutagenesis were employed to make the amino acid substitutions that would prevent O-fucosylation. Ser-4m, the Serrate protein with all four O-fucosylation consensus mutated (EGFs 3, 5, 12, and 13) (Fig.7A), was expressed in S2 cells and isolated by immunoprecipitation as for wild-type Serrate. Strikingly, this mutant form of Serrate was nonetheless a good substrate for Fringe in vitro (Fig. 7B, lane 2).FIG. 6Sequence between Cys2 and Cys3 of EGF repeats from DrosophilaSerrate. The sequence between conserved cysteines 2 and 3 of each EGF repeat from Drosophila Serrate is shown, and the narrow O-fucose consensus sites areunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 7Modification of Serrate byO-FucT-1 and Fringe occurs on consensus as well as nonconsensus EGF repeats. A, schematic of the Serrate extracellular domain, using the same symbolism as in Fig.1. X indicates the O-fucose consensus sites subjected to mutagenesis. B, the panel shows Western blot and fluorographic analysis of different forms of Serrate protein after Fringe-labeling assay. Lanes 1 correspond to wild-type Serrate protein, lanes 2 correspond to Ser-4m protein, and lanes 3 correspond to Ser-8m protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although Ser-4m lacks intact EGF repeats containing the C2XXGG(S/T)C3 consensus, it does contain one more EGF repeat that has this consensus, EGF 4. However, this repeat is interrupted by a 62-amino acid insertion between the third (Cys3) and fourth (Cys4) cysteines (Fig.6). Thus, it is not clear if EGF 4 folds into a typical EGF structure, thus providing the additional target for O-FucT-1 and Fringe in the Ser-4m mutant protein. Alternatively (or additionally), some nonconsensus sites may be modified on Serrate protein.Studies of O-FucT-1 activity using site-directed mutants of a human factor IX EGF indicated that the substitution of the conserved glycines in the consensus sequence (C2XXGG(S/T)C3) for alanines (GG to AG, or GA, or AA) preserved the fucosylation in vitro as long as the EGF repeat was properly folded (20Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A related sequence motif, C2XXGA(S/T)C3, was present in seven EGF repeats of Drosophila Notch, one of which, EGF repeat 25, is of particular interest because it is an EGF repeat to which a number of Abruptex mutations of Notch map (34Kelley M.R.

Inducible genes contain particular nucleotide elements within their promoter regions that are responsible for regulated transcription. The aim of this study was to characterize the cis-acting regulatory elements andtrans-acting nuclear factors that regulate inducible expression of the mPGES gene. We found that the binding of Egr-1, an inducible transcription factor, to the proximal GC box is an essential event that directs the regulatory expression of mPGES.Transgenic expression of the chimeric mouse mPGES gene (5′-untranslated fragment up to 1858 bp upstream of the initiating ATG) flanked by the LacZ reporter gene in mice resulted in LPS-stimulated expression of β-galactosidase in tissues in which mPGES was intrinsically induced, implying that the regulatory elements for stimulus-induced mPGES expression reside within this promoter region. On the basis of results from the promoter/reporter assay in mouse osteoblastic and macrophage-like cells, we identified the core promoter region controlling reporter expression to be situated between −70 and −150, in which two GC boxes were located tandemly. Moreover, mouse mPGES promoter activity was significantly increased when the promoter region was deleted at −150 to −655, indicating that this region adjacent to the GC boxes contains negative transcriptional regulatory elements. In this region, there are two consensus regulatory elements for glucocorticoids that have been shown to down-regulate mPGES expression in several cell types (10Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T.

There are no binding sites for NF-κB, CRE, and E-box that have been implicated in COX-2 induction (14Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.S. Liu W.L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol.

Indeed, even though both enzymes are stimulus-inducible and function sequentially in the same PGE2-biosynthetic pathway, the kinetics of induction of these two enzymes are not entirely identical in several systems (30Kojima F. Naraba H. Sasaki Y. Okamoto R. Koshino T. Kawai S. J. Rheumatol.,. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar,33Stichtenoth D.O. Thoren S. Bian H. Peters-Golden M. Jakobsson P.J. Crofford L. J.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6428-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Further studies using mutation constructs and EMSA confirmed that the two GC box sequences located between −70 and −150 are essential for the activation of the mouse mPGES gene in response to stimuli. Increase in reporter gene expression was reduced by mutating either of the two GC boxes, whereas TPA-stimulated DNA/protein binding activity was completely abolished only by mutation of the GC box-2, but not the GC box-1. These results suggest that even though the nuclear GC box-binding protein (Egr-1) binds only to the proximal GC box-2, both GC boxes are required for full promoter activity. Although the role of the distal GC box-1 is unclear, it may contribute to full promoter activity through association with coactivators or transcription initiation complex, which may act in synergy with Egr-1. Our EMSA experiments indicated that two other proteins, designated as I and III, also interacted with the GC box-2 even in unstimulated cells. It is possible that Egr-1 and the two other GC box-binding proteins share an overlapping site, although it is currently unclear whether these interactions are mutually exclusive or act in concert. The molecular identities of the proteins responsible for bands I and III detected in the EMSA analysis are under investigation.It has been reported that tandem GC box sequences exist in several gene promoters, such as prostacyclin synthase (35Ohkawara S.

These tandem GC boxes represent binding sites for members of the Sp1 transcription factor family (41Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) that play an important role in the control of transcription of the aforementioned genes. However, our EMSA studies using specific antibodies showed that the GC box in the mPGES promoter region does not bind Sp1 or Sp3. Instead, the transcription factor Egr-1 was found to bind the proximal GC box sequence in the nuclear extract of TPA-stimulated cells. Egr-1 (also known as Krox-24), which was first identified as an immediate-early gene induced by mitogenic stimulation (23Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), contains three zinc finger motifs that regulate transcription through binding to the GC-rich consensus sequence 5′-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3′ (20Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7857-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). TheEgr-1 gene is rapidly and transiently induced by a variety of stimuli or cellular stresses, including serum, TPA, and other growth factors (21Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1415-H1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lemaire P. Revelant O. Bravo R. Charnay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4691-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Egr-1-binding sites have been identified in the promoters of cyclin D1 (42Yan Y.X. Nakagawa H. Lee M.H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that sustained production of PGE2 by HEK293 cells stably co-transfected with COX-2 and mPGES is associated with aggressive cell growth and morphological change (9Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present study provides unequivocal evidence that Egr-1 binds to the GC box in themPGES promoter region and regulates inducible transcription of the mPGES gene. Thus, transcriptional regulation of mPGES expression by Egr-1 appears to be closely correlated with cellular proliferation and carcinogenesis. We speculate that Egr-1 may regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation at least in part through up-regulation of mPGES gene transcription, particularly in tissues and cells where PGE2 plays a regulatory role in these events. The functional link between Egr-1 and mPGES expression is further supported by recent observations that cytokine-induced expression of mPGES is suppressed by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (45Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and that Egr-1 induction is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (46Rolli M. Kotlyarov A. Sakamoto K.M. Gaestel M. Neininger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19559-19564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates Egr-1-mediated mPGES expression in our preliminary reporter assay. 2H. Naraba, C. Yokoyama, N. Tago, and T. Tanabe, unpublished observation. Although the sequences of the mouse and human mPGESpromoters (−1 to −640) were only 48% homologous, the homology between them around the tandem GC boxes (−70 to −124) is relatively high (78%). Of importance, our studies revealed that the tandem GC boxes were also critical for transcriptional activation of the humanmPGES gene. Moreover, a similar regulatory mechanism is common to several distinct cell types (osteoblasts, macrophages, and kidney cells) following various stimuli (TPA, cytokines, and LPS). It is therefore likely that Egr-1-mediated regulation of themPGES gene represents the common regulatory machinery in various situations. Prostaglandin E2(PGE2)1 is an important mediator that plays a variety of roles in biological events, such as fever, pain, tumorigenesis, gastrointestinal protection, osteogenesis, and inflammation (1Harris S.G.

Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is controlled by two rate-limiting steps. The first step is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX), which converts arachidonic acid to the intermediate prostanoid PGH2. Two isoforms of the COX enzyme have been identified: cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which is a constitutive enzyme, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is induced by various stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (7Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The second step is the terminal conversion reaction of PGH2 to PGE2, which is catalyzed by PGE2 synthase (PGES). At least two forms of PGES have recently been identified (8Tanioka T. Nakatani Y.

Membrane-associated PGES (mPGES), which was originally designated MGST1-L1 (for membrane-boundGST1-like-1), is an inducible enzyme, which is coordinately induced with COX-2 on the perinuclear membrane and is functionally coupled with COX-2 in marked preference to COX-1 (9Jakobsson P.J.

It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the inducible expression of both the COX-2 and mPGESgenes. A number of studies have reported the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 expression, in which several consensus sites in theCOX-2 promoter, such as NF-κB, NF-interleukin 6, CRE, and E-box, have been identified as regulatory sequences for COX-2 induction in response to various stimuli (14Schmedtje Jr., J.F.

Although the structure of the human mPGES gene, including a 632-bp 5′-flanking region, has been reported (19Forsberg L. Leeb L. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Jakobsson P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), transcription factors orcis elements required for gene expression ofmPGES remain elusive. In the present study, we have isolated the mouse mPGES gene with its promoter region and analyzed the regulatory mechanisms for inducible expression of the mPGES gene in mouse MC3T3-E1 or RAW264.7 cells. Our results indicate that the tandem GC box sequences in the mPGES promoter play a major role in regulating its inducible transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Egr-1, an inducible zinc finger protein that recognizes the GC-rich consensus DNA sequence 5′-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3′ (20Christy B.A. Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Increase in reporter gene expression was reduced by mutating either of the two GC boxes, whereas TPA-stimulated DNA/protein binding activity was completely abolished only by mutation of the GC box-2, but not the GC box-1. These results suggest that even though the nuclear GC box-binding protein (Egr-1) binds only to the proximal GC box-2, both GC boxes are required for full promoter activity. Although the role of the distal GC box-1 is unclear, it may contribute to full promoter activity through association with coactivators or transcription initiation complex, which may act in synergy with Egr-1. Our EMSA experiments indicated that two other proteins, designated as I and III, also interacted with the GC box-2 even in unstimulated cells. It is possible that Egr-1 and the two other GC box-binding proteins share an overlapping site, although it is currently unclear whether these interactions are mutually exclusive or act in concert. The molecular identities of the proteins responsible for bands I and III detected in the EMSA analysis are under investigation.It has been reported that tandem GC box sequences exist in several gene promoters, such as prostacyclin synthase (35Ohkawara S.

However, our EMSA studies using specific antibodies showed that the GC box in the mPGES promoter region does not bind Sp1 or Sp3. Instead, the transcription factor Egr-1 was found to bind the proximal GC box sequence in the nuclear extract of TPA-stimulated cells. Egr-1 (also known as Krox-24), which was first identified as an immediate-early gene induced by mitogenic stimulation (23Milbrandt J.

We have previously shown that sustained production of PGE2 by HEK293 cells stably co-transfected with COX-2 and mPGES is associated with aggressive cell growth and morphological change (9Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present study provides unequivocal evidence that Egr-1 binds to the GC box in themPGES promoter region and regulates inducible transcription of the mPGES gene. Thus, transcriptional regulation of mPGES expression by Egr-1 appears to be closely correlated with cellular proliferation and carcinogenesis. We speculate that Egr-1 may regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation at least in part through up-regulation of mPGES gene transcription, particularly in tissues and cells where PGE2 plays a regulatory role in these events. The functional link between Egr-1 and mPGES expression is further supported by recent observations that cytokine-induced expression of mPGES is suppressed by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (45Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and that Egr-1 induction is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (46Rolli M.

Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates Egr-1-mediated mPGES expression in our preliminary reporter assay. 2H. Naraba, C. Yokoyama, N. Tago, and T. Tanabe, unpublished observation. Although the sequences of the mouse and human mPGESpromoters (−1 to −640) were only 48% homologous, the homology between them around the tandem GC boxes (−70 to −124) is relatively high (78%). Of importance, our studies revealed that the tandem GC boxes were also critical for transcriptional activation of the humanmPGES gene. Moreover, a similar regulatory mechanism is common to several distinct cell types (osteoblasts, macrophages, and kidney cells) following various stimuli (TPA, cytokines, and LPS). It is therefore likely that Egr-1-mediated regulation of themPGES gene represents the common regulatory machinery in various situations. Evidence is emerging that mPGES is an inducible enzyme, the expression of which is markedly increased in various cells and tissues following proinflammatory stimuli (9Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S.

Inducible genes contain particular nucleotide elements within their promoter regions that are responsible for regulated transcription. The aim of this study was to characterize the cis-acting regulatory elements andtrans-acting nuclear factors that regulate inducible expression of the mPGES gene. We found that the binding of Egr-1, an inducible transcription factor, to the proximal GC box is an essential event that directs the regulatory expression of mPGES. Transgenic expression of the chimeric mouse mPGES gene (5′-untranslated fragment up to 1858 bp upstream of the initiating ATG) flanked by the LacZ reporter gene in mice resulted in LPS-stimulated expression of β-galactosidase in tissues in which mPGES was intrinsically induced, implying that the regulatory elements for stimulus-induced mPGES expression reside within this promoter region. On the basis of results from the promoter/reporter assay in mouse osteoblastic and macrophage-like cells, we identified the core promoter region controlling reporter expression to be situated between −70 and −150, in which two GC boxes were located tandemly. Moreover, mouse mPGES promoter activity was significantly increased when the promoter region was deleted at −150 to −655, indicating that this region adjacent to the GC boxes contains negative transcriptional regulatory elements. In this region, there are two consensus regulatory elements for glucocorticoids that have been shown to down-regulate mPGES expression in several cell types (10Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T.

We report that in addition to previously characterized arginine-rich PTDs, including TAT, lysine homopolymers were able to mediate transduction of a wide variety of cell types, as measured by flow cytometric and enzymatic assays. The efficiency of PTD-mediated transduction was influenced by the cell type tested, although polylysine homopolymers demonstrate levels of internalization that consistently exceeded those of TAT and arginine homopolymers. Transduction of arginine/lysine-rich PTDs occurred at 4 °C and following depletion of cellular ATP pools, albeit generally at reduced levels. Although transduction was reduced in Chinese hamster ovary mutant lines deficient in either heparan sulfate or glycosaminoglycan synthesis, uptake was restored to wild-type levels by incubating target cells with dextran sulfate. The enhancement of transduction by dextran sulfate suggests that electrostatic interactions play an important first step in the process by which PTDs and their cargoes traverse the plasma membrane.

Recently published reports suggest that the guanidinium head group of arginine plays a critical role in enhancing the uptake of arginine homopolymers, with levels of transduction increased severalfold over the TAT PTD (19Wender P.A.

These findings have led to increased focus on arginine homopolymers and synthetic peptoid analogues of arginine incorporating the guanidinium moiety as transduction domains (19Wender P.A.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6000-6007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of transduction mediated by PTDs has been the subject of some debate. It has been suggested that transduction of arginine homopolymers is dependent on the presence of active phosphate stores (21Mitchell D.J. Kim D.T. Steinman L. Fathman C.G. Rothbard J.B. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). However, more recent work has shown that treatment with sodium azide does not block internalization of PTDs (22Futaki S. Suzuki T.

The fact that internalization of PTDs occurs at 4 °C supports the notion that cell-mediated processes do not participate in the transduction process (6Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The search for specific cellular components required for transduction has identified few essential mediators. Internalization of Antennapedia, TAT, and arginine homopolymers has been shown to be nonsaturable and achiral, and it is not reliant on particular secondary structural elements within the PTD, as evidenced by mutagenesis experiments, use of retro-inverso peptides, β-peptides, peptoids, and substitution with d-enantiomers of PTD residues (19Wender P.A.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether the presence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) serves as a prerequisite for transduction by PTDs other than TAT (23Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Due to the rising importance of PTDs in delivering bioactive cargoes for the manipulation of cells in vitro and in vivo, we undertook a systematic, quantitative comparison of various cationic PTDs delivering cargoes ranging from 60 kDa to >500 kDa in size with the objective of determining key parameters governing efficiency of protein transduction. Previous studies have focused on measuring the efficiency of transduction of PTDs covalently linked to small fluorophore cargoes (19Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L.

Surprisingly, lysine homopolymers yielded the highest levels of internalization of all PTDs tested, across nearly all tested cell types. Additionally, we investigated the contribution of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and GAGs on uptake using CHO K1 cell line mutants. Preincubation of GAG-deficient cells with dextran sulfate significantly enhanced transduction of short PTDs, providing a method for enhancing in vitro and ex vivo manipulation of cells by protein transduction. This result also suggests that the initial step for internalization is mediated via electrostatic interactions. Peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis, N-terminally biotinylated, purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography to >90% purity on an acetonitrile/H2O-trifluoroacetic acid gradient, and confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Peptide Synthesis Facility, University of Pittsburgh). Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in distilled water to 2 mm stock concentrations. Peptide solutions containing primary amines (PTD-5, TAT, and lysine homopolymers; Table I) were quantitated by ninhydrin chemistry using l-norleucine (Sigma) as a standard. Arginine-rich peptides (arginine homopolymers and RQ series peptides; Table I) were quantitated by total amino acid hydrolysis, usingl-norleucine, glutamine (hydrolyzed to glutamic acid), and hydrolyzed biotin as internal controls.Table ISequences of the protein transduction domains used in the study CHO K1 Chinese hamster ovary cells and their HS-deficient (pgs D-677) and GAG-deficient (pgs A-745) derivatives and the HIG-82 rabbit synovial cell line were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells (human epithelial cervical carcinoma line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the human Jurkat T cell and A549 (human epithelial lung carcinoma) lines were cultured in RPMI 1640. All medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine. PTD-β-galactosidase complexes were formed by preincubating streptavidin-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal; Rockland Chemical Co.) with a 30-fold excess of biotinylated peptides for 30 min, at room temperature. Uncoupled biotinylated peptides were left in solution, since competition effects from excess peptides have been previously observed only at significantly higher concentrations (24Mi Z. Mai J., Lu, X. Robbins P.D. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Complexes were added to serum-containing medium (10% fetal calf serum) in each well of 24-well plates with confluent cell monolayers at 20 nm streptavidin concentrations and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in serum-containing media and once in PBS, and soluble extracts were obtained by incubating cells in 0.2% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, followed by pelleting insoluble debris at 14,000 rpm. β-Galactosidase recovered from the cellular extracts was quantitated by 1,2-dioxetane-based light emission (Tropix, Inc.). Fluorescence was measured in a Berthold AutoLumat luminometer, and relative light units were normalized to protein content as measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each condition tested was performed in triplicate, with means and S.D. values calculated. For complementation experiments using anionic polymers (salmon protamine sulfate (salmine, Grade II), porcine intestinal mucosal heparin sodium salt, bovine kidney heparan sulfate sodium salt, and dextran sulfate, Mr 500,000; Sigma), cells were preincubated with various concentrations of polymers in serum-containing media and washed twice in serum-containing media prior to the addition of complexes. Steps following incubation with complexes were performed as described above. PTD-streptavidin-fluorophore complexes were formed by preincubating 1.7 μm streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (SA-488; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) with 1 mm biotinylated peptides for 30 min at room temperature. A single cell suspension was generated by incubating confluent adherent cells in Hanks' solution-based enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Cells were pelleted, counted, and resuspended at a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in serum-containing media (10% fetal calf serum). PTD-streptavidin complexes were added to a final concentration of 20 nm streptavidin, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized for 20 min at 37 °C, washed again, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Trypsinization was used to eliminate noninternalized, surface-bound complexes. 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; BD Pharmingen) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 ng/μl 10 min prior to analysis by flow cytometry for dead cell exclusion. Cells were gated on the 7-AAD-negative cell populations, measuring fluorescence excited by a 488-nm argon ion laser line in a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer, with 20,000 events collected from the gated population. Flow cytometry data were analyzed with CellQuest (Becton Dickinson). For experiments conducted at 4 °C, all buffers and solutions were equilibrated to 4 °C, and incubations, washes, and spins were performed at 4 °C until the trypsinization stage. In the ATP depletion experiments, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in ATP-depletion medium (6 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 10 mm sodium azide, 10% fetal bovine serum in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (43Tang Y. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and further incubated with complexes for 1 h in ATP depletion medium at 37 °C prior to washing. Preincubations with anionic polymers were performed as described above. Cells analyzed by flow cytometry were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and mounted in gelvatol on slides using number 1 coverslips. Internalized PTD-streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 was visualized using a ×100 oil-1.3 NA immersion objective on an inverted Leica TCS NT laser-scanning confocal microscope. The argon 488-nm laser line was used to detect Alexa-488, and corresponding differential interference contrast images were taken of each section. Successive 0.4-μm optical sections were taken, and maximum intensity projections were generated using Leica TCS-NT software. Photomultiplier tube and laser power settings were identical for each data set. To assess the transductional efficiency mediated by a variety of PTDs, including arginine and lysine homopolymers (see Table I), the internalization of cargoes was examined by two different methods. The first method involved quantitating internalization efficiency of SA-β-Gal complexes (>500 kDa) coupled to the biotinylated PTDs by measuring enzymatic activity recovered from cellular extracts. Confluent cell monolayers were incubated with the complexes for 1.5 h at 37 °C, as peak transduction was measured to be reached in that time frame (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, cell line-specific differences in transduction are observed, with the HIG-82 synovial cell line demonstrating a 3.7–7.3-fold greater transduction than the other cell lines. The shorter PTDs (4R, 4K, and 5RQ) fail to mediate efficient transduction in the cell lines tested. Notably, no single PTD appears to be optimal in mediating transduction of the SA-β-Gal complex, although in all cases, polylysine homopolymers, particularly 8K and 10K, yield the highest levels of transduction from the PTD panel across all of the screened cell lines (see Table II). Furthermore, the internalization efficiency of the polylysines is not a simple function of length, since peak transduction occurs between 6 and 10 mers in size. Complexes with the 6R PTD yield the highest levels of transduction of the polyarginine PTDs. Interestingly, the 8RQ and 11RQ peptides, which were screened on the basis of the shared RRQRR motif between PTD-5 and TAT, show no enhancement of transduction, except in the case of HIG-82 cells.Table IISummary of transductional efficiency of PTD-SA-β-Gal complexesTable IISummary of transductional efficiency of PTD-SA-β-Gal complexes To determine whether results from the quantitation of β-galactosidase complexes were extendable to smaller cargo sizes (60 kDa), we examined the ability of biotinylated PTDs to facilitate internalization of SA-488 (60 kDa) in the same cell lines, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). Of concern was the fact that despite extensive washing, nonspecific electrostatic interactions may have led to quantitation of both surface-bound and internalized complexes in the SA-β-Gal transduction assays. By trypsinizing the cells for 20 min following incubation with the PTD-SA-488 complexes, noninternalized, surface-bound SA-488 was eliminated, a finding confirmed by confocal microscopy (data not shown). Trypsin was chosen because of its preference for cleavage following lysine and arginine residues, which are present in the PTDs, as well as its limited impairment of cell viability in comparison with other proteases. The addition of 7-AAD prior to flow cytometric analysis enabled elimination of nonviable cells from the quantitation. Results obtained by incubating the cell lines with PTD-SA-488 (Fig. 1B) yield similar patterns of uptake to the PTD-SA-β-Gal data (Fig. 1A), with the lysine homopolymers, particularly 8K and 10K, demonstrating the highest mean levels of uptake. These data are summarized in Tables II andIII. An example of fluorescence distributions derived following incubation with the PTD-SA-488 complexes is shown in Fig. 1C for CHO K1 cells. For the PTDs shown, greater than 99.7% of live CHO K1 cells exhibit fluorescence greater than 101, which is adjusted for background fluorescence in untreated cells. Distributions of fluorescence are generally narrow (>95% of events within 1 log fluorescence intensity), although 6K reproducibly resulted in a broader distribution in CHO K1 cells. Results from flow cytometry indicate that there are reproducible cell line-specific, as well as PTD-specific, patterns of overall uptake levels and distribution of uptake (data not shown). In this assay, CHO K1 cells demonstrate 4.4–9.7-fold greater transduction of the 60-kDa PTD-SA-488 complexes in comparison with the other cell lines. PTD-mediated internalization of Alexa Fluor 488 marker was confirmed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Fig. 1D), with observable levels of internalized fluorescence that correlate with the flow cytometry results. A punctate distribution of internalized marker, against a weaker diffuse signal, was present for the PTDs, suggesting that larger aggregates of SA-488 may have been internalized. No signal was detectable in the SA-488 control. Nonspecific, surface-bound peptide complexes were absent from all of the samples as a result of trypsin treatment. Interestingly, unlike in the SA-β-Gal quantitative assays, 8RQ and 11RQ peptides mediate efficient transduction of CHO K1 cells as shown by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.Table IIISummary of transductional efficiency of PTD-SA-488 complexes To assess the role of surface-bound GAGs in protein transduction, two mutants of the CHO K1 parental line were used. The CHO K1 mutant, pgs D-677, fails to express both GlcNAc transferase and GlcA transferase, resulting in defective HS synthesis with a concomitant 3–4-fold up-regulation of chondroitin sulfate (44Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Another CHO K1 mutant, pgs A-745, is deficient in xylosyltransferase, the key enzyme required for attachment of GAGs to the core protein. This defect leads to nearly complete elimination (1% of wild-type levels) of GAG expression (45Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar,46Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both SA-β-Gal and SA-488 assays were used to quantitate transduction mediated by the PTDs in the pgs D-677 and pgs A-745 lines (Fig. 2, A and B). Overall, internalization of PTD-SA-β-Gal complexes is reduced in HS- and GAG-deficient cells. Transduction of SA-β-Gal coupled to the 6K PTD, the highest transducer of the CHO K1 parental line, is diminished 90-fold in the pgs D-677 line and 42.8-fold in the pgs A-745 line (Fig. 2A). The most efficient PTD of the arginine homopolymers, 6R, transduces 12.7 and 10.8-fold less effectively in the pgs D-677 and pgs A-745 line, respectively. The TAT PTD, which has been shown to directly bind heparin sulfate, shows a 1.66-fold reduction in transduction in the HS− pgs D-677 line but a greater reduction of 4.8-fold in the GAG− pgs A-745 line. Interestingly, a trend emerges in which increasing lengths of arginine and lysine homopolymers show increasing levels of internalization of SA-β-Gal in the GAG mutant cells. In fact, 12R, the most efficient PTD for GAG mutant cells, mediates higher levels of transduction in the pgs D-677 and pgs A-745 lines (48-fold increase for both lines) than in the CHO K1 parental line (35-fold increase over control). Similar results arise from comparison of internalization levels of SA-488 in the GAG mutants, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig.2B). The most efficient transducer of CHO K1 wild type cells, 8K, shows a 2.8- and 10.3-fold reduction in internalization in the pgs A-677 and pgs D-745 lines, respectively. Likewise, 6R, the highest transducer of the polyarginines in CHO K1 cells, shows a 14-fold reduction in delivering SA-488 to both GAG mutants. Surprisingly, TAT shows almost no reduction in SA-488 delivery to pgs D-677 cells and only a 21% reduction in transduction of pgs A-745 cells. As in the SA-β-Gal assay (Fig. 2A), PTD-mediated trans"

https://openalex.org/W2169733234,"Telomerase is a regulated enzyme and its activity is tightly associated with cell proliferation. The mechanisms of this association are unclear, but specific growth factors may regulate telomerase activity. The present study examines the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on telomerase activity and identifies the signal transduction pathway involved in this process. EGF up-regulated telomerase activity in EGF receptor-positive cells after the activation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA expression. This activation was rapid, peaked after 6 or 12 h and was not blocked by the concurrent exposure to cycloheximide, suggesting a direct effect of EGF on TERT transcription. Transient expression assays revealed that EGF activates the hTERT promoter and that the proximal core promoter is responsible for this regulation. The activation of hTERT mRNA expression by EGF was specifically blocked by MEK inhibitor, and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that ERK is activated in response to EGF. Transient expression assays using mutant reporter plasmids revealed that an ETS motif located in the core promoter of hTERT is required for the EGF-induced transactivation of hTERT. Overexpression of wild type Ets in cells enhanced the EGF effect on hTERT transcription, while that of dominant negative Ets significantly repressed EGF action. These findings suggest that EGF activates telomerase through the direct activation of TERT transcription, in which the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway and Ets factor play major roles. Our data support the notion that growth factors directly regulate telomerase via specific signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2055668985,"Our previous studies revealed that insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin in 3T3L1 adipocytes. To explore the mechanisms involved in this event, we evaluated the association of the insulin receptor with caveolin. The receptor was detected in a Triton-insoluble low density fraction, co-sedimenting with caveolin and flotillin on sucrose density gradients. We also detected the receptor in caveolin-enriched rosette structures by immunohistochemical analysis of plasma membrane sheets from 3T3L1 adipocytes. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Tyr14. This effect of the hormone was not blocked by overexpression of mutant forms of the Cbl-associated protein that block the translocation of phospho-Cbl to the caveolin-enriched, lipid raft microdomains. Moreover, this phosphorylation event was also unaffected by inhibitors of the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. Although previous studies demonstrated that the Src family kinase Fyn was highly enriched in caveolae, an inhibitor of this kinase had no effect on insulin-stimulated caveolin phosphorylation. Interestingly, overexpression of a mutant form of caveolin that failed to interact with the insulin receptor did not undergo phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that the insulin receptor directly catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin. Our previous studies revealed that insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin in 3T3L1 adipocytes. To explore the mechanisms involved in this event, we evaluated the association of the insulin receptor with caveolin. The receptor was detected in a Triton-insoluble low density fraction, co-sedimenting with caveolin and flotillin on sucrose density gradients. We also detected the receptor in caveolin-enriched rosette structures by immunohistochemical analysis of plasma membrane sheets from 3T3L1 adipocytes. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Tyr14. This effect of the hormone was not blocked by overexpression of mutant forms of the Cbl-associated protein that block the translocation of phospho-Cbl to the caveolin-enriched, lipid raft microdomains. Moreover, this phosphorylation event was also unaffected by inhibitors of the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. Although previous studies demonstrated that the Src family kinase Fyn was highly enriched in caveolae, an inhibitor of this kinase had no effect on insulin-stimulated caveolin phosphorylation. Interestingly, overexpression of a mutant form of caveolin that failed to interact with the insulin receptor did not undergo phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that the insulin receptor directly catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin. The insulin receptor catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 277Issue 42PreviewIn this manuscript, we unintentionally failed to cite two studies (Gustavsson, J., Parpal, S., Karlsson, M., Ramsing, C., Thorn, H., Borg, M., Lindroth, M., Peterson, K.

Once activated, the receptor phosphorylates intracellular substrates on tyrosine, including members of the insulin receptor substrate family (IRS1/2/3/4),1 Shc, SIRP, Gab-1, Cbl, and APS (2Saltiel A.R.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins creates recognition sites for effector molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domains. These include the small adapter proteins Grb2, CrkII, and Nck, the SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase and the regulatory subunit of the type 1A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (4Kahn C.R.

This interaction appears to serve a dual function by stimulating PI3K activity and targeting the enzyme to a critical intracellular site (10Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Studies using various pharmacological inhibitors, microinjection of blocking antibodies, expression of dominant-interfering, and constitutively active mutants have consistently demonstrated a necessary role for PI3K activity in most of the metabolic effects of insulin (11Cheatham B.

Furthermore, inhibition of PI(3,4,5)P3 formation (a product of PI3K) by expression of the 3′-phosphatase phosphatase and tensin homolog or the 5′-phosphatase SH2 inositol 5-phosphatase prevents insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and Glut4 translocation (13Clement S.

Despite the general agreement that PI3K activity is necessary for insulin action, several studies have demonstrated the requirement for additional signals (15Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F.

For example, activation of PI3K by platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-4 or through engagement of integrin receptors does not induce Glut4 translocation (15Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C.

Furthermore, two naturally occurring insulin receptor mutations were unable to induce Glut4 translocation and glucose uptake, yet were fully capable of activating PI3K (20Krook A. Whitehead J.P. Dobson S.P. Griffiths M.R. Ouwens M. Baker C. Hayward A.C. Sen S.K. Maassen J.A. Siddle K. Tavare J.M. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol.

These data suggest that, although the PI3K pathway is necessary, there is at least one additional pathway required. Recent data suggest that the second requisite pathway might involve tyrosine phosphorylation events that are restricted to subdomains of the plasma membrane. The insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl results in its appearance in caveolin-enriched, lipid raft subdomains of the plasma membrane in 3T3L1 adipocytes (21Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Cbl is recruited to the insulin receptor by the adapter protein APS, which is necessary for its insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (24Liu J. Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Cbl and APS proteins form a trimeric complex with the adapter protein CAP, a member of the SoHo family of proteins that contains a flotillin-binding SoHo domain in it amino terminus, and three adjacent SH3 domains in its carboxyl terminus (22Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S.

A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, the Cbl·CAP complex is recruited to lipid rafts through the interaction of CAP with flotillin. Expression of dominant-interfering CAP mutants that lack either the SH3 or SoHo domains prevented the localization of this complex to plasma membrane microdomains and inhibited the stimulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation by insulin (25Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Following insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, Cbl recruits the SH2-containing adapter protein CrkII to lipid rafts; along with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G (21Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Upon its translocation, C3G activates TC10, a member of the Rho family protein of small GTP binding proteins expressed in muscle and adipose tissue (27Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). TC10 is specifically activated by insulin in 3T3L1 adipocytes in a CAP-dependent but PI3K-independent manner (26Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Although the physiologically relevant effectors that interact with TC10 are unknown, disruption of its activation blocks insulin-stimulated glucose transport and Glut4 translocation. Moreover, mistargeting of TC10 to a non-lipid raft domain by production of a TC10/K-Ras chimera or by disruption of lipid raft microdomains via expression of a dominant-interfering mutant form of caveolin-3 also completely prevented the activation of TC10 by insulin (28Watson R.T.

Although the precise function of lipid raft subdomains in assembling this signaling complex remains uncertain, resident structural proteins may play an important role. One such protein is caveolin-1, which is highly expressed in mature adipocytes (29Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and is known to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in various cells (30Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Caveolin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin in 3T3L1 adipocytes but not fibroblasts (30Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although this phosphorylation event correlates well with insulin responsiveness, the significance of caveolin phosphorylation remains uncertain. Moreover, it is unclear whether this phosphorylation event is a direct result of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor or perhaps catalyzed by the Src family kinase Fyn, which is also highly enriched in caveolae of adipocytes (30Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that insulin receptor physically associates with caveolin in 3T3L1 adipocytes and, further, that caveolin is a direct substrate of the insulin receptor. The anti-caveolin-2, insulin receptor β subunit and Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The FLAG (M2) antibody was obtained from Stratagene. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The phospho-p42/44 MAPK and phospho-Akt (4E2) antibodies were fromCell Signaling Technology. The anti-insulin receptor β subunit antibodies for immunofluorescence as well as the anti-caveolin-1, paxillin, and phospho-caveolin (Tyr14) antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. We used horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) for immunoblot detection. The Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. PD98059 and PP2 were from Calbiochem. Wortmannin was from Sigma Chemical Co. Octylthioglucoside was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The cDNA of mouse caveolin-1 was amplified by PCR from a 3T3L1 adipocyte cDNA library as the template. The 5′ primer was designed to have a BamHI restriction site followed by the amino acids 1–27. The 3′ primer was designed to have an EcoRI restriction site followed by the amino acids 515–537 according to GenBankTMU07645. These PCR products were cloned into pKMyc vector. FLAG-tagged CAP and CAP mutants were made as described previously (23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

All mutated forms of caveolin-1 were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. 3T3L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Differentiation to adipocytes was induced, and cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 3T3L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation as described previously (23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 25Kimura A. Baumann C.A.

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (1 tablet per 10 ml of buffer) (Roche Diagnostics). The clarified lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C and were washed extensively with lysis buffer before solubilization in SDS sample buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Individual proteins were detected with the specific antibodies and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The Triton-insoluble pellet fraction was generated as described previously (21Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in MBS buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.0; 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na-pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine) containing protease inhibitors and sodium orthovanadate. Lysed cells were kept at 4 °C to prevent degradation of caveolar complexes. The Triton-insoluble pellet fraction was solubilized in SOL buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa-pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mmoctylthioglucoside, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine) containing 60 mmoctylthioglucoside. 3T3L1 adipocytes were grown on glass cover slips in six-well dishes. Cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% ovalbumin for 1 h. Primary and Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were used at 2 μg/μl in blocking solution, and samples were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescent intensities were quantitated using the Olympus Fluoview software. Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.) for processing. Isolation of caveolae-enriched fractions was performed as previously described with minor modifications (30Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and rapidly scraped in 0.5 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 11) and homogenized with 10 strokes in a Dounce glass homogenizer. The homogenates were then sonicated three times for 20 s at the setting of 4.5 in a Fisher 550 sonic dismembrator. The samples were combined with 60% (w/v) sucrose in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl and well mixed to achieve a final sucrose concentration of 40%. The homogenates were overlaid with 4 ml of 35% (w/v) sucrose and then with 3 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl. The samples were spun at 39,000 rpm in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 19 h, and 1-ml fractions were collected for immunoblotting. To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin might be catalyzed directly by the insulin receptor, we explored the localization of the receptor in membranes of 3T3L1 adipocytes. Cells were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100 and purified on sucrose density gradients (Fig.1). As previously observed, under these gradient conditions caveolin and flotillin migrate in the low density region (Fig. 1A, fractions 3 and 4) of the sucrose gradient consistent with lipid raft enrichment. The insulin receptor was found in the more dense regions of the gradient but also co-migrated with caveolin-1 and flotillin in the low density fractions. As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in the recruitment of C3G to the low density fractions, whereas the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K was not detected in these fractions, irrespective of insulin treatment (Fig. 1B). To confirm that a population of the insulin receptor is co-localized with caveolin, plasma membrane sheets were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (28Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and stained with antibodies to caveolin-2 or the insulin receptor beta subunit. As is seen in Fig.1C, both caveolin and insulin receptor reside in characteristic large clusters of caveolae that take on a rosette or ring-like appearance in adipocytes (28Watson R.T. Shigematsu S. Chiang S.H. Mora S. Kanzaki M. Macara I.G. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both caveolin-1 and -2 are localized in these structures (data not shown). Previous studies suggested that the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin might be secondary to the phosphorylation of Cbl and its subsequent translocation to lipid raft microdomains (23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This translocation depends on the binding of Cbl to the adapter protein CAP, and the subsequent interaction of the second protein with the raft protein flotillin (23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated translocation of phospho-Cbl to these microdomains is blocked by overexpression of deletion mutants of CAP lacking the Cbl-interacting SH3 domains (CAPΔSH3) or flotillin-binding SoHo domain (CAPΔSoHo) (23Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 25Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cbl·CAP signaling is involved in caveolin-1 phosphorylation, FLAG-tagged CAP, CAPΔSoHo, and CAPΔSH3 were expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on Tyr14 in response to insulin was evaluated using a phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 2). Insulin stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1, using the phosphospecific antibodies to the sequences surrounding Tyr14 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). Identical results were generated using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). As previously reported (25Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), expression of CAP, CAPΔSoHo, or CAPΔSH3 did not effect the stimulation of Akt or MAPK phosphorylation in response to insulin. Similarly, expression of CAP, CAPΔSoHo, or CAPΔSH3 had no effect on insulin-stimulated caveolin phosphorylation (Fig.2D, lanes 3–8), indicating that the Cbl·CAP pathway is not required for phosphorylation of caveolin-1. As controls, the relative expression levels of CAP, CAPΔSoHo, CAPΔSH3, and endogenous caveolin are shown. Because the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin appears to be independent of the CAP/Cbl pathway, we sought to examine the potential role of the PI3K and MAPK pathways in this event (Fig.3). 3T3L1 adipocytes were pretreated with PD98059 (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK that has been shown to block the MAPK pathway (34Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) as well as wortmannin (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), an inhibitor of PI3K (35Hausdorff S.F. Fingar D.C. Morioka K. Garza L.A.

As expected, neither inhibitor blocked IRS-1 or insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), although wortmannin blocked the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3B) and PD98059 blocked the phosphorylation of MAPK (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin was unaffected by both inhibitors (Fig. 3D), indicating that this phosphorylation event is independent of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. Caveolin-1 was first identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Src-transformed cells (36Glenney J.R., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is known to be constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in Src- and Abl-transformed cells (33Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F.

To examine if insulin-stimulated caveolin phosphorylation is a consequence of Fyn activity, 3T3L1 adipocytes were pretreated with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 prior to insulin treatment, and caveolin phosphorylation was evaluated (Fig.4). This compound is known to specifically inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases in cells, including the kinase Fyn (37Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J.

The compound had no effect on insulin receptor or IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) or on the activation of Akt (Fig. 4B) or MAPK (Fig. 4C) in response to insulin. Furthermore, PP2 pretreatment failed to inhibit basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Fig.4D). In contrast, PP2 pretreatment completely blocked the constitutive phosphorylation of FAK, a known substrate of Src family kinases such as Fyn (Fig. 4E), although the dephosphorylation of the protein produced by insulin (39Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was not affected. Additionally, addition of PP2 blocked the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and Pyk2 in these cells (data not shown). Previous reports have demonstrated that palmitoylation-deficient caveolin-1 cannot be phosphorylated on Tyr14 by c-Src (33Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T.

Some of these characteristics including chromosomal instability, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition are shared with the genome instability syndromes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and Fanconi anemia.

It is also localized to diffuse patches in the nucleolus and a subset of telomeres (11Neff N.F. Ellis N.A., Ye, T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol.

During mitosis, BLM is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation followed by a sharp decline in G1 phase. Immunodepletion of BLM fromXenopus laevis extracts leads to inhibition of DNA replication (15Liao S. Graham J. Yan H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2570-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that BLM acts to suppress double strand breaks during replication (16Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y.

Although the exact role of BLM remains undefined, it seems likely that it suppresses inappropriate recombination.The presence of BLM in a multiprotein complex BASC (BRAC1-associated genome surveillance complex) with BRCA1, ATM, several damage repair proteins, and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex suggests that it is functionally linked to these proteins (17Wang Y.

It has also been demonstrated that ATM-dependent activation of Chk2 requires Nbs1 (34Buscemi G. Savio C. Zannini L. Micciche F. Masnada D. Nakanishi M. Tauchi H. Komatsu K. Mizutani S. Khanna K. Chen P. Concannon P. Chessa L. Delia D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5214-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylation of Nbs1 on serine 343 is required for radiation-induced activation of the S phase checkpoint, and mutations in either of these proteins give rise to radioresistant DNA synthesis (23Gatei M Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 35Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). On the other hand, BRCA1 function is required for both the S phase and G2/M checkpoints with ATM phosphorylation of BRCA1 on serine 1423 implicated in the G2/M checkpoint (36Xu B. Kim S.T. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Although it is evident that ATM and BLM recognize abnormal structures in DNA and suppress aberrant recombination, it is unclear as to whether they overlap at the mechanistic level. In this report we show that BLM interacts directly with ATM, BS cells exhibit radiosensitivity, and that the mitotic hyperphosphorylation of BLM is partially ATM-dependent, and we identify ATM-dependent phosphorylation sites on BLM that are phosphorylated post-irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. Mutation of either of these two sites alters survival and chromosome aberrations in response to radiation in transfected control cells and fails to correct radiosensitivity in BS cells.DISCUSSIONWe have provided evidence for a functional relationship between the products of two genes that, when mutated, give rise to the human disorders (A-T and BS) characterized by genome instability, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition (2Ellis N.A. Lennon D.J. Proytcheva M. Alhadeff B. Henderson E.E. German J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1019-1027PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Although these are distinct diseases, the BLM/ATM interaction is intriguing since it adds to the list of syndromes featuring genome instability and cancer predisposition whose gene products overlap functionally. Extensive overlap exists in the phenotypes of A-T and NBS, and recent data demonstrate that Nbs1 is phosphorylated by ATM and that this modification is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage (23Gatei M Young D.

Livingston D.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Mutations in Mre11, part of the complex with Nbs1, give rise to an A-T-like syndrome featuring radiosensitivity, radioresistant DNA synthesis, and chromosome fragility (22Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). These data reveal that ATM and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex operate in the same DNA damage response pathway(s) and give rise to three syndromes in the chromosomal breakage category. A new interaction, BLM with ATM, is now included in this list and adds another dimension of complexity to the recognition of abnormal structures in DNA during aberrant replication and/or in response to DNA damage. As observed with a number of other substrates, interaction of BLM with ATM is complex, occurring with the kinase domain and the N terminus of ATM. The interaction with the N terminus region of ATM was narrowed to a minimal region of 8 amino acids (VSASTQAS, 82–89). This sequence also corresponds to the minimal region for p53 and BRCA1 binding (30Khanna K.K. Keating K.E. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gatei M. Hobson K. Taya Y. Gabrielli B. Chan D. Lees-Miller S.P. Lavin M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar,40Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). 2H. Beamish, P. Kedar, H. Kaneko, P. Chen, T. Fukao, C. Peng, S. Beresten, N. Gueven, D. Purdie, S. Lees-Miller, N. Ellis, N. Kondo, and M. F. Lavin, unpublished data. Since this region of ATM bound most strongly to BLM and since the helicase domain of BLM bound ATM tightly, it is possible that these regions interact, allowing ATM to bind and phosphorylate Thr-99 and Thr-122 at the N terminus of BLM. More detailed mapping of these interactions sites requires further studies. The results described here reveal that ATM interacts with and directly phosphorylates BLM on Thr-99 and Thr-122 near the N terminus of the protein. These phosphorylations are physiologically significant since expression of mutant forms fails to correct radiation-induced damage in BS cells and enhanced radiosensitivity and chromosome aberrations in control cells. What is intriguing about these mutations of BLM is that they do not predispose to elevated SCE. In essence, we have demonstrated that specific mutations near the N terminus of BLM render the cells susceptible to radiation damage at least in part by interference with the function of ATM kinase and that this is separate from the helicase activity of BLM which is required for the prevention of SCE (2Ellis N.A. Lennon D.J. Proytcheva M. Alhadeff B. Henderson E.E. German J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1019-1027PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it appears that BLM is involved in maintaining genome stability in different pathways, one of which is ATM-dependent. The dominant interfering effect of the BLM mutants in normal cells can be explained by mutant protein interacting with BLM partner proteins critical for maintaining DNA integrity. The BASC complex, which contains several proteins involved in maintaining genome stability, represents one such target (17Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Oin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Some of the heterogeneity observed in BS patients might be explained by the presence of mutant protein. However, more than 90% of patients have mutations predicted to give rise to truncated protein, which is highly unstable and unlikely to cause interference with other functions. We have also demonstrated that radiation enhances the amount of Thr-99 phosphorylated BLM with increasing doses. Furthermore, this increase was defective in A-T cells, implicating ATM in this process. Thus in addition to phosphorylating BLM in vitro, ATM is also responsible for radiation-induced phosphorylation in vivo. It is not clear whether this is direct or mediated through another kinase, but based on our observations that these two proteins interact, it points to BLM being a substrate for ATM in response to DNA damage, joining an ever growing list of other substrates (45Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Yang D. Acta Oncol. 2001; 40: 686-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ababou et al. (46Ababou M. Dutertre S. Lecluse Y. Onclercq R. Chatton B. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have shown previously that BLM is retarded in its migration on SDS-PAGE in response to radiation and that phosphatase treatment restored migration to normal, providing evidence for radiation-induced phosphorylation. They also demonstrated that this shift was ATM-dependent but did not identify the site of phosphorylation. In addition to the radiation-induced phosphorylation of BLM, Ababou et al. (46Ababou M. Dutertre S. Lecluse Y. Onclercq R. Chatton B. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) observed an increase in BLM protein at 8 and 24 h post-irradiation. This differs from other results in which BLM is rapidly degraded in cells undergoing DNA damage-induced apoptosis (47Bischof O. Kim S.H. Irving J. Beresten S. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and we saw some evidence of this in A-T cells (Fig. 5). It is also noteworthy that the basal level of ATM kinase activity is elevated in the BS cell line HG2703 (Fig.4D). This is also the case for two other BS cell lines (results not shown) and may be explained by the inherent genomic instability of these cells. This explanation is supported by recent observations that 84% of undamaged BS cells contained Rad51 foci (48Wu L. Davies S.L. Levilt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19375-19381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Since these foci normally occur in response to radiation-induced double strand breaks in DNA, it seems likely that BS cells contain constitutively high levels of DNA breaks responsible for activation of ATM kinase. What is more difficult to explain is the reduction in ATM kinase at short times after irradiation in BS cells (Fig.4D), which suggests that BLM may have a modulating role on ATM kinase.Recent data reveal that BLM is required for correct relocalization of the Mre11/Rad50/nibrin complex at sites of stalled replication forks after treatment with hydroxyurea (49Franchitto A. Pichierri P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATR phosphorylates BLM, and this is positively correlated with the accurate subnuclear relocalization of the Mre11/Rad50/nibrin complex after hydroxyurea treatment. In the model proposed, BLM associates with stalled replication forks and assists in the loading of the Mre11/Rad50/nibrin complex. Phosphorylation of BLM by ATR facilitates recognition of the lesion, eventually leading to resolution of the stalled replication fork. Since relocalization of the complex reaches a maximum by 8 h, the timing involved raises the issue of the importance of this complex formation as a primary event in resolving the blocked fork. Hyperphosphorylation of BLM during mitosis is at least partially dependent upon ATM, and it is of interest as to whether ATR also plays a role in this process. The functional interaction between ATM and BLM during S phase in response to abnormal DNA structures and in mitosis, as well as the possible overlap in sites of phosphorylation for these different processes, requires further investigation. The presence of ATM, ATR, and BLM in complexes together with DNA damage recognition and repair proteins provides a vehicle for the functional coordination of these activities for the maintenance of genome integrity. Bloom's syndrome (BS)1is characterized by immunodeficiency, infertility, telangiectatic erythema, growth retardation, and chromosome aberrations, including gaps and rearrangements and a predisposition to diabetes, leukemias, and lymphomas (1German J.

Some of these characteristics including chromosomal instability, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition are shared with the genome instability syndromes ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and Fanconi anemia. Disturbances in DNA metabolism are evident in BS including slow replication fork progression and abnormal distribution of DNA replication intermediates (3Hand R. German J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

BS cells exhibit hypersensitivity to UV, hydroxyurea, and alkylating agents (5Kurihara T. Tatsumi K. Takahashi H. Inoue M. Mutat.

The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a 1417-amino acid protein with homology to the RECQ family of helicases including RECQL, Werner Syndrome protein, RECQ4 (mutated in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome), RECQ5, and the yeast proteins Sgslp and Rqh1p (2Ellis N.A.

Overexpression of BLM and purification from Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that it had ATP-dependent 3′-5′-DNA helicase activity (10Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

It is also localized to diffuse patches in the nucleolus and a subset of telomeres (11Neff N.F. Ellis N.A., Ye, T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol.

Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). During mitosis, BLM is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation followed by a sharp decline in G1 phase. Immunodepletion of BLM fromXenopus laevis extracts leads to inhibition of DNA replication (15Liao S. Graham J. Yan H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2570-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that BLM acts to suppress double strand breaks during replication (16Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y.

Although the exact role of BLM remains undefined, it seems likely that it suppresses inappropriate recombination. The presence of BLM in a multiprotein complex BASC (BRAC1-associated genome surveillance complex) with BRCA1, ATM, several damage repair proteins, and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex suggests that it is functionally linked to these proteins (17Wang Y.

https://openalex.org/W2008450867,"Aquaporin-6 (AQP6) has recently been identified as an intracellular vesicle water channel with anion permeability that is activated by low pH or HgCl2. Here we present direct evidence of AQP6 channel gating using patch clamp techniques. Cell-attached patch recordings of AQP6 expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes indicated that AQP6 is a gated channel with intermediate conductance (49 picosiemens in 100 mm NaCl) induced by 10 μmHgCl2. Current-voltage relationships were linear, and open probability was fairly constant at any given voltage, indicating that Hg2+-induced AQP6 conductance is voltage-independent. The excised outside-out patch recording revealed rapid activation of AQP6 channels immediately after application of 10 μmHgCl2. Reduction of both Na+ and Cl− concentrations from 100 to 30 mm did not shift the reversal potential of the Hg2+-induced AQP6 current, suggesting that Na+ is as permeable as Cl−. The Na+ permeability of Hg2+-induced AQP6 current was further demonstrated by22Na+ influx measurements. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Cys-155 and Cys-190 residues as the sites of Hg2+ activation both for water permeability and ion conductance. The Hill coefficient from the concentration-response curve for Hg2+-induced conductance was 1.1 ± 0.3. These data provide the first evidence of AQP6 channel gating at a single-channel level and suggest that each monomer contains the pore region for ions based on the number of Hg2+-binding sites and the kinetics of Hg2+-activation of the channel.

Aquaporins are a family of membrane channel proteins that are selectively permeated by water molecules (1Agre P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 764-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ion permeability is not a general feature of aquaporins (2Agre P. Lee M.D. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); however, we recently demonstrated ion permeation via AQP61expressed in X. laevis oocytes in response to Hg2+ or low pH (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This unique characteristic of AQP6 may expand our understanding of biophysical aspects of aquaporins. Channel gating is a fundamental property of ion channels in response to certain stimuli, such as membrane potential, pH, or ligands. In contrast, evidence of rapid channel gating has never been directly demonstrated for any aquaporin. This may be because aquaporins are constitutively active rather than gated or because of technical limitations in the measurement of single-channel water conductance. Ion permeation through AQP6 at a single-channel level allows us to study whether this aquaporin is gated. Mercurials are known to react with free sulfhydryls and to inhibit the osmotic water permeability of aquaporins (5Macey R.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis identified the residue Cys-189 as the site of mercurial inhibition of AQP1 (6Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Atomic structures of AQP1 have revealed that Cys-189 is located at the narrowest constriction of the channel pore, which led us to conclude that binding of Hg2+ to Cys-189 may occlude the pore, thereby inhibiting water conductance (7Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 8Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 9de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AQP6 has a cysteine residue (Cys-190) at the corresponding position to the Cys-189 in AQP1. Nevertheless Hg2+ does not inhibit AQP6 as initially reported (10Ma T. Yang B. Kuo W.L. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1996; 35: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but activates AQP6 instead (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the mechanistic effects of Hg2+ on aquaporins may be more complex than previously thought. Although Hg2+ induces both osmotic water permeability and ion conductance in AQP6, it remains unclear whether water and ions share a common pathway. Recent advances in developing atomic-resolution structural models of AQP1 and the bacterial glycerol transporter, GlpF, allow us to study detailed structure-function relationships (11Smith B.L. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. Van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J.

Aquaporins are present in the membrane as a homotetramer. It was recently suggested that the 4-fold axis of symmetry at the center of the homotetramer is a potential ion channel, based on the crystal structure of GlpF (15Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). No experimental data have yet been demonstrated to support this hypothesis, however. Here, we study single-channel properties of AQP6 expressed in X. laevis oocyte plasma membranes using patch clamp techniques to advance our understanding of the biophysical properties of AQP6. We have determined the single-channel conductance of AQP6. We also demonstrate the most likely ionic pathway for AQP6 based on the kinetics of Hg2+ activation of the channel. Stage V-VI oocytes were harvested from adult X. laevis anesthetized by immersion in ice-cold water. Ovarian follicles were removed, cut into small pieces, and digested in Ca2+-free OR2 (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) solution containing 2 mg/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma) for 1–2 h at room temperature. The oocytes were extensively rinsed with OR2 solution without collagenase and placed in Modified Barth's solution (MBS) at 18 °C. The oocytes were injected the day after isolation with either 50 nl of water (control) or 50 nl of water containing 5 ng of wild-type or mutant rat AQP6 cRNA. Mutations were introduced into AQP6 using the Chameleon double strand, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the specific 5′-phosphorylated primers and were confirmed by sequencing. The osmotic water permeability measurements were performed 3 days after injection of the cRNA. The oocyte-swelling assay was used for osmotic water permeability measurement. Oocytes were transferred into MBS diluted to 70 mosm with distilled water, and the time course of volume increase was monitored at room temperature by video microscopy with an online computer (6Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The relative volume (V/V 0) was calculated from the area at the initial time (A 0) and after a time interval (A t):V/V 0 = (A t/A 0)3/2. The coefficient of osmotic water permeability (Pf ) was determined from the initial slope of the time course (d(V/V 0)/dt), initial oocyte volume (V 0 = 9 × 10−4 cm3), initial oocyte surface area (S = 0.045 cm2), and the molar volume of water (V w = 18 cm3/mol) as shown in Equation 1. Pf=(V0×d(V/V0)/dt)/(S×Vw×(osMin−osMout))Equation 1 The electrophysiological measurements were performed 1 day after injection of the cRNA. On the day of recording, oocytes were placed in a hypertonic solution (200 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH) for 10–15 min to facilitate manual removal of the vitelline membrane, and then the oocytes were placed in OR2 solution until use. Recordings were performed using both cell-attached and outside-out excised patch configurations. Patch pipettes made of borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) filled with the standard solution (see below) with resistances of 5–8 MΩ were used. The bath was grounded via a 3 m KCl-agar bridge connected to a Ag-AgCl reference electrode. Solution changes were performed by gravity-feed of the 300-μl chamber (Warner Instruments) at a speed of 10 ml/min. Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200A amplifier controlled by Clampex 7.0 (Axon Instruments) via a Digidata 1200 interface. Data were analyzed by Pclamp software. The bath solution for cell-attached recording contained 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH7.2), and 1 mm MgCl2. The pipette solution for cell-attached recording contained 100 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EGTA, with or without 30 μmHgCl2. The bath solution for outside-out recording contained 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, with or without 10 μm HgCl2. To substitute gluconate for chloride, 100 mm NaCl was replaced with 100 mmsodium gluconate. The one-third NaCl solution contained 33 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mmMgCl2, and 132 mm mannitol. The pipette solution for outside-out recording contained 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. Whole oocyte membrane currents were recorded by a two-electrode voltage clamp. The standard iso-osmotic solution contains 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The command voltage was applied by two-microelectrode voltage clamp amplifier (Axoclamp-2A, Axon instruments, Foster City, CA) controlled by an IBM-compatible computer running pCLAMP software (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA). Current signals were sampled at 100 μs. The membrane potential was held at Vhold = −50 mV. To obtain current-voltage relationships, the membrane potential was rapidly stepped from the holding potential to a series of values generated between +50 and −150 mV, each differing by 20 mV. The pulse duration is 100 ms, and currents from 10 runs were averaged to reduce noise. All measurements were done at room temperature. Healthy oocytes were selected with resting potentials (from −25 to −40 mV). Hg2+-induced membrane conductance of AQP6 oocytes was measured in OR2 solution containing the indicated concentrations of HgCl2. The conductance was fitted to the Hill equation, and the Hill coefficient was calculated as shown in Equation 2, G=Gmax[Hg2+]n/(K0.5n+[Hg2+]n)Equation 2 where Gmax is the maximum conductance at saturating external Hg2+ concentration, K 0.5 is the concentration of Hg2+ where the conductance is one-half of the maximum and n is the Hill coefficient. Oocytes were placed in Eppendorf vials and washed twice with OR2 solution. At the beginning of the experiment each vial received 22NaCl (10 μCi, Amersham Biosciences) (17Weber W.M. Liebold K.M. Clauss W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 90 s of incubation at room temperature, the oocytes were washed with ice-cold isotope-free OR2 solution. Each oocyte was immediately placed individually in a scintillation counter after addition of 5 ml of scintillation fluid. A crystal structure of bovine aquaporin-1 produced by x-ray diffraction to 2.2 Å (PDB coordinates: 1J4N) (8Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) was used as the template. Tetrameric coordinates were built by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) Protein Quaternary Structure (PQS) server. The amino acid sequence of rat aquaporin-6 was threaded through the quaternary structure template in Swiss PDB Viewer 3.7 (b2) then optimized by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) SWISS-MODEL automated protein modeling server. We previously demonstrated that Hg2+ activates AQP6, increasing both the osmotic water permeability and the ion conductance 8–10-fold over baseline (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The ion permeation through AQP6 allows us to study the single-channel electrophysiological behavior of AQP6. To determine whether AQP6 is gated, single-channel activity was recorded in cell-attached patches from plasma membranes of oocytes expressing rat AQP6 and compared with control oocytes injected with water (Fig. 1). The membrane potential was estimated as the inverse of the holding potential because the resting membrane potential of oocytes became almost zero during removal of the vitelline membrane. A time-dependent increase in AQP6 single-channel activity was observed after the application of 30 μm HgCl2 into the patch pipette, whereas no increased channel activity was seen in recordings of plasma membranes of oocytes injected with water. Attempts to study single-channel conductance induced below pH 4.0 were prevented by difficulties in holding the patch pipette because of acidic conditions. A linear I-V relationship was observed in cell-attached recordings of Hg2+-induced single-channel currents in oocyte membranes expressing AQP6 (Fig. 2). The unitary conductance for the Hg2+-activated channel in the cell-attached recording was 49 picosiemens, which was calculated from the slope conductance. The open probability of single-channel currents did not show any voltage dependence, suggesting that Hg2+-activated AQP6 is not a voltage-gated channel. To elucidate if the rapid induction of AQP6 by HgCl2 is due to an increase in open probability of the channel, single-channel activity in an excised outside-out patch from the AQP6-expressing oocyte was recorded. Application of 10 μmHgCl2 to the bath increased the open probability within 10 s (Fig. 3). Bath application of 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol reversed the effects of HgCl2 only when it was applied within 1 min after HgCl2 application (not shown). We previously showed that AQP6 exhibited anion selectivity when it was activated by low pH. To examine the ion selectivity of AQP6 induced by HgCl2, ion replacement was performed in the excised outside-out patch mode. Ion replacement of chloride by gluconate shifted the reversal potential by +9.7 mV. Reduction of both Na+ and Cl− concentrations from 100 to 30 mm did not shift the reversal potential, indicating that both Na+ and Cl− are equally permeable (Fig.4). This is clearly different from the ion selectivity of low pH-inducible AQP6, which was five times more permeable for Cl− than Na+ (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To confirm Hg2+-induced cation permeability,22Na+ influx was measured in AQP6-expressing oocytes or water-injected oocytes (control). In the absence of HgCl2, 22Na+ uptake was nearly equal for AQP6 and control oocytes (Fig.5). The addition of 100 μmHgCl2 to the bath solution caused a 2.6-fold increase of22Na+ uptake in AQP6 oocytes (from 11.0 ± 1.2 to 28.3 ± 5.3 cpm/oocyte/90 s, n = 5) but only a marginal increase in water-injected control oocytes (from 8.8 ± 1.4 to 12.0 ± 2.5 cpm/oocyte/90 s, n= 5), indicating that HgCl2 induced Na+permeability of AQP6 oocytes consistent with the electrophysiological findings (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 5Radio-isotope influx measurements with22Na+.

To identify the residues responsible for Hg2+activation of AQP6, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. Three cysteines are present in rat AQP6: Cys-6, Cys-155, and Cys-190. The C6S mutant exhibited Hg2+-inducible water permeability and ion conductance similar to those of wild-type AQP6 (Fig.6). C155A and C190A each exhibited less Hg2+-inducible water permeability and ion conductance than did wild-type AQP6. The double mutant C155A/C190A exhibited negligible Hg2+-activation. Dose-dependent effects of HgCl2 on the conductance of AQP6-expressing oocyte was fitted to the Hill equation (Fig. 7). The Hill coefficient was 1.11 ± 0.28. Thus, Hg2+ binds to either the Cys-155 or the Cys-190 in each monomer to activate AQP6.Figure 7Dose-dependent conductance of an AQP6 oocyte treated with HgCl2. The average membrane conductance of an AQP6-expressing oocyte is shown as fitted to the Hill equation (n = 3–5). The conductance was calculated from the slope of the I-V curve between +10 and −90 mV obtained 1 min after application of the indicated concentration of HgCl2by a two-electrode voltage clamp. All values in fitting are the calculated parameter ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The aim of this study was to characterize the single-channel properties of AQP6 and to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which Hg2+ activates AQP6. We previously showed the ionic permeation of AQP6-expressing oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Here we used a single-channel patch clamp approach to examine the single-channel behavior of AQP6. Cell-attached patch recordings indicated that AQP6 is a gated channel induced by HgCl2 in a time-dependent manner. The I-V relationship from single-channel recordings indicated no voltage dependence, consistent with our previous findings obtained from a two-electrode voltage clamp (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The excised outside-out patch recording revealed a rapid activation of AQP6 by HgCl2, which is reversed rapidly by the application of β-mercaptoethanol. We have demonstrated that AQP6 activation is achieved by Hg2+binding to Cys-155 or Cys-190 residue in each monomer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that changes in water permeability resulted in equivalent changes in ion conductance. Taken together, these data suggest that each monomer forms a pore region for water and ions rather than ionic permeation through the center of homotetramer. Aquaporins are homotetramers with each monomer providing an independent water pore. In contrast, the conducting multimeric pore in many ion channels exists at the central 4-fold axis of symmetry. The 4-fold symmetry axis of GlpF has been considered as a potential pathway for ions because the dimensions along the axis are similar to those of the tetrameric KcsA potassium channel (15Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). We do not have direct evidence to conclude whether this is the case for AQP6; however, we strongly suspect that the each monomer contains an ion pore. We have found that each monomer has two Hg2+ binding sites, Cys-155 and Cys-190, indicating that there are eight Hg2+ binding sites in the homotetramer. Nevertheless, the Hill coefficient for Hg2+ binding is nearly unity, indicating no allosteric effects. Therefore, it is not likely that the 4-fold symmetry axis of AQP6 is the pore for ions. Structural analysis of AQP6 should identify the definitive ionic pathway for AQP6; however, attempts to express and purify the protein have so far been unsuccessful. Our studies with AQP6 contrast markedly with studies of AQP1 that purportedly led a subset of investigators to conclude that AQP1 functions as an ion channel. Previously reports (18Yool A.J. Stamer W.D. Regan J.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1216-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that oocytes expressing AQP1 contain forskolin-induced membrane currents, although we and other investigators could not confirm this (2Agre P. Lee M.D. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that stimulation with high concentrations of cGMP activated membrane currents in AQP1 oocytes (19Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57 (.0): 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This observation was qualitatively confirmed in planar bilayers containing purified AQP1; however, the cGMP-induced currents were activated very slowly, and, curiously, less than one in 106 AQP1 water channels was permeated by ions (3Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the biological significance (or lack of significance) of AQP1 ion conductance is debated, it is agreed that the AQP1 water and ion pathways are not identical. Thus, it is likely that the exceedingly rare currents through AQP1 probably represent slippage through the 4-fold axis and do not resemble ion conductance through the aqueous pore in each subunit of AQP6. Mercurials are known as inhibitors of aquaporins (5Macey R.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An earlier report of AQP6 showed inhibition of water permeability by HgCl2 (10Ma T. Yang B. Kuo W.L. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1996; 35: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we showed that HgCl2activates AQP6 (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the binding of Hg2+ to the corresponding sites (Cys-189 for AQP1 and Cys-190 for AQP6) leads to inhibition of AQP1 but activation of AQP6. We demonstrated that the binding of Hg2+ to AQP6 increased open probability of the channel gating. At this point, we could not distinguish whether the binding of Hg2+ to AQP1 simply occludes the pore or decreases the open probability of the channel because there is no evidence of rapid channel gating for AQP1. Cys-155 is the other binding site for Hg2+ to activate AQP6. The corresponding residue for Cys-155 is Cys-152 for AQP1 (6Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, Hg2+ has no effect on Cys-152 in AQP1. This also suggests that the mechanisms of Hg2+ effect on AQP6 are different from those of AQP1. We previously showed that low pH-induced AQP6 current is anion selective, based on reversal potentials measured in ion substitution experiments (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hg2+-induced AQP6 current exhibits much less ion selectivity. We hypothesize that pharmacological activation of AQP6 with Hg2+ leaves the pore in the maximally open state, which is probably not achieved physiologically. Nevertheless, the Hg2+-activation studies provide a new approach for molecular dissection of an ion channel. We believe that activation by low pH represents a physiologically open state that can be driven rapidly. The induction of water permeability of AQP6 by low pH is limited compared with the Hg2+-induced water permeability (4Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This may support our hypothesis that the pore open state is different between low pH-induced and Hg2+-induced AQP6 and that the characteristic of AQP6 as an anion channel is physiologically more relevant. Hg2+ activation and ionic permeation are unique characteristics of AQP6, as is gating. We believe that biophysical analysis of AQP6 will provide fundamental and novel insights into new functions of aquaporins and will form the basis for subsequent examination of structure-function relationships of the aquaporin channel family.

Accumulation of LCBPs results in cell growth inhibition in yeast, although the mechanism is unknown. Here, we identified a novel yeast gene, RSB1 (resistance to sphingoid long-chain base), by screening a multicopy suppressor of the LCB-sensitive phenotype of the LCBP lyase mutant. RSB1encodes a polypeptide of 354 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40.4 kDa. Rsb1p is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with seven transmembrane-spanning domains. We demonstrated that cells overproducing Rsb1p showed a decrease in accumulation of exogenously added sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine because of their increased release. This release was ATP-dependent, and a mutant of the predicted ATP binding motif had no activity. Substrate specificity analysis of Rsb1p demonstrated that it is active on LCBs but not on LCBPs or other hydrophobic compounds. These results suggest that Rsb1p is a transporter or flippase that translocates LCBs from the cytoplasmic side toward the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane.

The ceramide moiety consists of a sphingoid long-chain base (LCB)1(sphingosine (SPH) in animals, phytosphingosine (PHS) in yeast and plants), which is N-fatty acylated. In addition to the structural functions of sphingolipids in maintaining cell membrane integrity, recent discoveries have further revealed important roles for their metabolites such as ceramide, SPH, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPH1P) in such diverse biological responses as cell growth, differentiation, motility, apoptosis, and stress responses in mammalian cells (1Spiegel S. Merrill A.H., Jr. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 2Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of sphingolipids begins with the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, which is reduced to dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and then acylated to dihydroceramide. In mammalian cells, a 4,5-trans-double bond is then incorporated to form ceramide, which is further converted to sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids. Not a component in this synthetic pathway, sphingosine is encountered only as a product of sphingolipid turnover, but is then available also for phosphorylation. Synthesis of sphingolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is similar to that of mammalian sphingolipids (Fig.1). However, SPH is not produced in yeast, because dihydroceramide desaturase is not present. Instead, yeast contains PHS as the main sphingoid base. Phytoceramide is synthesized by attachment of a very-long-chain fatty acid to the amine of the LCB and converted to myo-inositol-containing sphingolipids, inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide (MIPC), and mannosyldiinositol phosphorylceramide (M(IP)2C). Because sphingolipids are essential for growth, yeast strains harboring mutations in the serine palmitoyltransferase gene, LCB1 or LCB2, cannot grow (4Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, addition of LCBs to the nutrient medium restores the growth defect of these mutant cells, indicating that yeast can incorporate exogenous LCBs into sphingolipids (4Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of ceramide synthesis, exogenously added LCBs must be delivered to the ER. Recently, it has been shown that a mutation of LCB3, which encodes a sphingoid long-chain base phosphate (LCBP) phosphatase associated with the ER membrane, or that of LCB4, a LCB kinase, reduces this incorporation drastically (6Qie L.

These results suggest that conversion of LCBs to LCBPs is essential for delivery of LCBs from the plasma membrane to the ER membrane. Yeast does not contain SPH or SPH1P, but two de novosynthesized LCBs, DHS and PHS, as well as their phosphorylated derivatives, LCBPs, have similarly been implicated as signaling molecules. LCBs are transiently increased upon heat shock and induce G0/G1 arrest and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (8Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H.

Elimination of the Dpl1 lyase or the Lcb3 phosphatase pathway results in a 2–5-fold and a 10–12-fold increase in the LCBP level, respectively (19Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Skrzypek M.S. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although a single deletion of DPL1 or LCB3elicits no growth defect, the concomitant deletion of DPL1and LCB3 causes cell death or a severe growth defect, which is dependent on strain background. In contrast, dpl1 lcb3 lcb4 triple mutants exhibit normal growth, indicating that hyperaccumulation of LCBPs is toxic to cells (19Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Skrzypek M.S. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this toxicity, as well as the target molecules of the LCBPs, has not been determined. In an attempt to identify genes for which products may be involved in LCBs/LCBPs signaling or transport, we screened a multicopy suppressor gene of the LCB-sensitive phenotype of the Δdpl1 cells. We obtained a novel gene, RSB1, which encodes a highly hydrophobic protein. Overproduction of this protein, Rsb1p, conferred on cells a resistance to SPH, PHS, DHS, andl-threo-dihydrosphingosine, but not to other hydrophobic compounds tested. This indicated that the effect of Rsb1p was LCB-specific. Cells overproducing Rsb1p also demonstrated an increase in LCB release, an ATP-dependent reaction. Together, these results suggest that Rsb1p may be a transporter or flippase that translocates LCBs outward across the plasma membrane.

KHY128 cells were constructed by mating SEY6210 with SEY6211 (21Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) cells. The Δdpl1::TRP1, Δlcb3::LEU2, Δysr3::URA3, and Δrsb1::HIS3 cells were constructed to replace the 0.47-kb SmaI-BglII region in theDPL1 gene, the 0.84-kb BamHI-HpaI region in the LCB3 gene, the 0.39-kbHindIII-StuI region in the YSR3 gene, and the 0.58-kb EcoRV-EcoRV region in theRSB1 gene with the TRP1, LEU2, URA3, or HIS3 marker, respectively. Cells were grown either in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or in synthetic complete (SC) medium containing nutritional supplements. A yeast genomic library was constructed by ligating 4–10-kb Sau3AI fragments of KHY24 genomic DNA to the BamHI site of pRS426 (22Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). A pool of 100,000 Ura+ clones, obtained after transformation of KHY13 cells with the library, was plated on YPD agar containing 5 μm SPH or 10 μm PHS. Nonidet P-40 (0.0015% w/v, final concentration) was also included in the plates as a dispersant. pAK80, a pRS316-derived yeast cloning vector, was designed for protein expression under the control of theTDH3 promoter, encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The TDH3 promoter region was first amplified from the pKT10 plasmid (23Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell.

The resulting fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to generate the pAK76 plasmid, and the 0.37-kb EcoRI fragment of pAK76 was then cloned into theEcoRI site of pRS316 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pAK80. The pAK90 plasmid, which encodes RSB1 under the control of the TDH3 promoter, was constructed in the following manner. Using the pAK69 plasmid, which contains a 3.1-kbSacI-PstI fragment of RSB1 region in pBluescript II SK+, as a template and the primers 5′-AGATCTTGGTATGGTACCGAACCTTCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACG-3′, the RSB1 region was amplified and then cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate the pAK75 plasmid. Finally, pAK90 was constructed by cloning a 2.8-kb BglII-NotI fragment of pAK75 into the BamHI-NotI site of pAK80. The pAK162 yeast vector was constructed to produce N-terminally triple hemagglutinin (3×HA)-tagged fusion proteins. The 3×HA epitope was amplified from the pKHR45 plasmid (25Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), using the primers 5′-GCAGCCCGGGGGAACCATGAGTTACCC-3′ and 5′-TTGTTAACGAGCTCTAAAGCGTAATCTGG-3′. This PCR fragment was first cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate pAK147, and the 0.14-kbSmaI-NotI fragment of pAK147 was cloned into the same site of pAK80 to generate pAK162. The plasmid pAK170, which encodes 3×HA-RSB1, was further constructed by cloning a 2.8-kb BglII (blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase)-NotI fragment into theHpaI-NotI site of pAK162. Finally, pAK186 (3×HA-rsb1 (G282W)) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers (5′-GCGTTTAAATGGAGAAGCACCTCG-3′ and 5′-CGAGGTGCTTCTCCATTTAAACGC-3′). Yeast strains were grown to 1A600 unit/ml in SC medium lacking uracil at 30 °C. Cells were treated with [3-3H]SPH (23.5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [4,5-3H]DHS (50 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc.), both of which had been complexed with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, A-6003) and incubated for indicated time periods. 0.1 μCi of [3H]SPH and 1 μCi of [3H]DHS were used for labeling 1 A600 cells. At each time point, cells equivalent to 0.45 A600 were chilled on ice, washed with cold SC medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA, and suspended in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA. Glass beads were added, and cells were lysed by vortexing vigorously. Lipids were extracted by successive addition and mixing of 187.5 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1, v/v), 62.5 μl of chloroform, and 62.5 μl of 1% KCl. Phases were separated by centrifugation, and the organic phase was recovered, dried, and suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The labeled lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC plates (Merck) with 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, v/v). Yeast strains were grown to 1A600 unit/ml in SC medium lacking uracil at 30 °C. Cells were treated with [3H]DHS (1 μCi/1A600 cells), which had been complexed with 1 mg/ml BSA, and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Cells were then washed with SC medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA two times, suspended in SC medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA, and incubated for the indicated time periods at 30 °C. Cells and medium were separated by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted from the medium and separated by TLC as described above. Cells equivalent to 2A600 were recovered by centrifugation and suspended in 100 μl of 0.2 n NaOH, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for 15 min on ice, samples were treated with 1 ml of cold acetone and incubated for 30 min at −20 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the resulting pellets were suspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue). Lysates equivalent to 0.2 A600 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to ImmobilonTMpolyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The resulting membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA antibodies, Y-11 (Santa Cruz) for 1 h and then with a 1:7500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2fragment (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Labeling was detected by the ECL detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde in potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), collected by centrifugation, and suspended in a mixture of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m sorbitol, and 5 mm sodium azide. Cells were then converted to spheroplasts by adding 0.002 volume of 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Co.) and incubating for 30 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were laid on multiwell glass slides (Cel-Line/Erie Scientific Co.) coated with polylysine, then permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA7 (Sigma) and anti-Kar2 antiserum (a gift from T. Yoshihisa, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) were used at 1:100 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. After washing, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h. For secondary staining the antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (10 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) were used. Cells were washed, mounted with a Slow Fade Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes), and observed under a fluorescence laser scanning microscope (LSM510; Zeiss). In searching for a new gene involved in LCBs/LCBPs signaling or in their transport, we screened for a multicopy suppressor gene that would rescue a LCB-sensitive phenotype. Because overaccumulation of LCBPs is toxic to yeast cells, the LCBP lyase mutant (Δdpl1) KHY13 cells are sensitive to exogenous LCBs. First, to prevent the isolation of previously established genes for LCBP lyase (DPL1) and LCBP phosphatase (LCB3, YSR3) genes, we constructed a yeast genomic library using genomic DNA prepared from KHY24 (Δdpl1 Δlcb3Δysr3) cells in a high copy number vector pRS426. A pool of KHY13 cells was then transformed with this genomic library and plated on YPD plates containing 5 μm SPH or 10 μm PHS. Several clones were obtained, but restriction-enzyme mapping, nucleotide sequencing, and subcloning revealed that all clones carried the same gene. This gene, termedRSB1, was found to be identical to an open reading frame indicated as YOR049c (GenBankTM accession no.CAA99241) in the S. cerevisiae data base. The RSB1 gene encodes a putative polypeptide of 354 amino acids (Fig. 2A) with a deduced molecular mass of 40.4 kDa. This protein, Rsb1p, is highly hydrophobic, and both the TopPredII 1.1 (26Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Cabios. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) and the SOSUI (27Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) programs predict it to be an integral membrane protein with seven membrane-spanning segments (Fig. 2B). Rsb1p has four homologs (Rtm1p, Yer185w, Rta1p, and Ylr046c) in the yeast data base. Rtm1p and Rta1p have been isolated as conferring resistance in yeast to the toxicity of molasses (28Ness F. Aigle M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 945-956PubMed Google Scholar) and 7-aminocholesterol (29Soustre I. Letourneux Y. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively, whereas functions forYER185w and YLR046c are unknown. Rsb1p shows 23–28% identity and 40–48% similarity to these proteins. Of these homologs, Rsb1p is the largest and contains an extended loop between predicted transmembrane domains 5 and 6 and a long C-terminal tail. A Walker A motif, GX4G(K/R/H)(T/S), generally known to mediate ATP binding and hydrolysis (30Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4210) Google Scholar), is present within the junction between the predicted transmembrane domain 7 and the C-terminal tail of Rsb1p. However, this motif is not found in other homologs. Rsb1p was previously predicted to be a transporter, based on its sequence (31DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of Rsb1p on the intracellular accumulation of LCBs (SPH or DHS) added exogenously. We also investigated the conversion of the imported LCB to LCBP, the step necessary for incorporation of exogenous LCB into sphingolipid. To measure the uptake and conversion of LCBs, we used the Δdpl1 Δlcb3 double deletion-containing KHY21 cells transformed with an empty vector pAK80 (control) or the same vector carrying the RSB1 gene, pAK90. 3H-Labeled SPH or DHS was added to the culture medium and incubated at 30 °C. At several time points, cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted and separated by TLC. As shown in Fig. 3, yeast cells harboring the pAK80 vector efficiently transported both exogenous SPH (Fig. 3, A (lanes 1–4) and C (closed circles)) and DHS (Fig. 3, B (lanes 1–4) and C (open circles)) into the cells. By 20 min most of the exogenous SPH and DHS had been imported (Fig.3C, closed and open circles). At 60 min, SPH1P and DHS1P were apparent (Fig. 3, A (lane 4) and B (lane 4)). On the other hand, cells overproducing Rsb1p (via pAK90) had much lower accumulations of exogenous SPH (Fig. 3, A (lanes 5–8) and C (closed squares)) and DHS (Fig. 3, B(lanes 5–8) and C (open squares)). These cells imported approximately 40% of the total SPH and 50% of the total DHS at 60 min, and initial transport rates of SPH and DHS were reduced by 6- and 5-fold, respectively, compared with control cells harboring the pAK80 vector (Fig.3C). Again, SPH1P and DHS1P were detected at 60 min, although their amounts were also reduced compared with the control cells (Fig. 3, A (lane 8) and B(lane 8)). To determine whether the reduced accumulation of exogenous DHS is caused by decrease in uptake or by an increase in release, we next performed an in vivo LCB release assay. The yeast cells carrying pAK80 or pAK90 were first incubated with [3H]DHS for 1 h to allow cells to accumulate DHS. Cells were then washed, resuspended in medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA, and incubated for 0, 10, and 30 min at 30 °C. At each time point, medium was separated from cells by centrifugation. Lipids were extracted from the medium and separated by TLC. Control cells harboring pAK80 released only 6% of the accumulated DHS by 10 min (Fig. 4, A (lane 2) and B(circles)). The amount of released DHS slightly decreased to 3% at 30 min (Fig. 4A, lane 3) probably because of competition by the import reaction. In contrast, cells overproducing Rsb1p released 25% of the accumulated DHS at 10 min, which was an ∼4-fold increase compared with control cells (Fig. 4, A(lane 5) and B (squares)). The released DHS was slightly increased to 30% at 30 min (Fig.4A, lane 6). To determine the phenotypic consequences of a complete loss ofRSB1 function, we constructed a null mutant allele ofrsb1 by replacing approximately half of RSB1 with the HIS3 gene. The Δrsb1 cells were viable and showed normal growth in YPD medium, indicating RSB1 function is not required for vegetative growth of the cells (data not shown). We next performed the in vivo DHS release assay using the Δrsb1 cells. Released DHS was reduced by 4-fold at 10 min and 10-fold at 30 min compared with those released from wild-type cells (Fig. 4, A (lanes 8 and 9) and B (triangles)). These results indicate that Rsb1p is involved in DHS release. We next examined the energy dependence of the DHS release by Rsb1p. Carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), which disrupts the membrane potential, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose and sodium azide, which deplete intracellular ATP, were used. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of the yeast cells with CCCP had little effect (Fig. 5A, lane 4), whereas treatment with 2-deoxy-d-glucose and sodium azide inhibited the Rsb1p-dependent DHS release (Fig. 5A, lane 6). These results suggest that Rsb1p may be an ATP-dependent transporter protein. As shown in Fig. 2, Rsb1p contains a possible Walker A ATP binding motif located at the beginning of the C-terminal tail. To investigate whether this predicted ATP-binding motif is required for Rsb1p activity, Gly-282 was mutated by site-directed mutation to a large but similarly hydrophilic residue, Trp. For detection of Rsb1p by immunoblotting, we constructed pAK170 (3×HA-RSB1+) and pAK186 (3×HA-rsb1(G282W)) plasmids, which express N-terminally 3×HA-tagged Rsb1p or its mutant, respectively, under the control of aTDH3 promoter. Using anti-HA antibodies, a 43-kDa protein was detected in cell lysates prepared from cells bearing pAK170 (Fig.6A, lane 2) and pAK186 (Fig. 6A, lane 3), but not those bearing the null plasmid pAK162 (Fig. 6A, lane 1). HA-Rsb1p was functional in vivo, because cells carrying pAK170 could suppress the growth defect of KHY13 on YPD plates containing 10 μm PHS (Fig. 6B). However, KHY13 cells overproducing the mutated Rsb1(G282W) could not form a single colony on the same plate (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the predicted ATP-binding motif is required for the Rsb1p activity. As shown above, we directly demonstrated that Rsb1p is involved in DHS release. Because RSB1 suppressed the SPH- and PHS-sensitive phenotypes of the LCBP lyase mutant (Table I), Rsb1p may also have releasing activities effective on SPH and PHS. To investigate whether the activity of Rsb1p is restricted to d-erythroisomers of LCBs, sensitivity tol-threo-dihydrosphingosine was tested. Cells overproducing Rsb1p showed a resistance tol-threo-dihydrosphingosine (Table I), indicating that Rsb1p is not stereospecific. Next, we examined whether Rsb1p can release intracellular LCBPs. KHY21 (Δdpl1Δlcb3) cells were used for this purpose. In some yeast backgrounds, a double deletion of DPL1 and LCB3genes causes a lethal phenotype resulting from hyperaccumulation of intracellular LCBPs (19Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Skrzypek M.S. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). KHY21 (Δdpl1Δlcb3) cells did show a severe growth defect, but were able to grow. The plasmid pAK80 (vector only) or pAK90 (vector withRSB1) was introduced into KHY21 cells, and their growth was investigated. KHY21/pAK90 cells, which overproduced Rsb1p, showed a growth rate indistinguishable from the control cells, indicating that Rsb1p cannot release intracellular LCBPs. We also examined the effects of Rsb1p on the release of hydrophobic compounds unrelated to LCBs such as aureobasidin A (an inhibitor of IPC synthase) and deoxycholic acid. As shown in Table I, overproduction of Rsb1p had no effects on sensitivities to these compounds. Thus, Rsb1p is highly specific to LCBs.Table ISubstrate specificity for Rsb1pCompoundKHY13/pAK80KHY13/pAK90Phytosphingosine8 μm20 μmd-erythro-Sphingosine2.5 μm10 μmd-erythro-Dihydrosphingosine5 μm30 μml-threo-Dihydrosphingosine10 μm30 μmAureobasidin A90 nm90 nmDeoxycholic acid2.4 mm2.4 mm Open table in a new tab Rsb1p plays a role in releasing LCBs, suggesting that it is localized to the plasma membrane. To examine whether the localization of Rsb1p is limited to the plasma membrane, we performed an immunofluorescent microscopic analysis. Cells expressing 3×HA-Rsb1p were stained by anti-HA antibodies. By confocal imaging, HA-Rsb1p was detected at several membrane structures including the plasma membrane (Fig. 7A). Double staining with antibodies against Kar2p, an ER marker, revealed that Rsb1p was partially co-localized with Kar2p (Fig. 7B). These results indicated that Rsb1p is localized to the plasma membrane, the ER, and other unknown organelles, probably the endosomes. In this study, we isolated a novel gene, RSB1, as a multicopy suppressor of the toxic effects of exogenous PHS and SPH. Rsb1p, its product, is highly hydrophobic and contains seven putative transmembrane segments. Rsb1p is predicted to be a transporter, although its substrates have been unclear. Here, we demonstrated that overproduction of Rsb1p caused an apparent decrease in the uptake of exogenous SPH and DHS (Fig. 3). Further analysis showed that this decrease was, in fact, the result of an increase in DHS release (Fig.4). Two mechanisms for the acceleration of DHS release by Rsb1p can be considered. First is the possibility that Rsb1p is a transporter protein and directly releases the imported DHS to the medium. Alternatively, Rsb1p enhances the metabolism of the exogenous DHS, which in turn increases the DHS release. Recent studies have demonstrated that exogenous DHS, once imported, is metabolized to sphingolipid through conversion to DHS1P (6Qie L. Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16110-16117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sütterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). DHS1P is dephosphorylated by a LCBP phosphatase, Lcb3p, at the ER, and the generated DHS is converted to ceramide. Ceramide is then converted to inositol-containing sphingolipids at the Golgi apparatus and transported to the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is possible that intracellular DHS accumulated by enhanced metabolism flows to the plasma membrane and is released to the medium. However, we reject the second possibility for following reasons. First, the kinetics of the DHS release is much faster compared with its conversion to DHS1P. The accelerated DHS release caused by Rsb1p competed with the import reaction, suggesting that the DHS release was occurring even at an earlier time point. However, the conversion to DHS1P was not detected until 60 min (Fig. 3). Moreover, because we used the Δdpl1Δlcb3 cells for the import assay, the metabolic pathway for exogenous LCB would be blocked in these cells. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that Rsb1p directly releases the imported DHS. The yeast S. cerevisiae contains four Rsb1p homologs, Rtm1p, Yer185w, Rta1p, and Ylr046c. RTM1 and RTA1 genes were also isolated as multicopy suppressors of toxic compounds, molasses (28Ness F. Aigle M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 945-956PubMed Google Scholar) and 7-aminocholesterol (29Soustre I. Letourneux Y. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, these homologs may constitute a transporter family. Among them, Rsb1p is the largest, and the only one possessing a predicted ATP-binding motif. We demonstrated that Rsb1p-dependent DHS release was ATP-dependent, and mutation of this motif abolished its activity. We also established that Rsb1p was highly specific to LCBs, and it could not act even on the phosphorylated LCBs, LCBPs. Rsb1p released all LCBs tested (phytosphingosine,d-erythro-sphingosine,d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine,l-threo-dihydrosphingosine). Therefore, the common amino and hydroxyl groups of LCBs may be important for recognition by Rsb1p, but some variations of the long-chain moieties may be permitted. From these results, we suggest that Rsb1p releases LCBs specifically and in an ATP-dependent manner. Yeast cells that carry a Δrsb1 mutation exhibited a decrease in LCB release but no other apparent unique phenotype. Therefore, the physiological function of Rsb1p remains unclear. One possibility is that Rsb1p is a drug transporter responsible for releasing LCB-like compounds. Previous microarray analysis showed thatRSB1 is one of the genes regulated by Pdr1p and Pdr3p (31DeRisi J. van den Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Pdr1p and Pdr3p are transcription factors that control expressions of various transporter proteins such as ABC transporters. The other possibility is that Rsb1p is a flippase rather than a transporter. Because LCBs are natural components of yeast membranes and are embedded in the lipid bilayer, we favor this possibility. Lipids can move within the lipid bilayer, a process termed flip-flop, where flip means translocation toward the cytosolic membrane leaflet. Because this process is generally slow, it may be driven by proteins termed flippases in cells. In our assay for LCB release, BSA was included in the medium to prevent nonspecific binding of LCB to the cell surface. Thus, LCB “flopped” toward the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by Rsb1p could be extracted by exogenous BSA. LCBs are regarded as signaling molecules, and their transient increase induces G0/G1 arrest and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (12Chung N. Jenkins G. Hannun Y.A. Heitman J. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17229-17232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, their orientation changes in lipid bilayers may be important for regulation of LCB signaling. Alternatively, it is possible that “flop” of LCBs is an important step in the de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Previous biochemical results using mouse liver suggested that sphingolipid synthesis is initiated and proceeds on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane until dihydroceramide synthesis begins (32Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, galactosylceramide and sphingomyelin were shown to be synthesized in the luminal side of the ER and the Golgi apparatus, respectively (33Sprong H. Kruithof B. Leijendekker R. Slot J.W. van Meer G. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25880-25888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, a flop reaction is required in the sphingolipid synthesis pathway, and it is assumed that ceramide is a candidate for having a role in this step. Recently, most of the enzymes involved in the sphingolipid synthesis have been cloned (35Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36Buede R.

Therefore, the topology of their active sites can be re-examined by more direct methods such as antibody binding assays, fusion to a topological reporter protein, and protease site introduction/digestion experiments. Such topological analysis has been performed only for the yeast IPC synthase, Aur1p, illustrating that its active site is located on the luminal side of the Golgi apparatus (41Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, we also demonstrated that the active site of the LCBP phosphatase, Lcb3p, is located in the lumen of the ER, 2A. Kihara, unpublished observations. suggesting that LCBPs are dephosphorylated at the luminal side and the resulting LCBs are released into the luminal leaflet. Because LCBs generated in this manner are then metabolized to ceramide and sphingolipids, LCBs in the luminal leaflet may be substrates for ceramide synthase. Therefore, we hypothesize that translocation of DHS (or the earlier intermediate, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine) toward the luminal side of the ER membrane is an essential process in sphingolipid synthesis. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Rsb1p is localized not only to the plasma membrane but also to the ER and other unknown organelles. Although it is possible that staining at the ER is artifact resulting from overexpression, it is possible that Rsb1p also functions in de novo sphingolipid synthesis or its regulation as one of the flippases that translocates LCBs toward the luminal side of the ER membrane. However, further analysis is required for elucidation of the precise physiological function of Rsb1p. We thank T. Yoshihisa (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan) for the anti-Kar2p antiserum and J. Inokuchi (this laboratory) for discussion."

Given that the signaling-facilitating molecules Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) and Hrs are mainly localized in early endosomes, it was unclear whether receptor internalization is required for Smad2 activation. Using reversible biotin labeling, we directly monitored internalization of the TGF-β type I receptor. Our data indicate that TGF-β type I receptor is endocytosed via a clathrin-dependent mechanism and is effectively blocked by depletion of intracellular potassium or by expression of a mutant dynamin (K44A). However, blockage of receptor endocytosis by these two means has no effect on TGF-β-mediated Smad2 activation. Furthermore, TGF-β-induced Smad2 activation was unaffected by inhibition of hVPS34 activity with wortmannin or inhibitory anti-hVPS34 antibodies. Finally, we demonstrated that Smad2 interacted with cell surface receptors and that a SARA binding-deficient Smad2 mutant was phosphorylated by the receptors. Thus, our findings suggest that receptor endocytosis is dispersible for TGF-β-mediated activation of Smad2 and that this activation can be mediated by both SARA-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that endocytosis may facilitate signaling by targeting signaling complexes to specific subcellular localization, either to increase access of activated receptor kinases to their substrates or to compartmentalize signaling complexes (1McPherson P.S.

Consistent with this idea, blocking of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was found to attenuate the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases by receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors (4Vieira A.V.

Upon the activation of G-protein-coupled proteinase-activated receptor 2, a multiprotein signaling complex that contains β-arrestin 1, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases is formed on endocytic vesicles as well (8DeFea K.A.

TGF-β1 binds to its cell surface receptors, resulting in the formation of type I and type II receptor complexes. In the complex, the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) phosphorylates and activates the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), which in turn phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residues of Smad proteins Smad2 and Smad3. As a result, Smad proteins accumulate in the nucleus, bind to DNA, and regulate transcription. The ligand-stimulated receptor complexes undergo endocytosis and are eventually degraded in an ubiquitin/lysosome-dependent pathway (9Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H.

This finding raises an important question: does Smad2 phosphorylation occur at the plasma membrane, where the receptors are exposed to TGF-β, or in early endosomes, where the signal-facilitating molecules SARA and Hrs are mainly localized? To investigate the role of TGF-β receptor endocytosis in Smad2 activation, we directly followed endocytosis of TβRI using a cell surface biotinylation protocol. Our data reveal that TβRI is rapidly internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis but that inhibition of receptor internalization does not block Smad2 activation. L17-TβRI cells and HeLa cells stably expressing wild-type and K44A dynamin were maintained as described previously (14Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J.

TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems, wortmannin was purchased from Sigma, anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-phospho-Thr308-AKT and anti-AKT were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-VPS34 antibodies have been described previously (22Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Unless indicated, all chemicals were from Fisher/ICN. SARA(dFYVE) and SARA(665-end) were generated by PCR-based deletion, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection, reporter assay, immunoprecipitation, Western analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as described previously (16Chen Y.G. Hata A., Lo, R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Receptor affinity labeling was carried out as described previously (17Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), except that 5 mm KCl was not included in KRH buffer for −KCl samples. Potassium depletion was performed as described by Larkin et al. (18Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with hypotonic medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 50% H2O) for 10 min and with isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with or without 10 mm KCl for 30 min. TGF-β1 was then added to a final concentration of 100 pm, and the cells were incubated for another 30 min. Cell lysates were harvested for Western analysis. L17-TβRI cells were maintained in growth medium in the absence of tetracycline for 16–24 h before biotinylation. Biotinylation was performed as described previously (19Marmorstein A.D. Zurzolo C., Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook 120. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 341Google Scholar). After labeling with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce), the cells were shifted to 37 °C for the indicated time in the presence or absence of 100 pm TGF-β1. Endocytosis was then stopped by transferring cells back to 4 °C. After treatment with reducing solution (15.5 mg/ml glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 10% fetal bovine serum) and 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2 plus 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were lysed in TNE (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA). Equal amounts of cell lysates were used for precipitation of biotinylated proteins with streptavidin beads (Pierce). Precipitated proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting. To study the relationship between receptor signaling and endocytosis, we chose to directly monitor TβRI internalization in the stable cell line L17-TβRI that is derived from the TβRI-deficient mink lung epithelial L17 cells and expresses HA-tagged TβRI under the control of tetracycline (15Pasche B. Kolachana P. Nafa K. Satagopan J. Chen Y.G., Lo, R.S. Brener D. Yang D. Kirstein L. Oddoux C. Ostrer H. Vineis P. Varesco L. Jhanwar S. Luzzatto L. Massague J. Offit K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5678-5682PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface proteins were labeled at 4 °C using a reducible biotinylation method (19Marmorstein A.D. Zurzolo C., Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook 120. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 341Google Scholar). After additional incubation of labeled cells for various times at 37 °C, biotin remaining at the cell surface was removed by incubation with impermeable reducing agents at 4 °C. Internalized receptors, which are protected from reduction, were then precipitated with streptavidin beads and analyzed by immunoblotting. First, we examined the ligand dependence of TβRI internalization. The cell surface TβRI was well labeled, and treatment of the cells with reducing agents efficiently removed biotin from the cell surface (Fig.1A, lanes 1 and 2). After the cells were shifted to 37 °C, TβRI was rapidly internalized, and its internalization was further increased by TGF-β treatment (Fig 1A, lanes 3–8; Fig.1B). To examine whether TβRI endocytosis is a clathrin-mediated process, we used two protocols that have been previously demonstrated to disrupt clathrin-mediated vesicle formation. Depletion of intracellular potassium decreases clathrin-coated pit formation and thus inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis (18Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is also regulated by the GTPase dynamin, and expression of dynamin mutants defective in GTP binding or hydrolysis blocks the endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptors (20Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). L17-TβRI cells were treated with hypotonic medium followed by isotonic potassium-free buffer to deplete intracellular potassium. Potassium depletion significantly inhibited TβRI endocytosis (Fig.2A, lane 4). However, ligand-mediated TβRI endocytosis was restored when 10 mm KCl was included in the buffer (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Therefore, depletion of intracellular potassium potently blocked TβRI internalization. To confirm the clathrin dependence of TβRI internalization, we employed stable HeLa cell lines that express wild-type dynamin or the K44A mutant under the control of tetracycline (14Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar); dynamin expression in these cells is induced by the withdrawal of tetracycline. The cells were transfected with HA-tagged TβRI and maintained in the growth medium in the absence of tetracycline, and TβRI endocytosis was measured. As shown in Fig. 2B, TβRI is efficiently endocytosed in HeLa cells expressing wild-type dynamin (lanes 3 and 4); a high level of ligand-independent TβRI internalization was observed, which could be due to the high level of receptor expression. Nonetheless, expression of K44A dynamin completely blocked TβRI internalization (Fig. 2B, lanes 7and 8). To test whether internalization of TGF-β receptors is required for Smad activation, L17-TβRI cells were subjected to depletion of intracellular potassium. The cells were then stimulated with TGF-β, and Smad2 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Smad2 antibodies (Fig.3A). Although potassium depletion potently inhibited TβRI internalization, it had no effect on TGF-β-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation (compare lanes 4and 6). Similar results were obtained with TGF-β1 at a concentration as low as 10 pm and were also observed in HeLa and Hep3B cells (data not shown). To further study whether clathrin-mediated endocytosis is essential for Smad2 activation by TGF-β, we examined Smad2 phosphorylation in dynamin-expressing HeLa cells. TGF-β stimulated the phosphorylation of Smad2 in parental HeLa cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 1and 2), and this phosphorylation was not inhibited by the expression of wild-type or K44A dynamin (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–10). We also examined the effect of wild-type and mutant dynamin on TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Smad2 is localized in the cytoplasm at the basal state, and TGF-β treatment resulted in its translocation into the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Expression of either wild-type or K44A dynamin had no effect on TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad2 (Fig. 3C). To examine whether TβRI endocytosis is necessary for the transcriptional activity of TGF-β, we examined the expression of two TGF-β-responsive reporters (3TP-luciferase and ARE-luciferase), whose expression is Smad-mediated. The 3TP-luciferase construct was transiently transfected into parental or dynamin-expressing HeLa cells, and reporter expression was measured after TGF-β treatment. TGF-β-induced expression of this reporter was not inhibited by expression of either wild-type dynamin or K44A mutant (Fig. 3D, left panel). We further confirmed this result in Hep3B cells using the ARE-luciferase reporter. Expression of wild-type dynamin enhanced ARE-luciferase expression, which is consistent with slightly higher Smad2 phosphorylation in cells expressing wild-type dynamin (Fig. 3B, lane 6). However, expression of the T65A and K142A dynamin mutants, which have been shown to block transferrin uptake (21Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), did not inhibit TGF-β induction of the ARE reporter (Fig. 3D, right panel). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that TβRI endocytosis is not required for Smad2 activation or Smad-mediated reporter expression in TGF-β-stimulated cells. The FYVE domain of SARA binds to PI(3)P, and deletion of the FYVE domain-containing N terminus of SARA antagonizes TGF-β-stimulated expression of ARE-luciferase (11Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). These data suggest that production of PI(3)P, presumably in the early endosome, is important for TβRI signaling. To test this hypothesis, we treated L17-TβRI cells with 100 nm wortmannin, which inhibits all phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases except the class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2α isoform. As shown in Fig.4A, wortmannin had no effect on TGF-β-stimulated Smad2 phosphorylation (lane 3), although it inhibited insulin-mediated Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation at threonine 308 (lane 10). Similar results were obtained in Hep3B cells (data not shown). In addition, treatment of Hela cells with wortmannin did not affect TGF-β-induced Smad2 nuclear localization (data not shown). To specifically examine the role of PI(3)P in TGF-β signaling, we microinjected HepG2 cells with specific inhibitory antibodies against the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, hVPS34. These antibodies disrupt the trafficking of internalized platelet-derived growth factor receptors and the endosomal localization of EEA1 (22Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, they completely disrupt the localization of the intracellular PI(3)P marker 2X-FYVE-GFP fusion protein in Chinese hamster ovary (23Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and HepG2 cells (data not shown). However, microinjection of inhibitory anti-VPS34 antibodies had no effect on TGF-β-stimulated nuclear accumulation of Smad2 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B). To directly address whether the FYVE domain is required for SARA function, we examined TGF-β-induced expression of 3TP-luciferase in the presence of SARA(dFYVE), a mutant that lacks the FYVE domain. This mutant was shown to lose a punctate subcellular localization but still interact with Smad2 (11Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this mutant should have a dominant negative effect on TGF-β signaling by sequestering Smad2 and Smad3 away from the membrane. However, like the wild-type SARA, SARA(dFYVE) has no effect on TGF-β activity in mediating the expression of 3TP-luciferase. This is in contrast to SARA(665-end), a mutant lacking both the N terminus and the FYVE domain, which does inhibit TGF-β function (Fig. 5) (11Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). These results suggest that interactions between SARA and intracellular PI(3)P are not required for Smad2 activation. To address whether Smad2 is activated on the plasma membrane, the receptor-Smad2 complexes were examined when receptor endocytosis was blocked. COS1 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad1 or Smad2, TβRI, and TβRII were subjected to potassium depletion and then incubated with125I-TGF-β1 to label cell surface receptors. After treatment with a cross-linking reagent, receptor-Smad complexes were examined by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Because the interaction between TβRI and Smad2 is transient, Smad2 stably associated with the receptors only when the kinase-deficient TβRI mutant was expressed (Fig.6A, lane 3). Importantly, Smad2 still interacted with TGF-β receptor complex even when receptor endocytosis was inhibited by potassium depletion (lane 5), strongly indicating that Smad2 is recruited into receptor complexes on the plasma membrane. To further investigate the role of SARA in Smad2 activation, we examined phosphorylation of Smad2(N381S), a mutant deficient in SARA-binding (24Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), in dynamin(K44A)-expressing HeLa cells. FLAG-tagged Smad2(N381S) was transfected into dynamin(K44A))-expressing HeLa cells together with TβRI and TβRII constructs. After induction of dynamin K44A expression for 16 h, the cells were treated with TGF-β1, and Smad2(N381S) phosphorylation was revealed by anti-phospho-Smad2 immunoblotting after anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.6B, Smad2(N381S) was phosphorylated when coexpressed with TGF-β receptors, and this phosphorylation was further stimulated by TGF-β. Phosphorylation of Smad2(N381S) in the absence of TGF-β could be due to protein overexpression. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that SARA binding activity is not essential for receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2. This phosphorylation is presumably mediated by the cell surface receptors because it is not abolished by inhibition of receptor endocytosis. Our finding that TβRI is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis is in agreement with the earlier studies, which utilized granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-TGF-β chimeric receptors (25Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Dore J.J. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The internalization of these chimeric receptors was abolished by potassium depletion. Furthermore, recent studies also suggest that internalization of TβRII is clathrin-mediated (26Ehrlich M. Shmuely A. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1777-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, uptake of 125I-TGF-β1 was not blocked by chloroquine or transient expression of K44A dynamin (27Zwaagstra J.C., El- Alfy M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27237-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TGF-β uptake may differ from that of TβRI internalization because TGF-β uptake can be mediated by different binding proteins, such as β-glycan. Thus, TGF-β uptake reflects the sum of internalized TGF-β-bound proteins, some of which may utilize clathrin-independent internalization mechanisms. SARA has been shown to play a role in Smad-mediated signaling. Given the endosomal localization of this protein, a model has emerged in which the internalization of TβRI receptors into early endosomes facilitates interactions with SARA and enhances TGF-β signaling. In this study, we have tested several aspects of this model. We demonstrate that TβRI internalizes via coated vesicles. However, inhibition of this process using two different methods has no effect on Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and has no effect on TGF-β-stimulated transcription. Furthermore, we find that disruption of the interaction between PI(3)P and the SARA FYVE domain, either by inhibiting cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases with wortmannin, by specifically inhibiting hVPS34 with antibodies, or by deleting the FYVE domain, has no effect on TGF-β-mediated signaling. In addition, we provide evidence that Smad2 can be recruited directly to cell surface TGF-β receptors. Therefore, we conclude that TβRI endocytosis is qualitatively dispersible for Smad2 activation and that interactions between the FYVE domain of SARA and PI(3)P are not necessary for Smad2-mediated TGF-β signaling. We further demonstrate that the SARA binding-deficient mutant Smad2(N381S) is still phosphorylated by activated TGF-β receptors. This is consistent with our previous results showing that both wild-type Smad2 and Smad2(N381S) can stimulate ARE-luciferase expression, but only the activity of wild-type Smad2 is enhanced by SARA (24Wu G. Chen Y.G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor-mediated Smad2 activation is mediated by both SARA-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our results do not rule out the possibility that receptor endocytosis may contribute to the maximal activation of Smad2. Although not required for TGF-β signaling, interactions with endosomal SARA could modulate the intensity or lifetime of TGF-β signaling in the presence of submaximal levels of ligand. This is suggested by recent experiments in which a dominant negative Rab5 increases TGF-β signaling presumably by influencing early endosomal dynamics (28Panopoulou E. Gillooly D.J. Wrana J.L. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Murphy C. Fotsis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18046-18052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that overexpression of wild-type dynamin slightly enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation. This suggests that overexpression of wild-type dynamin may accelerate receptor endocytosis and thereby facilitate Smad2 activation. Alternatively, enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation may be due to endocytosis-independent effects of dynamin on other signaling pathways, as has been suggested for mitogenic and apoptotic signal transduction (29Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24575-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Fish K.N. Schmid S.L. Damke H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Receptor endocytosis has been shown to be required for certain signaling pathways but not for others. For instance, isoproterenol-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation is inhibited by K44A dynamin, whereas activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C via trimeric G-proteins is unaffected (7Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similarly, blockage of insulin-like growth factor receptor internalization interferes with the Shc/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but not with the insulin receptor substrate-1 pathway (6Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition to the Smad pathway, TGF-β has also been implicated to signal through other pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 31Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether these signaling pathways are dependent on TGF-β receptor endocytosis.

Several lines of evidence suggest that replicative senescence is caused by short dysfunctional telomeres, which arise when DNA is replicated in the absence of adequate telomerase activity.

Replicative senescence was formally described more than four decades ago for cultures of normal human fibroblasts (1Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Since that time, many cell types from many animal species have been shown to undergo replicative senescence, both in culture and in vivo (reviewed in Refs. 2Stanulis-Praeger B. Mech. Aging Dev. 1987; 38: 1-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar and 3Campisi J. Dimri G.P. Hara E. Schneider E. Rowe J. Handbook of the Biology of Aging. Fourth Ed. Academic Press, New York1996: 121-149Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that, at least in mammalian cells, replicative senescence is an example of a more general process, termed cellular senescence. Cellular senescence arrests cell proliferation (used here interchangeably with growth) in response to insults that have the potential to cause neoplastic transformation. These and other findings suggest that cellular senescence is important for suppressing tumorigenesis in organisms with renewable tissues (4Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 5Campisi J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cellular senescence has also been proposed to cause or contribute to aging in selected mammalian tissues (4Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 6Campisi J. Cell. 1996; 84: 497-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 7Campisi J. In Vivo. 2000; 14: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular senescence entails an essentially irreversible arrest of cell growth. In replicative senescence, this growth arrest occurs as a consequence of cell division. The number of divisions that normal cells complete before they senesce depends on the cell type and the species, age, and genotype of the donor (2Stanulis-Praeger B. Mech. Aging Dev. 1987; 38: 1-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Campisi J. Dimri G.P. Hara E. Schneider E. Rowe J. Handbook of the Biology of Aging. Fourth Ed. Academic Press, New York1996: 121-149Google Scholar). This number can be large; for example, >80 population doublings (PD)1 for fetal or neonatal human fibroblast cultures. In the last decade, it has become clear that human cells sense the number of divisions they have completed through the telomeres, which shorten progressively with each cell cycle owing to the inability of DNA polymerases to replicate the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeres are the repetitive DNA sequence and associated proteins that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeres allow cells to distinguish chromosome ends from double-strand DNA breaks and are essential for chromosome stability (8Blackburn E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the DNA replication machinery cannot completely replicate termini, 50–200 bp of telomeric DNA are lost during each S phase. This loss can be prevented by telomerase, the enzyme that adds telomeric DNA to termini de novo. Most human cells do not express telomerase, and thus their telomeres shorten with each division (9Levy M.Z. Allsopp R.C. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Telomere shortening was first demonstrated in cultured human fibroblasts, which completely senesced with an average telomere length of 4–7 kb (reduced from 10–15 kb in the germ line) (10Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4665) Google Scholar). These findings led to the hypothesis that human cells undergo a senescence growth arrest when their telomeres reach a critically short length (11Chiu C.P. Harley C.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was strengthened by subsequent studies showing that ectopic expression of hTERT, the rate-limiting and catalytic subunit of telomerase, can prevent telomere erosion and replicative senescence (12Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar, 13Vaziri H.

First, telomere-associated proteins have been identified that regulate telomere length indirectly. Some of these proteins appear to alter the telomeric structure and hence the ability of telomerase to access the telomere (14Evans S.K. Lundblad V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 16Gasser S.

One such protein is TIN2. TIN2 negatively regulates telomere length in a telomerase-dependent fashion but does not act directly on the enzyme (18Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, telomerase expression alone may not be sufficient to prevent replicative senescence. Second, short telomeres may be more prone than long telomeres to structural dysfunction, and telomere function, rather than length, may control cellular senescence. Indeed, human fibroblasts that express ectopic telomerase can proliferate indefinitely with decidedly subsenescent telomere lengths (19Ouellette M.M. Liao M. Herbert B.S. Johnson M. Holt S.E. Liss H.S. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10072-10076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Likewise, in telomerase-deficient mice, the shortest telomeres appear to be responsible for the telomere dysfunction that compromises cellular and organismal survival (20Hemann M.T. Strong M.A. Hao L.Y. Greider C.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that telomerase can prevent cellular senescence by preferentially capping and acting on the shortest telomeres and that the senescence response is not induced by telomere length but, rather, by a dysfunctional telomere structure (21Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 22Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Third, both replicative and cellular senescence induce similar phenotypes, but cellular senescence can occur after very few doublings and in response to stimuli that likely act independently of telomeres (17Campisi J. Kim S. Lim C. Rubio M. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1619-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 23Morales C.P. Holt S.E. Ouellette M. Kaur K.J. Yan Y. Wilson K.S. White M.A. Wright W.E.

Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Some of these stimuli, however, may damage telomeres. For example, human fibroblasts cultured under hyperoxia senesce very rapidly but accumulate single-strand breaks at the telomeres (26von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Döcke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Conversely, telomeres may influence the sensitivity of cells and organisms to DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (IR). Thus, there was an inverse correlation between telomere length and chromosomal radiosensitivity in the lymphocytes of some breast cancer patients (27McIlrath J. Bouffler S.D. Samper E. Cuthbert A. Wojcik A. Szumiel I. Bryant P.E. Riches A.C. Thompson A. Blasco M.A. Newbold R.F. Slijepcevic P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 912-915PubMed Google Scholar), and short telomeres enhanced IR-induced lethality in telomerase-deficient mice (28Goytisolo F.A. Samper E. Martin-Caballero J. Finnon P. Herrera E. Flores J.M. Bouffler S.D. Blasco M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Wong K.K. Chang S. Weller S.R. Ganesau S. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Artandi S.E. Rudolph K.L. Gottlieb G.J. Chin L. Alt F.W. DePinho R.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition, cells from organisms with defects in telomere maintenance are frequently radiosensitive (30Metcalfe J.A. Parkhill J. Campbell L. Stacey M. Biggs P. Byrd P.J. Taylor A.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 31Hande P. Slijepcevic P. Silver A. Bouffler S. van Buul P. Bryant P. Lansdorp P. Genomics. 1999; 56: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Samper E. Goytisolo F.A. Slijepcevic P. van Buul P.P. Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, telomerase has been reported to protect some cells from the lethality that results from severe damage to telomeres (33Lu C. Fu W. Mattson M.P. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 131: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Ludwig A. Saretzki G. Holm P.S. Tiemann F. Lorenz M. Emrich T. Harley C.B. von Zglinicki T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3053-3061PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ren J.G. Xia H.L. Tian Y.M. Just T. Cai G.P. Dai Y.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The above findings cast doubt on the relevance of telomere lengthper se in signaling the replicative senescence of human cells. They also suggest that telomeres can act as sensors or transducers of DNA damage signals and that telomerase can repair or protect cells from telomeric damage. One caveat to these possibilities is that cell types may differ in their responses to telomere dysfunction and/or DNA damage. Moreover, given the significant differences in telomere biology between rodents and humans (36Weng N.P. Hodes R.J. J. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 20: 257-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), it may not be possible to extrapolate findings in rodent cells to human cells. To explore the relationships between telomere length, replicative senescence, and IR sensitivity, we created essentially isogenic human cell populations that have varying average telomere lengths. We started with normal human fibroblasts and used genetically defined manipulations. We show that telomere length does indeed influence replicative senescence but that human fibroblasts can senesce with telomeres that are significantly shorter or longer than expected. Our results support the idea that telomerase acts preferentially on short telomeres and that telomere structure, rather than length, causes replicative senescence. Finally, our results suggest that telomere length, but not telomerase, influences the response of human cells to IR. Normal human fibroblast strains 82-6 and BJ (HCA2) were obtained from J. Oshima (University of Washington, Seattle) and J. Smith (University of Texas, San Antonio), respectively. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum, as described previously (38Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar), until they reached 70–80% confluence, whereupon they were subcultured at 1–3 × 103/cm2. To determine the fraction of senescent cells, cells were plated at 103/cm2 and labeled with [3H]thymidine for 72 h; the percentage of labeled nuclei was determined by autoradiography and/or the cells were stained for the senescence-associated β-galactosidase, as described previously (38Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). The labeling index (LI) refers to the percentage of cells that incorporated [3H]thymidine during the 72-h labeling interval. Cultures were considered completely senescent when the LI reached <10%. Retroviral vectors pLXSN, pLXSH, and pLXSHD were from D. Miller (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA) (39Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 980-988PubMed Google Scholar), and pBABE-PURO was from H. Land (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) (40Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). pCI-NEO-hTERT was from R. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute, Boston, MA) (41Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), and pLOX and pACN were from K. Thomas (42Bunting M. Bernstein K.E. Greer J.M. Capecchi M.R. Thomas K.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). pL-TIN2 and pL-TIN2–13 have been described previously (18Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To create pLCRESH and pCMV-CRE, the 1.2-kb PstI-MluI fragment from pACN was subcloned in the HpaI site of pLXSH or PstI and EcoRV sites of pCMV-1. To create pBloxTSH, the 3.5-kbEcoRI-SalI fragment from pCI-NEO-HTERT was first cloned in the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBABE-PURO, to create pBABE-PURO-hTERT. We then cloned the 1.7-kbHpaI-HindIII l-histidinol resistance gene (HISD) from pLXSHD into the 8.2-kbSalI-HindIII fragment from pBABE-PURO-hTERT, creating pBTSH. The 5.2-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pBTSH was excised, blunt ends were created with Klenow, and the fragment was cloned between the loxP sites in pLOX. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI andHindIII, and the 5.2-kb fragment was subcloned into theEcoRI-HindIII sites in pBABE-PURO, creating pBloxTSH. Each cloning step was verified by sequencing across the ligation junctions. Fibroblasts were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infectious virus was produced by transient transfection, as described previously (43Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Proliferating cells (30–50% confluent) were infected for 6 h on two successive days, with a 16-h interval and medium change between infections. Forty-eight h after the second infection, the cells were selected with the appropriate antibiotics (Sigma Chemical Co.):l-histidinol (50 mm, 7–10 days, using a 2m stock solution in water, pH 7.0), hygromycin B (100 μg/ml, 5–7 days), puromycin (1 μg/ml, 3–5 days), or G418 (400 μg/ml, 5–7 days). Uninfected control cells did not survive these selection regimens. From the number of infected cells present after selection and the number of mock infected cells present without selection, we estimate that this protocol typically yielded 80–90% infected (antibiotic-resistant) cells. Genomic DNA was digested with HinfI and RsaI and analyzed by Southern blotting using a (TTAGGG)3 probe, as described (10Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4665) Google Scholar, 18Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences) and ImageQuaNT software. Mean TRF lengths were calculated as described previously (10Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4665) Google Scholar). Values reported are the average results of at least two independent Southern blots. Telomerase activity was determined by the telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), using a commercial kit (Intergen). Total RNA was isolated, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed as described (43Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The primers were: hTERT sense (2795–2816), 5′-CTG GGT GGC ACG GCT TTT GTT C-3′; hTERT antisense (3478–3499), 5′-GGG CTG CTG GTG TCT GCT CTC G-3′; pLXSHD antisense (1987–2008), 5′-ctc atg gtc cgg gat ctg cct c-3′. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. Fragments of 705 and 1021 bp were amplified from the endogenous and integrated retroviralhTERT genes, respectively. Infected cells were maintained as continually proliferating cultures and passaged for the indicated intervals. Cell number was determined by trypsinizing the monolayer and counting a dilution using an electronic particle counter (Coulter). The population doubling (PD) number was calculated as PD = log(N f/N 0)/log2, where N f is the final cell number andN 0 is the number of initially seeded cells. To determine IR sensitivity, proliferating cells were x-irradiated at the indicated doses using a Pantak x-ray generator operating at 320 kV/12 mA and allowed to recover for 4 h before trypsinization. The trypsinized cells (0.5–32 × 103) were replated in duplicate 100-mm dishes and left undisturbed for 13 days. The plates were then stained with crystal violet, and the number of colonies that were >1 mm in diameter were counted. We designed a retroviral-based system to allow conditional expression of telomerase and selection for cells that received or lost telomerase (Fig. 1). The system is based on the well-characterized ability of Cre recombinase to site-specifically excise DNA sequences that are flanked byloxP sites (44Sternberg N. Hamilton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The starting vector was pBABE-PURO (40Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), into which we introduced three modifications. First, we cloned into the multiple cloning site the cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) (41Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Second, we introduced a histidinol resistance gene (HISD) from pLXSHD (39Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 980-988PubMed Google Scholar) between the SV40 early promoter (SV40p) and puromycin resistance gene (PURO). This vector was designated pBTSH. Third, we introduced loxP sites upstream of the hTERT cDNA and between the HISD and PURO genes. This vector was designated pBloxTSH. Thus, pBTSH and pBloxTSH were identical except for the presence of loxP sites. We also used pLXSH (39Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 980-988PubMed Google Scholar) to create a retrovirus (pLCRESH) carrying Cre and the hygromycin resistance gene (HYGRO). We expected normal telomerase-negative cells infected with either pBTSH or pBloxTSH to acquire telomerase activity and histidinol resistance. After superinfection with pLCRESH, we expected pBloxTSH-infected cells to acquire hygromycin resistance but lose telomerase activity and histidinol sensitivity, owing to Cre-mediated excision of the hTERT and HISD genes. Simultaneously, these cells should acquire puromycin resistance because the excision brings the PURO gene under the control of the retroviral 5′ promoter (long terminal repeat). pBTSH-infected cells, by contrast, were predicted to acquire hygromycin resistance but no other changes after superinfection with pLCRESH (Fig. 1). We infected normal human fibroblasts with these retroviruses, using a protocol that produced 80–90% infected cells. Thus, the manipulations we describe were applied to mass cultures, obviating the need for single cell cloning. We infected early passage (PD 20, LI = 74%) normal human fibroblasts (strain 82-6) with pLXSHD, pBTSH, or pBloxTSH and assessed uninfected and infected populations for their ability to survive and proliferate in the presence of l-histidinol. As expected, uninfected cells were histidinol-sensitive, whereas the infected cells were histidinol-resistant (Table I). We also assessed these populations for telomerase activity, using a telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). After histidinol selection, cells infected with the hTERT-expressing viruses, either pBloxTSH or pBTSH, showed robust telomerase activity (Table I; see also Fig.3 A below). Uninfected cells, and cells infected with pLXSHD, remained telomerase-negative (Table I).Table IPhenotypes of infected human fibroblastsVirus 1Plasmid1-aCMV-based vectors. or virus 2HISD1-bS, sensitive; R, resistant.PUROHYGROTRAPSenescencePD1-cNumber of PD, after the last infection, at which senescence occurred.SSS−+20–25pLXSHDRSS−+20pBTSHRSS+−pBloxTSHRSS+−pBTSHpLXSHRSR+−pBTSHpLCRESHRSR+−pBloxTSHpLXSHRSR+−pBloxTSHpLCRESHSRR−+42pBloxTSHpCMV-1RSS+−pBloxTSHpCMV-CRESRS−+>301-dApproximation.

Open table in a new tab 82–6 human fibroblasts were either mock infected (−) or infected with the indicated retroviruses. Cells were assessed for sensitivity tol-histidinol (HISD), puromycin (PURO) and hygromycin (HYGRO), telomerase activity (TRAP), and population doubling (PD) level at replicative senescence, as described in Experimental Procedures. Uninfected 82-6 fibroblasts typically senesce after 40–45 PD. Cells infected with pLXSHD senesced ∼20 PD after infection (Fig.2 and Table I), consistent with their lack of telomerase activity. Because 82-6 cells were infected at PD 20, this result confirms that our infection protocol does not substantially alter the replicative life span of the cells (Table I) or the mean telomere length at senescence (see below). In contrast to the telomerase-negative cells (uninfected and pLXSHD-infected), cells infected with pBloxTSH or pBTSH had markedly extended replicative life spans, showing no signs of senescence many PD after infection (Fig. 2). To date, these cells have undergone >100 PD and appear to be replicatively immortal. We superinfected pBloxTSH- and pBTSH-infected cells with pLCRESH or pLXSH (control), both of which conferred hygromycin resistance, as expected (Table I). After selection in hygromycin, the cells were retested for histidinol sensitivity and telomerase and tested for puromycin sensitivity. As expected, pLXSH did not alter the histidinol or puromycin sensitivity, that is, pBloxTSH- and pBTSH-infected cells remained histidinol-resistant and puromycin-sensitive. In addition, pLCRESH did not alter the histidinol and puromycin response of pBTSH-infected cells. However, pLCRESH completely reversed the antibiotic response of pBloxTSH-infected cells, abolishing resistance to histidinol and conferring puromycin resistance (Table I). Moreover, only pBloxTSH + pLCRESH doubly infected cells lost telomerase activity (Table I and Fig. 3 A). This loss appeared to be complete, because lysates from these cells had no detectable TRAP activity, even when a 10-fold greater number of cells was assayed (Fig.3 A). Moreover, loss of telomerase activity resulted in progressive telomere shortening (see Fig. 4). Most important, pBloxTSH + pLCRESH doubly infected cells, but none of the other populations, underwent replicative senescence (Fig. 3 B). The cells senesced 42 PD after hygromycin selection (Table I). Thus, after expression and excision of hTERT, cells underwent an additional 20 PD before senescing. Consistent with this additional proliferative potential, the cells senesced with shorter telomeres, compared with those of senescent cells that never expressed hTERT (Fig. 4). Twenty-one PD after hTERT was excised from pBloxTSH cells by pLCRESH, seven cell clones were isolated. All the clones underwent senescence after an additional 15–18 PD (data not shown), consistent with the results obtained with the mass-infected population. These results indicate that all the retroviruses conferred the predicted phenotypes on cells. Moreover, they demonstrate that sequential infection with pBloxTSH and pLCRESH can efficiently and reversibly immortalize uncloned populations of normal human fibroblasts. We observed no deleterious effects owing to stable expression of Cre. However, Cre was reported to be mildly to moderately toxic in some cells (45Loonstra A. Vooijs M. Beverloo H.B.

We therefore constructed a CRE expression vector (pCMV-CRE) suitable for transient transfection and expression. We then transfected pBloxTSH-infected fibroblasts with control (pCMV-1) or expression (pCMV-CRE) vector DNA, using a protocol by which about 10% of the cells transiently take up and express the transfected DNA. Cultures that received the control vector did not survive puromycin selection, but numerous puromycin-resistant cells grew out of cultures that received pCMV-CRE (Table I). After transfection and puromycin selection, 103 cells were replated. In two experiments, these cultures of pooled puromycin-resis"

Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses can be envisaged concerning the timing and the location of Cdc2 phosphorylation on Thr-161 and the enzymes responsible on this process during oogenesis: 1) Newly synthesized cyclin B associates with Cdc2 in the cytoplasm. Then the neocomplex is translocated to the nucleus where it becomes a substrate of a CDK-activating kinase (CAK), composed of CDK7, cyclin H, and the assembly factor MAT1, a complex known to be strictly located within the Xenopus oocyte nucleus (7Labbe J.C. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Capony J.P. Darbon J.M. Derancourt J. Devault A. Morin N. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5155-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Fesquet D. Labbe J.C.

CAK exhibits a stronger affinity for cyclin-associated CDKs than for monomeric CDKs (9Kaldis P. Russo A.A. Chou H.S. Pavletich N.P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To prevent premature activation of Cdc2, the complex needs to be inactivated by phosphorylations on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 of Cdc2 by the ER membrane-associated Myt1 kinase (3Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), to accumulate as pre-MPF in the cytoplasm. 2) Cyclin-free Cdc2 is a substrate of another cytoplasmic CAK. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the only known CAK is a cytoplasmic monomeric enzyme called Cak1 or Civ1 (10Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J.

Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast to the CDK7·cyclin H complex, it preferentially phosphorylates monomeric CDKs rather than cyclin-associated CDKs (9Kaldis P. Russo A.A. Chou H.S. Pavletich N.P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, a “monomeric CAK” activity has been also detected in human cells (13Nagahara H. Ezhevsky S.A. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14961-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,14Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4213-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). If such an enzyme is expressed, then monomeric Cdc2 would be phosphorylated on Thr-161 in the cytoplasm prior its association with newly synthesized cyclin B, and, in the case of the growing oocyte, prior to its inactivation by the membrane-associated Myt1 kinase, leading to pre-MPF formation.During progesterone-induced meiotic maturation, the abrupt activation of pre-MPF into MPF occurs through an autoamplification process whereby the protein phosphatase Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphates on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 of Cdc2 (6Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A two-step mechanism, involving proteins such as protein phosphatase 2A and Plx1 kinase, allows active Cdc2 to positively regulate Cdc25 (15Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar). A major unanswered question is how the feedback loop between Cdc25 and Cdc2 is initiated. One possibility could be that an unstable or a neosynthetized “Cdc25-like” phosphatase, such as Cdc25B, is activated before Cdc25C and serves as a threshold for the Cdc2-Cdc25C autoamplification loop. Until now, no experimental evidence supports this hypothesis in theXenopus oocytes undergoing meiotic division. Another possibility is that, upon progesterone stimulation, a newly synthesized cyclin, or another Cdc2 partner, would associate with free Cdc2; the neoformed complex would then escape inactivating phosphorylations by Myt1 kinase and would serve as a threshold to initiate MPF autoamplification (15Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nebreda A. Gannon J. Hunt T.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this context, the presence of monomeric Cdc2 already phosphorylated on Thr-161 would favor the formation of this small starter amount of active MPF.The phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Thr-161 represents a potential key regulation step at two essential periods of the oocyte development; first, during late oogenesis when pre-MPF accumulates in prophase-arrested oocyte, and second, at the time preceding GVBD, when pre-MPF is activated. A major insight is to identify the enzymes, kinase and phosphatase, that control this critical event.In a first approach to understand how the Thr-161 phosphorylation of Cdc2 is regulated, we decided to undertake a biochemical purification of cyclin B-free Cdc2 and analyzed its Thr-161 phosphorylation level. The major observation of this study indicates that fully grown resting oocyte contains a significant amount of monomeric Cdc2 phosphorylated on Thr-161, whose phosphorylation level is negatively regulated by a Mg2+-dependent phosphatase, PP2C.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsXenopus laevis adult females (CNRS, Rennes, France) were bred and maintained under laboratory conditions. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEG502Z) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Reagents, unless otherwise specified, were from Sigma Chemical Co.Xenopus Oocyte ExtractsFully grown Xenopus prophase oocytes were obtained as described previously (18Jessus C. Thibier C. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 705-712PubMed Google Scholar). For extract preparations, oocytes were lysed in 4 volumes of EB (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.3) or modified EB (80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.3) supplemented with 10 mm ATP, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatants were recovered and termed “cytosolic extracts” or “S100.” Proteins of cytosolic extracts were precipitated by salting out using ammonium sulfate, successively 40 and 60%, as described in a previous study (15Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate pellets, respectively, P40 and P60, were stored at −80 °C for further analysis.Gel FiltrationP40 and P60 precipitates from 200 oocytes were resuspended in 160 μl of column buffer (EB or modified EB, adjusted to 0.1m NaCl) and then chromatographed on a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 ml/min. Ten fractions of 1 ml were collected and subject to Western blot and kinase and phosphatase assays.ImmunoblottingProteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE (Amresco) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). Anti-Xenopus cyclin B2 and cyclin B1 antibodies were obtained from goats immunized with inclusion bodies containing bacterially expressed Xenopus cyclins B2 and B1 and affinity-purified. The monoclonal mouse anti-Xenopus Cdc2 antibodies (mixture of A17 and 3E1) were initially described in a previous study (19Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R.Y.C. Hunt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29153-29160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-MO15 and anti-Cak1 polyclonal rabbit antibodies were described previously (Refs. 8Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Derancourt J. Capony J.P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T. Shuttleworth J. Doree M. Cavadore J.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3111-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and 10Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, respectively). Polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr-15) and anti-phospho-Cdc2 (Thr-161) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and polyclonal rabbit anti-PSTAIR antibody and polyclonal sheep anti-human PP2Cα were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The primary antibodies were detected with appropriated horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories) and the Western blot Chemiluminescence Renaissance kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Cdc2 Activation and Cdk2 PhosphorylationRecombinant GST-Cdc2GSH-Sepharose beads bound to purified and refolded GST-Cdc2 were washed in kinase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, 15 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA) and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer in the presence of 100 μmATP and various effectors: Cak1 (0.06 μg/μl), GST-cyclin A (0.1–0.2 μg/μl) or His-cyclin B1 (0.1 μg/μl). For histone H1 kinase assay, 0.2 mg/ml histone H1 (Roche Diagnostics) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added for a further 15 or 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and by boiling for 3 min.Endogenous Monomeric Cdc2Ammonium sulfate was removed from P40 and P60 by ultrafiltration with an Ultrafree Biomax system (Millipore). The amount of proteins recovered in each fraction was evaluated by Bradford analysis (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar). One oocyte corresponds to 24, 8, 12, and 1.2 μg of proteins, respectively, in S100, P40, P60, and F9. Activation of endogenous Cdc2 present in P60 or F9 was performed under the same conditions as for recombinant Cdc2, by adding Cak1 (0.06 μg/μl), GST-cyclin A (0.2 μg/μl), or His-cyclin B1 (0.1 μg/μl). In some experiments, GST·cyclin A·Cdc2 complexes were recovered by GST-cyclin A binding for 4 h at 4 °C on GSH-agarose beads. After several washes in EB (modified or not) or in kinase buffer, the bead pellets were, respectively, submitted to Western blot analysis or histone H1 kinase assay.Recombinant GST-Cdk2Phosphorylation of GST-Cdk2 was performed by incubating the protein (0.1 μg/μl) for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of Cak1 (0.06 μg/μl) in kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. GST-Cdk2 was then ultrafiltrated on a Microcon system (Millipore) to eliminate free [γ-32P]ATP or purified on GSH-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. In some experiments, incubation was performed in the presence of various concentrations of P60 and F9. After GST pull-down, pellets were washed, resuspended in sample buffer, and heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity incorporated in GST-Cdk2 was revealed by autoradiography and counted after excision from the gel in a Wallac counter.Phosphatase AssaySubstrate Preparation for PP2C Isolation AssayCasein (Sigma C4765, 5 mg) was phosphorylated by 250 milliunits of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma P2645) for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 100 μm ATP and 250 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. GST-Cdk2 (1 mg) was phosphorylated by Cak1 (15 μg) for 16 h at 30 °C in the presence of 200 μm ATP and 500 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, and 2 mm pyrophosphate. Proteins were then precipitated twice at 0 °C with an equal volume of 90% saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Free nucleotides were removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences).Phosphatase Reaction32P-Phosphorylated GST-Cdk2 or 32P-phosphorylated casein was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of either F9 (1 μg of proteins), recombinant Xenopus PP2C, or fractions from the purification procedure in the presence of bovine serum albumin (5 μg) and various amounts of Mg2+ and OA. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 volumes of 20% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged for 5 min, and the released 32P label was counted.Xenopus PP2C PurificationPhosphatase activity was determined using casein phosphorylated by PKA and Cdk2 phosphorylated by Cak1 as substrates. The selected fractions contain a phosphatase activity toward both substrates that is dependent on Mg2+ and insensitive to 1 μmokadaic acid. The entire purification procedure was carried out at 4 °C. Ovaries from 30 females were homogenized in 3 volumes of the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (Pentapharm), 1 mm benzamidine. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through glass wool and centrifuged again at 21,000 × g for 3 h, leading to a cytosolic extract. P40 and P60 were then prepared (15Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar). 30–40% of PP2C was recovered in the P40 while 60–70% was recovered in P60, as estimated by Western blot signal. The P60 fraction was resuspended in 1 liter of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and mixed with 500 ml of DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow resin equilibrated in buffer A. Fractions were eluted by steps in buffer A containing increasing NaCl concentrations (100 mm, 250 mm, 500 mm, 750 mm, and 1 m). The active fraction, eluted in 500 mm NaCl, was concentrated on Centricon Plus-80 (Amicon) and loaded on a Sephacryl S200 column equilibrated in buffer A plus 150 mm NaCl. The active fraction was desalted on Centricon Plus-80 and then loaded on a UnoQ column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. PP2C activity was eluted around 500 mm NaCl. NaCl was increased up to 3 m in the active fraction, which was then loaded on a phenyl-Superose HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A plus 3 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 3 to 0 m NaCl in buffer A, and the phosphatase activity was recovered at around 750 mm NaCl. The active fraction was desalted on Centricon Plus-80 with buffer A, then supplemented with 25 mm MgCl2 and loaded on a 5-ml Hi-Trap Blue column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A plus 25 mm MgCl2. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 0 mm MgCl2 in buffer A, and the active fraction was recovered at 13 mmMgCl2. After concentration by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% polyethylene glycol 40,000, the active fraction was stored at −80 °C.Xenopus PP2Cα CloningBased on the sequences dd98g09.x1 (December 2000) and dc59g09.y1 (September 2000) of two X. laevis expressed sequence tag cDNA clones (IMAGE (National Institutes of Health): 3436624 and 3401440) homologous to the human protein phosphatase 2Cα, two oligoprimers containing BglII sites (underlined) were designed: 5′-GAA GAT CTC ATG GGA GCA TTT TTA GAT AAG CC-3′ (corresponding to the amino-terminal part of the protein and used as upstream primer), and 5′-GAA GAT CTC TTA CCA CAT ATC ATC TGT TGA TGC-3′ (corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein and used as downstream primer). PCR was performed with a mix (50/50) of Pfu DNA polymerase and Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, #M7741 and #M2661) using a cDNA library fromX. laevis oocytes (λ ZAP Express phages, kind gift of Dr. J. Maller). The amplified PCR product was subcloned in the pGEM-T easy vector, and the cDNA sequences were determined on automated DNA Sequencer ALF-express (Amersham Biosciences) with a Thermo Sequenase CY5 Dye Terminator kit (Amersham Pharmacia) using T3- and T7-CY5 primers. The entire encoding nucleotide sequence has been deposited at the EMBL nucleotide sequence data base under the accession numberAJ438209.Preparation of Recombinant ProteinsGST- and His-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described in a previous study (19Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R.Y.C. Hunt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29153-29160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the following plasmids: human GST-cyclin A (kind gift of Dr. C. Bréchot, INSERM, France), Xenopus GST-Cdk2, Xenopus wild type GST-Cdc2, and Xenopus Thr-161 → Ala mutant GST-Cdc2 (kind gifts of Dr. T. Hunt, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, UK).S. cerevisiae His-Cak1 protein and human His-cyclin B1 protein were kindly provided by Dr. C. Mann (Commissariată l'Energie Aromique, Saclay, France) and Dr. B. Ducommun (CNRS, Toulouse, France), respectively.Bacterially produced Xenopus GST-Cdc2 is inactive and requires a refolding step (19Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R.Y.C. Hunt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29153-29160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This was performed by incubating 1 μg of wild type or Thr-161 → Ala mutant GST-Cdc2 in 2.5 μl of prophase oocyte extracts, prepared as described previously (23Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), for 30 min at room temperature. After refolding, GST-Cdc2 was isolated using GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences).Xenopus PP2Cα cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pThioHisB (Invitrogen). Expression of recombinant ThioHis-PP2C was induced with 0.5 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. The bacterial pellet was lysed in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, N-octylglucoside (0.5% v/v), 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340) and centrifuged (10 min, 14,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was chromatographed on a nickel column (Probond, Invitrogen), and the imidazole eluate was chromatographed on a phenyl arsine oxide-agarose column (Thiobond, Invitrogen). Step-elution was performed with β-mercaptoethanol from 50 mm to 1 m. Fractions of interest were dialyzed and concentrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and stored at −80 °C before use.DISCUSSIONMPF or Cdc2 protein kinase drives Xenopus oocyte meiotic maturation. It is regulated by the availability of cyclin subunits and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. The activating phosphorylation on Thr-161 within the T-loop is required for kinase activity (5Norbury C. Blow J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and should be regulated at different critical phases of oogenesis: first, during pre-MPF accumulation occurring during the last period of oocyte growth; second at the entry into metaphase I (or GVBD) when MPF is first activated; and third, during the metaphase I-metaphase II transition when cyclin turnover occurs. Does the addition of a phosphate to Thr-161 of Cdc2 precede or follow cyclin binding at each of these steps? Our results show that a significant fraction of monomeric Cdc2 partially purified in a Mg2+-free buffer from prophase resting oocytes is directly activable in vitro by cyclin addition. This result indirectly suggests that Thr-161-phosphorylated free Cdc2 is present in the oocyte. We directly evidenced the presence of this phosphorylated form of Cdc2 by using an antibody specifically directed against Thr-161-phosphorylated Cdc2. This antibody is able to recognize monomeric Cdc2, only when prepared in the absence of Mg2+. To ascertain the specificity of the antibody, recombinantXenopus Cdk2 or partially purified Xenopusmonomeric Cdc2 (F9) were phosphorylated in vitro on Thr-160 or Thr-161, respectively, by recombinant Cak1. Western blots illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 clearly demonstrate the high detection specificity of the phosphorylated activating Thr of the T-loop of Cdk2 and Cdc2 by this antibody. Therefore, through two distinct experimental approaches, it is possible to conclude that monomeric Thr-161-phosphorylated Cdc2 is present in the oocyte where it represents a latent form of Cdc2 directly activable by cyclin binding. Consequently, one might postulate that Xenopus oocyte contains the enzymes that control the addition and removal of phosphate on residue Thr-161 of monomeric Cdc2. Mg2+ chelation in purification buffers is required for the immunodetection of phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2, which appears to be directly activable by cyclin binding. This prompted us to search for the presence of a Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatase specific of Thr-161-phosphorylated Cdc2 in the Xenopus oocyte. A partial purification led to the isolation of a 45-kDa Mg2+-dependent phosphatase, which is recognized by an antibody raised against human PP2Cα and exhibits the enzymatic properties of PP2C. This purified enzyme was able to dephosphorylate recombinant Thr-160-phosphorylated Cdk2 as well as Thr-161-phosphorylated Xenopus Cdc2. After bacterial expression, the recombinant Xenopus PP2Cα similarly possesses a Mg2+-dependent phosphatase activity able to dephosphorylate the Thr-161 residue of monomeric Cdc2. When cyclins are added to prephosphorylated Cdc2, PP2C is not able to dephosphorylate Thr-161 anymore, indicating that cyclin·Cdc2 complex is not a PP2C substrate.In a previous study, Poon and Hunter (30Poon R.Y. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported that an EDTA-treated extract prepared from Xenopus eggs contains a “KAP”-like activity that dephosphorylates monomeric Thr-160-phosphorylated recombinant Cdk2. This phosphatase activity present in egg extracts has not been further characterized. Under our experimental conditions, no KAP-like phosphatase could be found in extracts from prophase oocytes prepared in the presence of EDTA. An intriguing possibility, which remains to be experimentally explored, could be that a KAP-like phosphatase activity, absent or inactive in prophase oocyte, is neosynthetized or unmasked during meiotic maturation.The copurification of a PP2C-like phosphatase with monomeric Cdc2 explains why Thr-161-phosphorylated Cdc2 had not been previously identified in Xenopus oocytes. Indeed, the standard EB buffer used to isolate pre-MPF or MPF contains a high Mg2+concentration (15 mm) (24Wu M. Gerhart J.C. Dev. Biol. 1980; 79: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), allowing full activity of Mg2+-dependent phosphatases and leading consequently to dephosphorylation of Cdc2.Solomon and co-workers (31Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) identified genetically and biochemically Ptc2p and Ptc3p in S. cerevisiae as the two major type 2C phosphatases that dephosphorylate monomeric CDC28. Therefore, PP2C physically opposes the biological functions of monomeric Cak1 in budding yeast. Human HeLa cells also contain two PP2C isoforms, PP2Cα and β2, that dephosphorylate monomeric human Cdk2/Cdk6 in vitro (32Cheng A. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34744-34749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These new observations raise, by analogy, the possibility that phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2 isolated fromXenopus oocyte could also be regulated by a monomeric CAK and PP2C. Whereas our results establish that a phosphatase 2C catalyzes the removal of phosphate on Thr-161/Thr-160 of Cdc2/Cdk2, it is at present uncertain whether the Xenopus oocyte contains an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of Thr-161 in monomeric Cdc2. Identification of monomeric Cdc2 phosphorylated on Thr-161 together with the low affinity of CDK7·cyclin H enzyme for monomeric CDKs (9Kaldis P. Russo A.A. Chou H.S. Pavletich N.P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) favors the view that such an enzyme would be present and functional in the oocyte. A difficulty encountered for the purification of this putative kinase is to inhibit or to remove the Mg2+-dependent phosphatase activity that opposes to this kinase activity.Our results show for the first time that monomeric Thr-161-phosphorylated Cdc2 can be isolated from Xenopusextracts and that it is a substrate of an endogenous PP2C. A specific regulation, implying the Thr-161 kinase and/or PP2C, allows the presence of two monomeric Cdc2 subpopulations in the oocyte, one being phosphorylated on Thr-161 and directly activable by cyclin binding while the other one is not. These results have important physiological implications. Of particular interest is the possible role of phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2 in the initiation of the MPF autoamplification loop. A small increase in cyclin B availability might be sufficient to bind with and to activate Cdc2 already phosphorylated on Thr-161 and then to generate a threshold Cdc2 kinase activity able to trigger MPF autoamplification. A recent study, using an antisense strategy, reported that the synthesis of cyclins B1, B2, B4, and B5 is not required in ovo for the initiation of MPF amplification during oocyte maturation (2Hochegger H. Klotzbucher A. Kirk J. Howell M. le Guellec K. Fletcher K. Duncan T. Sohail M. Hunt T. Development. 2001; 128: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded, however, that beyond cyclins B, another cyclin or an unknown partner of Thr-161-phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2 could be involved in the switching on of its kinase activity. A major objective will be to determine the levels of Thr-161-phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2 and to study how the phosphatase 2C and its opposed kinase are subject to regulation during the whole meiotic maturation process. The fully grown Xenopus oocyte is phys"
https://openalex.org/W2004510362,"Guanylate kinase (GMPK) is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to GMP to yield ADP and GDP. In addition to phosphorylating GMP, antiviral prodrugs such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and carbovir and anticancer prodrugs such as the thiopurines are dependent on GMPK for their activation. Hence, structural information on mammalian GMPK could play a role in the design of improved antiviral and antineoplastic agents. Here we present the structure of the mouse enzyme in an abortive complex with the nucleotides ADP and GMP, refined at 2.1 Å resolution with a final crystallographic R factor of 0.19 (Rfree = 0.23). Guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the CORE, LID, and NMP-binding regions. Previous studies on the yeast enzyme have shown that these parts move as rigid bodies upon substrate binding. It has been proposed that consecutive binding of substrates leads to “closing” of the active site bringing the NMP-binding and LID regions closer to each other and to the CORE region. Our structure, which is the first of any guanylate kinase with both substrates bound, supports this hypothesis. It also reveals the binding site of ATP and implicates arginines 44, 137, and 148 (in addition to the invariant P-loop lysine) as candidates for catalyzing the chemical step of the phosphoryl transfer. Guanylate kinase (GMPK) is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer from ATP to GMP to yield ADP and GDP. In addition to phosphorylating GMP, antiviral prodrugs such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, and carbovir and anticancer prodrugs such as the thiopurines are dependent on GMPK for their activation. Hence, structural information on mammalian GMPK could play a role in the design of improved antiviral and antineoplastic agents.

GMPK also plays an important role in the recycling of the second messenger cGMP (3Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to these physiological roles, GMPK is essential for the activation of prodrugs used for the treatment of cancers and viral infections (4Boehme R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12346-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Miller W.H. Daluge S.M. Garvey E.P. Hopkins S. Reardon J.E. Boyd F.L. Miller R.L. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is medically important to elucidate its enzymatic mechanism and the structural basis for its nucleotide specificity. Our current structural understanding of this enzyme is derived from the apo- and GMP-bound structures of the yeast GMPK (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and from analogy to other nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases (7Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the induced fit mechanism (8Koshland D.E.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 2375-2378Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar) plays an important role in NMP kinases, of which adenylate kinase is the best characterized (9Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Gerstein M. Schulz G. Chothia C. J. Mol.

NMP kinases catalyze phosphoryl transfer by binding both donor and acceptor nucleotides to form a ternary complex. Comparison of the crystal structures of nucleotide-free adenylate kinase to the one in which a single substrate is bound (AMP or ATP) and to the complex in which both substrates are present revealed the conformational changes that occur along the reaction coordinate: from an open unbound enzyme via a partially closed intermediate in which a single substrate is present to the fully closed form in the presence of both substrates. These substrate-induced conformational changes can be described as resulting from rigid body movements of three regions relative to each other: a CORE region, a LID region, and an NMP-binding region. Prior to this work, a structure of GMPK in which both substrate-binding sites are occupied was not available. Because of low sequence identity among the various NMP kinases and because of known structural differences between them (e.g. the NMP-binding domain of adenylate kinase (9Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) is all helical, whereas that of yeast GMPK consists of a four-stranded β-sheet and two short helices (12Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)), it is difficult to interpolate with high precision from a structure of one NMP kinase to a related one. Therefore, we set out to elucidate the crystal structure of the fully closed conformation of guanylate kinase. In addition, because the medically most relevant GMPK would be the human enzyme, we commenced our work with this enzyme. Contrary to published reports that found the human GMPK to be inactive when expressed in Escherichia coli (13Brady W.A. Kokoris M.S. Fitzgibbon M. Black M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16734-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we were successful in obtaining large quantities of active human GMPK (14Prinz H. Lavie A. Scheidig A.J. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35337-35342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, crystals grown with the human enzyme were not suitable for x-ray diffraction experiments. However, we were successful in obtaining crystals of the mouse GMPK in complex with GMP and ADP (mGMPKGMP-ADP). Here we report this structure with an emphasis on the conformational changes of the enzyme that occur because of the presence of nucleotides in both substrate-binding sites. The very high sequence similarity between the mGMPK and human GMPK (88% identity, 93% homology) assures that the information we have gained on the mouse enzyme is directly transferable to the human enzyme. The mGMPK coding region (13Brady W.A. Kokoris M.S. Fitzgibbon M. Black M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16734-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was cloned in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-RB (15Brundiers R. Lavie A. Veit T. Reinstein J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35289-35292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as a glutathione S-transferase-GMPK fusion protein. Expression was induced by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were grown ∼14 h after induction at 32 °C. A purification protocol was developed that included a glutathione-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Corp.), cleavage of the fusion protein with thrombin on the column, passage of the cleaved protein via a benzamidine column (to bind the thrombin), and a gel filtration column (S75; Pharmacia Corp.). The total yield of 400 mg of protein from 6 liters of culture was obtained. Prior to crystallization mGMPK was dialyzed against 25 mmKCl, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmdithiothreitol. Dynamic light scattering experiments indicated the existence of a single ∼20-kDa species in solution, which is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of ∼22 kDa. This result is in agreement with the gel filtration profile. The crystals were grown at room temperature using hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution. The protein solution contained 10 mg/ml of mGMPK, 2 mm GMP, 2 mmADP, and 5 mm MgCl2, whereas the reservoir contained 38–46% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 msodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 0.1–0.2 m ammonium acetate. Tetragonal crystals appeared within 4–6 days and exceeded the size of 240 × 200 × 200 μm. 100% mineral oil (light white; Sigma M3516) was used as cryoprotectant. Attempts to obtain crystals in which AppNHp replaces ADP were not successful. The data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku RAXIS IIc detector, by using focused copper Kα radiation from a Rigaku RU-H2R rotating anode x-ray generator at a power of 50 kV, 100 mA. The crystal diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution, and the data were processed with XDS (16Kabash W. Acta Crystallogr. Scet. A. 1976; 32: 922Crossref Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). The model used for molecular replacement was the 1.9 Å structure of yGMPK crystallized with GMP (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Refinement was done in CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) for x-ray data collected within resolution range of 30–2.1 Å. The final crystallographic R and Rfree are 0.19 and 0.23, respectively. Mouse guanylate kinase crystallized in space group P41212 (a = 67.2 Å, c = 108.7 Å) with one molecule/asymmetric unit. The data to a 2.1 Å resolution were collected at cryogenic temperature. The final structure consists of a single polypeptide chain (amino acids 5–194 of 198 were modeled; weak or no density was observed for both termini), 197 water molecules, the nucleotides GMP and ADP, and a potassium ion. The crystallographic R factor is 0.19 for reflections within the resolution range of 20–2.1 Å. All main chain dihedral angles are found in favorable and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (18Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The overall fold of the mouse guanylate kinase is very similar to that of the yeast enzyme (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consisting of 198 amino acid residues, mGMPK is 11 residues longer than yGMPK; two of these amino acids are located at the N terminus, and nine are located at the C-terminal part of the protein. mGMPK is built from a total of eight α-helices and two β-sheets that form three structurally and functionally distinct parts. These are the CORE region (residues 5–31, 97–123, and 165–194; helices α1, α4, α7, and α8; strands β1, β7, β8, and β9), the NMP-binding region (residues 37–89; helices α2 and α3; strands β3, β4, β5, and β6), and the LID region (residues 126–156; helices α5 and α6) (Fig. 1). These parts are interconnected with four hinges. The division of mGMPK to encompass these three regions is based on the analysis of three GMPK complex structures: apo-enzyme or enzyme with one or two nucleotides bound. Although the relative conformations of the regions (CORE, LID, and NMP-binding regions) are different between the three structures, comparison of the same region among the three structures reveals low RMSD (Fig. 2). Our nomenclature differs from that previously established in two aspects. First, we define a bigger LID region that includes residues 126–156 (previously defined only as seven residues) (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Second, we define hinges based on higher RMSDs of residues in the interface between regions and not on B factors as previously done. We believe that this RMSD-based classification represents a less biased approach than a one based solely on B factor analysis, avoiding the requirement for a hinge to be mobile in a static crystal structure. In our structure, there are two hinges between each pair of contacting domains. The NMP-binding and CORE regions are connected through hinge 1 (residues 32–36) and hinge 2 (residues 90–96; part of helix 3), whereas the CORE and LID regions are linked by hinge 3 (residues 124–125) and hinge 4 (residues 157–164; part of helix 6). Of the nine additional C-terminal residues found in mGMPK in comparison with yGMPK, five residues had traceable electron density and were modeled as helix α8. The functions of the additional C-terminal residues found in mammalian (13Brady W.A. Kokoris M.S. Fitzgibbon M. Black M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16734-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), bacterial (19Gentry D. Bengra C. Ikehara K. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14316-14321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plant (20Kumar V. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) GMPKs are not clear. The structure presented here is the first of a guanylate kinase in which both nucleotide-binding sites are occupied. The mGMPK in complex with GMP and ADP is in a closed conformation, which allows us, by comparing it with previously reported open (yGMPKapo) and partially closed (yGMPKGMP) structures of yGMPK (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), to delineate the effect of each nucleotide on the conformation of the enzyme (Fig.3). Nucleotide-induced movements in NMP kinases affect the relative orientation of rigid regions while maintaining to a large extent the overall fold of each individual region. If one uses the hand as an analogy to NMP kinase structure, the CORE region would be the palm of the hand, the LID region would be the thumb, and the NMP-binding region would be the fingers. Analogously to fingers and thumb that close over the palm of the hand to make a fist, in the presence of nucleotides the LID and NMP-binding regions move toward each other by means of “hinges” that connect the two regions to the CORE region. The high folding similarities of these relatively rigid regions, the CORE, NMP-binding, and LID regions, between the mGMPK and yGMPK make it possible to overlay regions between the two species. Superposition of all three models (yGMPKapo, yGMPKGMP, and mGMPKGMP-ADP) based only on the CORE region clearly shows a closing of individual regions with successive binding of nucleotides. The nucleotide-free yGMPK structure is characterized by the farthest distance between the LID and NMP-binding regions, which we name the open conformation of the kinase. This conformation appears highly flexible, consistent with the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric units of the yGMPKapo structure that differ slightly in the relative conformations of the LID and NMP-binding regions (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This higher mobility of the nucleotide-free enzyme is also manifested by a structure having higher average main chain B factors (Fig. 4). The enzyme with only GMP bound, as compared with the apo-GMPK structure, is characterized by a significant movement of the NMP-binding region toward the LID region, with a concomitant smaller move of the LID region in the same direction (i.e. not toward the NMP-binding region). However, the overall effect of GMP binding is to bring these two regions closer to each other and form the partially closed enzyme conformation. A detailed analysis of the change in conformation from the apo-bound to the GMP-bound enzyme has been presented recently (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the presence of nucleotides at both binding sites, both the LID and NMP-binding regions are pulled closer to each other and to the CORE region, yielding an even more compact conformation. This closed conformation is also characterized by a lower overall B factor in comparison with the apo- and GMP-bound structures, with a significant reduction of apparent mobility of the LID region (Fig. 4). The increased rigidity of the ternary complex structure can be accounted for by the newly formed interactions between residues of the LID region and the nucleotides (Fig. 5), as well as a direct interaction between the LID and NMP-binding regions (salt bridge between Glu140 and Arg44). The major interactions involved in the binding of GMP in our mGMPKGMP-ADP ternary complex are similar to those previously reported for the yGMPKGMPstructure (Fig. 5, b and d). Specificity between AMP and GMP is accomplished by discriminating base interactions: Ser37 that interacts with the guanine carbonyl at position 6 (an amino group in adenine), and by carboxylic acids Glu72 and Asp103 that interact with the guanine amino group at position 3 (not present in adenine). Notably, Glu72 makes a bidentate interaction with two hydrogen bond donors; N1, which is protonated in guanine (but unprotonated in adenine), and the amine group at position 2 of the base. In adenylate kinase (21Berry M.B. Meador B. Bilderback T. Liang P. Glaser M. Phillips G.N., Jr. Proteins. 1994; 19: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Abele U. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), specificity for adenine is obtained because of the presence of a glutamine in the analogous position of the glutamic acid in guanylate kinase, also via a bidentate interaction with N1 (this time an hydrogen bond acceptor) and the amine group at position 6. Our structure supplies an explanation for the rather limited success in changing the substrate specificity of mGMPK to accept AMP as a substrate by replacing the glutamic acid with a glutamine (23Stolworthy T.S. Black M.E. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). A strong peak in the electron density map close to atom N7 of the guanine base was modeled as a potassium ion (modeling of this density with a smaller atom resulted in a very low B factor; note that KCl was present in the crystallization buffer). Additionally, the distances between this six-coordinated metal to its ligand are in agreement with the expected values for potassium (24Cotton F.A. Wilkinson G. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. 5th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1386-1388Google Scholar). The importance of this interaction for GMP binding is not clear and was not observed in the yGMPKGMP structure. For the yeast GMPK it has been reported that dGMP is a poor substrate in comparison with GMP, with a ∼4-fold higher Kmand a ∼8-fold reduced kcat (25Li Y. Zhang Y. Yan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28038-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The residue responsible for this difference is Asp101 (conserved between mouse and yeast), which interacts with the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose of GMP. Similarly to the yGMPKGMP structure, in the mGMPKGMP-ADP structure we observed tyrosines 53 and 81 and arginines 41 and 44 to interact with the phosphate group of GMP. However, the interaction of these arginines with GMP is strengthened in the mGMPKGMP-ADP structure in comparison with the yGMPKGMP structure. For example, Arg44, which corresponds to Arg41 in the yeast structure and which makes only a weak hydrogen bond in that structure (3.4 Å), makes a stronger (2.6 Å) interaction with phosphate of GMP in mGMPKGMP-ADP. Not present in the yGMPKGMP complex structure is the interaction between the LID arginine (Arg148) and the phosphate group of GMP that we observed in the mGMPK ternary complex. Formation of the latter arginine-GMP interaction and strengthening of the former is made possible by the conformational changes induced by the binding of both substrates that bring the LID and NMP-binding regions closer to each other. These facts, as well as a position that potentially enables these arginine side chains to interact with both substrates concomitantly (i.e. the GMP phosphate and the γ-phosphate of ATP), make these two residues potential candidates for taking part in catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer. Our mGMPKGMP-ADP structure represents the enzyme in an abortive complex in which a substrate (GMP) and a product (ADP) are bound. Inhibition of GMPK activity by GMP has been attributed to the formation of this complex, which slows down but does not arrest the release of ADP (25Li Y. Zhang Y. Yan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28038-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of ADP provides us with important information on the conformation of the enzyme in the presence of two nucleotides and on the interactions made with the phosphoryl donor. The binding site of ADP/ATP is located between the LID and CORE regions (Fig. 5e). The adenine base is held in position through the strictly conserved Arg133 (a stacking interaction), the side chain of Asn171, and the main chain carbonyl of Asp172 (Fig. 5, a and b). As was previously observed in other NMP kinase structures, the ATP/ADP-ribose does not directly interact with any protein atom but rather is stabilized by several water molecules. Phosphate group binding is through the P-loop, a sequence highly conserved among ATP-binding proteins (26Dreusicke D. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The main chain atoms of this motif, localized in the loop between strand β1 and helix α1, provide hydrogen-bonding interactions with the β-phosphate. Additionally, the β-phosphate interacts with the side chains of Ser18 and Lys17 (both from the P-loop) and Arg137 (from the LID region). The latter basic amino acids could potentially also interact with a γ-phosphate and in this way play a role in catalyzing the chemical step of phosphoryl transfer. The α-phosphate is within hydrogen bond distances from the side chains of Thr19 and Arg137 (Arg137 also interacts with the β-phosphate). The ability of guanylate kinase to catalyze the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to GMP to yield GDP is important both physiologically and medicinally. Physiologically, through being a component of the metabolic pathway of GTP and dGTP formation, GMPK plays a vital role in DNA and RNA synthesis (2Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25652-25655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the recycling of the second messenger cGMP and the overall concentrations of GTP, which is involved in the regulation of numerous pathways, is dependent on GMPK activity (3Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The medicinal importance of GMPK is in the activation pathway of guanosine analog prodrugs. Examples are mercaptopurine and thioguanine, which are used for the treatment of various types of cancers; acyclovir and ganciclovir, which are used for the treatment of herpes infections and in cancer suicide gene therapy; and carbovir, which are used against HIV (4Boehme R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12346-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Miller W.H. Daluge S.M. Garvey E.P. Hopkins S. Reardon J.E. Boyd F.L. Miller R.L. J. Biol.

Despite its importance, up to now there was no structure of a mammalian GMPK, and the available structures that focused on the yeast enzyme had no substrates or only a single substrate present in complex with the enzyme. To better understand the active site properties of the mammalian enzyme and to characterize the enzyme in the presence of nucleotides at both substrate-binding sites, we solved the crystal structure of the mouse guanylate kinase in complex with GMP and ADP. The LID region in most NMP kinases (eukaryotic thymidylate kinases being an exception (28Ostermann N. Lavie A. Padiyar S. Brundiers R. Veit T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Konrad M. Schlichting I. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) contains several arginine residues that have been shown to participate in catalyzing phosphoryl transfer by direct interactions with the γ-phosphate of ATP (29Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the nucleotide-free and GMP-bound yGMPK structures, this region is too far away to fulfill this catalytic role. Upon binding of ATP, a conformational change takes place that brings the LID to a position where its arginines (Arg137 and Arg148) can directly interact with the phosphates of the nucleotide. In the mGMPKGMP-ADPstructure, Arg137 interacts with the α- and β-phosphates of ADP, and Arg148 interacts with the GMP phosphate. The analogous arginines in adenylate kinase have been shown by mutational analysis to be essential for catalysis (30Kim H.J. Nishikawa S. Tokutomi Y. Takenaka H. Hamada M. Kuby S.A. Uesugi S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additionally, structural studies performed with Dictyostelium discoideum uridylate kinase have also demonstrated the importance of these LID arginines (29Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Scheffzek K. Kliche W. Wiesmuller L. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Notably, in the structure of uridylate kinase in a complex that mimics the transition state, it was observed that the arginine that would correspond to Arg148of mGMPK interacts with the transferred phosphoryl group. It is therefore likely that Arg148, which we observed only to interact with GMP, would actually interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP (we have ADP in our structure) or would potentially act as a clamp by interacting with both the phosphates of GMP and ATP. Additionally, this residue is held in its position by hydrogen bonding with Ser13 (CORE) and Ser144 (LID) through NH1 and Nε, respectively. It is possible that the presence of ATP would favor an interaction with γ-phosphate of ATP instead of Ser13. On the other hand, Arg44, which is part of NMP-binding region, is also positioned to potentially interact with the γ-phosphate of ATP, suggesting its possible involvement in directly catalyzing the chemical step of phosphoryl transfer. This residue is additionally stabilized in our structure with the previously mentioned interaction with Glu140. Ambiguity that arises, if Arg44, Arg148, or both directly interact with the transferred phosphoryl group, cannot be resolved by our structure. In the analysis by Blaszczyk et al. (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of the conformational changes that occur in yGMPK upon GMP binding, it was noticed that the temperature factors of residues in helix 3, which compose one of hinges between the NMP-binding region and the CORE region, have increased significantly in comparison with those seen in the yGMPKapo structure (6Blaszczyk J., Li, Y. Yan H. Ji X. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Blaszczyk et al. propose that helix 3 acts like a spring in the movement of the NMP-binding region and speculate that the ternary complex will likewise have increased mobility in this helix. Higher mobility of the analogous helix in adenylate kinase was also observed by Muller et al. (32Muller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, we observe below average B factors for this helix in the mGMPKGMP-ADPstructure (Fig. 4). Consistent with our observation are low B factors for the analogous helix seen in a number of uridylate kinase ternary complex structures (29Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Scheffzek K. Kliche W. Wiesmuller L. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We conclude that the higher B factors for this helix seen in the yGMPKGMP structure may be due to the inherent flexibility of the enzyme when only a single substrate is present and that the more rigid, fully closed structure we observe in the presence of both nucleotides is a true representation of this state. Importantly, our results and those of others (29Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Scheffzek K. Kliche W. Wiesmuller L. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Muller C.W. Schlauderer G.J. Reinstein J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1996; 4: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) question the proposal that helix 3 serves as a spring to prevent the ternary complex from getting trapped at an energy minimum. Our structure also serves to rationalize the limited success achieved in work in which the goal was to change the substrate specificity of mGMPK to accept AMP instead of GMP as substrate (23Stolworthy T.S. Black M.E. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This was attempted by mutating the two carboxylic acids that interact with the guanine base to uncharged residues, as are present in adenylate kinase. The E72Q/D103N double mutant, although able to functionally complement adenylate kinase temperature-sensitive bacterial strains, possessed only marginally improved kinetics with AMP. This we attribute to the inability of the introduced glutamine in position 72 of mGMPK to mimic its counterpart in adenylate kinase. Although in both nucleoside monophosphate kinases there is an interaction between the side chain of this residue to N1 of guanine/adenine, in mGMPK Glu72 interacts with the NH2 at position 2, whereas in adenylate kinase the glutamine analogous to Glu72 interacts with the NH2 at position 6. As a result of this difference (an interaction with NH2 at position 2 or 6), despite the presence of a glutamine in mGMPK instead of Glu72 in the double mutant, this residue will not be able to interact with the NH2 at position 6 of the adenine ring. The position of the Glu72 side chain will be constrained by the proximity to Thr83, making a shift from proximity to position 2 to position 6 of the ring not possible. Using our structure we are now in a position to design mutations that would take this fact into consideration (for example, mutating Thr83 to a glycine to provide room for the introduced glutamine at position 72 to make a bidentate interaction with the adenine ring). The closed conformation of the ternary complex shows that ADP is mostly solvent exposed, whereas GMP is mostly buried. This would suggest an ordered substrate-binding and product release mechanism in which GMP binds first, followed by ATP, and after the chemical step, ADP leaves the enzyme prior to GDP (an ordered sequential mechanism). However, recent kinetic results are consistent with a random sequential mechanism, although they do not rule out an ordered mechanism (25Li Y. Zhang Y. Yan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28038-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To reconcile a random sequential mechanism for GMPK with our closed conformation structure of mGMPKADP-GMP, we must speculate that the closed structure we observe is the most stable of the ternary complex conformations but that the molecule undergoes opening (“breathing”) to transiently produce a more open structure. It is to this transient open structure that substrates bind in a random order or from which products dissociate in a random order. In conflict with such a random sequential mechanism are recent results on the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase using isothermal titration calorimetry that demonstrated ordered binding to this kinase (33Perozzo R. Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Folkers G. Scapozza L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16139-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Planned isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with mGMPK will resolve this ambiguity. The purine base analogs 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine have been in clinical use for nearly 50 years (34Elion G.B. Science. 1989; 244: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), but it is still not possible to pinpoint a single biochemical pathway for thiopurine cytotoxicity. One mechanism would be due to the incorporation of thiopurine in DNA, which induces DNA damage, such as single strand breaks, DNA-protein cross-links, interstrand cross-links, and sister chromatid exchanges (35Bodell W.J. Mutagenesis. 1991; 6: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Christie N.T. Drake S. Meyn R.E. Nelson J.A. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3665-3671PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pan B.F. Nelson J.A.

Mandel H.G. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3852-3856PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism requires the sequential phosphorylation of thiopurine prodrugs to their activated triphosphorylated forms. Guanylate kinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphorylation pathway of thiopurines, with a Km of over 2 mm for 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (6T-MP) and a maximal velocity of 3% of that with GMP (40Miller R.L. Adamczyk D.L. Spector T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We modeled 6T-MP in the active site of mGMPK to try to understand the structural reasons that make this GMP analog such a poor substrate. The sulfur atom, which substitutes for the oxygen atom found in guanine, is predicted, if bound in an identical fashion to GMP, to make hydrogen bonds with Ser37 and Thr83. An explanation for the poor activity of GMPK with 6T-MP might be steric clash with these alcohol side chains. To test this hypothesis, we made mutants in which the serine and the threonine, singly and in combination, were replaced by an alanine or a glycine. However, kinetic analysis of these mutants showed no improved activity with 6T-MP as a substrate. 2O. Spangenberg, M. Konrad, and A. Lavie, unpublished data. An alternative explanation for the poor activity of 6T-MP implicates the hydrogen bonding capability of this analog with the enzyme. GMP makes a bidentate interaction with Glu72, but because 6T-MP is predicted to exist mostly as the tautomer in which the sulfur atom is protonated (an −SH group) and the ring nitrogen at position 1 is unprotonated, this interaction cannot be obtained with the thiopurine analog. This suggests that replacing the conserved Glu72with a glutamine would enable such an interaction to take place. Whether such a variant of mGMPK in combination with mutations of Ser37 and Thr83 will efficiently phosphorylate thioguanines is currently being tested. In summary, we present the structure of the first mammalian guanylate kinase in complex with GMP and ADP. Comparison of the structure with the available yeast guanylate kinase structures allows us to better understand the conformational changes that occur along the reaction coordinate, to explain the substrate specificity of this enzyme, and to rationalize and model mutants of this enzyme designed to modify the substrate selectivity."

In target tissues, all-trans-retinoic acid is produced by the oxidation of all-trans-retinaldehyde catalyzed by cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases (Fig. 1) (2Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L.

Retinaldehyde, in turn, can be produced either by the oxidation of retinol catalyzed by microsomal or cytosolic retinol dehydrogenases (reviewed in Refs. 6Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar). In the small intestine, the majority of absorbed β-carotene is converted directly to all-trans-retinal by cytosolic β,β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (9Barua A.B. Olson J.A. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinal produced from β-carotene is reduced to all-trans-retinol by microsomal retinal reductase activity (10Kakkad B.P. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12916-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction in the small intestine functions in the presence of cellular retinol binding protein type II (CRBPII),1 which is expressed specifically in the small intestine and binds all-trans-retinal with high affinity (K dof ∼100 nm) (11Li E. Demmer L.A. Sweetser D.A. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5779-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Retinol produced from retinal by retinal reductase is then esterified by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase and incorporated into the lipid core of the chylomicron (12Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. 139. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 31-96Google Scholar). The retinyl esters associated with chylomicrons are cleared into hepatocytes where they undergo a cycle of hydrolysis and re-esterification before storage (12Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. 139.

Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar). However, there is growing evidence that a number of cell types are capable of utilizing β-carotene directly, supplementing their own retinoid stores even though serum levels of retinol are tightly controlled. For instance, in addition to the small intestine, β-carotene is converted to retinol in the liver (8Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar), human colon cancer cells (13During A. Albaugh G. Smith J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In situhybridization analysis of β-carotene dioxygenase expression showed that the corresponding mRNA was expressed primarily in epithelial structures of tissues such as duodenum, lung, and kidney as well as in skin, where it could serve to provide the tissue-specific vitamin A supply (21Wyss A.

Recently, prostate epithelial cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU 145 were shown to convert β-carotene to retinol (22Williams A.W. Boileau T.W.-M. Zhou J.R. Clinton S.K. Erdman J.W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that human prostate epithelium also contains β-carotene dioxygenase. However, the one or more enzymes responsible for the reduction of retinal produced from β-carotene to retinol in prostate as well as other tissues have yet to be characterized. Furthermore, the enzyme responsible for the intestinal microsomal retinal reductase activity that recognizes CRBPII-bound retinal as substrate has not yet been defined at the molecular level.Recently, we have shown that the prostate expresses high levels of a transcript encoding a novel member of theshort-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, PSDR1 (23Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we characterized the cell-specific expression, subcellular localization, and catalytic properties of the protein encoded by the humanPSDR1 gene. We present evidence that PSDR1 is a microsomal retinal reductase that is expressed in the epithelial cells of the human prostate gland and is capable of reducing all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol under physiologically relevant conditions. This activity suggests that PSDR1 might contribute to the enzymatic conversion of retinaldehyde produced from β-carotene to retinol in human prostate. To provide a nomenclature more descriptive of actual biochemical activity, we have changed the designation of this gene and encoded protein fromPSDR1 to RalR1 forRetinalReductase1.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have established that the protein encoded by the recently discovered human gene originally named PSDR1for prostate short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase encodes a novel microsomal enzyme with retinal reductase activity. Accordingly, we changed the designation of PSDR1 gene and protein toRalR1 for retinal reductase 1. RalR1 shares less than 30% overall sequence identity with other members of the SDR superfamily, including the recently characterized all-trans-retinal reductase retinal SDR1 (37Haeseleer F. Huang J. Lebioda L. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21790-21799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the NADP+-dependent photoreceptor-specific all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase (38Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of RalR1 based on algorithms for secondary structure prediction (39von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 40Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that RalR1 is a membrane protein anchored by a single hydrophobic N-terminal segment (amino acids 1–23) with the majority of the polypeptide chain localized on the cytosolic side of the membrane. This model is supported by the experimental data obtained in the present study. First of all, as established by cell fractionation and immunolocalization studies, RalR1 is associated with the ER membranes. Second, the subunit molecular weight of RalR1 does not change after incubation with microsomes, indicating that the ER targeting signal in RalR1 is not cleaved. Finally, RalR1 is not glycosylated at the putative N-linked glycosylation motifs at Asn174and Asn298. Because glycosylation occurs exclusively in the lumen of the ER, lack of glycosylation suggests that RalR1 faces the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.The cytosolic orientation of RalR1 in the ER membrane suggests that in intact cells the enzyme will function as a reductase. RalR1 exhibits at least an 800-fold lower K m values for NADP+ and NADPH than for NAD+ and NADH as cofactors. In the cytosol of liver and, presumably, other cells, NADP+ exists mainly in the reduced form (41Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, enzymes that prefer NADP+ are likely to function in the reductive direction in vivo.Characterization of RalR1 enzymatic properties revealed that the enzyme recognizes retinoids but not steroids as substrates and is particularly efficient as an all-trans-retinaldehyde reductase. Retinoids are highly hydrophobic and chemically labile compounds that are solubilized and protected from unwanted conversions by specific binding proteins inside the cells and in blood plasma (reviewed in Ref. 34Noy N. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinal binds to cytosolic CRBPI, which is expressed in many different types of cells but the levels of CRBPI expression may vary (32Kato M. Blaner W.S. Mertz J.R. Das K. Kato K. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most likely, the enzymes involved in retinoid metabolism have to function in the presence of some amount of CRBPI. Interestingly, not all enzymes that are active with free retinol can metabolize retinol in the presence of CRBPI. It was shown that CRBPI sequesters all-trans-retinol from acyl CoA:retinol acyltransferase (29Ong D.E. Kakkad B. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol.

Bosron W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), enzymes that are active with free retinol. On the other hand, retinal reductase activity in the rat intestine reduced all-trans-retinal in the presence of a 20% molar excess of CRBPII (10Kakkad B.P. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12916-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytosolic rat retinal dehydrogenase type 2 oxidized retinal in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of CRBPI (3Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).The ratio of CRBPI to retinaldehyde in the human prostate gland is not known. Kato et al. (32Kato M. Blaner W.S. Mertz J.R. Das K. Kato K. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that rat prostate contains an ∼8-fold lower amount of CRBP than rat liver (5.2 versus40.0 μg/g of wet weight). This translates into ∼0.3 μm CRBP in rat prostate (molecular weight 14,600). The molar ratio of CRBP to retinal might vary, depending on the tissue supply of β-carotene and the rate of retinol oxidation to retinaldehyde. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CRBPI on RalR1 activity at a constant concentration of retinal over a wide range of CRBPI concentrations. Our results showed that RalR1 exhibits a relatively high rate (1.3 nmol/min × mg) of retinal reduction even at a 10-fold molar excess of CRBPI over 1 μm retinal concentration. Thus, RalR1 can produce retinol from retinaldehyde in the presence of varied physiological levels of CRBPI.Retinoic acid plays an important role in the prostate as an activating ligand for retinoic acid receptor γ, which is required for the normal differentiation of prostate epithelium (44Lohnes D. Kastner P. Dierich A. Mark M. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the prostate gland contains retinol dehydrogenase activity associated with the microsomes and retinal dehydrogenase activity in the cytosol that catalyze the formation of retinoic acid (45Pasquali D. Thaller C. Eichele G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that prostate cells are capable of converting β-carotene to retinol, suggesting that these cells possess β-carotene dioxygenase and retinal reductase activities (22Williams A.W. Boileau T.W.-M. Zhou J.R. Clinton S.K. Erdman J.W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). While our manuscript was under revision, the presence of β-carotene dioxygenase (β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase) mRNA in human prostate was directly demonstrated in a study by Lindqvist and Andersson (46Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), providing further support for colocalization of β-carotene dioxygenase and retinal reductase.Under normal circumstances, the intracellular levels of retinoic acid in tissues are tightly controlled. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this regulation are not yet fully understood but appear to function at several levels of retinoic acid metabolism: biosynthesis, degradation, and storage. Aberrations in retinoid signaling are early events in carcinogenesis, and vitamin A deficiency has been associated with a higher incidence of cancer (reviewed in Ref. 47Sun S.Y. Lotan R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 41: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the levels of retinoic acid are five to eight times lower in human prostate cancer than in normal prostate cells (45Pasquali D. Thaller C. Eichele G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Supplementation of the diet with β-carotene appears to decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer (48Cook N.R. Stampfer M.J. Ma J. Manson J.E. Sacks F.M. Buring J.E. Hennekens C.H. Cancer. 1999; 86: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it was shown that β-carotene inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cellsin vitro (22Williams A.W. Boileau T.W.-M. Zhou J.R. Clinton S.K. Erdman J.W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).From a metabolic point of view, retinal produced from β-carotene in the prostate or any other peripheral tissue may be either oxidized to bioactive retinoic acid by cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases or it may be reduced to retinol, which can then be esterified for storage (8Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar). Hence, retinal is positioned at the crossroads of two opposite metabolic processes: activation and inactivation of retinoids. The fate of the cellular retinal would depend on the activities and expression levels of local aldehyde dehydrogenases and retinal reductases that compete for the same all-trans-retinal substrate. Therefore, changes in the expression level of RalR1 could perturb retinoid homeostasis and alter the intracellular retinoic acid concentrations, leading to abnormal differentiation of prostate epithelium.Besides prostate, RalR1 appears to be expressed at lower levels in a number of different human tissues, including the small intestine (23Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar), where it could play a role in retinoid metabolism. Identification and characterization of retinal reductases in human tissues will provide a better understanding of the control mechanisms responsible for the regulation of intracellular retinoic acid concentrations. All-trans-retinoic acid is a metabolite of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) that functions as an activating ligand for a family of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (1Mangelsdorf D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). In target tissues, all-trans-retinoic acid is produced by the oxidation of all-trans-retinaldehyde catalyzed by cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases (Fig. 1) (2Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L. Hogan P. Chin W.W. Drager U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41210-41218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Retinaldehyde, in turn, can be produced either by the oxidation of retinol catalyzed by microsomal or cytosolic retinol dehydrogenases (reviewed in Refs. 6Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar and 7Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) or by a symmetrical cleavage of β-carotene (Fig. 1) (8Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar). In the small intestine, the majority of absorbed β-carotene is converted directly to all-trans-retinal by cytosolic β,β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (9Barua A.B. Olson J.A. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinal produced from β-carotene is reduced to all-trans-retinol by microsomal retinal reductase activity (10Kakkad B.P. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12916-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction in the small intestine functions in the presence of cellular retinol binding protein type II (CRBPII),1 which is expressed specifically in the small intestine and binds all-trans-retinal with high affinity (K dof ∼100 nm) (11Li E. Demmer L.A. Sweetser D.A. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5779-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Retinol produced from retinal by retinal reductase is then esterified by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase and incorporated into the lipid core of the chylomicron (12Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. 139. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 31-96Google Scholar). The retinyl esters associated with chylomicrons are cleared into hepatocytes where they undergo a cycle of hydrolysis and re-esterification before storage (12Vogel S. Gamble M.V. Blaner W.S. Nau H. Blaner W.S. Retinoids: The Biochemical and Molecular Basis of Vitamin A and Retinoid Action. 139. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 31-96Google Scholar). It is generally believed that retinol secreted from the liver bound to plasma retinol-binding protein serves as the major source of retinoids for peripheral tissues (8Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar). However, there is growing evidence that a number of cell types are capable of utilizing β-carotene directly, supplementing their own retinoid stores even though serum levels of retinol are tightly controlled. For instance, in addition to the small intestine, β-carotene is converted to retinol in the liver (8Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar), human colon cancer cells (13During A. Albaugh G. Smith J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and human lung (14Scita G. Aponte G.W. Wolf G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1992; 3: 118-123Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and skin fibroblasts (15Wei R.R. Wamer W.G. Lambert L.A. Kornhauser A. Nutr. Cancer. 1998; 30: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Significant progress in understanding the tissue-specific uptake and metabolism of β-carotene was provided through the molecular characterization of β,β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenases from the fruit fly (16von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), chicken (17Wyss A. Wirtz G. Woggon W. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Bachmann H.

Campochiaro P. Palczewski K. Zack D.J. Genomics. 2001; 72: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of the corresponding mRNAs revealed that, besides the small intestine, many tissues, including liver, kidney, brain, stomach, testis, and small intestine express relatively high levels of β,β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (17Wyss A. Wirtz G. Woggon W. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Bachmann H. Hunziker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Redmond T.M. Gentleman S.

Kerrigan M. Campochiaro M. Campochiaro P. Palczewski K. Zack D.J. Genomics. 2001; 72: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In situhybridization analysis of β-carotene dioxygenase expression showed that the corresponding mRNA was expressed primarily in epithelial structures of tissues such as duodenum, lung, and kidney as well as in skin, where it could serve to provide the tissue-specific vitamin A supply (21Wyss A. Wirtz G.M. Woggon W.D. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Riss G. Bachmann H. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, prostate epithelial cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU 145 were shown to convert β-carotene to retinol (22Williams A.W. Boileau T.W.-M. Zhou J.R. Clinton S.K. Erdman J.W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that human prostate epithelium also contains β-carotene dioxygenase. However, the one or more enzymes responsible for the reduction of retinal produced from β-carotene to retinol in prostate as well as other tissues have yet to be characterized. Furthermore, the enzyme responsible for the intestinal microsomal retinal reductase activity that recognizes CRBPII-bound retinal as substrate has not yet been defined at the molecular level. Recently, we have shown that the prostate expresses high levels of a transcript encoding a novel member of theshort-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, PSDR1 (23Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we characterized the cell-specific expression, subcellular localization, and catalytic properties of the protein encoded by the humanPSDR1 gene. We present evidence that PSDR1 is a microsomal retinal reductase that is expressed in the epithelial cells of the human prostate gland and is capable of reducing all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol under physiologically relevant conditions. This activity suggests that PSDR1 might contribute to the enzymatic conversion of retinaldehyde produced from β-carotene to retinol in human prostate. To provide a nomenclature more descriptive of actual biochemical activity, we have changed the designation of this gene and encoded protein fromPSDR1 to RalR1 forRetinalReductase1. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have established that the protein encoded by the recently discovered human gene originally named PSDR1for prostate short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase encodes a novel microsomal enzyme with retinal reductase activity. Accordingly, we changed the designation of PSDR1 gene and protein toRalR1 for retinal reductase 1. RalR1 shares less than 30% overall sequence identity with other members of the SDR superfamily, including the recently characterized all-trans-retinal reductase retinal SDR1 (37Haeseleer F. Huang J. Lebioda L. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21790-21799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the NADP+-dependent photoreceptor-specific all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase (38Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of RalR1 based on algorithms for secondary structure prediction (39von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 40Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that RalR1 is a membrane protein anchored by a single hydrophobic N-terminal segment (amino acids 1–23) with the majority of the polypeptide chain localized on the cytosolic side of the membrane. This model is supported by the experimental data obtained in the present study. First of all, as established by cell fractionation and immunolocalization studies, RalR1 is associated with the ER membranes. Second, the subunit molecular weight of RalR1 does not change after incubation with microsomes, indicating that the ER targeting signal in RalR1 is not cleaved. Finally, RalR1 is not glycosylated at the putative N-linked glycosylation motifs at Asn174and Asn298. Because glycosylation occurs exclusively in the lumen of the ER, lack of glycosylation suggests that RalR1 faces the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.The cytosolic orientation of RalR1 in the ER membrane suggests that in intact cells the enzyme will function as a reductase. RalR1 exhibits at least an 800-fold lower K m values for NADP+ and NADPH than for NAD+ and NADH as cofactors. In the cytosol of liver and, presumably, other cells, NADP+ exists mainly in the reduced form (41Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, enzymes that prefer NADP+ are likely to function in the reductive direction in vivo.Characterization of RalR1 enzymatic properties revealed that the enzyme recognizes retinoids but not steroids as substrates and is particularly efficient as an all-trans-retinaldehyde reductase. Retinoids are highly hydrophobic and chemically labile compounds that are solubilized and protected from unwanted conversions by specific binding proteins inside the cells and in blood plasma (reviewed in Ref. 34Noy N. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinal binds to cytosolic CRBPI, which is expressed in many different types of cells but the levels of CRBPI expression may vary (32Kato M. Blaner W.S. Mertz J.R. Das K. Kato K. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most likely, the enzymes involved in retinoid metabolism have to function in the presence of some amount of CRBPI. Interestingly, not all enzymes that are active with free retinol can metabolize retinol in the presence of CRBPI. It was shown that CRBPI sequesters all-trans-retinol from acyl CoA:retinol acyltransferase (29Ong D.E. Kakkad B. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol.

Bosron W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), enzymes that are active with free retinol. On the other hand, retinal reductase activity in the rat intestine reduced all-trans-retinal in the presence of a 20% molar excess of CRBPII (10Kakkad B.P. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12916-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytosolic rat retinal dehydrogenase type 2 oxidized retinal in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of CRBPI (3Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).The ratio of CRBPI to retinaldehyde in the human prostate gland is not known. Kato et al. (32Kato M. Blaner W.S. Mertz J.R. Das K. Kato K. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that rat prostate contains an ∼8-fold lower amount of CRBP than rat liver (5.2 versus40.0 μg/g of wet weight). This translates into ∼0.3 μm CRBP in rat prostate (molecular weight 14,600). The molar ratio of CRBP to retinal might vary, depending on the tissue supply of β-carotene and the rate of retinol oxidation to retinaldehyde. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CRBPI on RalR1 activity at a constant concentration of retinal over a wide range of CRBPI concentrations. Our results showed that RalR1 exhibits a relatively high rate (1.3 nmol/min × mg) of retinal reduction even at a 10-fold molar excess of CRBPI over 1 μm retinal concentration. Thus, RalR1 can produce retinol from retinaldehyde in the presence of varied physiological levels of CRBPI.Retinoic acid plays an important role in the prostate as an activating ligand for retinoic acid receptor γ, which is required for the normal differentiation of prostate epithelium (44Lohnes D.

It was shown that CRBPI sequesters all-trans-retinol from acyl CoA:retinol acyltransferase (29Ong D.E. Kakkad B. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol.

Bosron W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), enzymes that are active with free retinol. On the other hand, retinal reductase activity in the rat intestine reduced all-trans-retinal in the presence of a 20% molar excess of CRBPII (10Kakkad B.P. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12916-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytosolic rat retinal dehydrogenase type 2 oxidized retinal in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of CRBPI (3Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The ratio of CRBPI to retinaldehyde in the human prostate gland is not known. Kato et al. (32Kato M. Blaner W.S. Mertz J.R. Das K. Kato K. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that rat prostate contains an ∼8-fold lower amount of CRBP than rat liver (5.2 versus40.0 μg/g of wet weight). This translates into ∼0.3 μm CRBP in rat prostate (molecular weight 14,600). The molar ratio of CRBP to retinal might vary, depending on the tissue supply of β-carotene and the rate of retinol oxidation to retinaldehyde. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CRBPI on RalR1 activity at a constant concentration of retinal over a wide range of CRBPI concentrations. Our results showed that RalR1 exhibits a relatively high rate (1.3 nmol/min × mg) of retinal reduction even at a 10-fold molar excess of CRBPI over 1 μm retinal concentration. Thus, RalR1 can produce retinol from retinaldehyde in the presence of varied physiological levels of CRBPI. Retinoic acid plays an important role in the prostate as an activating ligand for retinoic acid receptor γ, which is required for the normal differentiation of prostate epithelium (44Lohnes D. Kastner P. Dierich A. Mark M. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the prostate gland contains retinol dehydrogenase activity associated with the microsomes and retinal dehydrogenase activity in the cytosol that catalyze the formation of retinoic acid (45Pasquali D. Thaller C. Eichele G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that prostate cells are capable of converting β-carotene to retinol, suggesting that these cells possess β-carotene dioxygenase and retinal reductase activities (22Williams A.W. Boileau T.W.-M. Zhou J.R. Clinton S.K. Erdman J.W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). While our manuscript was under revision, the presence of β-carotene dioxygenase (β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase) mRNA in human prostate was directly demonstrated in a study by Lindqvist and Andersson (46Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23942-23948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), providing further support for colocalization of β-carotene dioxygenase and retinal reductase. Under normal circumstances, the intracellular levels of retinoic acid in tissues are tightly controlled. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this regulation are not yet fully understood but appear to function at several levels of retinoic acid metabolism: biosynthesis, degradation, and storage. Aberrations in retinoid signaling are early events in carcinogenesis, and vitamin A deficiency has been associated with a higher incidence of cancer (reviewed in Ref. 47Sun S.Y. Lotan R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 41: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the levels of retinoic acid are five to eight times lower in human prostate cancer than in normal prostate cells (45Pasquali D. Thaller C. Eichele G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Supplementation of the diet with β-carotene appears to decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer (48Cook N.R. Stampfer M.J. Ma J. Manson J.E. Sacks F.M. Buring J.E. Hennekens C.H. Cancer. 1999; 86: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it was shown that β-carotene inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cellsin vitro (22Williams A.W. Boileau T.W.-M. Zhou J.R. Clinton S.K. Erdman J.W. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From a metabolic point of view, retinal produced from β-carotene in the prostate or any other peripheral tissue may be either oxidized to bioactive retinoic acid by cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases or it may be reduced to retinol, which can then be esterified for storage (8Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 229-250Google Scholar). Hence, retinal is positioned at the crossroads of two opposite metabolic processes: activation and inactivation of retinoids. The fate of the cellular retinal would depend on the activities and expression levels of local aldehyde dehydrogenases and retinal reductases that compete for the same all-trans-retinal substrate. Therefore, changes in the expression level of RalR1 could perturb retinoid homeostasis and alter the intracellular retinoic acid concentrations, leading to abnormal differentiation of prostate epithelium. Besides prostate, RalR1 appears to be expressed at lower levels in a number of different human tissues, including the small intestine (23Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar), where it could play a role in retinoid metabolism. Identification and characterization of retinal reductases in human tissues will provide a better understanding of the control mechanisms responsible for the regulation of intracellular retinoic acid concentrations.

PP1c specifically interacts with VDR but not retinoic acid receptor α and retinoid X receptor α in yeast. Although VDR-PP1c and VDR-PP2Ac interaction is ligand-independent in vivo, 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 induces VDR-associated phosphatase activity. Further, VDR modulation of PP1c/PP2Ac activity results in a rapid and specific dephosphorylation and inactivation of their substrate, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k). Finally, we demonstrate that the endogenous VDR, PP1c or PP2Ac, and p70S6k are present in a ternary complex in vivo, and the interaction of p70S6k with the VDR-PP complex is modulated by the phosphorylation state of the kinase.

VDR heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and at the molecular level VDR-RXR heterodimers induce gene expression via interaction with vitamin D response elements present in the promoter regions of responsive genes (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). This mode of action is known as the “genomic action” of VDR. However 1,25-(OH)2D3 also induces gene expression by a mechanism distinct from its classical mode of action. For example, 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced expression of monocytic differentiation markers CD14 and CD11b in THP-1 cells requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) via ligand-dependent interaction of VDR with the regulatory (p85) subunit of PI 3-kinase (2Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly estrogen receptor interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase where estrogen receptor-PI 3-kinase interaction leads to the activation of protein kinase B/AKT and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (3Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D. Ley K. Chin W. Liao J. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). It thus appears that cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signal transduction pathways can lead to either induction of gene expression in a nuclear receptor-responsive element-independent manner or to extranuclear/non-genomic induction of enzymatic activities that are physiologically important, for example, in explaining the vasoprotective effects of estrogen (3Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D. Ley K. Chin W. Liao J. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Further, nuclear receptor ligands (dexamethasone, triiodothyronine, and retinoic acid) also induce a rapid dephosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase independently of their transcriptional activation (4Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, nuclear receptors appear to have a functional role both outside and inside the nucleus. Ser/Thr phosphatases are implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions, namely metabolism, transcription, translation, development, cell growth, and differentiation (5Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). There are two major and structurally related families of Ser/Thr phosphatases, termed PP1 and PP2A. PP1c and PP2Ac are the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A, respectively, that associate with various regulatory and target subunits, thereby generating distinct holoenzymes with unique localizations, specificities, and cellular functions (6Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence of a cross-talk between VDR and Ser/Thr phosphatases and show that VDR interacts with PP1c in a ligand-dependent manner in yeast. Although the association of VDR and PP1c/PP2Ac is ligand-independent in vitro andin vivo in mammalian cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces the Ser/Thr phosphatase enzymatic activity of these phosphatases. This induction leads to a rapid and specific dephosphorylation at the Thr-389 residue of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k), resulting in inactivation of this kinase. By co-immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate the presence of a ternary complex containing VDR-PP-p70S6k, where PP represents PP1c or PP2Ac. Using rapamycin, which specifically prevents Thr-389 phosphorylation, we show that the Thr-389-dephosphorylated p70S6k does not efficiently interact with the VDR-PP complex, suggesting that p70S6k phosphorylation state modulates its interaction with the VDR-PP complex. Since p70S6k is critical for G1-to-S phase transition, our observations provide a molecular basis of VDR ligand-induced G1 block in colon/epithelial cancer cells. The bait plasmid was generated by introducing a PCR-amplified VDR-LBD fragment (amino acids 89–427) in-frame with Gal4 DNA binding domain intoEcoRI-BamHI sites of the plasmid pGBKT7 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Transformation of yeast was carried out by using the Yeastmaker transformation kit (CLONTECH). A colony from pGBKT7-VDR-transformed yeast strain PJ69-2A was grown for 18 h in 50 ml of SD/Trp− medium at 30 °C with shaking at 270 rpm. After a growth of 0.8 at A 600, cells were pelleted (1000 × g, 5 min) and resuspended in 5 ml of the medium to give a final concentration of more than 1 × 109 cells/ml. The entire pGBKT7-VDR-transformed PJ69-2A culture was combined with 1 ml of Y187 cells pretransformed with a mouse embryo cDNA library in pGADT7 expression vector (CLONTECH) in a 2-liter sterile flask. YPDA/kan (50 ml) was added to the flask and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C with swirling (50 rpm) for mating. The mixture was centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min), and the cells were resuspended in YPDA/kan (10 ml). Double transformants were screened on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1 μm). Positive clones were tested for β-galactosidase activity (7Nagpal S. Ghosn C. DiSepio D. Molina Y. Sutter M. Klein E.S. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22563-22568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PP1c deletion mutants Δ1PP1c (amino acids 105–323), Δ2PP1c (amino acids 177–323), and Δ3PP1c (amino acids 1–200) were prepared by cloning corresponding PCR amplification products into EcoRI-XbaI sites of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). For protein expression, pGEX3X-VDR-LBD-transformed DH5α cells (25 ml) were grown overnight and used for inoculating LB medium (250 ml). Induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was performed at A 600 = 0.5, and cells were allowed to grow for 3 h at 30 °C with shaking. Bacteria were washed once in cold PBS, resuspended in 5 ml of extraction buffer (PBS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT with protease inhibitors), and sonicated three times for 10 s with 15-s intervals. Following centrifugation to remove cell debris, bacterial extract was incubated (2 h) at 4 °C with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (250 μl) (Amersham Biosciences). For GST pull-down assays, 15 μl of glutathione bead-bound GST-VDR-LBD or GST were mixed with 5 μl ofin vitro transcribed and translated [35S]methionine-labeled wild type or mutant PP1c. Reactions were subsequently incubated in 1 ml of 75 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton-X, 10% glycerol for 2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−7m). Beads were washed, resuspended in 2× protein loading dye (Invitrogen), denatured for 10 min at 70 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%), and analyzed by autoradiography. T47D and Caco-2 cells were passaged in phenol red-free, high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. For microcystin chromatography, Caco-2 or T47D cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−7m) for 30 min, washed with cold PBS, and scraped in MC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× mammalian mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Cells were centrifuged (1000 rpm) at 4 °C for 5 min, resuspended in MC buffer (3 ml), and subjected to freeze-thaw. Cell extracts were passed through a 21-gauge needle, and debris was removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm) for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured using BCA reagent (Pierce). The control sample was preincubated with 5 nm free microcystin for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell extract (1 mg of protein) was mixed with 30 μl of microcystin-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) pre-equilibrated with MC buffer and incubated overnight with shaking at 4 °C. Beads were washed with cold MC buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, resuspended in 10 μl of 2× protein loading dye, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel together with aliquots from the unbound fraction (20 μg each). 1,25(OH)2D3was present in all washes and buffer for the treated samples. For phosphatase activity, cell extracts (600 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agarose-conjugated rabbit anti-VDR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and beads were washed four times with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij35) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 1,25(OH)2D3 where needed. Beads were resuspended in washing buffer, and aliquots (40 μl) were used for phosphatase activity assay or Western blotting. Ser/Thr phosphatase activity was measured using the Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−8m) or vehicle for 5, 15, or 30 min, rinsed once with cold PBS containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), and scraped off in the same buffer. Cells were centrifuged at 450 × gfor 5 min and resuspended in 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 5 min. Igepal-640 was added (0.6% final concentration), and cells were vortexed (10 s) and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 s). The supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic fraction. Protein extracts (30 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with various p70S6k antibodies (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Immunoprecipitation of VDR- or PP1c-bound p70S6k was performed on 1 mg of cytoplasmic extract as described for the phosphatase assay. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action of 1,25(OH)2D3, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interacted with VDR in the presence of the ligand. The sequence of VDR harboring the D-E regions of the receptor (amino acids 89–427) was used to prepare the bait construct (pGBKT7-VDR), and cDNAs encoding VDR-interacting proteins were isolated from a 17.5-day mouse embryo library. Upon characterization, most of the cDNA clones, whose protein products interacted with VDR in a ligand-dependent manner, were found to be mouse RXRα, -β, and -γ (Fig.1 A). Among other VDR-interacting protein cDNAs, a clone, H1, was isolated that contained a 2.2-kb insert corresponding to the cDNA sequence of full-length mouse PP1c. Neither the bait nor the fish vector was active when expressed alone in yeast cells. However, β-galactosidase activity in yeast was observed only when pGBKT7-VDR was expressed with pGADT7-PP1c in the presence but not in the absence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1, A andC). Ligand-dependent interaction of VDR-LBD with PP1c was also found to be dose-dependent (Fig.1 B), and the interaction was also observed with full-length VDR but not with RARα and RXRα (Fig. 1, C andD). To further explore VDR-PP1c interaction, a GST-VDR-LBD fusion protein (containing amino acids 90–427) was purified from pGEX3X-VDR-LBD-transformed bacterial cells using glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled PP1c was retained by the glutathione bead-bound GST-VDR-LBD. In contrast to the yeast two-hybrid results, in vitro interaction between GST-VDR-LBD and PP1c was found to be ligand-independent (Fig.2 A). No interaction was observed between PP1c and glutathione-bound GST protein. To identify the VDR interaction domain of PP1c, deletion mutants of PP1c were generated and assayed for interaction in GST pull-down experiments. Deletion of up to 177 amino acids in the N-terminal portion of PP1c did not prevent binding to VDR-LBD (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly the N-terminal part contains a number of amino acids essential to the catalytic function of PP1c, suggesting that the integrity of the catalytic site is not required for interaction with VDR. Deletion of 123 amino acids from the C terminus of PP1c significantly reduced but did not abolish its binding to VDR (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that although the C terminus of PP1c provides the major interacting region, similar to its interaction with other regulatory proteins, multiple regions are involved in VDR-PP1c interaction (Fig.2 B). To verify that endogenous PP1c was physically associated with endogenous VDR, we purified PP1c-associated proteins using microcystin-Sepharose (an affinity resin for PP1c and PP2Ac) beads (8Kloeker S. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5339-5347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cell extracts obtained from control or 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−7m)-treated Caco-2 cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with microcystin-Sepharose beads. Following extensive washing, microcystin bead-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-VDR antibodies. A VDR-PP1c interaction was observed in Caco-2 cells that was not dependent on the presence of the VDR ligand (Fig. 2 C, a). Preincubation of Caco-2 extract with 0.5 nmol of free microcystin resulted in a loss of detectable VDR and PP1c, suggesting that VDR-PP1c association was specific (Fig. 2 C, b). Further, microcystin chromatography of control and 1,25(OH)2D3(10−7m)-treated Caco-2 and T47D cell extracts followed by Western blotting with anti-VDR antibodies showed VDR-PP1c interaction in Caco-2 but not T47D cells (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that VDR-PP association is cell context-dependent. Moreover, RXRα was not detected in the VDR-PP complex retained on microcystin-Sepharose beads (Fig.2 D). The presence of ligand-independent interaction between VDR and PP1c in GST and microcystin systems but ligand dependence in yeast prompted us to examine the possibility that 1,25(OH)2D3induced the enzymatic activity of VDR-bound Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. A ligand-mediated increase in phosphatase activity could explain the increase in VDR gene expression in yeast. Therefore, we measured VDR-associated Ser/Thr phosphatase activity. Anti-VDR antibody could pull down Ser/Thr protein phosphatase enzymatic activity from Caco-2 cell extracts (Fig.3 A). Further, 30-min treatment of cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10−8m) resulted in an enhancement of VDR-associated phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 A). The specificity of VDR-associated Ser/Thr phosphatase activity was demonstrated by incubation of the VDR-IP reaction with microcystin (6 nm) that completely abolished the VDR-associated enzymatic activity (Fig.3 A). Microcystin, a cyanobacterial toxin, is a potent inhibitor of both PP2Ac and PP1c (9Zolnierowicz S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1225-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Aliquots from the VDR-IP used to measure phosphatase activity were subjected to Western blot analysis to monitor differences in VDR-associated Ser/Thr phosphatases between control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated samples. In immunoprecipitations, VDR antibody could pull down not only PP1c but also PP2Ac, and identical levels of PP1c and PP2Ac proteins were detected in control and treated cell extracts (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that the increased Ser/Thr phosphatase activity associated with VDR-IP derived from 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells did not result from increased recruitment of Ser/Thr phosphatases to the receptor. In contrast, as expected, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of Caco-2 cells resulted in increased immunoprecipitation of RXRα by anti-VDR antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Taken together these data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases the enzymatic activity of VDR-associated Ser/Thr phosphatases in Caco-2 cells. A number of cellular mechanisms dependent on Ser/Thr phosphorylation and relevant to 1,25(OH)2D3 action could be affected by increased VDR-bound phosphatase activity. The effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on G1-S phase transition is of particular interest since Ser/Thr phosphatases complex with a number of key regulators of cell cycle progression. PP2Ac is known to dephosphorylate and inactivate p70S6k (10Petritsch C. Beu H. Balmain A. Oft M. Genes Dev. 2001; 14: 3093-3101Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Peterson R.T. Desai B.N.

PP2Ac is also shown to form a complex with p70S6k, thus indicating the presence of a Ser/Thr phosphatase-kinase signaling module inside the cell (10Petritsch C. Beu H. Balmain A. Oft M. Genes Dev. 2001; 14: 3093-3101Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we looked for changes at the phosphorylation state of p70S6k after treatment of Caco-2 cells with the VDR ligand. Caco-2 cytoplasmic extracts probed with phospho-Thr-389-specific p70S6k antibodies showed dephosphorylation of p70S6k after 5, 15, and 30-min treatments of cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.3 C). In contrast, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 did not change either the protein level of p70S6k or the level of phosphorylated p70S6k at Thr-421/Ser-424 or Ser-411 positions (Fig.3 C). The rapamycin-sensitive FRAP/mTOR kinase is implicated in phosphorylating p70S6k at Thr-389 upon serum stimulation, raising the possibility that 1,25(OH)2D3 could act by decreasing FRAP/mTOR activity. Activity of this kinase correlates to its phosphorylation at Ser-2448 (15Nave B. Ouwens M. Withers D. Alessi D. Shepherd P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Analysis of Caco-2 cell extracts did not reveal any decrease in FRAP/mTOR phosphorylation level using a phospho-Ser-2448-specific antibody (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that decreased Thr-389 phosphorylation on p70S6k was not secondary to reduced FRAP/mTOR activity. Although PP2Ac-p70S6k interaction is well documented (10Petritsch C. Beu H. Balmain A. Oft M. Genes Dev. 2001; 14: 3093-3101Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Peterson R.T. Desai B.N.

Biol. 2001; 11: R596-R599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), PP1c-p70S6k interaction has not been reported. As shown in Fig. 3 D, p70S6k could be immunoprecipitated using anti-PP1c antibody, suggesting the presence of a PP1c-p70S6k signaling module. We next tested the possibility that VDR-PP1c or -PP2Ac complexes also contain p70S6k, thereby providing an opportunity for PP2Ac or PP1c to dephosphorylate and thus inactivate p70S6k. Anti-VDR antibody could pull down Thr-389-phosphorylated p70S6k in the absence but not in the presence of the ligand (Fig. 3 D). Further, p70S6k did not directly interact with VDR sincein vitro translated p70S6k was not retained by GST-VDR-LBD bound to glutathione beads (data not shown). Dissociation of p70S6k from VDR under conditions where Thr-389 was mainly dephosphorylated (via activation of associated PP1c or PP2Ac in the complex) suggested that the interaction could be dependent upon the phosphorylation state of p70S6k. To support this hypothesis, Caco-2 cells were treated with rapamycin (20 nm, 45 min), and VDR immunoprecipitates were analyzed by using phospho-Thr-389-specific antibody. Since rapamycin preferentially inhibits FRAP/mTOR, the upstream kinase of p70S6k (16Dumont F.J. Qingxiang S. Life Sci. 1995; 58: 373-395Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar), as expected rapamycin treatment of Caco-2 cells inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6k at Thr-389 (Fig.3 D). This inhibition resulted in a significant dissociation of p70S6k from VDR, supporting the idea that phospho-Thr-389 preferentially interacted with the VDR-PP complex in the absence of the ligand (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that VDR may act as a platform to compartmentalize VDR-PP1c-p70S6k and VDR-PP2Ac-p70S6k complexes to the same intracellular location or bring them in close proximity so that ligand stimulation could result in induction of Ser/Thr phosphatase activity, which in turn may result in dephosphorylation and inactivation of p70S6k. Therefore, in addition to vitamin D-dependent induction of p21 gene expression (17Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), VDR ligand-mediated dephosphorylation and inactivation of p70S6k may also play a role in 1,25(OH)2D3-induced G1 arrest of colon cancer cells. Alternatively the VDR-PP1c/PP2Ac-p70S6kpathway may contribute to ligand-mediated inhibition of proliferation of epithelial cancer cells that do not show p21 up-regulation after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment (18Prudencio J. Akutsu N. Benlimame N. Wang T. Bastien Y. Lin R. Black M.J. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. White J.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies show that vitamin D confers significant protection against colorectal cancer (19Garland C. Shekelle R. Barrett-Connor E. Criqui M. Rossof A. Paul O. Lancet. 1985; 8424: 307-309Abstract Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and increased VDR expression is observed in cancerous lesions than normal colon (20Cross H. Bajna E. Bises G. Genser D. Kallay E. Potzi R. Wenzl E. Wrba F. Roka R. Peterlik M. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 2333-2337PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vandewalle B. Adenis A. Hornez L. Revillion F. Lefebvre J. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, as shown in our model (Fig. 3E), it is tempting to speculate that in colon cancer cells, at least a part of the cytoplasmic complement of VDR is compartmentalized as VDR-PP1c/PP2Ac-p70S6k signaling module. Increased VDR levels coupled with low 1,25(OH)2D3 may inhibit the activity of PP1c/PP2Ac in this complex, thus rendering the associated p70S6k active by virtue of its Thr-389 phosphorylation. This is evident from Fig. 3 A since VDR-associated Ser/Thr phosphatase activity is drastically inhibited in the absence of the ligand. VDR ligand, upon binding to LBD, appears to impart a conformational change in PP1c/PP2Ac proteins, thus rendering them active in terms of their enzymatic activity (Fig. 3 A), which is evident by decreased Thr-389 phosphorylation, inactivation, and dissociation of VDR-associated p70S6k (Fig. 3, Cand D). The final result of this sequence of events is cell cycle arrest at the G1-S transition state. Accordingly, VDR ligands inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in vivo (22Wali R.K. Bissonnette M. Khare S. Hart J. Sitrin M.D. Brasitus T.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3050-3054PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shabahang M. Buras R.R. Davoodi F. Schumaker L.M. Nauta R.J. Evans S.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3712-3718PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, since down-regulation of PP2Ac activity is one of the key steps in cellular transformation (24Altiok S., Xu, M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 25Sontag E. Sontag J.-M. Garcia A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5662-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), our observation that 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates Ser/Thr phosphatase activity might contribute to elucidating the role of VDR ligands in controlling growth and differentiation of normal and cancer cells."

Using fusion proteins derived from the intracellular regions of the Nav1.2a subunit and the Ank repeat domain of AnkG node, we mapped a major interaction site in the intracellular loop separating α subunit domains I-II. This 57-amino acid region binds the Ank repeat region with a K D value of 69 nm.

Ankyrins, a family of ubiquitous adapter proteins linking membrane proteins to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), have been identified as major players in the membrane insertion and anchoring of sodium channels (2Bennett V. Chen L. Curr. Opin.

Three genes for ankyrin have been described in mammals, and all three generate isoforms that are represented in the brain (5Kordeli E. Bennett V. J.

Products of the Ank3 gene (AnkG)1 are present in almost all tissues; in the nervous system, two isoforms, of 270 and 480 kDa, are specifically localized at the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier (AnkG node) (6Kordeli E.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Ankyrins in the nervous system share a common molecular organization; the N-terminal domain is mainly composed of 24 repeats of 33 amino acids, built on a common consensus sequence, which fold into four thermodynamically autonomous subdomains of six repeats each (9Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This Ank repeat region binds numerous membrane or cytoplasmic proteins including the erythrocyte anion exchanger (10Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), clathrin (11Michaely P. Kamal A. Anderson R.G. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition to the voltage-dependent sodium channel, this region interacts with other proteins found in the nodes of Ranvier or in paranodal regions: Na+,K+-ATPase (13Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and members of the L1 family of adhesion molecules, neurofascin and NrCAM (14Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A spectrin-binding domain, providing a link to the cytoskeleton, follows the Ank repeat (or membrane-binding) domain. The C-terminal regulatory region has been shown to modulate the binding affinity of the membrane-binding and spectrin-binding domains. Large brain ankyrins (440-kDa AnkB and 480-kDa AnkG node) have in addition an extended tail inserted between the spectrin-binding and C-terminal domain. This tail domain is subject to alternative splicing that can modify its overall length (giving rise to the 220-kDa AnkB, and 280- and 190-kDa AnkG isoforms), and it has been predicted to assume the shape of an extended random coil structure. In AnkG node isoforms, a unique serine-threonine-rich domain involved in control of the restricted expression to axonal proximal segments follows the spectrin-binding domain (2Bennett V. Chen L. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The sodium channel from rat brain is a multimeric protein (15Hartshorne R.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1667-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); an α subunit forms the ionic pore of the channel, and three auxiliary subunits, β1, β2, and β3, are involved in the regulation of inactivation and in transport to the cell surface (16Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 17Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S.

Mizuguchi K. Jackson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2308-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The α subunit is a large glycoprotein of 260 kDa formed by four homologous domains each containing six transmembrane segments; four isoforms (Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6) are expressed in the central nervous system. The β1 (38 kDa), β2 (36 kDa), and β3 subunits have an extracellular N-terminal domain, one transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic domain. Their extracellular regions contain immunoglobulin-like domains; such domains are responsible for a variety of homophilic or heterophilic interactions established by cell adhesion molecules (20Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Earlier studies have shown that ankyrins bind the purified voltage-dependent sodium channel via a fragment of the membrane-binding domain that encompasses repeats 12–24 (4Srinivasan Y. Lewallen M. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7483-7489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the β1 and β2 subunits are also able to bind ankyrin, and their involvement in trans-homophilic adhesive interactions leads to the formation of clusters of ankyrin at the cell membrane (21Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).Anchoring of the sodium channel thus implicates several partners, and the interactions involved have yet to be defined in molecular terms. In this study, we have identified the intracellular regions of the Nav1.2 sodium channel that interact with ankyrin and defined a major site for binding to the Ank repeats located in a 57-aa stretch in the intracellular loop I-II of the Nav1.2 α subunit. This region is central to sodium channel function, since it is close both to the major protein kinase A modulator site and to the synaptotagmin binding site (22Sampo B. Tricaud N. Leveque C. Seagar M. Couraud F. Dargent B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3666-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Ank repeat region is also able to bind the interdomain III-IV inactivation loop with low affinity. However, we could not find an interaction of the cytoplasmic region of the β1 and β2 subunits with the Ank repeat region; in addition, we show that the sodium channel and AnkG node colocalize at spinal motoneuron initial segments in the absence of the β2 subunit and that antibodies directed against AnkG node or the cytoplasmic domain of the β1subunit failed to co-immunoprecipitate these two proteins from detergent lysates of brain synaptosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsChemicals, Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center), soybean lecithin (l-α-phosphatidylcholine, type II-S), and glutathione-agarose beads were purchased from Sigma.

They were used as pure sera for immunoprecipitation, and an IgG fraction of the anti-β1 antibody was prepared by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (AP Biotech), following the manufacturer's instructions, for use in Western blotting experiments. The GST-III-IV (see below) fusion protein was used to raise antibodies in rabbits following conventional procedures; the resulting immune serum (αIII-IV) was used as a 30% ammonium sulfate-precipitated fraction for immunoprecipitation, and antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on antigen coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose as recommended by the manufacturer (AP Biotech) for use in Western blot.

All of the sodium channel fragments were obtained by PCR from the initial clones and inserted in frame with the glutathione S-transferase coding region in the pGEX 2T vector (22Sampo B. Tricaud N. Leveque C. Seagar M. Couraud F. Dargent B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3666-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A fragment (Ank-(7–23)) of the human AnkG node (GenBankTM accession number U13616) repeat domain was cloned by PCR using primers corresponding to nucleotides 820–839 and 2570–2589 in the pET 28a vector, in frame with the initiation site and the His6 epitope; fragments of this region and a fragment of the rat AnkG node serine-rich domain (6Kordeli E.

His6 fusion proteins were obtained as radiolabeled derivatives by in vitro translation of the cDNA in the presence of [35S]methionine using the T7/TnT kit and following the manufacturer's instructions. Binding experiments were performed by incubating the GST-protein beads (2 nmol for GST, 0.2 nmol for the GST fusion proteins), in a 200-μl final volume, with thein vitro translated products in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes with 1 ml of the same buffer and determination of the bead-associated radioactivity by scintillation counting.Solubilization of Synaptosomal Membranes and ImmunoprecipitationNerve endings from adult rat forebrain were prepared as previously described (27Leveque C. el Far O.

After a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, pelleted membranes were solubilized in various conditions. Solubilization with Triton X-100 (2.5%) and exogenous lipids (0.25% soybean lecithin) of TTX-saturated sodium channels has already been described (23Alcaraz G. Sampo B. Tricaud N. Giraud P.

Lewallen M. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7483-7489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); using a homologous region from AnkG node, we mapped a major interaction site on the Nav1.2 sodium channel intracellular loop between domains I and II. This site, expressed as a GST fusion protein, shows a K D of 69 nm, a value in good agreement with the 34 nm value defined for the binding of ankyrin to the sodium channel reconstituted in artificial membranes (4Srinivasan Y. Lewallen M. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7483-7489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other sites, of weaker affinity, located on loop III-IV and on the N-terminal region, could contribute to the overall binding of the α subunit. This situation is not unique to the sodium channel; two cooperative binding sites for erythrocyte ankyrin have been described on the anion exchanger (10Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and Na+,K+-ATPase, which possesses five cytoplasmic domains, has two binding sites for the Ank repeat region (13Devarajan P. Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recognition of the membrane-binding domain by the sodium channel α subunit loop I-II involves an extended region, as it does for other proteins for which binding sites on ankyrin have been mapped. Neurofascin and the anion exchanger, for instance, can both bind to ankyrin through subdomains D3 + D4, whereas their binding to subdomains D2 + D3 is competitive (10Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); clathrin binds to subdomains D2, D3 + D4, and D4 with nanomolar affinities (11Michaely P. Kamal A. Anderson R.G. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Such “Velcro-type” interactions allow for finer modulation than an all-or-nothing type of binding would and render the Ank repeat region able to accommodate a potentially higher number of binding partners. In this regard, it is not surprising then that the binding profile of the α subunit loop III-IV to ankyrin fragments strictly follows that of the α subunit loop I-II; the binding of β1 and β2 to ankyrin has been demonstrated in a transfected insect cell system in which these auxiliary subunits, when involved in trans-homophilic interactions, could recruit endogenous ankyrin to the plasma membrane (21Malhotra J.D. Kazen-Gillespie K. Hortsch M. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11383-11388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). An explanation for the absence of in vitro binding we observed could be that the involvement of β1 and β2 in adhesive interactions results in an increase in their affinity for ankyrin, possibly through a change in conformation or by association with another membrane protein that would act as an allosteric effector. The fact that we have been unable to detect an interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 and β2 subunits expressed as GST fusion proteins with the ankyrin repeat fragment used in this study does not exclude the possibility that such an interaction, with a very low affinity, might exist. However, we observed a colocalization of AnkG node and sodium channel α subunit at the axon initial segment in embryonic spinal motoneurons, which do not express β2 subunit transcripts, and we could not co-immunoprecipitate complexes of ankyrinG node and β1 subunits from solubilisates of rat brain membranes. These results suggest that the interaction of AnkG node with the β1 and β2 auxiliary subunits might be secondary to the interaction with α.Cultured spinal motoneurons are derived from an early embryonic stage (14 days in utero), are able to differentiate well characterized axonal and somato-dendritic domains in vitro, and as such, represent an adequate model for the study of sodium channel insertion and anchoring in polarized membrane domains and particularly at the axon initial segment. As soon as 18 h after plating, labeling of the cells with an iodinated α-scorpion toxin, a ligand of brain sodium channels, decorates only the axon with a much increased density at the axon initial segment (31Alessandri-Haber N. Paillart C. Arsac C. Gola M. Couraud F. Crest M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 203-214Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This pattern of labeling does not change qualitatively during subsequent days in culture and is identical to that observed by immunofluorescence with the pan-anti-α antibody at 6 days in vitro. Cells at this age express transcripts for the Nav1.3 α subunit and, to a lesser extent, the Nav1.2 α subunit isoforms (32Alessandri-Haber N. Alcaraz G. Deleuze C. Jullien F. Manrique C. Couraud F. Crest M. Giraud P. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These sodium channels are already functional; a rapidly activating sodium current is present at 18 h in culture, and the cells are able to fire action potentials as early as 3 days in vitro (31Alessandri-Haber N. Paillart C. Arsac C. Gola M. Couraud F. Crest M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 203-214Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our immunofluorescence experiments show that AnkG node and sodium channel are colocalized at 6 days in vitro. The region that contains the major interaction site with ankyrin displays 63% identity and 84% homology between the Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 isoforms, and it is thus probable that Nav1.3 interacts with the ankyrin repeats through the same site. Actually, AnkG node should already be present when membrane sodium channels are detected, since targeted cerebellar knockout of the Ank3 gene prevents the expression of sodium channel clusters at axon initial segments (37Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).A somewhat different situation might prevail at nodes of Ranvier. The formation of mature nodes proceeds postnatally through an extended time scale and is even delayed in the central nervous system as compared with the peripheral nervous system (38Rasband M.N. Peles E. Trimmer J.S. Levinson S.R. Lux S.E. Shrager P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7516-7528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental studies have shown that formation of nodes of Ranvier involves the formation of NrCAM/neurofascin-positive clusters to which AnkG node and sodium channels are later recruited (39Lambert S. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7025-7036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the nodes takes place by coalescence of AnkG node/Ank-binding protein paired clusters, the distal borders of which are limited by the edges of myelinating glial cell processes (34Vabnick I. Novakovic S.D. Levinson S.R. Schachner M. Shrager P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4914-4922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rasband M.N. Peles E. Trimmer J.S. Levinson S.R. Lux S.E. Shrager P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7516-7528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nav1.2 isoform is expressed first at nodes and is replaced later by the Nav1.6 isoform, whereas there is no evidence that the Nav1.3 isoform is nodally expressed even at early stages (40Boiko T. Rasband M.N. Levinson S.R. Caldwell J.H. Mandel G. Trimmer J.S. Matthews G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 91-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 41Kaplan M.R. Cho M.H.

Finally, in a cultured retinal ganglion cell system where oligodendrocyte-induced clustering of sodium channels is thought to mimic the early stages of the formation of nodes of Ranvier, the expression and clustering of surface β2subunit together with the Nav1.2 isoform occurs in the absence of surface β1 subunit (41Kaplan M.R.

A splice variant of the β1 subunit has been described (42Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Ragsdale D.S. D'Andrea M.R. Mattei L.N. Rogers K.E. Isom L.L. J. Biol.

Because the function of rab proteins in the biosynthetic pathway does not appear to depend on cycling between membranes and cytosol, we were interested to investigate whether or not this holds true for rab function in the endocytic pathway. We created a chimeric rab4 protein (NHrab4cbvn) in which the carboxyl-terminal prenylation motif was replaced by the transmembrane domain of cellubrevin. The chimeric protein was permanently attached to membranes, properly targeted to early endosomes, and bound guanine nucleotide to the same extent as wild type rab4. However, in transport assays we found that basolaterally endocytosed transferrin was less efficiently transported to the apical cell surface in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with NHrab4cbvn than in cells expressing wild type rab4. Hence, rab4 function requires ongoing cycles of association and dissociation from early endosomes. This cycle is altered during mitosis when rab4 accumulates in the cytoplasm through phosphorylation by a mitotic kinase.

The active GTP-bound form of rab proteins associates with multiple other proteins, which may serve to relay the GTPase switch to effector systems such as SNARE1 complexes involved in membrane docking and fusion (see Refs. 1Zerial M.

It is thought that rab proteins may work as timers whose set point is determined by the relative rates of GTP hydrolysis and GDP exchange (7Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I.

Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). rab GTPases cycle on and off membranes through the activity of a protein known as GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). GDI extracts the GDP form of rab proteins from membrane, shields their lipophilic carboxyl terminus from the aqueous cytoplasm, and can present complexed rab protein again to a donor membrane for a new activity cycle (see Ref. 8Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The significance of a membrane to cytoplasm cycle for rab activity in the biosynthetic pathway has been called into question recently. Evidence for this notion derives from studies with Ypt1p chimeras in which the hydrophobic tails of the v-SNAREs Sec22p and Snc2p replaced the Ypt1p carboxyl terminus. These chimeric proteins appear to be correctly targeted and retain the function of Ypt1p in the biosynthetic pathway (9Ossig R. Laufer W. Schmitt H.D. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although they are resistant to GDI extraction (10Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).We have been investigating the role of rab4 in transport through the early endocytic pathway. rab4 regulates recycling from early endosomes (11van der Sluijs P.

Klumperman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4163-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). rab4 is phosphorylated on Ser-196 during mitosis (16Bailly E. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Goud B. Bornens M. Nature. 1991; 350: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This increases the cytoplasmic pool ∼5–10-fold, possibly due to the interaction with the mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 (18Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z., Lu, K.P. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these phosphorylated rab4 molecules are in the GTP form. Because the cytoplasmic pool of rab proteins is thought to be in the GDP-bound form, this suggests that the additional rab4 molecules in the cytoplasm of mitotic cells are dissociated from early endosomes. Perturbation of the normal rab4 cycle by phosphorylation of either the cytoplasmic or membrane-bound pools may result in an increased cytoplasmic steady-state localization during mitosis. Hence, it has been difficult to establish whether membrane-bound rab4 is a target for mitotic kinases. To address this question, and to investigate whether membrane transport through early endosomes depends on cycles of rab4 dissociation and association with early endosomes, we constructed NHrab4cbvn in which we replaced the carboxyl-terminal Cys-Gly-Cys motif of rab4 with the transmembrane domain of cellubrevin, an endosomal v-SNARE. We found that NHrab4cbvn was fixed permanently on endosomal membranes and did not support rab4 function in membrane transport. The chimeric protein was phosphorylated during mitosis, showing that membrane-bound rab4 is targeted by mitotic kinases.DISCUSSIONProtein phosphorylation plays a key role in the regulation of membrane transport and organelle inheritance during the mammalian cell cycle. Intracellular transport is coordinately inhibited in dividing cells, and organelle fragmentation is thought to occur due to ongoing transport vesicle formation while membrane fusion is inhibited. The molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of membrane transport during mitosis are only partially understood. rab4 regulates membrane transport through early endosomes and is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase (11van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 17van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus rab4 is likely to be one of the targets for the inhibition of endocytic transport. Indeed, although rab4 is associated with endosomes in interphase, during mitosis it is localized to the cytoplasm in a complex with the peptidyl prolylisomerase Pin1 and presumably unable to perform its endosomal function (18Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z., Lu, K.P. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Why phosphorylated rab4 is localized to the cytoplasm is not clear. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic rab4 pool might inhibit its recruitment to endosomes. Alternatively, phosphorylation of membrane-bound rab4 may enhance its dissociation into the cytoplasm. Both scenarios or a combination thereof will result in the depletion of rab4 from early endosomes and the build-up of a cytoplasmic pool of rab4 molecules. A rab4 truncation mutant that is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm does become phosphorylated during mitosis, which is consistent with a model in which phosphorylated cytoplasmic rab4 molecules fail to be recruited to endosomes (17van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Informative as it is, this result cannot be used as evidence against the second model, because it is not known whether the endosomal pool of rab4 might be targeted by a mitotic kinase.We addressed this question in expression experiments with an rab4 construct that was permanently attached to early endosomes, because its consensus sequence for carboxyl-terminal isoprenylation was replaced by the transmembrane domain of the endosomal v-SNARE, cellubrevin. The chimeric protein was membrane-associated in both interphase and mitotic cells. During mitosis NHrab4cbvn was phosphorylated, showing for the first time that phosphorylation of rab4 can also occur on membranes. This also explains the previous finding that phosphorylated cytoplasmic rab4 is in the GTP-bound form (18Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z., Lu, K.P. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because rab4 guanine nucleotide exchange activity remains membrane-associated during mitosis (32Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4497-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), enhanced dissociation of phosphorylated rab4-GTP from endosomes increases the number of cytoplasmic rab4 molecules in the GTP-bound form.GTP hydrolysis on rab proteins was initially thought to be required for membrane docking and fusion or recycling of the GDP-bound form back to the donor organelle (39Bourne H.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 669-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). More recent experiments with Ypt1p and Sec4p that were permanently attached to membranes have called this concept into question (9Ossig R. Laufer W. Schmitt H.D. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These mutants appeared to be targeted to the correct membranes and reportedly retained the capacity to maintain vesicular transport through the biosynthetic pathway. In contrast to these rab proteins that act between the ER and the plasma membrane, our recycling experiments in MDCK cells, however, showed that NHrab4cbvn cannot substitute for wild type rab4.Because rab proteins are important for tethering of transport vesicles to their target membrane (see Ref. 40Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for their formation at the donor compartment (13de Wit H. Lichtenstein Y. Kelly R.B. Geuze H.J. Klumperman J. van der Sluijs P. Mol.

Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), a salvage pathway is required to recycle rab proteins from the acceptor membrane. GDI-mediated extraction followed by cytosolic transfer of a rab·rab GDI complex back to the donor or transport vesicle is an attractive mechanism that is supported by experimental evidence, although it is also possible that retrieval to the donor membrane may occur via a retrograde transport pathway. The observation, that NHrab4cbvn permanently resides on membranes and has an inhibitory phenotype in the transport assay, suggests that a cycle of rab4 between membrane and cytosol is important for its function in membrane recycling from early endosomes. It is unlikely that retrieval of NHrab4cbvn to early endosomes proceeds via the cell surface and endocytosis, because immunoelectron microscopy shows that neither rab4 (13de Wit H. Lichtenstein Y.

Klumperman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4163-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) nor NHrab4cbvn localize to the plasma membrane.Why would rab4 behave differently in this respect than do Ypt1p and Sec4p? At least two explanations can be put forward to account for this disparity. First, even though the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways are regulated by members of conserved protein families, there appear to be clear differences. For instance, deletion of the YPT1 orSEC4 genes in yeast is lethal (44Segev N. Mullholland J. Botstein D. Cell. 1988; 52: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 45Salminen A. Novick P.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), whereas knockout strains of YPT5, whose product regulates the endocytic pathway, are viable (46Horazdovski B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Second, because rab GTPases exert their functions in membrane transport through multiple effector proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar), this may simply indicate that there is not necessarily a common principle by which rab proteins control membrane traffic. An example of this idea is provided by rab27a, which in melanocytes cooperates with myosin Va (6Wu X. Rao K. Bowers M.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. J.

These are rabaptin-4 (49Nagelkerken B. van Anken E. van Raak M. Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Uden N. Holthuizen J. Pelkmans L. van der Sluijs P. Biochem.

Clearly a further understanding of membrane recycling via early endosomes requires the identification and characterization of additional rab4 effector and accessory proteins. Small GTPases of the rab family are key regulators of vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells. More than 60 rab proteins have been identified, many of which are localized to intracellular organelles of the central vacuolar system (see Refs. 1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar and 2Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The active GTP-bound form of rab proteins associates with multiple other proteins, which may serve to relay the GTPase switch to effector systems such as SNARE1 complexes involved in membrane docking and fusion (see Refs. 1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar and 3Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that rab proteins may work as timers whose set point is determined by the relative rates of GTP hydrolysis and GDP exchange (7Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). rab GTPases cycle on and off membranes through the activity of a protein known as GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). GDI extracts the GDP form of rab proteins from membrane, shields their lipophilic carboxyl terminus from the aqueous cytoplasm, and can present complexed rab protein again to a donor membrane for a new activity cycle (see Ref. 8Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The significance of a membrane to cytoplasm cycle for rab activity in the biosynthetic pathway has been called into question recently. Evidence for this notion derives from studies with Ypt1p chimeras in which the hydrophobic tails of the v-SNAREs Sec22p and Snc2p replaced the Ypt1p carboxyl terminus. These chimeric proteins appear to be correctly targeted and retain the function of Ypt1p in the biosynthetic pathway (9Ossig R. Laufer W. Schmitt H.D. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although they are resistant to GDI extraction (10Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have been investigating the role of rab4 in transport through the early endocytic pathway. rab4 regulates recycling from early endosomes (11van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Goud B. Mellman I.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3703-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is localized to vacuolar and tubular subdomains of early endocytic compartments and transport vesicles but not to the plasma membrane (13de Wit H.

Klumperman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4163-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). rab4 is phosphorylated on Ser-196 during mitosis (16Bailly E. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Goud B. Bornens M. Nature. 1991; 350: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This increases the cytoplasmic pool ∼5–10-fold, possibly due to the interaction with the mitotic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 (18Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z., Lu, K.P. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these phosphorylated rab4 molecules are in the GTP form. Because the cytoplasmic pool of rab proteins is thought to be in the GDP-bound form, this suggests that the additional rab4 molecules in the cytoplasm of mitotic cells are dissociated from early endosomes. Perturbation of the normal rab4 cycle by phosphorylation of either the cytoplasmic or membrane-bound pools may result in an increased cytoplasmic steady-state localization during mitosis. Hence, it has been difficult to establish whether membrane-bound rab4 is a target for mitotic kinases. To address this question, and to investigate whether membrane transport through early endosomes depends on cycles of rab4 dissociation and association with early endosomes, we constructed NHrab4cbvn in which we replaced the carboxyl-terminal Cys-Gly-Cys motif of rab4 with the transmembrane domain of cellubrevin, an endosomal v-SNARE. We found that NHrab4cbvn was fixed permanently on endosomal membranes and did not support rab4 function in membrane transport. The chimeric protein was phosphorylated during mitosis, showing that membrane-bound rab4 is targeted by mitotic kinases. DISCUSSIONProtein phosphorylation plays a key role in the regulation of membrane transport and organelle inheritance during the mammalian cell cycle. Intracellular transport is coordinately inhibited in dividing cells, and organelle fragmentation is thought to occur due to ongoing transport vesicle formation while membrane fusion is inhibited. The molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of membrane transport during mitosis are only partially understood. rab4 regulates membrane transport through early endosomes and is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase (11van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 17van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus rab4 is likely to be one of the targets for the inhibition of endocytic transport. Indeed, although rab4 is associated with endosomes in interphase, during mitosis it is localized to the cytoplasm in a complex with the peptidyl prolylisomerase Pin1 and presumably unable to perform its endosomal function (18Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z., Lu, K.P. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Why phosphorylated rab4 is localized to the cytoplasm is not clear. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic rab4 pool might inhibit its recruitment to endosomes. Alternatively, phosphorylation of membrane-bound rab4 may enhance its dissociation into the cytoplasm. Both scenarios or a combination thereof will result in the depletion of rab4 from early endosomes and the build-up of a cytoplasmic pool of rab4 molecules. A rab4 truncation mutant that is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm does become phosphorylated during mitosis, which is consistent with a model in which phosphorylated cytoplasmic rab4 molecules fail to be recruited to endosomes (17van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Informative as it is, this result cannot be used as evidence against the second model, because it is not known whether the endosomal pool of rab4 might be targeted by a mitotic kinase.We addressed this question in expression experiments with an rab4 construct that was permanently attached to early endosomes, because its consensus sequence for carboxyl-terminal isoprenylation was replaced by the transmembrane domain of the endosomal v-SNARE, cellubrevin. The chimeric protein was membrane-associated in both interphase and mitotic cells. During mitosis NHrab4cbvn was phosphorylated, showing for the first time that phosphorylation of rab4 can also occur on membranes. This also explains the previous finding that phosphorylated cytoplasmic rab4 is in the GTP-bound form (18Gerez L. Mohrmann K. van Raak M. Jongeneelen M. Zhou X.Z., Lu, K.P. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because rab4 guanine nucleotide exchange activity remains membrane-associated during mitosis (32Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4497-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), enhanced dissociation of phosphorylated rab4-GTP from endosomes increases the number of cytoplasmic rab4 molecules in the GTP-bound form.GTP hydrolysis on rab proteins was initially thought to be required for membrane docking and fusion or recycling of the GDP-bound form back to the donor organelle (39Bourne H.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 669-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). More recent experiments with Ypt1p and Sec4p that were permanently attached to membranes have called this concept into question (9Ossig R. Laufer W. Schmitt H.D. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These mutants appeared to be targeted to the correct membranes and reportedly retained the capacity to maintain vesicular transport through the biosynthetic pathway. In contrast to these rab proteins that act between the ER and the plasma membrane, our recycling experiments in MDCK cells, however, showed that NHrab4cbvn cannot substitute for wild type rab4.Because rab proteins are important for tethering of transport vesicles to their target membrane (see Ref. 40Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1-3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for their formation at the donor compartment (13de Wit H. Lichtenstein Y. Kelly R.B. Geuze H.J. Klumperman J. van der Sluijs P. Mol.

Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), a salvage pathway is required to recycle rab proteins from the acceptor membrane. GDI-mediated extraction followed by cytosolic transfer of a rab·rab GDI complex back to the donor or transport vesicle is an attractive mechanism that is supported by experimental evidence, although it is also possible that retrieval to the donor membrane may occur via a retrograde transport pathway. The observation, that NHrab4cbvn permanently resides on membranes and has an inhibitory phenotype in the transport assay, suggests that a cycle of rab4 between membrane and cytosol is important for its function in membrane recycling from early endosomes. It is unlikely that retrieval of NHrab4cbvn to early endosomes proceeds via the cell surface and endocytosis, because immunoelectron microscopy shows that neither rab4 (13de Wit H. Lichtenstein Y.

At least two explanations can be put forward to account for this disparity. First, even though the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways are regulated by members of conserved protein families, there appear to be clear differences. For instance, deletion of the YPT1 orSEC4 genes in yeast is lethal (44Segev N. Mullholland J. Botstein D.

https://openalex.org/W1970630868,"Phosphagen kinase systems provide different advantages to tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands, in particular an efficient energy buffering system. In this study we show for the first time functional expression of two phosphagen kinase systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not normally contain such systems. First, to establish the creatine kinase system, in addition to overexpressing creatine kinase isoenzymes, we had to install the biosynthesis pathway of creatine by co-overexpression of l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase. Although we could achieve considerable creatine kinase activity, together with more than 3 mm intracellular creatine, this was not sufficient to confer an obvious advantage to the yeast under the specific stress conditions examined here. Second, using arginine kinase, we successfully installed an intracellular phosphagen pool of about 5 mm phosphoarginine. Such arginine kinase-expressing yeast showed improved resistance under two stress challenges that drain cellular energy, which were transient pH reduction and starvation. Although transient starvation led to 50% reduced intracellular ATP concentrations in wild-type yeast, arginine kinase overexpression stabilized the ATP pool at the pre-stress level. Thus, our results demonstrate that temporal energy buffering is an intrinsic property of phosphagen kinases that can be transferred to phylogenetically very distant organisms. Phosphagen kinase systems provide different advantages to tissues with high and fluctuating energy demands, in particular an efficient energy buffering system. In this study we show for the first time functional expression of two phosphagen kinase systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not normally contain such systems. First, to establish the creatine kinase system, in addition to overexpressing creatine kinase isoenzymes, we had to install the biosynthesis pathway of creatine by co-overexpression of l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase. Although we could achieve considerable creatine kinase activity, together with more than 3 mm intracellular creatine, this was not sufficient to confer an obvious advantage to the yeast under the specific stress conditions examined here. Second, using arginine kinase, we successfully installed an intracellular phosphagen pool of about 5 mm phosphoarginine. Such arginine kinase-expressing yeast showed improved resistance under two stress challenges that drain cellular energy, which were transient pH reduction and starvation. Although transient starvation led to 50% reduced intracellular ATP concentrations in wild-type yeast, arginine kinase overexpression stabilized the ATP pool at the pre-stress level. Thus, our results demonstrate that temporal energy buffering is an intrinsic property of phosphagen kinases that can be transferred to phylogenetically very distant organisms. creatine kinase arginine kinase cell dry weight creatine dilution rate mitochondrial phosphoarginine phosphocreatine CO2 evolution rate l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase guanidinoacetate methyltransferase The availability of biochemical energy, with ATP as the primary energy currency, is fundamental to most cellular processes. Although ATP and its congeners are involved in literally hundreds of biochemical reactions, the intracellular concentration of ATP is generally kept very constant at about 2–5 mm, depending on organisms and tissues, with a turnover rate of the ATP pool that is in the range of a few seconds (1Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York1975: 336Google Scholar). Hence, metabolic ATP generation in a cell must be balanced tightly with ATP-consuming processes. Small deviations from the standard cellular concentrations of free ATP, ADP, and AMP serve important regulatory roles in fine tuning this delicate balance. This balance between energy-consuming and -producing processes is particularly challenged in tissues that experience periods of high and fluctuating energy demand, such as brain, heart, or skeletal muscle. To maintain constant ATP levels, these tissues express creatine kinase (CK1; EC 2.7.3.2) that uses creatine (Cr) to create a metabolically inert pool of phosphocreatine (PCr). Among other functions, this PCr pool serves as a temporal energy buffer that can replenish ATP rapidly during phases of high energy demand, according to the following reaction (2Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar): MgADP− + PCr2− + H+ ⇄ MgATP2− + Cr. The CK system is found in many vertebrate tissues and is probably the best known example of what is more generally referred to as the phosphagen kinase system (3Ellington W.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The common feature of these kinases is their capability to synthesize a metabolically inert pool of phosphorylated compounds (phosphagens) during normal metabolic conditions and to replenish the ATP from this pool during periods of high energetic demand. Eight phosphagen kinases are found in the animal kingdom (3Ellington W.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), with arginine kinase (AK; EC 2.7.3.3) as a prominent example, occurring in insects (4Grieshaber M.K. Hardewig I. Kreutzer U. Portner H.O. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 125: 43-147PubMed Google Scholar), crustaceans (5Wyss M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1107-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar), and in certain unicellular organisms (6Pereira C.A. Alonso G.D. Paveto M.C. Iribarren A. Cabanas M.L. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1495-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In analogy to CK, AK catalyzes the following reaction: MgADP− + PArg2− + H+⇄ MgATP2− + Arg. In addition to their supposedly primary role as temporal energy buffer, phosphagen kinase systems serve a number of other functions, which include buffering of the intracellular pH and preventing a rise in intracellular ADP levels that would trigger multiple metabolic responses (2Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 3Ellington W.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In addition to the above general functions, the CK/PCr system has the unique capability to establish a spatial energy buffering, as well (2Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 3Ellington W.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 7Greenhaff P.L. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 657Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This complex functionality is also reflected by oligomeric composition and compartmentalization of the CK isoforms, with cytosolic isoenzymes (B-CK, M-CK) forming dimers and mitochondrial isoenzymes (sMtCK, uMtCK) forming dimers and octamers (8Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stochowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, expression of CK in the naturally CK-deficient liver led to multiple, beneficial effects for this organ, including tolerance to hypoxia and endotoxins (9Miller K. Halow J. Koretsky A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1544-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hatano E. Tanaka A. Iwata S. Satoh S. Kitai T. Tsunekawa S. Inomoto T. Shinohara H. Chance B. Yamaoka Y. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 663-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although microorganisms are often exposed to rapidly changing environmental conditions and fluctuating availability of energy, phosphagen kinase systems occur only in few unicellular organisms, e.g. Paramecium caudatumand Trypanosoma cruzi (6Pereira C.A. Alonso G.D. Paveto M.C. Iribarren A. Cabanas M.L. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1495-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Noguchi M. Sawada T. Akazawa T. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1063-1071PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that lower unicellular eukaryotes, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, would potentially benefit if artificially equipped with such phosphagen kinase systems. In particular for S. cerevisiae, intracellular acidification is a well known consequence of various environmental stresses, including exposure to weak acids and copper (12Fernandes A.R. Sa-Correia I. Yeast. 2001; 18: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Viegas C.A. Almeida P.F. Cavaco M. Sa-Correia I. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 779-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Holyoak C.D. Stratford M. McMullin Z. Cole M.B. Crimmins K. Brown A.J. Coote P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3158-3164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also as a secondary effect of stress challenges like desiccation and heat (15Attfield P.V. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 16Panaretou B. Piper P.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1763-1770Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Acidification is counteracted by a greatly increased activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which expels protons from the cytoplasm at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (14Holyoak C.D. Stratford M. McMullin Z. Cole M.B. Crimmins K. Brown A.J. Coote P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3158-3164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The energetic expense for this proton pumping activity may require up to 60% of the total ATP production (17Serrano R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1984; 23: 87-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), thus constituting an ATP drain similar to muscle contraction. Likewise starvation and several other stress challenges are known to exert high ATP demands (18Hamilton C.A. Good A.G. Taylor G.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 231-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we attempted to install phosphagen kinase systems in lower eukaryotes, thereby addressing the hypothesis that functional expression of such phosphagen kinases could potentially improve resistance to those stress challenges that constitute a significant energetic burden. This work is also a first step toward a more detailed investigation on molecular functions and mechanisms of the phosphagen kinase systems in a biological background that is free of endogenous phosphagen kinases and that can be genetically manipulated easily. S. cerevisiaeCEN.PK 113–7D (MATa) was used for Cr adaptation experiments. All other experiments were performed with strain CEN.PK 113–6B (MATaura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–289). Construction of expression plasmids was done in Escherichia coli DH5α (F−/endA1 hsdR17(rk-mk+)glnV44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA(Nalr) relA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR (φ80dlacΔ(lacZ)M15)). The plasmids p424HXT7 (TRP1), p425HXT7 (LEU2), and p426HXT7 (URA3) were used for heterologous gene expression. Constitutive expression is driven from the truncated promoter of the high affinity glucose transporter gene HXT7 and is terminated by the CYC1 terminator (19Hauf J. Transcriptional Regulation of the PDC1 Gene and Overexpression Studies of Seven Glycolytic Enzymes in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph.D. thesis. Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany1998Google Scholar, 20Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). All physiological experiments were done in yeast minimal medium containing 0.85 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.15 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.5 g/liter MgSO4, 0.1 g/liter NaCl, 0.1 g/liter CaCl2, 500 μg/liter H3BO3, 63 μg/liter CuSO4·5H2O, 100 μg/liter KI, 200 μg/liter FeCl3, 450 μg/liter MnSO4·H2O, 235 μg/liter Na2MoO4·2H2O, 712 μg/liter ZnSO4·7H2O, 20 μg/liter biotin, 2 mg/liter calcium pantothenate, 2 μg/liter folic acid, 10 mg/liter inositol, 0.4 mg/liter nicotinic acid, 0.2 mg/literp-aminobenzoic acid, 0.4 mg/liter pyridoxine hydrochloride, 0.2 mg/liter riboflavin, and 0.4 mg/liter thiamin hydrochloride. If not specified otherwise, the medium was also supplemented with 5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4 and 5 g/liter glucose as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Uracil (20 mg/liter), tryptophane (50 mg/liter), or leucine (240 mg/liter) were added, if necessary. Aerobic batch cultivations were performed in 500-ml baffled shake flasks with maximally 50 ml of medium at 30 °C on a gyratory shaker at 300 rpm. Cr adaptation experiments were performed by growing S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113–7D for up to 100 generations in consecutive 3-ml batch cultures at 30 °C and 300 rpm. Two types of carbon and nitrogen source combinations were used, with 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 33 mm Cr, and 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate or 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.1% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and 22.5 mm Cr, respectively. As positive and negative control, cultures with combinations of 0 or 0.5% (w/v) glucose, as well as 0 or 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, were also used. After 24 h, the next batch culture was inoculated with 1.5% (v/v) in fresh medium, and the intracellular Cr concentration was measured. To detect metabolism of Cr, 3-ml yeast minimal medium cultures were grown for up to 6 days at 30 °C and 300 rpm, with 40 mm Cr (as the sole carbon source) and 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate or 0.5% glucose (w/v) and 28 mm Cr (as the sole ammonium source). Transient pH stress experiments were performed in 10-ml culture tubes with 3 ml of medium at 30 °C on a gyratory shaker at 300 rpm. Cultures were grown to an OD600 of about 0.5, before the pH was set to 2 with 10% (v/v) H3PO4. After 1 h, pH 5 was re-established using 100 mm KOH. The recovery time was determined as the period required to reach a growth rate of at least 0.1 h−1 after re-establishing pH 5. Starvation stress experiments were performed in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a dilution rate of 0.1 h−1. The culture volume was kept constant at 1 liter using a weight-controlled pump, and the pH was controlled at 5.0 by the addition of 2m KOH. The airflow was kept constant at 1.0 liter/min, and the agitation speed was adjusted to 1′000 rpm. The temperature was kept constant at 30 °C. Oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration in the culture effluent gas were determined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Fisons Prima 600; Fisons, Oxbridge, United Kingdom). After cultures reached a stable steady state, defined as at least 5 volume changes with constant O2, CO2, and OD600 readings, the medium feed pump was programmed so that the feed was interrupted for 150 s and initiated for 30 s. These 180-s cycles were maintained until a new steady state was achieved, usually within 5 volume changes. For determination of intracellular metabolite concentrations, aliquots were withdrawn at least 30 s after the feeding was interrupted and before it was started again. pBCK was constructed by PCR amplification of the chicken B-CK gene from plasmid pT23–1 2M.

The resultingSpeI/EcoRI fragment was then cloned into p424HXT7. pMtCK was constructed by PCR amplification of the chicken sarcomeric MtCK gene with a cytochrome c1pre-sequence added as in-frame fusion for mitochondrial targeting from plasmid pFG8 3R. Furter (deceased) and T. Wallimann, unpublished data. with the primers 5′-GACTAGTATGTTTTCAAATCTATCTAA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTTCCTGCCAAACT-3′. The resultingSpeI/XhoI fragment was then cloned into p426HXT7. pAGAT was constructed by PCR amplification of thel-arginine-glycine amidinotransferase gene from pig (21Humm A. Huber R. Mann K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) from plasmid pBS/SK−−:RGAT-7 with the primers 5′CGCGGATCCATGCTGCGGGTGC-3′ and 5′-CGCGAATTCTCAGTCCAAGTAGGAC-3′. The resulting BamHI/EcoRI fragment was then cloned into p425HXT7. pGAMT was constructed by PCR amplification of the human guanidino acetate methyltransferase gene (22Isbrandt D. von Figura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 264-267Google Scholar) from pGEM-T-4-hGAMT-7 with the primers 5′-CGCACTAGTATGAGCGCCCCCA-3′ and 5′-CGCGAATTCTCAGCCTTTGGTCAC-3′. The resultingSpeI/EcoRI fragment was cloned into p426HXT7. pAK was constructed by PCR amplification of the Limulus polyphemus AK gene (23Strong S.J. Ellington W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) from plasmid pET-22b(+):AK with the primers 5′-GGAATTCATGGTGGACCAGGCAACATTG-3′ and 5′-TGCGGTCGACTTAGGCAGCAGCCTTTTCCATC-3′. The resultingEcoRI/SalI fragment was cloned into p424HXT7. Plasmids were transformed in S. cerevisiae using the S.c. EasyComp kit (Invitrogen). Cell growth was monitored by the increase in OD600. Crude cell extracts for determination of intracellular metabolite concentrations were prepared by washing cells in 4 packed cell volumes of cold water and resuspending in 2 packed cell volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m(NH4)2SO4, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at 0 °C. Four packed cell volumes of ice-cold, acid-washed 0.45–0.55-mm glass beads were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 1 min and incubated for 2 min on ice. This procedure was repeated up to 10 times until complete disruption, as was verified by microscopic control. The liquid phase was centrifuged for 60 min at 12′000 × g and 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C for further analysis. For determination of protein activity, samples were analyzed within a week. CK and AK activity were determined using pH-stat analysis (24Milner-White E.J. Watts D.C. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Wallimann T. Schlösser T. Eppenberger H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5238-5246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, crude cell extracts were incubated at pH 7.0 and 25 °C with 6.3 mmKCl, 8.3 mm MgCl2, 83 μm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm ADP, and 10 mm of either PCr (CK) or PArg (AK), and the rate of stoichiometric proton consumption by conversion of PCr and ADP to Cr and ATP was monitored by titration. Cr concentrations in supernatants and crude cell extracts were determined with the above pH-stat analysis by incubating cell extracts at pH 8.0 and 25 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere in a buffer containing 63 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 83 μm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm ADP, and 0.1 units/ml rabbit B-CK. Calibration was done with Cr concentrations between 1 and 20 mm. For Cr measurement, cells were washed three to five times with water prior to crude cell extract preparation. Arg concentrations were determined enzymatically by adding 200 mm triethanolamine, 12 mm α-ketoglutarate, 130 μm NADH, 2 mm ADP, 1.3 units/ml glutamate dehydrogenase, 10 units/ml urease, and 6 units/ml arginase to crude cell extracts and monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm (26Mira de Orduna R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PArg concentrations were determined as described previously (11Noguchi M. Sawada T. Akazawa T. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1063-1071PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-maleate, pH 7.0, and disrupted by boiling for 1 min at 95 °C with 0.6% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. This boiling step was necessary, because incubation at lower temperatures did not result in complete disruption of the yeast cells (data not shown). Stability of PArg during this treatment was experimentally verified. Although acid incubation at 95 °C for 2 min lead to significant hydrolysis of PArg, PArg concentrations after a 1-min incubation at 95 °C were within 10% of those found after incubation at 0 °C. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube, and the pH was set to 8.2. To precipitate adenyl nucleotides, 1.5% (w/v) barium acetate was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight on ice. The supernatant was supplemented with 100 μm Na2SO4and centrifuged for 5 min at 13′000 rpm to remove residual barium ions. Trichloroacetic acid was added to 2.3% (v/v) to the clarified supernatant, and samples were hydrolyzed for 1 min at 100 °C. The liberated organic phosphate was determined colorimetrically at 623 nm after addition of 1.5% (v/v) H2SO4, 10 mm Na2MoO4, and 10% (v/v) of a color reagent containing 10 g/liter polyvinyl alcohol and 185 mg/liter malachite green. Intracellular ATP and ADP concentrations were determined as described previously (27Tran Q.H. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Emmerling M. Bailey J.E. Sauer U. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 67: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-ml culture samples were quickly withdrawn (within 1 s) on acid-washed glass beads that were pre-cooled at −20 °C. 50-μl aliquots of culture broth were supplemented with 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and 750 μl of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.75. Aliquots were then frozen at −70 °C for further analysis. ATP concentrations were determined using an ATP bioluminescence kit HS II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). ADP was converted to ATP by incubating another aliquot for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 1,250 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and the total ATP level was then determined. ADP concentration were calculated as the difference between total ATP and the ATP level in the other aliquot. Calibration was done with ATP and ATP/ADP mixtures, in the concentration range of 1 and 1,000 nm. Intracellular metabolite concentrations were calculated from the experimentally determined concentration using a cellular volume of 1.162·10−11 ml and a concentration of 108cells/ml at an OD600 of 1.5 (29Winge Ö. Roberts C. Cook H. The Chemistry and Biology of Yeast. Academic Press, New York1958: 115Google Scholar). In batch cultures, the exponential growth phase was identified by log-linear regression of OD600versus time, with maximal growth rate (μmax) as the regression coefficient. To calculate specific production rates, OD600 values were converted to cellular dry weight (cdw) using a predetermined correlation factor (0.52 g/liter cdw per OD600 unit). The biomass concentration was calculated as cdw per volume unit. The CO2 evolution rate (CER) was defined as the relative CO2 production (ΔCO2) multiplied by the effluent gas flow rate (F), on the basis of the relationship CER = ΔCO2 · F. The specific production rate for CO2 (qCO2) was calculated by dividing the CER by the biomass concentration (X) and the culture volume (V), on the basis of the relationship qCO2 = CER/(X· V). To establish a functional CK system in S. cerevisiae (Fig.1), we first overexpressed the cytosolic brain-type isoenzyme (B-CK) and/or the ubiquitous mitochondrial isoenzyme (uMtCK). Transformants exhibited CK activity of 0.5–0.9 international units/mg protein (Fig. 2), corresponding to the CK activity found in many chicken tissues (30Saks V.A. Khuchua Z.A. Vasilyeva E.V., Yu Belikova O. Kuznetsov A.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 155-192Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Based on a previous report (31Brindle K. Braddock P. Fulton S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2395-3302Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32(NCBI), N. C. f. B.

Biochem. 2001; 224: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and the National Center for Biotechnology Information website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). During growth in yeast minimal medium supplemented with 10 mm Cr, however, neither CK-expressing nor control yeast accumulated any appreciable amounts of intracellular Cr (data not shown).FIG. 2Specific creatine kinase activity in different CK-engineered yeast strains. Enzymatic activity was determined in crude cell extracts harvested from stationary phase ofS. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113–6B (control) and transformed yeast strains grown on yeast minimal medium with 0.5% glucose. The cytosolic brain-type isoform (as pBCK), as well as the mitochondrial sarcomeric isoform (as pMtCK), of CK are expressed alone, in combination, or together with the Cr synthesis genes pAGAT and pGAMT. Control with the Cr synthesis genes alone is also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To activate potential unspecific Cr transport systems or silent genes (34Sauer U. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2001; 73: 129-169PubMed Google Scholar) that may facilitate some Cr uptake, we attempted to adapt S. cerevisiae to Cr consumption. Specifically, we grew S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113–7D in successive batches with Cr as additional carbon or nitrogen source, in combination with glucose or ammonium, respectively. In no case, however, did we detect intracellular Cr (data not shown) or any growth in cultures with Cr as the unique carbon or nitrogen source. To provide intracellular Cr to CK-expressing S. cerevisiae, we installed the biosynthetic pathway for Cr that naturally does not occur in yeast (Ref. 33Snow R.J. Murphy R.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 224: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and the National Center for Biotechnology Information website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Expression of humanl-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and rat guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) yielded an intracellular concentration of about 3.2 mm Cr (Table I), presumably resulting from utilization of endogenous glycine and Arg. The minor concentration of Cr detected in cells expressing only AGAT is probably because of the accumulation of guanidinoacetate, which, at high concentrations, is also detected by the Cr assay (data not shown).Table IIntracellular creatine concentrationsStrainIntracellular Cr concentrationmmControl0.0 ± 0.0pBCK0.0 ± 0.0pAGAT0.12 ± 0.2pGAMT0.0 ± 0.0pAGAT pGAMT3.2 ± 0.2pAGAT pGAMT pBCK3.3 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab S. cerevisiae displays the endogenous capability for Arg biosynthesis and transport (35Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, functional establishment of an AK system should depend solely on heterologous expression of AK, which is not naturally present in yeast (5Wyss M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1107-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). Independent of the amount of exogenously supplied Arg, AK activities in crude extracts of cells harboring pAK were 3.7 international units/mg, whereas control cultures did not exhibit any AK activity (data not shown). To exclude that Arg became limiting in our system, we determined intracellular Arg concentration in cultures grown at different extracellular Arg concentrations. Increasing extracellular Arg supplementation up to 6 mm was reflected by increasing intracellular Arg concentrations. At concentration exceeding 6 mm, however, no further increase of intracellular Arg was observed (Fig. 3). In this respect, an essentially identical behavior was observed for control and AK-expressing strains. Although intracellular PArg concentrations were below detection level in the control strain, AK-expressing strains exhibited intracellular PArg concentrations of about 5 mmat all investigated extracellular Arg concentrations (data not shown), whereas intracellular Arg concentrations in these AK-expressing strains were similar to those seen in controls (Fig. 3). We grew S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113–6B expressing either AK (pAK and 10 mm Arg supplementation in the medium) or the complete CK system (pBCK, pAGAT, and pGAMT) on yeast minimal medium in shake flasks. Under standard growth conditions, we did not observed any improvement in maximal cdw and μmax with respect to the controls (data not shown). We then examined specific stress conditions that provoke a drop in ATP and therefore possibly confer an advantage to cells expressing a phosphagen kinase system (14Holyoak C.D. Stratford M.

A transient acidic stress was applied by shifting the pH of mid-log phase cultures (at an OD600 of 0.8–1.0) for 1 h from pH 5 to pH 2 and subsequently returning to pH 5. Under these conditions, the ability of the cultures in recovering to the original μmax value, as well as the time needed to recover growth (defined as recovery time), were investigated. Cultures harboring the complete CK system as above did not show any improvement with respect to the controls (Fig. 4b) In contrast, AK conferred the ability to reduce the recovery time from 3.3 to 2.3 h (Fig. 4a). As the experiment was repeated two times (data not shown), the recovery time of the control varied between 3 and 5 h, whereas the recovery time was always at least 1 h shorter with AK-expressing cells. The μmax of controls and cells expressing AK remained unchanged. Thus it became obvious that the AK system facilitated a shortening of the time needed to recover full growth after pH stress. Because heterologous AK expression improved resistance to transient pH stress, we wanted to investigate whether this improvement could also be seen under starvation stress and directly related to the ATP buffering capacity of AK (36Ellington W.R.

The enzymes characterized from vertebrates andDrosophila are α2β2 tetramers, in which protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) serves as the β subunit. Two conserved α subunit isoforms, PHY-1 and PHY-2, have been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans. We report here that three unique P4H forms are assembled from these polypeptides and the single β subunit PDI-2, both in a recombinant expression system andin vivo, namely a PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 mixed tetramer and PHY-1/PDI-2 and PHY-2/PDI-2 dimers. The mixed tetramer is the main P4H form in wild-type C. elegans butphy-2−/− andphy-1−/− (dpy-18) mutant nematodes can compensate for its absence by increasing the assembly of the PHY-1/PDI-2 and PHY-2/PDI-2 dimers, respectively. All three of the mixed tetramer-forming polypeptides PHY-1, PHY-2, and PDI-2 are coexpressed in the cuticle collagen-synthesizing hypodermal cells. The catalytic properties of the mixed tetramer are similar to those of other P4Hs, and analogues of 2-oxoglutarate were found to produce severe temperature-dependent effects on P4H mutant strains.

Initial characterization of a recombinant C. elegans α subunit isoform (PHY-1) revealed a unique association in that it formed an active αβ dimer with both human PDI and its C. elegansorthologue PDI-2 but not with C. elegans PDI-1 (17Veijola J.

Since this initial PHY-1 characterization, C. elegans has become the first multicellular organism to have its genome completely sequenced (19The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar), thereby permitting a detailed evaluation of this enzyme class in this metazoan. In addition to the PHY-1 encoding gene, a second highly conserved P4H α subunit encoding gene, phy-2, has been identified (20Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc.

Detailed analyses of gene function employing RNA interference and/or homologous deletion techniques have recently been performed onphy-1 (20Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T.

In addition, detailed temporal and spatial expression pattern analyses and embryonic phenotype time-lapse examinations have been performed on all three genes (21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that phy-1 is important for post-embryonic body morphology, since its deletion resulted in a dumpy (short and fat) phenotype with an associated decrease in the 4-hydroxyproline content of the fourth larval cuticle (20Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The phy-1 gene was found to correspond to the previously uncharacterized dumpy mutant,dpy-18 (20Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dobbins C.A. L'Hernault S.W. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, phy-2 was found to be dispensable or functionally redundant, since its deletion resulted in no visible phenotype, although a significant reduction in cuticular 4-hydroxyproline content was noted (20Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The combined disruption ofphy-1 and phy-2 did, however, demonstrate an essential role for both genes in embryonic viability (20Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nematodes lacking both genes developed normally during early embryogenesis, until the first collagenous ECM or cuticle was formed, after which the normal elongated body morphology was lost and death followed (21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Significantly, deletion of the characterized P4H β subunit gene pdi-2 gave an identical time-lapse phenotype to the phy-1/phy-2 combined disruption (21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Taken together with the shared hypodermal spatial expression patterns and the molting cycle-related temporal expression patterns of all three genes (21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the genetic analysis suggests a biochemical association of all three encoded polypeptides and supports a cuticle collagen-specific role for these P4H subunits. We describe here a detailed in vitro and in vivobiochemical characterization of the second conserved C. elegans P4H α subunit isoform PHY-2, demonstrating the presence of a novel mixed PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer formed by the three polypeptides both in recombinant insect cell coexpression experiments and in vivo. This mixed tetramer formation is species-specific, and the regions of PHY-1 and PHY-2 required for the association were identified. We also show that this mixed tetramer is far more abundant than the previously characterized recombinant PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer, and we describe an additional PHY-2-containing dimer that can partially substitute for the mixed tetramer in a P4H mutant. A nuclear-excluded colocalization of all three polypeptides together with the newly synthesized chains of a cuticle collagen is consistent with their role in the ER modification of collagens synthesized by hypodermal cells and destined for the cuticular ECM. Wild-type (N2),dpy-18(e364), andphy-2(ok177) strains were received from theC. elegans Genetics Center. The deletion strainphy-3(ok199) was generated by the C. elegans Genome Deletion Consortium. PHY-2 was expressed in insect cells by cloning the full-length phy-2 coding sequence into the vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen). PCR was performed on N2 C. elegansmixed stage cDNA (23Page A.P. MacNiven K. Hengartner M.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with the primers Phy-2BVF (NotI, underlined) gacgcggccgcATGAGAGCAGTTTTGCTAGTC and Phy-2BVR (XbaI, underlined) gcgtctagaCTATGGATCATTGGCATATGGGGAC. The PCR product was cloned into the pCRScript vector (Stratagene), digested withNotI and XbaI, and ligated into similarly digested pVL1392 (BD PharMingen). Baculovirus transfer vectors coding for hybrid PHY polypeptides with no linker between the PHY-1 and PHY-2 sequences were constructed by preparing two PCR fragments using kinase-treated primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) with pVL1392-phy-1 (17Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pVL1392-phy-2 as templates. To generate constructs coding for hybrid PHY polypeptides in which the N-terminal half consists of PHY-1 amino acids, thephy-1 PCR-fragments were amplified from the pVL1392NotI site to the codons for PHY-1 Leu120 or Ala271, and the phy-2 PCR fragments from the codons for PHY-2 Gln123 or Leu268 to the stop codon followed by an XbaI site. To generate constructs coding for hybrid PHY polypeptides in which the N-terminal half consists of PHY-2 amino acids, the phy-2 PCR fragments were amplified from the pVL1392 NotI site to the codons for PHY-2 Leu122 or Ala267 and the phy-1 PCR fragments from the codons for PHY-1 Gln121 or Leu272 to the stop codon followed by an XbaI site. The phy-1 and phy-2 fragment pairs were coligated into NotI-XbaI-digested pVL1392. Hybrid A consists of the PHY-1 signal peptide, PHY-1 amino acids 1–120 and PHY-2 amino acids 123–523; hybrid B of the PHY-1 signal peptide, PHY-1 amino acids 1–271 and PHY-2 amino acids 268–523; hybrid C of the PHY-2 signal peptide, PHY-2 amino acids 1–122 and PHY-1 amino acids 121–543; and hybrid D of the PHY-2 signal peptide, PHY-2 amino acids 1–267 and PHY-1 amino acids 272–543 (Fig. 7). The recombinant baculovirus constructs were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingen), and the resultant virus pools were collected and amplified (24Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System Instruction Manual. PharMingen, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Insect cells (Sf9 or High Five, Invitrogen) were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% insect cell qualified fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as monolayers at 27 °C. Cells seeded at a density of 5 × 106 per 100-mm plate were infected at a multiplicity of 5 with different combinations of the viruses coding for the C. elegans PHY-1 (17Veijola J. Koivunen P.

The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 mphosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a solution of 0.1 mglycine, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Samples of the resulting supernatants (50 μg of total protein) were analyzed by 8% reducing SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or 8% nondenaturating PAGE by leaving out the SDS and reducing agent from the standard SDS-PAGE protocol (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and assayed for enzyme activity by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (26Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). K m andK i values were determined as described previously (26Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were generated against synthetic peptides representing the C-terminal residues of PHY-1 (CEPRNAPNVSPNLAKDVWETL), PHY-2 (CLEEEVQENFIGDLSPYANDP), and PDI-2 (CGASEEEKAEEEADEEGHTEL). The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma and Genosys) via a cysteine residue (added to PHY-1 and PDI-2 sequences,C) and used to immunize two rabbits. Western blot analysis of baculovirus-generated recombinant proteins was performed by transferring samples from SDS-PAGE or nondenaturing PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), followed by incubation with the antibodies described above and a subsequent incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. No cross-reactivity was noted between the three antisera, and specific bands of the correct estimated size were observed following Western blotting of reduced denatured worm extracts (data not shown). The cuticle collagen-specific DPY-7 monoclonal antibody used in colocalization experiments was a gift from Dr. Iain Johnstone (University of Glasgow). Native worm extracts were prepared by washing mixed stage nematodes from 4 × 100-mm plates in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 μm E64, and 0.1 μm pepstatin). After several washes, the worms were pelleted by gentle centrifugation at 2000 × g and frozen at −70 °C. Pellets (0.5–1 ml of packed worms) were resuspended on ice in an equal volume of P4H buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, at 4 °C) and homogenized in a 3-ml Dounce tissue homogenizer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants (14 μg total protein/well) were resolved on 4–12% gradient nondenaturing PAGE gels (NOVEX, NuPage, BisTris) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Western blotting was performed with antibodies to PHY-1, PHY-2, and PDI-2 as described above. The P4H activity of the nematode lysates was assayed by measuring the formation of 4-hydroxy[14C]proline in a nonhydroxylated [14C]proline-labeled protocollagen substrate (26Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Wild-type embryos were collected from agar plates and washed extensively in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were then pipetted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and permeabilized by freeze-cracking (27Rogalski T.M. Williams B.D. Mullen G.P. Moerman D.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1471-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Samples were blocked in PBST (0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dried skimmed milk and probed with combinations of monoclonal anti-DPY-7 (1/50) and polyclonal antisera to PHY-1, PHY-2, and PDI-2 (all at 1/100) in PBST. Samples were then washed extensively and incubated in a mixture of 1/500 Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Samples were washed and viewed under epifluorescence on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope. Images captured with a CCD Hamamatsu digital camera were pseudocolored and processed using Improvision Openlab and Adobe Photoshop software. Small (4 cm) Petri dishes were used for the inhibitor studies with wild-type,dpy-18(e364), phy-2(ok177), and phy-3(ok199) nematodes. Plates were prepared with NGM-agarose (minus salts) and seeded with OP50 washed with S medium (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KPO4, pH 6, with 5 mg/liter cholesterol). Plates were then inoculated with 400 μl of pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate or pyridine 2,5-dicarboxylate diluted in S medium to final concentrations ranging from 60 μm to 10 mm. Fifteen 2-fold embryos of each strain were added to each plate, incubated at 20 or 25 °C, and viewed twice daily over several days. Phenotypes of inoculated nematodes and their progeny were viewed and images captured as above.

The PCR product was cloned into the XbaI-XhoI-digested vector pPD129:36 (29Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNA for injection was produced in vitro as described previously (21Winter A.D Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ten young adults of wild-type,dpy-18(e364), andphy-2(ok177) strains were microinjected, allowed to recover overnight, and transferred singly to fresh plates, and their progenies were scored. To perform bacterially mediated RNAi, the construct pPD129:36-phy-3 was transformed according to published methods (29Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Ten L4 animals of the strains N2,dpy-18(e364), andphy-2(ok177) were transferred to feeding plates and incubated for 2 days at 25 °C, after which the adults were then transferred to fresh feeding plates and allowed to lay eggs for 24 h, and the progeny were scored. A recombinant baculovirus coding for the C. elegans PHY-2 polypeptide was generated and used to infect insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The cell pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS, and the Triton X-100 and SDS-soluble proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with data reported previously (11Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Likewise, the efficient extraction of the recombinant PHY-2 from the cell homogenates required the use of 1% SDS (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). In order to study whether an association could be achieved between theC. elegans PHY-2 and the C. elegans PDI-1, PDI-2, or human PDI, insect cells were coinfected with recombinant viruses coding for PHY-2 and one of the PDI subunits. In control experiments a recombinant virus coding for the C. elegans PHY-1 was used together with a virus coding for one of the PDI subunits. Triton X-100-soluble extracts of the cell homogenates were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 B) and Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). PHY-2 did not become associated with any of the PDI subunits (Fig. 1, Band C, lanes 1–3), whereas in the control experiments, PHY-1 formed a dimer with the C. elegans PDI-2 or human PDI (Fig. 1, B, lane 6, andC, lanes 4 and 6). The assembly of a recombinant PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer was fairly inefficient, however, as reported previously (18Veijola J. Annunen P. Koivunen P. Page A.P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also this dimer could be detected only in Western blots and not in Coomassie-stained native gels (Fig. 1,B and C, lanes 4). P4H activity in the Triton X-100 soluble extracts was analyzed with an assay based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate using (Pro-Pro-Gly)10as a substrate. As reported previously (18Veijola J. Annunen P. Koivunen P. Page A.P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the level of enzyme activity in extracts from cells coexpressing PHY-1 and PDI-2 was about 3% that in extracts from cells coexpressing PHY-1 and human PDI (TableI). A very low amount of P4H activity was also detected in extracts from cells coexpressing PHY-2 and PDI-2, and the level of this activity was about half that in extracts from cells coexpressing PHY-1 and PDI-2 (Table I), and thus probably below the detection limit of the Western blot analysis used here. No significant P4H activity was present in extracts from cells coexpressing PHY-2 or PHY-1 and C. elegans PDI-1, or PHY-2 and human PDI (Table I).Table IP4H activity in Triton X-100 extracts of insect cells coexpressing C. elegans (Cel) or human (Hu) α-subunits with various PDI subunitsPolypeptides expressedP4H activity, dpm/10 μlCelPHY-2 and CelPDI-2310 ± 160CelPHY-2 and CelPDI-1<50CelPHY-2 and HuPDI<50CelPHY-1 and CelPDI-2750 ± 460CelPHY-1 and CelPDI-1<50CelPHY-1 and HuPDI22120 ± 3610CelPHY-1 and CelPHY-2 and CelPDI-210280 ± 1540Huα(1) and HuPDI17390 ± 4560Values are given in dpm/10 μl of extractable cell protein, mean ± S.D. for at least four experiments.

To study whether PHY-2 can form mixed tetramers with PHY-1 and PDI-1, PDI-2, or human PDI, both types of PHY polypeptide were coexpressed in insect cells together with one of the PDI subunits. In control experiments, insect cells were coinfected with viruses coding for the human α(I) subunit and human PDI. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, and Triton X-100-soluble proteins were analyzed by PAGE performed under nondenaturing conditions, followed either by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2 A) or Western blotting (Fig. 2, B and C). Coexpression of PHY-2 and PHY-1 with PDI-2 led to the formation of an active recombinant P4H (Table I) with a mobility similar to that of the human enzyme, thus indicating that a tetramer was formed when these three C. elegans polypeptides were coexpressed (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 4). Immunostaining with polyclonal antibodies against PHY-2 and PHY-1 showed that both polypeptides were present in this tetramer (Fig. 2, B andC, lanes 1). A small amount of a dimer formed by PHY-1 and PDI-2 was also seen in the same sample in Western blots (Fig.2 C, lane 1), whereas no association of PHY-1 and PHY-2 with C. elegans PDI-1 was observed (Fig. 2,lanes 2). Thus the Coomassie-stained native gels indicate that the mixed PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer is the predominant P4H form produced by recombinant C. elegans P4H subunits in insect cells. When PHY-1 and PHY-2 were coexpressed with human PDI, PHY-1 efficiently associated with the latter to form a dimer (Fig. 2, A and C, lanes 3). In addition, a faint band corresponding to"

Here, we report that both responses are induced in the cells by exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. Suramin, an inhibitor of systemin receptor function, strongly inhibited the UV-B-induced medium alkalinization and MAPK activity. The UV-B response was also reduced when cells were initially treated with systemin or the systemin antagonist Ala-17-systemin, which competitively inhibits binding of systemin to the systemin receptor. Cells that were initially treated with either UV-B or systemin exhibited a strongly reduced response to a subsequent elicitation with systemin. The desensitization was transient, reaching a maximum at 30–60 min after the initial treatment. Several hours later, depending on the initial UV-B dose or systemin concentration, the cells regained their initial responsiveness. When cells were irradiated with low doses of UV-B and subsequently treated with systemin, the UV-B response reached levels higher than the response without UV-B treatment. The data provide evidence for an involvement of the systemin receptor and/or systemin-responsive signaling elements in the UV-B response.

Plant cells are frequently exposed to high energy UV-B radiation, which has the potential to damage essential macromolecules including DNA, lipids, and proteins. Much of the UV-B radiation is absorbed by protective pigments such as flavonoids. Genes coding for enzymes functioning in biosynthetic pathways for pigment synthesis are expressed in response to UV-B exposure. Phytochromes are known to perceive light in the red/far red light range, and cryptochromes and phototropins perceive light in the UV-A/blue light range. For the UV-B range of the solar spectrum (280–320 nm), light perception is not well understood. No specific UV-B photoreceptor has been identified so far, although certain photomorphogenic UV-B responses are indicative of the presence of such photoreceptors (1Ballaré C. Barnes P. Flint S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 93: 584-592Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Animal cells lack specific UV-B photoreceptors, but they have sophisticated mechanisms to protect themselves against UV-induced damage. During the UV response, prostaglandin synthesis increases, and a range of genes is activated eventually leading to inflammatory symptoms like erythema or apoptosis (2Miller C.C. Hale P. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3529-3533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tyrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The underlying signal transduction involves ligand-independent activation of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases for polypeptide growth factors and cytokines. This results in the Ras/Raf-mediated activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1cascade, which in turn activates transcription factor complexes like AP-1. Accordingly, many genes are activated by both UV-B and growth factors/cytokines (3Tyrell R.M. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Rosette C. Karin M.

Moreover, UV irradiation was shown to result in autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and a dominant negative EGFR mutant showed a decreased UV-C response (5Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The receptor tyrosine kinases are most likely not the primary targets of UV radiation. There is evidence showing that these receptors are activated as a consequence of UV-induced inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases (7Groβ S. Knebel A. Tenev T. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Herrlich P.

The difficulties in identifying a specific UV-B photoreceptor in plants may be in part due to the multiple and diverse UV-B effects that comprise photomorphogenic, protective, and defense responses. Some UV-B-responsive gene products function in protection against harmful UV-B effects as well as pathogen defense. For example, biosynthetic pathway enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase and chalcone synthase are involved in the synthesis of protective UV-absorbing pigments like flavonoids and defensive phytoalexins. Other UV-B-responsive genes like PR, defensin, or proteinase inhibitor genes have no obvious function for UV protection (10Brederode F.T. Linthorst H.J.M. Bol J.F. Plant Mol.

In the leaves of tomato plants, the herbivore/wounding-induced defense signaling pathway is regulated by the polypeptide signal systemin. The systemin signaling pathway exhibits several analogies to the animal inflammatory response such as systemin perception by a membrane-bound receptor and activation of a MAPK and a phospholipase A2(17Bergey D.R.

UV-C radiation (<280 nm) affects the wound response in tomato plants by inducing the synthesis of proteinase inhibitors (23Conconi A. Smerdon M.J Howe G.A. Ryan C.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Proteinase inhibitors play a role in resistance of plants to herbivorous insects. In contrast to UV-C, UV-B radiation did not induce proteinase inhibitor synthesis in leaves of 14-day or older tomato plants. However, UV-B caused a strong potentiation of proteinase inhibitor synthesis in response to wounding (15Stratmann J.W. Stelmach B.A. Weiler E.W. Ryan C.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, in field studies plants exposed to solar UV-B are more resistant to herbivorous insects than plants exposed to solar radiation without UV-B (24Ballaré C. Scopel A.L. Stapleton A.E. Yanovsky M. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The synergistic effects of UV-B and wounding suggest that the UV-B response pathway and the wounding/systemin-induced signaling pathway overlap in a yet unknown way. Furthermore, some signaling events induced by wounding/systemin show striking similarities to UV-B signaling, including proton and potassium fluxes (25Arnott T. Murphy T.M. Environ. Exp.

However, it is still largely unknown how these signaling events are initiated by UV-B, what their precise cellular function is, and whether wounding/systemin-induced pathways and UV-B-induced pathways utilize some common signaling components. Here we provide evidence for the involvement of the systemin receptor and/or systemin-responsive signaling elements in the UV-B response in tomato (Lycopersicon peruvianum) suspension-cultured cells. L. peruvianumsuspension-cultured cells (kindly provided by A. Schaller) were cultivated under constant light as described previously (21Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured weekly and used for experiments 4–7 days after subculturing. For the experiments, cells were transferred to multiwell plates (1.5 ml/well) that were vigorously shaken on an orbital shaker under ambient room light and temperature conditions. After a ∼1-h equilibration period, the pH of the medium reached a starting pH of 4.8 ± 0.2. UV-B lamps, the UV filter (Melinex®561/1000 gauge; 0.25 mm; DuPont), and the UV meter were described previously (15Stratmann J.W. Stelmach B.A. Weiler E.W. Ryan C.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The distance between lamps and the surface of the medium was adjusted for a UV-B irradiance of 5.4 ± 0.6 mW·cm−2 at the surface of the medium. The exact irradiance and, thus, the dose at the cell surface cannot be determined because UV light is strongly absorbed by the growth medium (75% at 310 nm), and the distance between the cell or medium surface and UV lamps varies while cultures are vigorously shaken. Systemin was supplied to 1.5 ml of suspension-cultured cells at the times and concentrations indicated in the text (see “Results”). Suramin in water, fusicoccin (Sigma) in 10% (v/v) ethanol, and 10% ethanol (control, no effect on the pH of the medium) were supplied to the cells at the times and concentrations indicated in the text (see “Results”). For the UV-B time course experiment (see Fig. 1) untreated samples were assayed over the course of the experiment. The pH of the medium was measured with a pH meter as described previously (22Stratmann J. Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8862-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine the UV-B-induced AR and the inhibition of UV-B-induced AR by suramin, the pH increase in untreated controls and in response to UV-B irradiation was measured at the times indicated after the start of irradiation, and the difference was referred to as ΔpH or 0% inhibition of UV-B-induced AR. Another set of cells was pretreated for 5 min with suramin at various concentrations and then irradiated for 10 min with UV-B or left untreated. The pH was measured 20 min after the start of irradiation. The UV-B-induced response in the presence of suramin was expressed as the percentage of the response to UV-B alone (% inhibition of UV-B-induced AR). In each case, the increase in medium pH was corrected for a weak change in the baseline (≤0.3 pH units) of untreated cells or cells that had been treated with suramin alone. In-gel myelin basic protein kinase assays, and immunocomplex assays were performed as described previously (22Stratmann J. Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8862-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Radioactive signals corresponding to phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by a myelin basic protein kinase were quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the pH increase in response to a second stimulation after an initial treatment at time 0 (t = 0), cells were either supplied with systemin, Ala-17-systemin, or a random 18-amino acid peptide, irradiated with UV-B as described above, or left untreated. At the times indicated in the text (t = x), the conditioned medium of all sets of cells was quantitatively exchanged and replaced with fresh medium (pH 5.0). Immediately thereafter a subset of pretreated and untreated cells was supplied with systemin or irradiated with UV-B (treatment 2). The increase in medium pH was measured 15 min later (t = x + 15 min). The series of treatments was as indicated in Table I.Table ISeries of treatments for AR desensitization assayst = 0t = x t =x + 15 min1 No treatmentMedium exchangeMeasure pH2 No treatmentMedium exchange + treatment 2Measure pH3 Treatment 1Medium exchangeMeasure pH4 Treatment 1Medium exchange + treatment 2Measure pH Open table in a new tab The difference between 2 and 1 in Table I is referred to as 100%, or the full response. The effect of the initial treatment (treatment 1) on treatment 2 was expressed as the percentage of the full response using the equation (4 − 3) × 100/(2 − 1) = % of full response. Desensitization MAPK assays were conducted similar to AR assays with the exception that no medium exchange was performed. Samples were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen 10 min after application of systemin or 30 min after the start of irradiation. Thereafter, kinase activity was assayed and quantified (see above). UV-B irradiation periods were 5 or 10 min. The series of treatments was as described in TableII.Table IISeries of treatments for MAPK desensitization assayst = 0t = xt = x + 10/30 min1 No treatmentNo treatmentQuick freeze2 No treatmentTreatment 2Quick freeze3 Treatment 1No treatmentQuick freeze4 Treatment 1Treatment 2Quick freeze Open table in a new tab Background kinase activity measured in 1 in Table II was subtracted from the activities measured in 2, 3, and 4. The corrected kinase activity in 2 was then referred to as 100%, or the full response. The effect of the initial treatment 1 on treatment 2 at the times indicated in the text (t = x) was expressed as the percentage of the full response using the equation (4 − 3) × 100)/2 = % of full response. The medium exchange for AR assays and appropriate pH controls for the kinase assays ruled out that the reduced responsiveness to systemin early after an initial treatment might be due to a pH effect on the perception of systemin rather than to a down-regulation of signaling components. Similar data were obtained when the pH after elicitation was titrated back to pH 5 using HCl. All experiments were performed with at least two sets of cells and reproduced at least three times with different batches of cell samples. The data are given as the mean of three experiments ± S.D. Comparisons among treatment groups were made employing the one-sample or paired t test. Multiple pairwise comparisons were performed using the Tukey's Studentized Range test. p values are two-tailed. Significance was assumed at p values < 0.05. Suspension-cultured L. peruvianum cells respond to the polypeptide signal systemin with a rapid and transient increase in the activity of a 48-kDa MAPK and the alkalinization of the culture medium (18Meindl T. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Stratmann J. Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8862-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1995; 7: 381-389Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have found that a 5-min UV-B irradiation ofL. peruvianum cells caused a rapid increase of the AR (Fig.1 A) and in 48-kDa MAPK-like activity (Fig. 1 B), similar to systemin. Both the kinase activity and the AR exhibited rapid increases within 10 min after irradiation. The lag phase for the AR was about 30 s (Fig.1 A, inset). The rapid increase was followed by a decrease and a second increase that maximized at about 60–90 min for the kinase activity and at 90 min for the AR. Cells were exposed to UV-B irradiation for increasing time periods and to white light for 10 min. They were then assayed for kinase activities and AR at 30 and 20 min after the start of irradiation, respectively. The two responses were UV-B dose-dependent (Fig.1 C). The UV-B-induced AR and the kinase activity reached a maximum after an irradiation period of 10–15 min. A longer irradiation period of 30 min led to profound decreases in both responses (data not shown), perhaps due to UV-induced damage to essential signaling components. White light was inactive. The lamps used have a peak emittance at 310 nm. They do not emit UV-C radiation, but 41% of the emitted light is in the UV-A range (15Stratmann J.W. Stelmach B.A. Weiler E.W. Ryan C.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When the cells were irradiated through a UV filter that totally cut off UV-B radiation and partially short wavelength UV-A radiation, both responses were almost completely abolished (Fig. 1 C). This demonstrated that the active wavelength range is largely in the UV-B region of the spectrum. Suramin was previously shown to interfere with the perception of systemin by the 160-kDa membrane-bound systemin receptor in suspension-cultured L. peruvianum cells, resulting in the inhibition of systemin-induced AR and MAPK activation (22Stratmann J. Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8862-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). WhenL. peruvianum cells were pretreated for 5 min with increasing suramin concentrations and subsequently irradiated with UV-B for 10 min, the AR was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The IC50 for suramin was about 300 μg·ml−1 (210 μm). However, the UV-B-induced AR could not be completely inhibited by suramin, even at higher concentrations than shown. At 1500 μg·ml−1, suramin inhibited the AR by about 70%. At this concentration, the induction of MAPK-like activity by UV-B was nearly abolished (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that suramin-sensitive cell surface components such as the systemin receptor may participate in the UV-B response. The activation of the kinase was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, demonstrated by immuno-complexing of the active kinase with a monoclonal antibody that is specific for phosphotyrosine (15Stratmann J.W. Stelmach B.A. Weiler E.W. Ryan C.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is a distinguishing feature of members of the MAPK family of protein kinases. In the presence of suramin, no tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase was detected (Fig. 2 C). To test a possible interaction of the systemin and UV-B signaling pathways, a typical feature of signaling pathways was analyzed, the transient down-regulation of signaling components after an initial activation. This results in a reduced responsiveness of cells to a subsequent treatment with the same or a related stimulus (43Felix G. Regenass M. Boller T. Plant J. 1993; 4: 307-316Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 44Felix G. Baureithel K. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ability of the L. peruvianumcells to respond to a second systemin treatment after an initial activation by systemin was assayed for the AR and MAPK. Fig.3 shows that the initial activation of both AR and MAPK by systemin leads to a transient reduced responsiveness of the cells to a second treatment with a saturating concentration of systemin. The magnitude of the desensitizing effect was dependent on the initial systemin concentration. A concentration of 10 or 3.3 nm led to an almost complete loss of responsiveness to the second treatment at 30 min. This effect was transient, and at 3.5 h, the responsiveness of the cells was almost completely restored. This indicates that the initial activation results in a desensitization of a component or components of the systemin signaling pathway. To determine whether UV-B treatments would desensitize L. peruvianum suspension-cultured cells to a subsequent systemin treatment, cells were initially irradiated for increasing times with UV-B, and 1, 2, 4, and 8 h later they were treated with systemin. One hour after a 5-min UV-B irradiation period, the systemin-induced AR was reduced by 80% compared with the response without initial UV-B treatment (Fig.4 A). At 30 min after a 10-min UV-B treatment, the systemin-induced MAPK activity was also reduced by 80% compared with the response without initial UV-B treatment (Fig.4 B). The desensitizing effects of UV-B on both AR and MAPK activity were dose-dependent and transitory. The MAPK recovery occurred sooner than the AR. At 8 h after the initial irradiation of the cells with lower UV-B doses, the systemin induction of both responses was 135% (p < 0.05) that of the response without initial UV-B treatment (Fig. 4, A andB). After a 10-min UV-B exposure, systemin-induced MAPK activity did not return to pre-exposure levels, perhaps due to UV-B damage that did not occur at lower doses. These results suggest that UV-B activates components of the systemin signaling pathway. To further test a possible involvement of the systemin receptor in the UV-B response, cells were initially treated with systemin, Ala-17-systemin, or a random 18-amino acid polypeptide (18mer). An initial treatment with the 18-mer did not show any significant effect on the response to a 5-min UV-B treatment 30 min later. However, when the cells were initially treated with systemin, they were significantly desensitized to a subsequent UV-B irradiation. When compared with the effect of the 18-mer, the reduction for the AR was 35% (p < 0.05) and, for MAPK activity, 25% (p < 0.05) (Fig.5 A). Ala-17-systemin is a systemin analog and a powerful antagonist of systemin. It binds to the systemin receptor but is not capable of strongly activating the systemin signaling pathway (18Meindl T. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1995; 7: 381-389Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 45Pearce G. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 212-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When Ala-17-systemin was supplied to cells 30 min before UV-B irradiation, the UV-B-induced AR and MAPK activity were reduced by 25% (p < 0.05) and 40% (p < 0.05), respectively, when compared with the effects of the 18 mer (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that the systemin receptor may participate in UV-B signaling. The transient reduced responsiveness to systemin after a UV-B treatment could have been caused by a direct UV-B effect on the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which plays a major role in regulating the proton gradient across the plasma membrane during the systemin-induced AR (46Schaller A. Oecking C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar, 47Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fusicoccin is a plasma membrane H+-ATPase agonist and causes an acidification of the culture medium due to an enhanced pumping of protons out of the cell (46Schaller A. Oecking C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar). Fusicoccin-induced acidification of the cell culture medium was not altered by treating the cells with UV-B radiation (Fig.6). Furthermore, when mastoparan, another activator of the H+-ATPase in L. esculentumcells (48Vera-Estrella R. Higgins V.J. Blumwald E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was added to UV-B-treated L. peruvianum cells, a reacidification of the medium occurred (data not shown). In addition, the activation of the H+-ATPase by fusicoccin was not inhibited by suramin pretreatment of the cells (Fig. 6). Therefore, the H+-ATPase does not appear to be a direct target of UV-B. We have investigated the effects of UV-B radiation on two rapidly occurring defense signaling responses that are activated by systemin in suspension-cultured L. peruvianum cells, the alkalinization of the culture medium, and the activation of a 48-kDa MAPK. These are among the earliest known signaling events induced by systemin (27Felix G. Boller T. Plant J. 1995; 7: 381-389Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Stratmann J.W. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which is perceived by a 160-kDa membrane-bound receptor (18Meindl T. Boller T. Felix G.

To determine whether stimulation of the hydrolysis of cytosolic CE can be used as a novel therapeutic modality of atherosclerosis, we overexpressed hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in THP-1 macrophage-like cells by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery, and we examined its effects on the cellular cholesterol trafficking. We show here that the overexpression of HSL robustly increased neutral CE hydrolase activity and completely eliminated CE in the cells that had been preloaded with CE by incubation with acetylated low density lipoprotein. In these cells, cholesterol efflux was stimulated in the absence or presence of high density lipoproteins, which might be at least partially explained by the increase in the expression of ABCA1. Importantly, these effects were achieved without the addition of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, cAMP, or even high density lipoproteins. Furthermore, the uptake and degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein was significantly reduced probably by decreased expression of scavenger receptor A and CD36. Notably, the cells with stimulated CE hydrolysis did not exhibit either buildup of free cholesterol or cytotoxicity. In conclusion, increased hydrolysis of CE by the overexpression of HSL leads to complete elimination of CE from THP-1 foam cells not only by increasing efflux but also by decreasing influx of cholesterol.

Besides cleaning up extracellularly deposited atherogenic lipoproteins, macrophage foam cells secrete a wide variety of substances, which include inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipid-rich lesions that are characterized by a plethora of macrophage foam cells are associated with massive infiltration with activated T lymphocytes and prone to rupture, thereby leading to thrombotic coronary occlusion (2Libby P. Circulation. 2001; 104: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Thus, elimination of CE from foam cells is potentially a promising therapeutic strategy to stabilize rupture-prone atherosclerotic plaques. Foam cells are generated by the uptake of modified lipoproteins through scavenger receptors, such as scavenger receptor A (SR-A) and CD36 (3de Winther M.P. Hofker M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the lipoprotein-associated CE by lysosomal acid lipase liberates free cholesterol (FC), which is subsequently re-esterified by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) to form CE for storage in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic CE is in turn hydrolyzed by neutral CE hydrolase (NCEH) to generate FC, which is transported to a compartment for re-esterification by ACAT1. The rest of the FC is released out of the cells primarily through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (6Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the balance between synthesis and hydrolysis of CE conceivably governs the level of CE in macrophages. Inhibition of ACAT activity is shown to suppress CE accumulation with concomitant promotion of the net hydrolysis of CE in mouse peritoneal macrophages (8Brown M.S., Ho, Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting these in vitro results, ACAT inhibitors have been reported to suppress atherosclerosis in many animal models (9Buhman K.F. Accad M. Farese R.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Consistently, we have reported that atherosclerotic lesion areas as well as aortic CE contents are moderately reduced in mice that are deficient in ACAT1 in the setting of apoE or the LDL receptor deficiency (10Yagyu H. Kitamine T. Osuga J. Tozawa R. Chen Z. Kaji Y. Oka T. Perrey S. Tamura Y. Ohashi K. Okazaki H. Yahagi N. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Harada K. Shimano H. Yamashita H. Gotoda T. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21324-21330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, Fazio et al. (11Fazio S. Major A.S. Swift L.L. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) reported that macrophage-specific ablation of ACAT1 aggravated atherosclerotic lesions. It was speculated that inhibition of ACAT was detrimental because of cytotoxicity of excess FC in macrophages, as has been reported in cells treated with ACAT inhibitors (12Warner G.J. Stoudt G.

Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Together, it remains unknown whether selective inhibition of ACAT1 in macrophages is useful as a therapeutic tool. The role of CE hydrolysis in the development of atherosclerosis is less clear, because molecular identity of NCEH in macrophages has yet to be determined. Several investigators (14Small C.A. Goodacre J.A. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Khoo J.C. Reue K. Steinberg D. Schotz M.C. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have attributed the NCEH activity in macrophages to hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both triacylglycerol (TG) and CE in various organs including adipose tissue and testis (17Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This is apparently consistent with the results that treatment with cAMP, which is known to activate HSL, stimulated the CE hydrolysis in macrophages (18Khoo J.C. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12659-12661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bernard D.W. Rodriguez A. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 710-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cAMP stimulates the expression of ABCA1 (20Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), another rate-limiting step for cholesterol efflux, making it difficult to conclude that CE hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux are primarily mediated by endogenous HSL. Furthermore, we showed that NCEH activity was not reduced in peritoneal macrophages obtained from HSL knockout mice (22Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), indicating that another enzyme that is distinct from HSL mediates NCEH activity in macrophages. In this context, it is noteworthy that a new NCEH has been cloned from the human macrophages library (23Ghosh S. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, neither molecular identity nor characteristics of NCEHs in macrophages are completely elucidated. Previously, Escary et al. attempted to achieve increased hydrolysis of CE by overexpression of HSL using macrophage-specific enhancer/promoter of SR-A in RAW 264.7 cells (24Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and transgenic mice (25Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Wang X.P. Castellani L.W. Glass C.K. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 397-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, they were not successful in obtaining sufficient increases in CE hydrolysis. In the transfected cells, without the addition of ACAT inhibitor, increased hydrolysis of CE was not observed (24Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In macrophages from HSL transgenic mice, CE was paradoxically increased when incubated with acetylated LDL (acLDL) in vitro, which was ascribed to the compensatory activation of ACAT1 with low level of increase in NCEH activity (25Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Wang X.P. Castellani L.W. Glass C.K. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 397-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it still remains unclear whether stimulation of CE hydrolysis suppresses foam cell formation. To achieve higher expression of HSL in macrophages, we have used adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. We show here that the overexpression of HSL caused a robust increase in NCEH activity, which accompanied complete elimination of CE from the cells loaded with CE without affecting cell viability in THP-1 macrophages. These results implicate that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of HSL can be used as a therapeutic strategy to regress and stabilize rupture-prone foam cell lesions.

Mononuclear cells, which were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors using Lymphoprep (NYCOMED, Roskilde, Denmark) and adhered to plastic dishes, were used as human monocytes. Cells were loaded with cholesterol by incubation with RPMI 1640 containing 100 μg/ml acLDL and 5 mg/ml BSA for 24 h at 37 °C. After transduction with Ad-HSL or Ad-LacZ for 72 h at 37 °C in RPMI containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 100 μg/ml acLDL, cells were harvested. Cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells per well in 12-well tissue culture plates and infected with Ad-LacZ at 100 m.o.i. On day 3, β-galactosidase activity in the cellular proteins was measured by standard kits (Promega, Madison, WI). Cellular protein was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce).

THP-1 macrophages were plated in 4-chamber plates at 0.5 × 106 cells per well and treated with acLDL and recombinant adenovirus, as described above. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, and stained with Oil Red O in 60% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, and hematoxylin. Colorimetric MTT assay for cell survival and proliferation was performed following manufacturer's protocol. CE formation from [1-14C]oleic acid was determined as described previously (34Perrey S.

Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in culture media containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 100 μg/ml acLDL whose CE was reconstituted with [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate. Cells were then infected with recombinant adenoviruses at indicated m.o.i. at 37 °C for additional 72 h in RPMI 1640 containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 100 μg/ml acLDL in the presence or absence of 250 μg/ml HDL. An aliquot of the medium was removed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. Total cell-associated radioactivity was determined after dissolving the cells at time 0 in 0.1 n NaOH. Cholesterol efflux of radioactive cholesterol from the cells into the medium was determined as a percentage to the total radioactivity in the cells at time 0. Cells were incubated in RPMI containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 125I-labeled acLDL at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C for 6 h. The amounts of125I-labeled acLDL associated with or degraded by the cells were determined as described (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Nonspecific values were determined by adding a 50-fold excess of unlabeled acLDL. Specific values were calculated by subtracting the nonspecific value from the total value. Five μg of total RNA, which was isolated from the cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), was used for Northern blot analysis as described (22Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A.

Probes for human adipophilin, CD36, SRBI, SR-A, ABCA1, human ABCG1, human apoE, and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) were constructed from cDNA fragments amplified by RT-PCR using cDNA obtained from THP-1 monocyte/macrophages as a template. Probes for murine adipocyte lipid-binding protein (aP2) and HSL (exon 8 probe) were constructed from cDNA fragments amplified by RT-PCR using cDNA obtained from mouse adipose tissue as a template (22Osuga J.

All calculations were performed with STAT view version 5.0 for Macintosh (SAS Institute Inc.). To identify macrophages or macrophage-like cell lines that were effectively transduced with recombinant adenovirus, we compared the expression of LacZ in macrophage-like cell lines (THP-1, J774, RAW 264.7, and P388D1), primary cultures of macrophages such as murine peritoneal macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages, and HEK293 cells, after infection with Ad-LacZ. Compared with HEK293 cells, macrophage-like cells expressed extremely low activity of LacZ as follows: THP-1, 0.71%; J774, 0.01%; RAW 264.7, <0.01%. LacZ activity was undetectable in the following cells: P388D1, murine peritoneal macrophages, and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Among these cells, THP-1 macrophages were transduced with adenovirus most effectively. Thus, we used 30, 100, and 300 m.o.i., which correspond to 0.21, 0.71, and 2.13 copies of the virus infected into a THP-1 cell, respectively. To verify the expression of exogenous HSL after the infection with Ad-HSL, we performed Western blot analysis and measured activities for NCEH and TG lipase in the cells (Fig. 1). HSL protein was expressed in THP-1 macrophages infected with Ad-HSL in a dose-dependent manner but not in cells infected with Ad-LacZ (Fig. 1A). In parallel, NCEH activity was robustly stimulated after infection with Ad-HSL in cells treated with acLDL in a dose-dependent manner; 120-fold increase was observed at 300 m.o.i. (Fig. 1B). Similarly, TG lipase activity was stimulated after infection with Ad-HSL in cells treated with acLDL in a dose-dependent manner; 4-fold increase was observed at 300 m.o.i. (Fig. 1C). Fold increase was apparently more prominent in NCEH activity than in TG lipase activity, because basal level of endogenous NCEH activity was much lower than that of endogenous TG lipase activity. To examine whether the increased NCEH activity hydrolyzes cellular CE, we measured CE and FC contents in THP-1 macrophages infected with various doses of Ad-LacZ or Ad-HSL (Fig.2). Incubation with acLDL increased both CE and FC in the cells. The net amount of these lipids was not decreased by the addition of HDL, which is a physiological acceptor of FC that is released from cells and conceivably stimulates the efflux of FC from the cells to the medium (Fig. 2, compare Awith C and B with D). Infection with Ad-LacZ did not change the contents of either CE or FC. In contrast, infection with Ad-HSL significantly decreased the CE contents in a dose-dependent manner; CE was almost undetectable at 300 m.o.i. Importantly, the elimination of CE did not accompany an increase in FC. HDL had no significant effect on the CE contents (Fig.2, compare A with C). In agreement with these results, Oil Red O staining revealed that the number and size of intracellular lipid droplets, which were increased by incubation with acLDL, were remarkably reduced by the infection with Ad-HSL but not by the infection with Ad-LacZ (Fig. 3A). To rule out the possibility that the overexpression of HSL is cytotoxic and thereby decreases the lipid accumulation, we performed MTT assay (Fig.3B). Incubation with acLDL increased MTT activity by 51%. Infection with either Ad-LacZ or Ad-HSL decreased MTT activity by 41 and 33%, respectively; there was no significant difference between the cells infected with two viruses. To determine how Ad-HSL decreased cellular CE contents, we compared CE formation from [14C]oleic acid between Ad-LacZ and Ad-HSL (Fig. 4A). The CE formation, which was stimulated by acLDL, was substantially inhibited by the infection with Ad-HSL but not by Ad-LacZ. It is of note that these results were nearly identical to those on CE contents. To determine whether the decreased CE formation resulted from decreased ACAT activity, we measured microsomal ACAT activities (Fig. 4B). Incubation with acLDL stimulated microsomal ACAT activity. Neither Ad-HSL nor Ad-LacZ reduced the activities. Because FC contents were not increased despite the increased hydrolysis of CE, we hypothesized that FC, which is generated by the breakdown of CE, was effectively transported out of the cells to the media. To verify the possibility, we measured the amounts of FC released from the cells to the media (cholesterol efflux) (Fig.5, A and B). Ad-HSL stimulated the cholesterol efflux in a dose-dependent manner. HDL increased the cholesterol efflux by 50% (compare Fig. 5, A and B). Suppression of the uptake of acLDL may explain the decrease in CE content of Ad-HSL-infected cells. To test this possibility, we measured the amounts of 125I-labeled acLDL associated with or degraded by the cells infected with the viruses (Fig. 5, Cand D). Even the infection with Ad-LacZ reduced the amounts of 125I-labeled acLDL degraded by or associated with the cells by 2-fold. The infection with Ad-HSL further decreased the uptake and degradation by 30.2 and 50.8%, respectively. To investigate the changes in the expression of genes that govern cholesterol trafficking in the cells, we have performed Northern blot analyses (Fig. 6). The overexpression of HSL accompanied an ∼2-fold increase in the mRNA expression of ABCA1 but not the expression of other genes involved in cholesterol efflux, such as ABCG1, apoE, and CYP27. Apparently consistent with the reduced uptake and degradation of acLDL, the mRNA expression of the members of scavenger receptor family such as SR-A, CD36, and SRBI was decreased by ∼2-fold in the cells infected with Ad-HSL. Finally, we found no changes in the mRNA expression of the molecules whose expression was reported to be increased in response to oxidized LDL, such as adipophilin (35Wang X. Reape T.J., Li, X. Rayner K. Webb C.L. Burnand K.G. Lysko P.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and adipocyte lipid-binding protein (36Fu Y. Luo N. Lopes-Virella M.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2017-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Foam cell formation, accumulation of CE in monocyte/macrophages, is an initial step in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, elimination of CE from foam cells would be of considerable therapeutic benefit. This study was designed to determine whether the hydrolysis of CE is the rate-limiting step in the removal of CE from foam cells. We show here that overexpression of HSL leads to the complete elimination of CE from THP-1 macrophage foam cells without affecting cellular viability. These changes are associated not only with an increase in cholesterol efflux but also with a decrease in lipoprotein uptake, which may effectively protect foam cells from excessive accumulation of FC. Previously, Escary et al. (24Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) attempted to overexpress HSL in macrophages. They took advantage of plasmid transfection to RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells (24Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as well as transgenic mice using SR-A enhancer/promoter (25Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Wang X.P. Castellani L.W. Glass C.K. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 397-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, however, the levels of the expression were relatively low (5-fold in in vitro study, and 7-fold in in vivo study), and did not sufficiently overcome the compensatory activation of endogenous ACAT activity (2-fold increase in both studies). Indeed, the macrophages isolated from the transgenic mice showed paradoxical accumulation of CE when incubated with acLDL. Similar paradoxical worsening of atherosclerotic lesions was observed in the transgenic mice. In this regard, it is noteworthy that our study was the first to achieve a significant increase in the hydrolysis of CE in macrophages by virtue of adenovirus-mediated gene delivery (Fig. 1), which allowed us to investigate the role of CE hydrolysis in foam cell formation without the need for concomitant addition of ACAT inhibitors and/or cAMP analogues, which were required to demonstrate the increased CE hydrolysis in the studies of Escary et al. (24Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Escary J.L. Choy H.A. Reue K. Wang X.P. Castellani L.W. Glass C.K. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 397-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant increased activity of NCEH led to complete elimination of CE accumulated in THP-1 macrophages that had been preloaded with CE by incubation with acLDL (Fig. 2). The elimination of CE was not caused by inhibition of cholesterol esterification, because microsomal ACAT activity was not decreased (Fig. 4). The suppression of CE formation from [14C]oleic acid (Fig. 4) could be explained not only by the increased efflux (Fig. 5, A and B) but also by the decreased influx of cholesterol (Fig. 5, C and D). It is noteworthy that FC contents were not increased in these cells overexpressing HSL (Fig. 2). FC that was generated by the hydrolysis of CE might be effectively removed out of the cells by the increase in cholesterol efflux (Fig. 5), indicating that CE hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in foam cell formation of THP-1 macrophages. In comparison with murine macrophages such as mouse peritoneal macrophages and J774.2 cells, human macrophages including THP-1 macrophages are reportedly resistant to cholesterol efflux; neither cAMP nor the addition of HDL enhanced the cholesterol efflux (37Graham A. Angell A.D. Jepson C.A. Yeaman S.J. Hassall D.G. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 120: 135-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Kritharides L. Christian A. Stoudt G. Morel D. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This particular nature of THP-1 macrophages has been ascribed to the low activity of endogenous NCEH, which may in part account for our success in obtaining the significant increase in NCEH activity above the endogenous level after the transduction with Ad-HSL. The increased cholesterol efflux was at least partly in agreement with the up-regulation of the expression of ABCA1, which is a key transporter facilitating cellular cholesterol efflux (7Santamarina-Fojo S. Remaley A.T. Neufeld E.B. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Hydrolysis of CE generates cholesterol and fatty acids, both of which conceivably stimulate the expression of ABCA1, because fatty acids, their oxidized forms, and oxysterols might activate PPARα, PPARγ, and liver X receptor α, respectively, which increase the expression of ABCA1 in turn (7Santamarina-Fojo S. Remaley A.T. Neufeld E.B. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that cholesterol efflux was increased even in the absence of HDL in the medium (Fig. 5). Thus, the increased hydrolysis of CE stimulated cholesterol efflux via a pathway that is distinct from ABCA1, which requires HDL, in addition to cholesterol efflux via the ABCA1-mediated pathway. Thus far, it has been reported that the HDL-independent efflux of cholesterol is mediated either by apoE (39Huang Z.H. Lin C.Y. Oram J.F. Mazzone T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2019-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or by CYP27, an enzyme that catalyzes hydroxylation of cholesterol to form 27-hydroxycholesterol for elimination as bile acids from the liver (40Björkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 41Shanahan C.M. Carpenter K.L. Cary N.R. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 154: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, PPARδ has been shown to regulate the expression of CYP27 at the transcriptional level (42Vosper H. Patel L. Graham T. Khoudoli G.A. Hill A. Macphee C.H. Pinto I. Smith S.A. Suckling K.E. Wolf C.R. Palmer C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44258-44265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that FC released by the CE hydrolysis might be directed to a distinct subcellular compartment where FC is preferentially metabolized by this enzyme, thus facilitating cholesterol efflux. In this context, it is interesting to note that inhibition of ACAT results in accumulation of FC in endoplasmic reticulum, not in cytosol (43Puglielli L. Konopka G. Pack-Chung E. Ingano L.A. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. Chang T.Y. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Increased cholesterol efflux should have a therapeutic benefit, because accumulation of excess FC might be toxic to the cells. For example, many investigators (12Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have reported the cytotoxicity of ACAT inhibition in macrophages, whereas there are some who disagree (37Graham A. Angell A.D. Jepson C.A. Yeaman S.J. Hassall D.G. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 120: 135-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that the LDL receptor knockout mice whose bone marrow was repopulated with that from ACAT1-deficient mice developed more severe atherosclerosis than the LDL receptor knockout mice (11Fazio S. Major A.S. Swift L.L. Gleaves L.A. Accad M. Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which was ascribed to potential cytotoxic effects of FC accumulated in macrophages due to ACAT inhibition. We did not observe either FC accumulation or cytotoxicity in THP-1 cells overexpressing HSL (Figs. 2 and 3). Unexpectedly, we found that THP-1 macrophages overexpressing HSL showed reduced ability to take up and degrade acLDL (Fig. 5). In agreement with this, the expression of SR-A, CD36, and SRBI was decreased (Fig.6). SR-A (44Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and CD36 (45Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P. Hazen S.L. Hoff H.F. Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) are receptors for both acLDL and oxidized LDL; SRBI is a receptor for acLDL as well as for HDL (47Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of these proteins may contribute to the decreased uptake of acLDL as observed in our study. Since thiazolidinediones were reported to down-regulate the expression of SR-A (48Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D.S. Mortensen R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), it is possible that the HSL overexpression generates oxidized fatty acids, which suppress the expression of SR-A by activating PPARγ. If this is the case, it is difficult to explain the suppression of the expression of CD36, which was reported to be up-regulated by the activation of PPARγ (49Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Intracellular cholesterol content may play a more central role in the regulation of CD36 than fatty acids (50Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ghosh (23Ghosh S. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has recently reported the cloning of a novel CE hydrolase expressed in macrophages. There may be multiple NCEHs in macrophages: HSL, the CEH cloned by Ghosh (23Ghosh S. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and possibly others (22Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). It is yet to be known which enzyme is predominant in macrophages. Although the successful elimination of CE from macrophage foam cells was shown only in the artificial system at cellular level, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of HSL can be applied to the treatment of foam cell lesions in atherosclerotic plaques after solving issues at the in vivo level, such as gene delivery, tissue-specific expression, level of expression, side effects, etc. In summary, we show here that the overexpression of HSL robustly increases NCEH activity and completely eliminates CE in foam cells. In these cells, cholesterol efflux was stimulated in the absence or presence of HDL, which might be at least partially explained by the increase in the expression of ABCA1. Furthermore, the uptake and degradation of acLDL were significantly reduced probably by decreased expression of scavenger receptors such as SR-A and CD36. These changes in cholesterol trafficking, which are associated with the increased CE hydrolysis, may protect cells from cytotoxic effects of FC buildup. Thus, increased hydrolysis of CE by the overexpression of HSL leads to complete elimination of CE from THP-1 foam cells not only by increasing efflux but also by decreasing influx of cholesterol. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the changes in cholesterol trafficking in cells with increased hydrolysis of CE. We thank Z. Chen, S. Perrey, M. Amemiya-Kudo, T. Yoshikawa, and A. H. Hasty for comments and discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2117707907,"The blockade of heptahelical receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins by the expression of peptides derived from G protein Gα subunits represents a novel means of simultaneously inhibiting signals arising from multiple receptors that share a common G protein pool. Here we examined the mechanism of action and functional consequences of expression of an 83-amino acid polypeptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of Gαs(GsCT). In membranes prepared from GsCT-expressing cells, the peptide blocked high affinity agonist binding to β2adrenergic receptors (AR) and inhibited β2AR-induced [35S]GTPγS loading of Gαs. GsCT expression inhibited β2AR- and dopamine D1Areceptor-mediated cAMP production, without affecting the cellular response to cholera toxin or forskolin, indicating that the peptide inhibited receptor-Gs coupling without impairing G protein or adenylyl cyclase function. [35S]GTPγS loading of Gαq/11 by α1BARs and Gαi by α2AARs and Gq/11- or Gi-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was unaffected, indicating that the inhibitory effects of GsCT were selective for Gs. We next employed the GsCT construct to examine the complex role of Gs in regulation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, where activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway reportedly produces both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on heptahelical receptor-mediated ERK activation. For the β2AR in HEK-293 cells, where PKA activity is required for ERK activation, expression of GsCT caused a net inhibition of ERK activation. In contrast, α2AAR-mediated ERK activation in COS-7 cells was enhanced by GsCT expression, consistent with the relief of a downstream inhibitory effect of PKA. ERK activation by the Gq/11-coupled α1BAR was unaffected by GsCT. These findings suggest that peptide G protein inhibitors can provide insights into the complex interplay between G protein pools in cellular regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1976501903,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is important in lipid metabolism due to its interaction with members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. ApoE is able to interact with the LDL receptor only when it is bound to lipid particles. To address structural aspects of this phenomenon, a receptor-active apoE peptide, encompassing the receptor-binding region of the protein, was studied by NMR in the presence of the lipid-mimicking agent trifluoroethanol. In 50% trifluoroethanol, apoE-(126–183) forms a continuous amphipathic α-helix over residues Thr130–Glu179. Detailed NMR relaxation analysis indicates a high degree of plasticity for the residues surrounding 149–159. This intrinsic flexibility imposes a curvature to the peptide that may be important in terms of interaction of apoE with various sized lipid particles and the LDL receptor. Residues 165–179 of apoE may act as a molecular switch whereby these residues are unstructured in the absence of lipids and prevent interaction with the LDL receptor. In the presence of lipids, these residues become helical resulting in a receptor-active conformation of the protein. Furthermore, the electrostatic characteristics and geometric features of apoE-(126–183) suggest that apoE binds to the LDL receptor by interacting with more than one of the receptor ligand-binding repeats. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is important in lipid metabolism due to its interaction with members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. ApoE is able to interact with the LDL receptor only when it is bound to lipid particles.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). ApoE is composed of two structurally and functionally independent domains (9Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 10-kDa C-terminal domain exhibits a high affinity for lipids and is thought to be the primary site for binding of apoE on spherical lipoprotein particles (11Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 22-kDa N-terminal domain contains the receptor-binding region of the protein. This region has been localized between residues 136 and 150 and is essentially made of basic amino acids whose chemical modifications render apoE non-receptor-competent (12Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L.

Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of lipids, neither the N-terminal domain nor the full-length apoE protein are recognized by the LDL receptor (14Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain has a lower affinity for plasma lipoproteins than the C-terminal domain; however, the N-terminal domain is able to bind phospholipid vesicles and transform them into discoidal complexes that bind the LDL receptor with a similar efficiency as the entire protein (15Innerarity T.L. Friedlander B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains are linked by a protease-sensitive hinge region that has had no function associated to date. The structure of the N-terminal domain in lipid-free solution was solved at high resolution by x-ray crystallography. This domain is an elongated four-helix bundle made of amphipathic helices with hydrophobic faces oriented toward the interior of the bundle (16Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the N-terminal four-helix bundle undergoes a conformational change upon lipid binding to expose the hydrophobic side-chains of the protein that interact with the lipid surface (2Weisgraber K.H.

In this report, the structure and dynamics of the receptor-active apoE peptide, as determined by NMR spectroscopy in presence of TFE, are shown. Results indicate that apoE-(126–183) consists of an extended amphipathic helix that runs almost the entire length of the sequence. Structural calculations, in addition to relaxation data, indicate that the helix shows a high degree of plasticity. The dynamics study reported here marks the first such study of an extended helix in solution. The implications of the flexibility and helical structure of apoE-(126–183) are discussed in terms of whole apoE in the presence of a wide range of lipoprotein particles in the bloodstream. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the requirement of lipids bound to apoE for proper LDL receptor recognition. For preparation of apoE-(126–183), human apoE3-(1–183) was cloned into a pET vector, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and purified as described previously (20Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unlabeled and uniformly 15N labeled apoE3-(1–183) was prepared using standard media (21Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). ApoE-(126–183) was prepared by cleavage of the purified recombinant apoE3-(1–183) by CNBr as described previously (19Raussens V. Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NMR experiments were performed on ∼2 mm unlabeled or 15N-labeled apoE-(126–183) in 500 μl of 50% TFE-d 3, 40% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 3.3, containing 0.01% (w/v) NaN3and 0.25 mm of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as an internal chemical shift reference. NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on Varian INOVA 500-MHz and Unity 600-MHz NMR spectrometers. Data were processed using NMRPIPE (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRVIEW (23Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Complete 1H and 15N spectral assignments of apoE-(126–183) were obtained using gradient-enhanced three-dimensional15N-edited total correlation spectroscopy (τmix 51.4 ms) and NOESY (τmix 50 ms) experiments to identify spin systems and inter-residue connectivities as described by Wüthrich (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Confirmation of side-chain assignment was obtained through the use of three-dimensional HNHB and two-dimensional natural abundance 13C HSQC spectra. 15N T1, T2, and heteronuclear NOE relaxation data were recorded at 30 °C on both 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers using the enhanced sensitivity gradient pulse sequences developed by Farrow et al. (25Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). The T1relaxation decay was sampled at 10 different time points on each spectrometer: 11.1, 111, 277.5, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999, and 1110 ms. The T2 relaxation decay was sampled at different 10 time points: 16.6, 33.2, 49.8, 66.4, 83.0, 99.7, 116.3, 132.9, 149.5, and 166.1 ms on the 500-MHz spectrometer and 16.3, 32.6, 48.9, 65.2, 81.4, 97.7, 114.0, 130.3, 146.6, and 162.9 ms on the 600-MHz spectrometer. The exponential decay curves for T1 and T2 peak intensities were fit using the in-house written program xcrvfit. 2R. Boyko, unpublished data. {1H}-15N NOE values were obtained from the ratio of the peak intensity from proton-saturated and -unsaturated spectra. Reduced spectral density mapping was carried out as described by Farrow et al. (26Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Szabo A. Torchia D.A. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). An ensemble of 388 apoE-(126–183) structures was computed from 525 distance restraints (203 intraresidue, 202 sequential, and 120 medium range (defined as 2 >= i − j <= 4)), and 76 dihedral angle restraints (46 φ, 30 ψ) starting with an extended chain using a simulated annealing protocol (27Nilges M. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 28Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) in X-PLOR version 3.851 (29Brünger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional15N-edited NOESY experiments recorded with a τmix of 50 and 100 ms, as well as a two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY experiment in D2O recorded with a τmix of 150 ms. Distances were calibrated according to Slupsky and Sykes (30Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15953-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). φ backbone dihedral angles were calculated based on measured 3 J HN-Hα coupling constants in an HNHA experiment (31Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and the Karplus equation (32Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2870-2871Crossref Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). ψ dihedral angle restraints were obtained from the ratio of thed Nα(i,i)/dαN(i− 1,i) in the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY spectrum (33Gagné S. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The X-PLOR energies for the 100 lowest energy structures are as follows: E total = 64.8 ± 1.7,E bonds = 14.6 ± 0.8,E angles = 46.8 ± 1.3,E vdw = 0.4 ± 0.6,E noe = 2.4 ± 0.7, and Ecdih = 0.5 ± 0.2 kcal·mol−1. No distance or dihedral angle violation was greater than 0.2 Å or 2°, respectively. Root mean square deviations from idealized values are as follows: bonds = 0.0039 ± 0.0001 Å, angles = 0.4207 ± 0.0059°, and improper angles = 0.0094 ± 0.0013°. Families of structures were extracted from the ensemble of structures by superimposing the backbone of residues 149–159 of apoE-(126–183) using the program NMRCLUST (34Kelly A.L. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). ApoE-(126–183) is a 58-residue peptide that includes a lipid-binding region as well as the LDL receptor-binding moiety of apoE. ApoE-(126–183) is insoluble in aqueous solution above pH 4. Below pH 4, the peptide does not appear structured in water; however, in the presence of either lipids, such as dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), or lipid-mimicking agents, such as trifluoroethanol (TFE), it displays a high (70–80%) helical content (19Raussens V. Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Previously, it was determined that 50% TFE or 13 mmDPC is sufficient to induce full structuring of this peptide (19Raussens V. Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, functional characterization has shown that, in the presence of lipids, this peptide is able to interact with the LDL receptor (19Raussens V. Mah M.K.H. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig.1 exhibits a two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum of apoE-(126–183) illustrating the quality of the data obtained for this peptide at an NMR frequency of 500 MHz. For the 58-residue peptide, most resonances are clearly resolved. Four resonances overlap (Lys157 with Arg158 and Ile177 with Arg180); one resonance is very weak and close to another peak (Leu148), and three residues are missing (the two N-terminal residues, Leu126, Gly127, and the residue preceding the C-terminal proline, Gly182). Despite having a well resolved spectrum, normally indicative of a protein with a well defined tertiary structure, no long range distance restraints (i − j >= 5) could be found in an 15N-edited NOESY spectrum with a mixing time of 150 ms. The secondary structure of apoE-(126–183) was determined using NMR spectroscopy based upon NOE connectivities, the Hα NMR chemical shift index (CSI) (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 36Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), and the ratio of the dNα/dαN NOEs (33Gagné S. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A summary of these data are illustrated in Fig. 2. In general, helical secondary structure was defined as follows: 1) the presence of a dαN(i,i+3) NOE; 2) a dNα/dαN ratio >1; 3) a3 J HNHα <6 Hz; and 4) upfield shifted Hα NMR chemical shifts relative to random coil chemical shifts (negative CSI). When more than half of the available criteria were met for a particular residue and the flanking residues, the secondary structure was assigned as helical. Fig. 2 shows that apoE-(126–183) appears to be composed of a long α-helix spanning the sequence from Thr130 to Glu179, with the first and last four residues appearing unstructured. For residues Ala176 to Glu179, the dαN(i,i+3) NOEs could not be assigned due to ambiguities arising from an almost complete overlap of Ile177 and Arg180. Nevertheless, the3 J HNHα, dNα/dαN, and CSI values for these residues favor a helical conformation. Fig. 2 also shows evidence of the simultaneous presence of dαN(i,i+2)and dαN(i,i+4) NOEs for some residues along the helix. These data were collected from a short mixing time NOESY (50 ms) and thus are not likely due to spin diffusion. According to Wüthrich (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), dαN(i,i+4) is characteristic of an α-helix, whereas dαN(i,i+2) is characteristic of a 310 helix. The simultaneous presence of both NOEs for the same residue may reflect some sort of internal flexibility. The three-dimensional structure of apoE-(126–183) was calculated from the NMR data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An ensemble of 388 structures was computed, none of which contained distance restraint violations greater than 0.2 Å nor dihedral angle violations greater than 2°. The 100 structures with the lowest calculated total energy were subsequently selected for further consideration. According to PROCHECK-NMR (37Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4283) Google Scholar), 99.90% of the non-glycine residues have (φ, ψ) angles in the most favored or the additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for these 100 structures (data not shown). Attempts to superimpose the final 100 structures revealed a rather poor convergence. In general, it is well known that proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides are flexible in solution and can adopt multiple conformations. Such conformational flexibility has been shown to be important for biological function. Most structures solved by NMR are usually reported as ensembles of structures fulfilling the experimental restraints to a similar and high extent (38Abseher R. Horstink L. Hilbers C.W. Nilges M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, when the dynamics or motion in a protein is more extensive, conformational families are believed to be a more realistic representation of the protein structure (34Kelly A.L. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 38Abseher R. Horstink L. Hilbers C.W. Nilges M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Brüschweiler R. Blackledge M. Ernst R.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 40Görler A. Ulyanov N.B. James T.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the case of apoE-(126–183), it is apparent that there are several conformationally related subfamilies that all fulfill the experimental restraints after the simulated annealing calculations. To visualize the structural diversity of apoE-(126–183), conformationally related subfamilies of structures were extracted using the program NMRCLUST (34Kelly A.L. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). For clustering, the backbone heavy atoms of residues 149–159, the central core region of the peptide displaying similar R2/R1ratios (see “Discussion” below), were superimposed, and clustering was done on the backbone heavy atoms of residues 132–170. In total, 13 subfamilies of structures were found. Among these, the first five contain 68 of the 100 structures. Each of the other classes contained 5 or fewer structures. The subfamilies could be further divided in two categories as follows: those with their hydrophobic residues on the convex face of the helix, and those with their hydrophobic residues on the concave face of the helix. The first three subfamilies (Fig.3 A) have their hydrophobic residues located on the concave portion of the helix and represent 45 of the 68 structures found in the first 5 subfamilies. The structures in each of the first 3 subfamilies are moderately well defined over the entire helical length with root mean square distributions about the mean coordinate positions of 1.2 Å for subfamily 1, 1.3 Å for subfamily 2, and 1.6 Å for subfamily 3 for backbone atoms of residues 134–168. However, these subfamilies have quite differing degrees of helix curvature. With the hydrophobic face of the helix pointing toward the reader, a van der Waals surface of the representative structure of subfamily 1 is shown in Fig. 3 B. A continuous and almost perfectly aligned surface of hydrophobic residues appears to cover the inside face of the apoE-(126–183) peptide in this conformation. Such a disposition of the hydrophobic residues is well suited for an interaction of this peptide with another hydrophobic surface such as a lipid particle. Arg134, close to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, is the only non-hydrophobic residue in this face of the peptide. To gain insight into the motions of apoE-(126–183) in solution, longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) 15N NMR relaxation times as well as {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs were measured. The R1 (1/T1) and R2 (1/T2) relaxation rates as well as the heteronuclear NOEs at field strengths of 500 and 600 MHz are shown in Fig. 4. R1, R2, and the heteronuclear NOE are useful NMR parameters for probing backbone dynamics on several time scales. Picosecond to nanosecond time scale motions are reflected in all three parameters. Slower millisecond to microsecond time scale motions are manifested in the parameter R2. Of the 58 residues in apoE-(126–183), 50 were used in the backbone dynamics analysis excluding the four overlapping resonances, the three missing resonances (the two N-terminal residues, and the penultimate C-terminal residue) and the C-terminal proline. The 1st panel in Fig. 4 illustrates the R1relaxation rate of apoE-(126–183). For a rigid globular (and hence isotopically tumbling) protein with flexible ends, it is typically observed that the R1 relaxation rates decrease sharply from the flexible N terminus to a plateau value that is maintained for the majority of the protein, ending with a sharp increase for the flexible C-terminal residues. For apoE-(126–183), there appears to be a gradual decrease in the R1 relaxation rate up to approximately residue 149 followed by a gradual increase after approximately residue 159. The 2nd panel illustrates the R2 relaxation rates. For a globular protein, it is typically observed that the R2 relaxation rate will follow the opposite behavior of R1; R2 sharply rises followed by a plateau region and subsequently sharply falls due to flexibility at the N and C termini. For apoE-(126–183), the first and last four residues follow this pattern of the sharp rise and fall. However, for residues 130–148, R2 appears to rise gradually followed by a plateau region from 149–159 followed by a more rapid decrease for residues 160–178. The 3rd panel in Fig. 4 shows the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE for apoE-(126–183). For a rigid globular protein, the heteronuclear NOE should follow a similar pattern to R2. For apoE-(126–183), the NOE rises sharply for the first few residues, followed by a gradual increase up to residue 136. The NOEs stay constant up to residue 156 followed by a slight decreasing trend to residue 179. Often there is a region such as a loop that exhibits higher R1 and lower R2 relaxation rates, which is characteristic of a greater mobility in that portion of the polypeptide chain. For apoE-(126–183), no such regions are observed in the measured relaxation data. In general, relaxation rates are field-dependent: as magnetic field strength increases, R1 decreases, whereas the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE and to a much lesser extent R2 increase. The only parameter sensitive to millisecond to microsecond time scale motions is R2. Large differences in R2 at different field strengths imply that motion is occurring in the millisecond to microsecond time scale. This motion is termed exchange and can arise from structural interconversions or aggregation. It is unlikely that apoE-(126–183) forms an oligomer as these studies were performed in 50% TFE. TFE has a tendency to weaken hydrophobic interactions and has been shown to be a denaturant of quaternary structure (41Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D.

Fig. 4shows typical behavior for a monomeric protein. R1 and NOE show the proper field dependence, whereas R2 shows very little field dependence, ruling out exchange as a mechanism for describing the motions present in apoE-(126–183). The bottom panel in Fig. 4 shows the R2/R1 ratio. In general, R2/R1 ratios are determined by the overall rotational correlation time, assuming the value of R2 is not dominated by exchange (43Kay L.E. Torschia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 44Brutscher B. Brüschweiler R. Ernst R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13043-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the position of the N-H bond vector relative to the diffusion tensor of the protein. ApoE-(126–183) exhibits much larger R2/R1 ratios for the central residues (residues 149–159) than for the termini. Because the lack of field dependence of R2 indicates there are no significant exchange contributions, anisotropic motion was investigated as a source for the large R2/R1 values. Assuming that the protein is an extended helix and can be represented as a prolate ellipsoid, the motion will be anisotropic, and the rotational correlation times along the long axis (∥) and short axis (⊥) will be different. Assuming a diffusion tensor ratio D∥:D⊥ ∼7, expected for an extended helix of 58 residues, values of 0.7 s−1 are calculated for R1, 25 s−1 for R2, and 0.77 for the NOE (45Perrin F. J. Phys. Radium. 1934; 5: 497-511Crossref Google Scholar, 46Perrin F. J. Phys. Radium. 1936; 7: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar, 47Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12562-12566Crossref Scopus (663) Google Scholar). For residues 149–159, the average R1 is 0.95 s−1, R2 is 25 s−1, and the heteronuclear NOE is 0.56. The similarity of calculatedversus experimental values suggests that the motion of apoE-(126–183) approximates that of a prolate ellipsoid, at least for the central residues. The decrease in R2/R1 ratios on either side of the central region (residues 149–159) of the peptide implies that the helix is “fraying” or “unfolding” as one approaches the N or C terminus. To determine the time scales of the motions involved, we undertook a reduced spectral density approach to study the motions along the helix. The spectral densities quantitate the contributions of motions at various frequencies obtainable from the NMR experiment. Fig.5 illustrates the reduced spectral density functions J(0), J(ωN), andJ(0.87ωH), which describe the motion of the H-N bonds, derived from the relaxation parameters R1, R2, and {1H}-15N NOE. The spectral density function at zero frequency, J(0), is sensitive to motions on all time scales (48Viles J.H. Donne D. Kroon G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2743-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The high frequency spectral density functions, J(ωN) andJ(0.87ωH), are sensitive to fast internal motions on the time scales of 1/ωN and 1/wH, respectively. Large J(0.87ωH) (greater than 15 ps/rad) indicate fast internal motions, whereas spectral densities less than 7.5 ps/rad indicate a lack of internal flexibility (48Viles J.H. Donne D. Kroon G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2743-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 indicates the relative inflexibility of the central region of the peptide, especially on the faster time scales. Residues 144–162 exhibit J(0.87ωH) lower than 7.5 ps/rad, whereas J(0) is consistently above 7 ns/rad for residues 149–162. Not surprisingly, the first four residues, 127–130, and the last sev"

We investigated in vivoand in cultured cells the contribution of the intronic regulatory sequences and their interaction with the promoter elements in controlling aldolase B gene expression. Transgene activity was completely abolished by disruption of the two hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding sites in the enhancer, whereas mutation of one HNF1 site had no effect in the liver but strongly decreased activity in the kidney. Our data show that the HNF1 binding site(s) in the enhancer were key regulators of aldolase B transgene expression both in the liver and kidney. Deletion of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein site in the promoter completely abolished the enhancer function in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that expression of the aldolase B gene in the liver requires cooperative interactions between CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and HNF1. Deletion of the HNF4 binding site in the enhancer suppressed expression in both liver and kidney in half of the transgenic lines, suggesting that this element might play a role in chromatin opening at the insertion site. We firmly establish that the endogenous aldolase B gene's first response to glucagon or cyclic AMP exposure was a transient increase in the expression in the liver, followed by a secondary decline in the transcription, as previously reported. This response was reproduced by all transgenes studied, indicating that neither HNF1 nor HNF4 binding sites in the enhancer were involved in this biphasic cyclic AMP response.

The expression of the aldolase B gene is subject to tissue-specific, hormonal, and metabolic regulation. The adult liver expresses the aldolase B gene exclusively, whereas the kidney and enterocytes co-express both aldolase A and B genes (1Weber A. Marie J. Cottreau D. Simon M.P. Besmond C. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1798-1802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the liver, transcription of the aldolase B gene is induced by a carbohydrate-rich diet and inhibited by fasting and glucagon, whereas, in the kidney, it is almost unresponsive to dietary and hormonal regulation (2Munnich A. Besmond C. Darquy S. Reach G. Vaulont S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, even in the liver, the expression of the aldolase B gene is never completely abolished. In addition, it is restimulated after prolonged starvation. 1C. Gregori, A. Porteu, C. Mitchell, A. Kahn, and A.-L. Pichard, unpublished data. 1C. Gregori, A. Porteu, C. Mitchell, A. Kahn, and A.-L. Pichard, unpublished data. This behavior may reflect the dual role of aldolase B in hepatocytes, where it is required for the opposite glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. Finally, hereditary fructose intolerance is a recessive genetic disease caused by aldolase B deficiency. Repeated ingestion of noxious sugars by homozygotes leads to hepatic and renal injury (3Ali M. Rellos P. Cox T.M. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 35: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), with metabolic disturbances (including low concentrations of blood glucose) that may prove fatal (4Cox T.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The aldolase B gene proximal promoter (−194 to +14) is sufficient to direct cell type-specific expression in cultured hepatoma cells, but in mice a distal intronic enhancer fragment (+1916 to +2324) is required for transgene expression (5Sabourin J.C.

We have previously studied both these regions extensively (6Raymondjean M. Pichard A.L. Gregori C. Ginot F. Kahn A.

Their respective contributions to promoter activity and enhancer function were investigated by transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)2 assays in HepG2 hepatoma cells. The main findings were as follows. The promoter activity was up-regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) and CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), but repressed by hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) (7Gregori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The enhancer function was abolished by mutation or deletion of either of the two HNF1 binding sites and reduced by deletion of the HNF4 binding site (9Gregori C. Porteu A. Lopez S. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25237-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Figure 3Analysis of the element in the promoter required for enhancer function. At the top is an illustration of the wild-type construct with the location of the regulatory elements and transcription factors known to bind to these sites. 7.5 μg of the indicated constructs mutated in the promoter linked or not linked to the enhancer fragment were transfected into HepG2 cells with 2.5 μg of the reference plasmid RSV luciferase. CAT activity was normalized with respect to the transfection efficiency by measuring luciferase activity. Results give the ratio of the CAT activity of the construct with and without the enhancer fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Dietary regulation of a transgene directed by 1600 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the aldolase B gene and the first intron appeared paradoxical; it was down-regulated by a high carbohydrate diet and stimulated by prolonged fasting (5Sabourin J.C. Kern A.S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.P. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to explain these results, we hypothesized that the endogenous gene possessed distinct glucose-dependent and fasting-dependent responsive elements, only the latter being present in the transgenic construct. The objective of the current study was to assess, in a chromosomalin vivo context, the contribution of the different DNA elements of the intronic enhancer to the tissue-specific expression and metabolic regulation of the transgenes. Our results demonstrate a major contribution of the HNF1 enhancer binding sites to the tissue-specific expression of the aldolase B gene. Deletion of the two HNF1 binding sites suppressed transgene expression in both liver and kidney. In contrast, mutation in one HNF1 site did not significantly affect transgene expression in the liver but resulted in a 100-fold loss of activity in the kidney. Findings suggested that the differential role of the HNF1 sites in the different organs could be related to the abundance of C/EBP in the liver compared with the kidney. Indeed, we show that a C/EBP binding site previously identified in the proximal promoter is crucial for maximal expression in hepatocytes. Deletion of the HNF4 site seemed to render the transgene activity more dependent on the insertion site, silencing it completely in about half of the transgenic lines. Finally, we demonstrate that transgene activation by fasting could be mimicked by glucagon and dibutyryl cAMP, but we have so far failed to delineate a cyclic AMP response element in the enhancer. Aldolase B-CAT constructs used have been previously described (9Gregori C. Porteu A. Lopez S. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25237-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A presents a diagram of the aldolase B-CAT gene, indicating the main cis-acting elements and cognate DNA-binding proteins. The enhancer fragment (residues 1916–2329) was maintained in an intronic position; the splice sites are indicated by the boldface brackets. Fig.1 B shows the microinjected constructs indicating the locations of the block mutations or deletions performed in the aldolase B enhancer. Fig. 3 schematizes various constructs with deletions or mutations in the promoter. Here, the enhancer fragment was subcloned in the ClaI site located downstream of the CAT gene (8Gregori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The DNA constructs were digested with restriction enzymes ClaI (cutting in 3′ in the vector) and Hind III (cutting in 5′ in the plasmid linker). The fragments of interest were isolated by electrophoresis, electroeluted, and purified by using elutip-d columns (Schleicher and Schuell) and then microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs according to Gordon and Ruddle (10Gordon J.W. Ruddle F.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 411-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The progeny was analyzed for the presence of the transgene by Southern blot. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 μml-triiodothyronine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 10 nm insulin at 37° in 5% (v/v) CO2. Transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (11Graham F.L. Eb A.J.v.d. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar), under experimental conditions previously described (9Gregori C. Porteu A. Lopez S. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25237-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In each experiment, 7.5 μg of the CAT plasmids and 2 μg of the luciferase plasmid were cotransfected. The pRSV luciferase standardization plasmid was used to monitor variations in transfection efficacy. The CAT assay (12Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) and luciferase assay (13de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of adult transgenic mice carrying the −232A100B400 wild-type transgene by perfusion with collagenase (14Mitchell C. Mignon A. Guidotti J.E. Besnard S. Fabre M. Duverger N. Parlier D. Tedgui A. Kahn A. Gilgenkrantz H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1597-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Viable hepatocytes were separated from other cells using isodensity Percoll centrifugation (15Kreamer B.L. Staecker J.L. Sawada N. Sattler G.L. Hsia M.T. Pitot H.C. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (>95% viability) were seeded at a density of 3.5 × 106 cells/dish (78 cm2). After cell attachment (4 h), the medium was replaced by M199 medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen) containing 20 mmglucose, supplemented with 1 μml-triiodothyronine, 1 μm dexamethasone, 10 nm insulin at 37 °C in 5% (v/v) CO2 for 3 days. The culture medium was changed every 24 h. Cells were then cultured in the same medium either with or without 3.3 mg/liter glucagon and 3.3 mg/liter theophylline. Adult mice heterozygous for the transgene were used for analysis. One group of mice was fasted for 24 h prior to sacrifice; the other group was fasted for 24 h and then refed a high carbohydrate diet ad libitumfor 18 h prior to sacrifice. Organs were stored at −80 °C until use. To determine the effect of cAMP or glucagon, mice were either starved for 18 h or fed a high carbohydrate diet ad libitum for 18 h and then injected intraperitoneally every hour with either dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) (30 mg/kg of body weight) or glucagon (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) with theophylline (30 mg/kg of body weight) and sacrificed after 2 or 4 h of treatment, and then tissues were removed and kept at −80 °C until use. The mRNA extraction from liver, kidney, and cultured hepatocytes was performed using the RNAzol B reagent (Bioprobe Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through a 1.5% (w/v) denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA probes were labeled by random priming using a labeling kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CAT cDNA probe was aClaI-EcoRI fragment of the PeCAT vector (5Sabourin J.C.

The murine aldolase B probe was a 379-bp fragment of cDNA, and the phosphoenolpyruvate kinase (PEPCK) probe was a 1305-bp fragment of cDNA (a gift of Dr. B Antoine (16Vallet V. Bens M. Antoine B. Levrat F. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Vandewalle A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Full and tissue-specific expression of the aldolase B transgenes results from a cooperation between a proximal promoter and a distal intronic enhancer (5Sabourin J.C. Kern A.S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.P. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enhancer activity is provided by a 400-bp sequence (residues 1916–2329) containing binding sites for known liver-enriched nuclear factors HNF1 (residues 2212–2246 and 2275–2304), HNF4 (residues 2146–2184), and unknown factor (residues 2195 to +2220). We analyzed the contribution of each of the cis-acting elements to the expression of the aldolase B gene in vivo. For this purpose, chimeric genes that contained the wild-type aldolase B promoter (−232A100) linked to either wild-type or mutant aldolase B enhancer in its normal intronic position were ligated to the CAT gene (Fig.1). Fig. 2shows the results of the expression of the CAT transgenes directed by aldolase B gene regulatory sequences in the liver and kidney. Expression of the aldolase B-CAT transgenes was strictly restricted to the liver, kidney, and small intestine (not shown); no ectopic expression was detected in other tissues tested (e.g. brain and lung) (not shown). In agreement with prior data (5Sabourin J.C. Kern A.S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.P. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the level of transgene expression was totally independent of the copy number and strongly dependent on the integration site. Among the six lines harboring the wild-type aldolase B-CAT transgene, one was very weakly expressed. The HNF1-mut transgene carries a 5-bp block mutation of the 5′ HNF1 binding site (enhancer element 5). In five lines with this construct, transgene expression was conserved in the liver (although weak in two of the line) and was very low in the kidney (a decrease on average of 100-fold compared with the wild-type construct). Among 16 lines harboring a transgene with deletion of enhancer element 7 (i.e. the 3′ HNF1 binding site), only one expressed CAT activity in the liver and, very weakly, in the kidney (Fig. 2). None of the nine lines harboring the transgene with deletion of both HNF1 binding sites (construct Δ5–7) expressed CAT activity either in the liver or in the kidney (data not shown). Twelve lines harboring a Δ2 transgene with a deletion of the HNF4 binding site (enhancer element 2) were generated. In five lines, transgene expression was undetectable; in one it was weak, and in the other six it was strong. Finally, expression of a transgene with deletion of enhancer element 4, which binds a liver-enriched but uncharacterized factor (9Gregori C. Porteu A. Lopez S. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25237-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was much higher than that of the wild-type transgene and had a high CAT activity in both liver and kidney in four lines and a lower activity in one line (Fig. 2). The differential effect of the 5′ HNF1 binding site deletion from the enhancer on transcriptional activity in different cells and tissues could reflect tissue-specific differences in transcription factor content. We focused on transcription factors previously demonstrated to be active on aldolase B gene expression. The C/EBP factor was a good candidate, since its concentration is high in the liver, low in HepG2 cells, and almost zero in the kidney (17Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPs like HNF1 are potent transactivators of the aldolase B promoter (7Gregori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). If our hypothesis is correct, overexpression of C/EBP in HepG2 cells should restore transcriptional activity of constructs with mutation or deletion of one of the enhancer HNF1 binding sites. Indeed, when HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with the wild-type aldolase B-CAT plasmid and a C/EBP expression vector, CAT activity was stimulated only 5-fold. In contrast, under the same conditions, the HNF1-mut and Δ7 constructs were stimulated about 200-fold (Table I). Next, we wanted to ascertain whether the C/EBP binding site (−170 to −140) in the aldolase B promoter mediated the observed C/EBP effect. In fact, a construct devoid of the enhancer sequence and with deletion of the C/EBP binding site in the promoter (−140A100) responded 10-fold less to C/EBP than the −232A100 promoter (Table I). We think that the residual transactivation was due to promiscuous binding properties of C/EBP, able, at high concentration, to bind to degenerated, low affinity sites. Finally, in the absence of the C/EBP element in the promoter (140A100B400wild), the enhancer activity was abolished.Table IEffect of CIEBP-α overexpression on activity of aldolase B CAT vectors containing an impaired HNF1 binding site in the enhancer−232A100−232A100B400wild−232A100B400 HNF1“mut”−232A100B400 Δ7−140A100−140A100B400wildWithout C/EBP-α70 ± 252003 ± 31254 ± 964 ± 1150 ± 1946 (3)With C/EBP-α15,000 (4)10,794 (4)10,268 (4)10,355 (4)1500 (4)2439 (3)Hep G2 cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of aldolase B CAT vectors, 2.5 μg of luciferase plasmid, and, when indicated, 2.5 μg of expression vector for C/EBP-α.

Open table in a new tab Hep G2 cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of aldolase B CAT vectors, 2.5 μg of luciferase plasmid, and, when indicated, 2.5 μg of expression vector for C/EBP-α. CAT activity was normalized according to transfection efficiency by measuring the luciferase activity. When more than four independent experiments were performed, results are given as means ± SE; otherwise, the means are given, with the number of experiments in parentheses. These results point to a specific role of C/EBP in the cooperation between the promoter and the intronic enhancer of the aldolase B gene. In order to determine whether C/EBP bound to promoter must specifically interact with other contiguous factors to cooperate with the enhancer, we studied the CAT activity of a series of new constructs transfected into HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). These constructs included, from 5′ to 3′, the promoter fragment, the CAT gene, and the enhancer. Fig. 3 shows that the enhancer stimulated the activity of the 190-bp wild-type promoter 30-fold. Deletion of the HNF4 binding site from the promoter did not change this stimulation. Deletion or mutation of the PAB element suppressing binding of either HNF1 or HNF3 or both HNF1 and HNF3 seemed rather to increase the stimulatory effect of the enhancer. Finally, as expected, all mutants devoid of the promoter C/EBP binding site were weakly sensitive to the enhancer action. When the PAB element was replaced by a high affinity HNF1, the enhancer lost practically all stimulatory activity, most likely because the C/EBP/HNF1 interaction between promoter and enhancer is replaced by the same type of interaction inside the promoter. Northern blot analysis of transgene expression as a function of diet was performed on at least two different mouse lines for each transgene. Feeding mice a high carbohydrate diet stimulates aldolase B gene transcription in liver, whereas starvation decreases its expression (Ref. 2Munnich A. Besmond C. Darquy S. Reach G. Vaulont S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). Prior transgenic analysis indicated that a transgene with 1600 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence and the whole first intron responds to diet in an opposite manner (5Sabourin J.C. Kern A.S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C. Chatelet F.P. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3469-3473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Northern blots in Fig. 4 demonstrate that exactly the same expression pattern was reproduced using the “wild-type” construct with only 232 bp of the promoter and the 400-bp intronic enhancer. HNF1 mut, Δ2, and Δ4 transgenes were also induced in mice fasted for 24 h and inhibited in mice refed a high carbohydrate diet. Therefore, the investigated enhancer elements do not seem to be implicated in the long term dietary regulation of the aldolase B gene in the liver. The dietary response of the aldolase B transgenes resembles that of neoglucogenic genes such as the PEPCK gene. Since such genes are known to be responsive to glucagon and cAMP, we tested the effects of the hormone and of cAMP analogues on the expression of the −232A100B400wild-CAT transgene. Fig.5 A shows that Bt2cAMP induced parallel accumulation of PEPCK and CAT transgenic mRNA 2 and 4 h after injection into carbohydrate-fed mice. In fasted mice, these messengers were already abundant before Bt2cAMP treatment; consequently, the Bt2cAMP effect was weak or nil (Fig. 5 B). As expected, the effect of Bt2cAMP in stimulating the transgene was mimicked by glucagon (Fig. 5 C). The response to glucagon was conserved for the Δ2 and HNF1-mut transgenes, characterized by a deleted HNF4 binding site and a mutated HNF1 binding site, respectively (not shown). Although the endogenous aldolase B gene has been described rather as a typical “glycolytic gene,” up-regulated by carbohydrates and down-regulated by fasting and glucagon (2Munnich A. Besmond C. Darquy S. Reach G. Vaulont S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the results observed with the aldolase B-CAT transgenes prompted us to reevaluate more precisely the response of the endogenous gene to glucagon. Fig. 5 C shows that, in fact, endogenous aldolase B mRNA accumulated 2 and 4 h after glucagon administration to carbohydrate-fed animals, in parallel with accumulation of the PEPCK mRNA. In primary hepatocytes isolated from the liver of mice bearing the −232A100B400wild-CAT transgene and cultured for 3 days in the presence of 25 mm glucose and 20 nm insulin, the addition of glucagon led first to aldolase B mRNA accumulation, with a peak at 3 h and thereafter a decline. Aldolase B and PEPCK mRNA inductions were parallel. In contrast, the response of the aldolase B-CAT transgene was delayed, with a peak at 24 h (Fig.6). Tissue-specific transcription of the aldolase B gene is governed by a short 200-bp promoter stimulated by a 400-bp intronic enhancer (5Sabourin J.C. Kern A.S. Gregori C. Porteu A. Cywiner C.

In previous studies using transient transfection assays, both the promoter and the enhancer were shown to be cell-specific (9Gregori C. Porteu A. Lopez S. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1991; 176: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The nuclear factors mainly involved in liver-specific gene transcription include HNF1 (19Courtois G. Baumhueter S. Crabtree G.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and albamin D element binding protein (24Lichtsteiner S. Schibler U. Cell. 1989; 57: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Both the aldolase B gene promoter and the enhancer fragments contain HNF1 and HNF4 binding sites; in addition, a binding site for C/EBP is present in the promoter. Therefore, the aldolase B gene was an attractive model for identifying, in vivo, the promoter and enhancer elements necessary for tissue-specific, dietary-regulated gene expression. In the present study, we have shown that mutation of the 5′ HNF1 binding site in the enhancer, preventing binding of HNF1, reduced expression of the transgene (−232A100B400HNF1mut) in the kidney but did not alter its transcription in the liver. A similar role for HNF1 in the differential control of PEPCK gene transcription in the liver and kidney has been reported (25Patel Y.M. Yun J.S. Liu J. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5619-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the aldolase B gene was normally transcribed in the liver (26Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and in the kidney of HNF1 knock-out mice. 3M. Pontoglio and M. Yaniv, personal communication. However, these results are not inconsistent with our own data, since the two isoforms HNF1α and HNF1β, binding to the same element, are coexpressed in the liver and the kidney, HNF1β being increased by a compensatory mechanism in HNF1α −/− (26Pontoglio M. Barra J. Hadchouel M. Doyen A. Kress C. Bach J.P. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Cell. 1996; 84: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Deletion of the second HNF1 site in the enhancer (element 7) led to an inactive transgene in 11 of the 12 lines tested. In the only line expressing the −232 A100B400Δ7 transgene, expression was weak but easily detectable in the liver and almost nil in the kidney, which confirms that here again abrogation of the HNF1 binding site has a more severe effect in the kidney than in the liver. Since the mutation in the first HNF1 site changed 5 bp whereas deletion of the second site excised 47 bp from the transgene, we cannot deduce from our results that the two HNF1 binding sites in the enhancer play different roles. Indeed, it could be that the 47-bp sequence binds factors other than HNF1 or destroys a binding site 5′ to the deletion, although we did not detect such a site either by in vivo footprinting (9Gregori C. Porteu A. Lopez S. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25237-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or by gel shift analysis (not shown). A transgene deleted from the HNF4 site was silent in both livers and kidneys in half of the mouse lines. It is possible that the HNF4 mutation affects the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling factors (27Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 28Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the −232A100B400Δ2 transgene could remain silent when inserted into a closed chromatin region and would be active when integrated into a permissive, open chromatin region. Although both HNF1 (29Soubt M.K. Marksitzer R. Menoud P.A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12108-12118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and HNF4 binding sites (31You M. Fischer M. Cho W.K. Crabb D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 398: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Angrand P.O. Coffinier C. Weiss M.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 957-966PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to play a role in the response of some genes to cAMP, the corresponding elements present in the enhancer do not seem to be involved in the dietary and hormonal regulation of the aldolase B gene. Indeed, the response of our mutated transgenes to fasting and cAMP was conserved. To explain the differential effect of enhancer HNF1 binding site mutations according to the cells and tissues, we hypothesized that HNF1 is involved in a cooperative interaction of the enhancer with another DNA element able to bind a factor differentially abundant in the liver, hepatoma cells, and kidneys. C/EBPα, present and abundant in adult hepatocytes, at low concentration in hepatoma cells, and essentially absent from kidney (33Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), is a good candidate. Mouse models also suggest a major role for C/EBPα in liver-specific expression of aldolase B. The liver of albino lethal mice shows reduced aldolase B and C/EBP levels (34Ruppert S. Boshart M. Bosch F.X. Schmid W. Fournier R.E. Schutz G. Cell. 1990; 61: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas other transcription factors are normally expressed. In contrast, aldolase B is normally expressed in the kidney of these animals. Aldolase B gene expression is also depressed in the liver of C/EBP α−/− mice (35Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A C/EBP binding site (−170 to −140) has been characterized in the aldolase B promoter (6Raymondjean M. Pichard A.L. Gregori C. Ginot F. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and both C/EBP and HNF1 have been shown to be potent transactivators of the promoter (7Gregori C. Kahn A. Pichard A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To confirm that the different levels of C/EBP in different tissues could account for the tissue-specific ciseffects of the enhancer HNF1 binding sites, we studied by transient transfection in HepG2 cells the inducibility by C/EBPα of aldolase B-CAT constructs carrying either the wild-type enhancer or enhancers devoid of one of the two HNF1 binding sites. The constructs with mutations of the HNF1 binding site(s) in the enhancer were highly responsive to overexpression of C/EBP (100-fold induction) compared with the 5-fold induction of the construct with an intact enhancer. Furthermore, deletion of the C/EBP site in the promoter impaired the enhancer function, whereas mutations or deletions of the other known sites (binding HNF1, HNF3, or HNF4), alone or in combination, did not affect the enhancer function. These findings suggest that liver-specific expression of the aldolase B gene requires cooperation between the C/EBP site in the promoter and at least one HNF1 site in the enhancer. In contrast, expression in the kidney (lacking C/EBP) requires the presence of the two enhancer HNF1 binding sites. Cooperation between HNF1 and C/EBP in the control of gene expression in the liver has already been reported for the PEPCK gene (25Patel Y.M. Yun J.S. Liu J. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5619-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (36Faust D.M. Catherin A.M. Barbaux S. Belkadi L. Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3125-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the apolipoprotein B gene (37Brooks A.R. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1134-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the albumin gene (38Wu K.J. Wilson D.R. Shih C. Darlington G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1177-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that neither HNF1 nor HNF4 binding sites mediate the aldolase B gene regulation by fasting and cAMP. However, C/EBP was a possible alternative candidate, since its involvement in the response to cAMP has been established for several genes, in particular the PEPCK gene (39Crosson S.M. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, although the wild-type aldolase B-CAT construct was perfectly responsive to glucagon in hepatocytes isolated from transgenic mice, the same construct transiently transfected into HepG2 cells was insensitive to cAMP. This insensitivity could not be reversed by cotransfection with expression vectors C/EBPα and/or the protein kinase A catalytic subunit. Consequently, further experiments will be needed to determine whether C/EBP and C/EBP-binding sites are involved in the regulation of the aldolase B gene by fasting, glucagon, and cAMP. The observed early stimulation of both transgenes and the endogenous aldolase B gene by glucagon in hepatocytes in primary culture prompted us to reevaluate our previous presentation of this gene as being negatively regulated by glucagon and cAMP (2Munnich A. Besmond C. Darquy S. Reach G. Vaulont S. Dreyfus J.C. Kahn A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In fact, our former results were taken from mRNA measurements performed 12–24 h after glucagon administration. We now find that the early positive response to glucagon, maximal at the 3rd hour, is followed by a decline that reached undetectable levels at the 24th hour. Accordingly, the transcription rate of the aldolase B gene measured by run-on assay showed first a transient increase in transcription 10 min after glucagon injection, followed by transcriptional inhibition (41Vaulont S. Munnich A. Marie J. Reach G. Pichard A.L. Simon M.P. Besmond C. Barbry P. Kahn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hormonal regulation of the aldolase B gene reflects its dual role in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon and cAMP are involved in hypoglycemic and stress conditions in which a rapid increase in glucose production is essential. This requires, in particular, a transient increase in aldolase B gene transcription, leading to an increase in mRNA and enzyme abundance. However, this gene must also be stimulated to allow for a proper adaptation to a shift from a carbohydrate-poor to a carbohydrate-rich diet. As previously discussed, the regulatory domains responsible for the response to cAMP (and fasting) are retained in the −232A100B400CAT transgene, while the region required for the positive response to carbohydrates is absent from this construct. In conclusion, we report in this paper the complex, tissue-specific functional interplay between the promoter and intronic enhancer of the aldolase B gene, which can be considered to be both a glycolytic and gluconeogenic gene."
