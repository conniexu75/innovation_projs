https://openalex.org/W3128849750,"Monitoring animals in their natural habitat is essential for advancement of animal behavioural studies, especially in pollination studies. Non-invasive techniques are preferred for these purposes as they reduce opportunities for research apparatus to interfere with behaviour. One potentially valuable approach is image-based tracking. However, the complexity of tracking unmarked wild animals using video is challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments. Out-of-the-box algorithms currently present several problems in this context that can compromise accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion in a 3D environment. To address the issue, we present a novel hybrid detection and tracking algorithm to monitor unmarked insects outdoors. Our software can detect an insect, identify when a tracked insect becomes occluded from view and when it re-emerges, determine when an insect exits the camera field of view, and our software assembles a series of insect locations into a coherent trajectory. The insect detecting component of the software uses background subtraction and deep learning-based detection together to accurately and efficiently locate the insect among a cluster of wildflowers. We applied our method to track honeybees foraging outdoors using a new dataset that includes complex background detail, wind-blown foliage, and insects moving into and out of occlusion beneath leaves and among three-dimensional plant structures. We evaluated our software against human observations and previous techniques. It tracked honeybees at a rate of 86.6% on our dataset, 43% higher than the computationally more expensive, standalone deep learning model YOLOv2. We illustrate the value of our approach to quantify fine-scale foraging of honeybees. The ability to track unmarked insect pollinators in this way will help researchers better understand pollination ecology. The increased efficiency of our hybrid approach paves the way for the application of deep learning-based techniques to animal tracking in real-time using low-powered devices suitable for continuous monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3127852329,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of a variety of cancers, however their therapeutic potential is limited by abstruse immune related adverse events. Currently, no robust animal model exists of checkpoint inhibitor-induced adverse events. Establishing such a model will improve our mechanistic understanding of this process, which in turn will inform design of improved therapies. We developed a mouse model to determine inflammatory toxicities in response to dual checkpoint blockade in the presence of syngeneic tumors. Mice from susceptible genetic backgrounds received intraperitoneal injections of anti-mouse PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies. The mice were monitored for weight loss and histologic evidence of inflammation. Blood was collected for basic metabolic panels and titers of anti-nuclear antibodies. In parallel, mice were also treated with prednisolone, which is commonly used to treat immune related adverse events among cancer patients. Among all the genetic backgrounds, B6/lpr mice treated with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies developed more substantial hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, and pneumonitis characterized by organ infiltration of immune cells. Mice that developed tissue infiltration demonstrated high serum levels of glucose and high titers of anti-nuclear antibodies. Finally, while administration of prednisolone prevented the development of the inflammatory adverse events, it also abrogated the protective anti-tumor effect of the checkout inhibitors. Genetic background and treatment modalities jointly modified the inflammatory adverse events in tumor bearing mice, suggesting a complex mechanism for checkpoint inhibitor-related inflammation. Future studies will assess additional genetic susceptibility factors and will examine possible contributions from the administration of other anti-inflammatory drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3127521476,"This prospective study evaluated the accuracy of non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (niPGT-A) using cell-free DNA in spent culture medium, as well as that of preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) using trophectoderm (TE) biopsy after culturing beyond implantation. Twenty frozen blastocysts donated by 12 patients who underwent IVF at our institution were investigated. Of these, 10 were frozen on day 5 and 10 on day 6. Spent culture medium and TE cells were collected from each blastocyst after thawing, and the embryos were cultured in vitro for up to 10 days. The outgrowths after culturing beyond implantation were sampled and subjected to chromosome analysis using next-generation sequencing. Chromosomal concordance rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false-positive rate (FPR), and false-negative rate (FNR) of niPGT-A and PGT-A against each outgrowth were analyzed. The concordance rate between the niPGT-A and outgrowth samples was 9/16 (56.3%), and the concordance rate between the PGT-A and outgrowth samples was 7/16 (43.8%). NiPGT-A exhibited 100% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, 88.9% PPV, 100% NPV, 12.5% FPR, and 0% FNR. PGT-A exhibited 87.5% sensitivity, 77.8% specificity, 87.5% PPV, 75% NPV, 14.3% FPR, and 22.2% FNR. NiPGT-A may be more accurate than PGT-A in terms of ploidy diagnostic accuracy in outgrowths."
https://openalex.org/W3127964405,"There is a paucity of population health data on the experiences of transgender, non-binary, and other gender minority gay, bisexual, and queer men, and Two-Spirit people in Canada. To address this gap, this article presents a socio-demographic and health profile of trans and non-binary participants from the community-based bilingual 2018 Sex Now Survey. Participants were recruited in-person from Pride festivals in 15 communities to self-complete an anonymous paper-and-pen questionnaire. To be eligible, participants needed to be at least 15 years old, live in Canada, either report a non-heterosexual sexual identity or report sex with a man in the past 5 years, and not report gender identity as a woman. Through community consultations the survey was inclusive of trans men, non-binary people, and Two-Spirit people. Three gender groups (cisgender, transgender, and non-binary) were created, and trans and non-binary participants were compared with their cisgender peers across a variety of demographic, mental health, sexual health, and general health indicators. Odds ratios were calculated to determine initial significance for categorical variables, and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to control for five possible confounders (age, ethnoracial identity, country of birth, sexual identity, and financial strain). Significant differences emerged across all sets of indicators, with many of these findings remaining significant after adjusting for confounding variables, including significantly higher reported rates of mental health challenges and sexual health service barriers for trans and non-binary participants compared to the cisgender group. Trans and non-binary participants were also more likely to be in polyamorous relationships. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that trans and non-binary people experience significant disadvantages compared with cisgender sexual minority men. Improved educational supports and employment protections, access to queer and gender affirming healthcare, and trauma-informed mental health services are needed to improve the health wellbeing of trans and non-binary people in Canada."
https://openalex.org/W3128124126,"Housing value is a major component of the aggregate expenditure used in the analyses of welfare status of households in the development economics literature. Therefore, an accurate estimation of housing services is important to obtain the value of housing in household surveys. Data show that a significant proportion of households in a typical Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS), adopted by the Word Bank and others, are self-owned. The standard approach to predict the housing value for such surveys is based on the rental cost of the house. A hedonic pricing applying an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is normally used to predict rental values. The literature shows that Machine Learning (ML) methods, shown to uncover generalizable patterns based on a given data, have better predictive power over OLS applied in other valuation exercises. We examined whether or not a class of ML methods (e.g. Ridge, LASSO, Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting) provided superior prediction of rental value of housing over OLS methods accounting for spatial autocorrelations using household level survey data from Uganda, Tanzania, and Malawi, across multiple years. Our results showed that the Machine Learning methods (Boosting, Bagging, Forest, Ridge and LASSO) are the best models in predicting house values using out-of-sample data set for all the countries and all the years. On the other hand, Tree regression underperformed relative to the various OLS models, over the same data sets. With the availability of abundant data and better computing power, ML methods provide viable alternative to predicting housing values in household surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3127578386,"Purpose OCT-angiography (OCT-A) offers a non-invasive method to visualize retinochoroidal microvasculature. As glaucoma disease affects retinal ganglion cells in the macula, macular microcirculation is of interest. The purpose of the study was to investigate regional macular vascular characteristics in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT), pre-perimetric primary open-angle glaucoma (pre-POAG) and controls by OCT-A in three microvascular layers. Material and methods 180 subjects were recruited from the Erlangen Glaucoma Registry, the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Erlangen and residents: 38 OHT, 20 pre-POAG, 122 controls. All subjects received an ophthalmological examination including measurements of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), retinal ganglion cell layer (RGC), inner nuclear layer (INL), and Bruch’s Membrane Opening-Minimum Rim Width (BMO-MRW). Macular vascular characteristics (vessel density, VD, foveal avascular zone, FAZ) were measured by OCT-A (Spectralis OCT II) in superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP). Results With age correction of VD data, type 3 tests on fixed effects showed a significant interaction between diagnosis and sectorial VD in SVP (p = 0.0004), ICP (p = 0.0073), and DCP (p = 0.0003). Moreover, a significance in sectorial VD was observed within each layer (p&lt;0.0001) and for the covariate age (p&lt;0.0001). FAZ differed significantly between patients’ groups only in ICP (p = 0.03), not in SVP and DCP. For VD the AUC values of SVP, ICP, and DCP were highest among diagnostic modalities (AUC: 0.88, 95%-CI: 0.75–1.0, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Regional reduced macula VD was observed in all three retinal vascular layers of eyes with OHT and pre-POAG compared to controls, indicating localized microvascular changes as early marker in glaucoma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3128467383,"Hybrid physics-machine learning models are increasingly being used in simulations of transport processes. Many complex multiphysics systems relevant to scientific and engineering applications include multiple spatiotemporal scales and comprise a multifidelity problem sharing an interface between various formulations or heterogeneous computational entities. To this end, we present a robust hybrid analysis and modeling approach combining a physics-based full order model (FOM) and a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) to form the building blocks of an integrated approach among mixed fidelity descriptions toward predictive digital twin technologies. At the interface, we introduce a long short-term memory network to bridge these high and low-fidelity models in various forms of interfacial error correction or prolongation. The proposed interface learning approaches are tested as a new way to address ROM-FOM coupling problems solving nonlinear advection-diffusion flow situations with a bifidelity setup that captures the essence of a broad class of transport processes."
https://openalex.org/W3127014057,"Cigarette smoking patterns vary within the population, with some individuals remaining never smokers, some remaining occasional users, and others progressing to daily use or quitting. There is little research on how population-level tobacco control policy interventions affect individuals within different smoking trajectories. We identified associations between tobacco control policy interventions and changes across different smoking trajectories among adolescents and young adults. Using 15 annual waves of data drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), we applied a group-based trajectory model to identify associations between days smoked per month, comprehensive smoke-free laws, cigarette tax rates, and known socio-demographic risk factors for membership in different smoking trajectories. Comprehensive smoke-free laws were associated with reduced risk of initiation and reductions in days smoked per month for all trajectories other than occasional users. Higher tax rates were associated with reduced risk of initiation and days smoked for all trajectories other than established users. Overall, population-based tobacco control policies, particularly comprehensive smoke-free laws, were associated with reduced smoking. Tobacco taxes primarily reduced risk of initiation and use among never smokers, experimenters, and quitters, consistent with previous research suggesting that tobacco manufacturers lower prices after tax increases to reduce the cost of continued smoking for established users. These results provide support for expanding smoke-free laws and establishing a minimum tobacco floor price, which could improve public health by reducing the risk of initiation as well as use among occasional and established smokers."
https://openalex.org/W3128802291,"Background Stromal reaction is an important prognostic factor in several cancers, and the presence of myxoid change was assessed as a poor prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, the prognostic significance of myxoid change in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of myxoid change and fibrotic focus (FF), which is a fibrotic area within the tumor and considered a poor prognostic indicator in patients with TNBC. Methods We enrolled 62 patients with TNBC and reviewed the surgically resected specimens to evaluate myxoid change and FF in the tumor using previously outlined criteria. We evaluated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) using hematoxylin and eosin slides. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were compared based on the presence of myxoid change and/or FF, and the risk factors for RFS were analyzed. Results Myxoid change and FF were observed in 25.8% and 33.9% of specimens, respectively. Based on stromal lymphocyte infiltration, 19 patients (30.6%) had high TILs, while the remaining 43 patients (69.4%) had low/intermediate TILs. Presence of myxoid change was significantly correlated with poor OS and RFS ( p = 0 . 040 and 0 . 031 , respectively). FF was also significantly correlated with poor OS and RFS ( p = 0 . 012 and 0 . 028 , respectively). The combination of myxoid change and FF was an independent and poor prognostic factor according to the multivariate analysis (HR 11.61; 95% CI 1.027–131.2; p = 0 . 048 ). Presence of myxoid change and FF were significantly associated with low/intermediate TILs in the stroma ( p = 0 . 013 ). Conclusions Histopathological assessment of myxoid change and FF in TNBC may be a useful, practical, and easily assessable method for predicting prognosis in patients with TNBC, which should be confirmed in larger prospective studies. Diagnostic criteria for the establishment of myxoid change and FF in TNBC must be established, and their underlying molecular events must be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W3126692498,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that emerged in the late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It caused a worldwide outbreak and a major threat to global health. It is important to design prediction and control strategies to restrain its exploding. In this study, a hybrid intelligent model is proposed to simulate the spreading of COVID-19. First, considering the effect of control measures, such as government investment, media publicity, medical treatment, and law enforcement in epidemic spreading. Then, the infection rates are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) and a modified susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered (SIQR) epidemic spreading model is proposed. In addition, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is imbedded into the SIQR model to design the hybrid intelligent model to further optimize other parameters of the system model, which can obtain the optimal predictive model and control measures. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid intelligence algorithm has good predictive ability. This study provide a reliable model to predict cases of infection and death, and reasonable suggestion to control COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3128153796,"The effects of nutrient and mechanical sensing on gut motility and intestinal metabolism in lower vertebrates remains largely unknown. Here we present the transcriptome response to luminal stimulation by nutrients and an inert bolus on nutrient response pathways and also the response on gut motility in a stomachless fish with a short digestive tract; the ballan wrasse ( Labrus berggylta ). Using an in vitro model, we differentiate how signals initiated by physical stretch (cellulose and plastic beads) and nutrients (lipid and protein) modulate the gut evacuation rate, motility patterns and the transcriptome. Intestinal stretch generated by inert cellulose initiated a faster evacuation of digesta out of the anterior intestine compared to digestible protein and lipid. Stretch on the intestine upregulated genes associated with increased muscle activity, whereas nutrients stimulated increased expression of several neuropeptides and receptors which are directly involved in gut motility regulation. Although administration of protein and lipid resulted in similar bulbous evacuation times, differences in intestinal motility, transit between the segments and gene expression between the two were observed. Lipid induced increased frequency of ripples and standing contraction in the middle section of the intestine compared to the protein group. We suggest that this difference in motility was modulated by factors [prepronociceptin ( pnoca ), prodynorphin ( pdyn ) and neuromedin U ( nmu ), opioid neurotransmitters and peptides] that are known to inhibit gastrointestinal motility and were upregulated by protein and not lipid. Our findings show that physical pressure in the intestine initiate contractions propelling the bolus distally, directly towards the exit, whereas the stimuli from nutrients modulates the motility to prolong the residence time of digesta in the digestive tract for optimal digestion."
https://openalex.org/W3128926251,"Recent research promotes comparing the current state of the environment with the past (and not the future) to increase the pro-environmental attitudes of those on the political right. We aimed to replicate this temporal framing effect and extend on research in this area by testing the potential drivers of the effect. Across two large-scale replication studies, we found limited evidence that past comparisons (relative to future comparisons) increase pro-environmentalism among those with a more conservative political ideology, thus precluding a full investigation into the mediators of the effect. Where the effect was present, it was not consistent across studies. In Study One, conservatives reported greater certainty that climate change was real after viewing past comparisons, as the environmental changes were perceived as more certain. However, in Study Two, the temporal framing condition interacted with political orientation to instead undermine the certainty about climate change among political liberals in the past-focused condition. Together, these studies present the first evidence of backfire from temporal frames, and do not support the efficacy of past comparisons for increasing conservatives’ environmentalism. We echo recent calls for open science principles, including preregistration and efforts to replicate existing work, and suggest the replication of other methods of inducing temporal comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W3126649755,"NUDIX hydrolase type 5 (NUDT5) is a kind of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase and nucleotide metabolizing enzyme in cell metabolism. Previous studies have shown NUDT5 expression affected chromosome remodeling, involved in cell adhesion, cancer stem cell maintenance and epithelial to mesenchyme transition in breast cancer cells. Nevertheless, the role of NUDT5 in breast cancer progression and prognosis has not yet been systematically studied. This study explored the association of NUDT5 with the tumor development and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Our results show that the levels of NUDT5 were upregulated in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissues, and the expression of NUDT5 in breast tumor tissues increased significantly when compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. Breast cancer patients with high NUDT5 expression had a worse prognosis than those with low expression of NUDT5. In addition, the knockdown of NUDT5 suppressed breast cancer cell lines proliferation, migration and invasion, and dramatically inhibited the AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and expression of Cyclin D1. The opposite effects were observed in vitro following NUDT5 rescue. Our findings indicated that the high expression of NUDT5 is probably involved in the poor prognosis of breast cancer via the activation of the AKT / Cyclin D pathways, which could be a prognostic factor and potential target in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3127793042,"Global warming is expected to have direct effects on species through their sensitivity to temperature, and also via their biotic interactions, with cascading indirect effects on species, communities, and entire ecosystems. To predict the community-level consequences of global climate change we need to understand the relative roles of both the direct and indirect effects of warming. We used a laboratory experiment to investigate how warming affects a tropical community of three species of Drosophila hosts interacting with two species of parasitoids over a single generation. Our experimental design allowed us to distinguish between the direct effects of temperature on host species performance, and indirect effects through altered biotic interactions (competition among hosts and parasitism by parasitoid wasps). Although experimental warming significantly decreased parasitism for all host-parasitoid pairs, the effects of parasitism and competition on host abundances and host frequencies did not vary across temperatures. Instead, effects on host relative abundances were species-specific, with one host species dominating the community at warmer temperatures, irrespective of parasitism and competition treatments. Our results show that temperature shaped a Drosophila host community directly through differences in species’ thermal performance, and not via its influences on biotic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3128912509,"Objective In recent years the social media offers a handy platform for patients who want to receive medical information. The aim of this study is to assess the content of YouTube as an information source on space maintainers and to evaluate the efficiency of videos by parents and patients. Methods and findings YouTube was searched for information using two keywords ‘space maintainer’ and ‘space maintainers in pediatric dentistry’. Two dentists reviewed the first 200 videos for each search term. After exclusions, 52 videos were included for analysis. Demographics of videos, including the type of source, date of upload, length, viewers’ interaction and viewing rate were evaluated. The overall usefulness of videos was scored according to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry Guideline based on 9-point scales. The mean usefulness score of evaluated videos was 4,4 ± 1,5 (range 1–8). There was a significant correlation between usefulness and video length (p&lt;0,05). But there was no significant correlation between usefulness and other demographics. Most videos were uploaded by healthcare professionals (51.9%). Videos uploaded by individual users were less useful compared with videos uploaded by healthcare professionals or organizations. Most of the videos (88,5%) used representative images for visualizing. Conclusions YouTube videos about space maintainers are useful for parents only to understand and visualize their function. However, it does not provide sufficient information about adverse effects and types of them. Dentists should warn their patients that videos on the internet may contain incorrect and limited information."
https://openalex.org/W3126212708,"In Australian prisons approximately 20% of inmates are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), providing an important population for targeted treatment and prevention. A dynamic mathematical model of HCV transmission was used to assess the impact of increasing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment uptake on HCV incidence and prevalence in the prisons in New South Wales, Australia, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternate treatment strategies. We developed four separate models reflecting different average prison lengths of stay (LOS) of 2, 6, 24, and 36 months. Each model considered four DAA treatment coverage scenarios of 10% (status-quo), 25%, 50%, and 90% over 2016–2045. For each model and scenario, we estimated the lifetime burden of disease, costs and changes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in prison and in the community during 2016–2075. Costs and QALYs were discounted 3.5% annually and adjusted to 2015 Australian dollars. Compared to treating 10% of infected prisoners, increasing DAA coverage to 25%, 50%, and 90% reduced HCV incidence in prisons by 9–33% (2-months LOS), 26–65% (6-months LOS), 37–70% (24-months LOS), and 35–65% (36-months LOS). DAA treatment was highly cost-effective among all LOS models at conservative willingness-to-pay thresholds. DAA therapy became increasingly cost-effective with increasing coverage. Compared to 10% treatment coverage, the incremental cost per QALY ranged from $497-$569 (2-months LOS), -$280–$323 (6-months LOS), -$432–$426 (24-months LOS), and -$245–$477 (36-months LOS). Treating more than 25% of HCV-infected prisoners with DAA therapy is highly cost-effective. This study shows that treating HCV-infected prisoners is highly cost-effective and should be a government priority for the global HCV elimination effort."
https://openalex.org/W3126491610,"Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy that occurs in sheep. Atypical/Nor98 scrapie occurs in sheep that tend to be resistant to classical scrapie and it is thought to occur spontaneously. The purpose of this study was to test the transmission of the Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent in three genotypes of Suffolk sheep and characterize the distribution of misfolded prion protein (PrP Sc ). Ten sheep were intracranially inoculated with brain homogenate from a sheep with Atypical/Nor98 scrapie. All sheep with the ARQ/ARQ and ARQ/ARR genotypes developed Atypical/Nor98 scrapie confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and one sheep with the VRQ/ARQ genotype had detectable PrP Sc consistent with Atypical/Nor98 scrapie at the experimental endpoint of 8 years. Sheep with mild early accumulations of PrP Sc in the cerebellum had concomitant retinal PrP Sc . Accordingly, large amounts of retinal PrP Sc were identified in clinically affected sheep and sheep with dense accumulations of PrP Sc in the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W3126501721,"Rhinogobius gigas is an amphidromous fish endemic to eastern Taiwan. Fishes with the diadromous behavior are expected to have a broader distribution range and higher genetic homogeneity despite that some amphidromous fishes with limited distribution are observed and R . gigas is an additional exception with a limited distribution range. Rhinogobius gigas has been documented to be retained inshore near the river plume with a short pelagic larval duration of 30–40 days, which may account for the endemism of this species. The short marine larval stage of R . gigas may imply a population genetic structure and the aim of the present study is to test whether the population genetic structure is present in R . gigas . To test the population genetic structure, fragments of mitochondrial displacement loop and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I were sequenced to provide molecular inference for genetic structure among populations. Sixty-nine haplotypes were identified among 191 R . gigas from 10 populations of eastern Taiwan and the mean haplotype and nucleotide diversities for all samples were 0.956 and 0.0024, respectively, implying a bottleneck followed by a recent population expansion further supported by Fu’s Fs (-26.6; p &lt; 0.001) and Tajima’s D (-1.5; p = 0.037) values. The phylogenetic analysis revealed lack of genetic structure and the bush-like median joining network without commonly shared haplotypes supports the same scenario. The genetic homogeneity is probably due to the amphidromous life history providing the opportunity for passive larval transportation among the rivers through coastal currents in eastern Taiwan. The endemism to eastern Taiwan may be a consequence of complicated interactions among short pelagic larval duration, interspecific competition and coastal currents."
https://openalex.org/W3128064292,"The pectinolytic genus Dickeya (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi ) comprises numerous pathogenic species which cause diseases in various crops and ornamental plants across the globe. Their pathogenicity is governed by complex multi-factorial processes of adaptive virulence gene regulation. Extracellular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides present on bacterial envelope surface play a significant role in the virulence of phytopathogenic bacteria. However, very little is known about the genomic location, diversity, and organization of the polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters in Dickeya . In the present study, we report the diversity and structural organization of the group 4 capsule (G4C)/O-antigen capsule, putative O-antigen lipopolysaccharide, enterobacterial common antigen, and core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis clusters from 54 Dickeya strains. The presence of these clusters suggests that Dickeya has both capsule and lipopolysaccharide carrying O-antigen to their external surface. These gene clusters are key regulatory components in the composition and structure of the outer surface of Dickeya . The O-antigen capsule/group 4 capsule (G4C) coding region shows a variation in gene content and organization. Based on nucleotide sequence homology in these Dickey a strains, two distinct groups, G4C group I and G4C group II, exist. However, comparatively less variation is observed in the putative O-antigen lipopolysaccharide cluster in Dickeya spp . except for in Dickeya zeae . Also, enterobacterial common antigen and core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis clusters are present mostly as conserved genomic regions. The variation in the O-antigen capsule and putative O-antigen lipopolysaccharide coding region in relation to their phylogeny suggests a role of multiple horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. These multiple HGT processes might have been manifested into the current heterogeneity of O-antigen capsules and O-antigen lipopolysaccharides in Dickeya strains during its evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3128418477,"Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent one of the major sequelae of obesity. On the other hand, the relationship between bone diseases and obesity remains unclear. An increasing number of biological and epidemiological studies suggest the presence of a link between atherosclerosis and osteoporosis, however, the precise molecular pathways underlying this close association remain poorly understood. The present work thus aimed to study Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), as a proposed link between atherosclerosis and osteoporosis in high fat diet fed rats. Methods and findings 40 rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, untreated atherosclerosis group, atherosclerotic rats treated with carvedilol (10mg/kg/d) and atherosclerotic rats treated with alendronate sodium (10mg/kg/d). After 8 weeks, blood samples were collected for estimation of Lipid profile (Total cholesterol, HDL, TGs), inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP and NO) and Bone turnover markers (BTMs) (Alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and pyridinoline). Rats were then euthanized and the aortas and tibias were dissected for histological examination and estimation of MMP-9, N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and NF-kB expression. Induction of atherosclerosis via high fat diet and chronic stress induced a significant increase in BTMs, inflammatory markers and resulted in a state of dyslipidaemia. MMP-9 has also shown to be significantly increased in the untreated atherosclerosis rats and showed a significant correlation with all measured parameters. Interestingly, Carvedilol and bisphosphonate had almost equal effects restoring the measured parameters back to normal, partially or completely. Conclusion MMP-9 is a pivotal molecule that impact the atherogenic environment of the vessel wall. A strong cross talk exists between MMP-9, cytokine production and macrophage function. It also plays an important regulatory role in osteoclastogenesis. So, it may be a key molecule in charge for coupling CVD and bone diseases in high fat diet fed rats. Therefore, we suggest MMP-9 as a worthy molecule to be targeted pharmacologically in order to control both conditions simultaneously. Further studies are needed to support, to invest and to translate this hypothesis into clinical studies and guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3127367284,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies develop within two weeks of infection, but wane relatively rapidly post-infection, raising concerns about whether antibody responses will provide protection upon re-exposure. Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory."
https://openalex.org/W3127489992,"Globally the burden due to mental disorders is continuously increasing. Still, professional help-seeking behavior is not fully understood. To conceive cultural determinants of help-seeking is crucial to reduce personal and social costs of (untreated) mental disorders. The current study investigates mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes in a Cuban ( n = 195) and a German ( n = 165) sample. In a questionnaire survey we asked for attitudes towards mental illness and professional help-seeking in the general Cuban and German populations. The cultural context was associated with mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes. Interestingly, Cuban participants reported stronger mental health stigma and more willingness to seek help. In multiple hierarchical regression analyses, community attitudes towards the mentally ill significantly predicted help-seeking attitudes, especially in the Cuban sample. Only in the German sample, more negative individual beliefs about mental illness predicted more self-stigma on help-seeking. Beyond that, cultural context moderated the association between mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes with a stronger association between the measures in the German sample. However, gender did not predict help-seeking attitudes and self-stigma on help-seeking and no interactions between community attitudes, cultural context, and gender were found in the prediction of help-seeking attitudes. Similarities and differences between the samples are discussed in the light of the cultural contexts and peculiarities of the current samples. Concluding, implications of the current findings are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W3128401617,"Identifying social determinants of tobacco and alcohol use during pregnancy is critical to improving health outcomes for the next generation. This is especially important on a rural Tribal Nation where influences such as isolation, cultural barriers, and historical trauma have made it uniquely challenging to prevent substance use during pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to identify population-specific factors that are protective against smoking and drinking during pregnancy. We used data from 421 pregnancies collected as a part of the Safe Passages study from a rural Tribal Nation in the central United States. Pregnant women were classified as women who did not smoke (n = 84), women who quit during pregnancy (n = 23), women who smoked during pregnancy (n = 314), and women who both smoked and drank alcohol during pregnancy (n = 149). Demographic data revealed that 28.8% of the mothers were currently employed, and 91.8% of mothers reported a household income of less than $3,000 per year. Substance use rates were higher than national averages: 74.6% smoked during pregnancy and 35.4% of the women both smoked and drank alcohol during pregnancy. Five factors were identified as being protective against substance use during pregnancy: 1) living with someone (81% less likely to smoke and 92% less likely to smoke and drink), 2) having at least 12 years of education (128% less likely to smoke, and 126% less likely to smoke and drink), 3) having over 12 years of education (235% less likely to smoke, and 206% less likely to smoke and drink), 4) being employed (158% less likely to smoke, and 111% less likely to smoke and drink), and 5) not being depressed (214% less likely to smoke, and 229% less likely to smoke and drink). These social determinants should be considered for intervention research to decrease rates of substance use during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3126627714,"Objectives Surgery for acute type A aortic dissection is associated with several perioperative complications, such as acute respiratory dysfunction (ARD). The aim of this study was to investigate perioperative risk factors involved in the development of ARD and whether antibiotic treatment has an impact. Methods 243 patients underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection between 2008 and 2017. The patients were retrospectively divided into the ARD and NON-ARD group. ARD was defined as PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 200 mmHg (PF ratio) within 48 hours after surgery. All patients received either narrow- or broad-spectrum antibiotics. Results After the exclusion of 42 patients, 201 patients were analyzed. The PF ratio of the ARD group was significantly lower than of the NON-ARD group within the first 7 days. ARD patients (n = 111) were significantly older ( p = .031) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) ( p = .017). ARD patients required longer postoperative ventilation (2493 vs. 4695 [min], p = .006) and spent more days in the intensive care unit (7.0 vs. 8.9 [days], p = .043) compared to NON-ARD. The mortality was significantly lower for ARD than for NON-ARD patients ( p = .030). The incidence of pneumonia was independent of the antibiotic treatment regime ( p = .391). Renal and neurological complication rate was higher in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic. Conclusion ARD is the main complication (55%) that occurs approximately 24 hours after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. The preoperative risk factors for ARD were higher age and increased BMI. Patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics did not show an improved postoperative outcome compared to patients with narrow-spectrum antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3126809843,"Providing surgical margin information during breast cancer surgery is crucial for the success of the procedure. The margin is defined as the distance from the tumor to the cut surface of the resection specimen. The consensus among surgeons and radiation oncologists is that there should be no tumor left within 1 to maximum 2 mm from the surface of the surgical specimen. If a positive margin remains, there is substantial risk for tumor recurrence, which may also result in potentially reduced cosmesis and eventual need for mastectomy. In this paper we report a novel multimodal optical imaging instrument based on combined high-resolution confocal microscopy-optical coherence tomography imaging for assessing the presence of potential positive margins on surgical specimens. Since rapid specimen analysis is critical during surgery, this instrument also includes a fluorescence imaging channel to enable rapid identification of the areas of the specimen that have potential positive margins. This is possible by specimen incubation with a cancer specific agent prior to imaging. In this study we used a quenched contrast agent, which is activated by cancer specific enzymes, such as urokinase plasminogen activators (uPA). Using this agent or a similar one, one may limit the use of high-resolution optical imaging to only fluorescence-highlighted areas for visualizing tissue morphology at the sub-cellular scale and confirming or ruling out cancer presence. Preliminary evaluation of this technology was performed on 20 surgical specimens and testing of the optical imaging findings was performed against histopathology. The combination of the three imaging modes allowed for high correlation between optical image analysis and histological ground-truth. The initial results are encouraging, showing instrument capability to assess margins on clinical specimens with a positive predictive value of 1.0 and a negative predictive value of 0.83."
https://openalex.org/W3127257798,"Objective To study the epidemiology and outcomes of delirium among hospitalized patients in Zambia. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, from October 2017 to April 2018. The primary exposure was delirium duration over the initial 3 days of hospitalization, assessed daily using the Brief Confusion Assessment Method. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. Secondary outcomes included 6-month disability, evaluated using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Findings 711 adults were included (median age, 39 years; 461 men; 459 medical, 252 surgical; 323 with HIV). Delirium prevalence was 48.5% (95% CI, 44.8%-52.3%). 6-month mortality was higher for delirious participants (44.6% [39.3%-50.1%]) versus non-delirious participants (20.0% [15.4%-25.2%]; P &lt; .001). After adjusting for covariates, delirium duration independently predicted 6-month mortality and disability with a significant dose-response association between number of days with delirium and odds of worse clinical outcome. Compared to no delirium, presence of 1, 2 or 3 days of delirium resulted in odds ratios for 6-month mortality of 1.43 (95% CI, 0.73–2.80), 2.20 (1.07–4.51), and 3.92 (2.24–6.87), respectively ( P &lt; .001). Odds of 6-month disability were 1.20 (0.70–2.05), 1.73 (0.95–3.17), and 2.80 (1.78–4.43), respectively ( P &lt; .001). Conclusion Among hospitalized medical and surgical patients in Zambia, delirium prevalence was high and delirium duration independently predicted mortality and disability at 6 months. This work lays the foundation for prevention, detection, and management of delirium in low-income countries. Long-term follow up of outcomes of critical illness in resource-limited settings appears feasible using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule."
https://openalex.org/W3128562551,"Background Faecal calprotectin (FCP) is a powerful tool to predict inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. In the paediatric patient population, the reference value of &lt; 50 μg/g and the influence of age on FCP levels result in a high number of redundant investigations and specialist referrals. We assessed paediatric FCP levels, their diagnostic value and corresponding referral pathways from primary and secondary care. Methods We analysed two cohorts from a precisely defined catchment area: one consisted of all FCPs measured in this area (n = 2788). The second cohort—a subset of the first cohort—consisted of FCP values and corresponding clinical data from children who were referred for possible IBD to our department (n = 373). Results In the first cohort, 47% of FCP levels were &gt; 50 μg/g, 15% were ≥ 250 μg/g. Children &lt; 1y had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher FCP than older children. In the second cohort, 6.7% of children with an FCP of &lt; 250 μg/g (or 8.6% with an FCP of &lt; 600 μg/g) had IBD–all featured symptoms suggestive of IBD (e.g. bloody diarrhoea, nocturnal abdominal pain, weight loss) or abnormal blood tests. 76% of patients in whom raised FCP (&gt; 50 μg/g) was the sole reason for being referred for suspected IBD did not have IBD. Conclusion Children with an FCP &lt; 600 μg/g and without matching symptoms suggestive of IBD are unlikely to have IBD. A higher FCP reference value may provide cost-effective improvement that could avoid redundant investigations and specialist referrals. A guideline for specialist referrals is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W3128593080,"In high-density aquaculture, fish health can suffer because of excessive feeding, which causes fatty liver disease. Siberian ginseng ( Acanthopanax senticosus ) has been used as a feed additive to promote animal growth, immunity, and lipid metabolism. In this study, we explored the effects of A . senticosus on the physiology of hybrid yellow catfish ( Tachysurus fulvidraco ♀ × Pseudobagrus vachellii ♂ ). A control group and five groups fed diets containing A . senticosus (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 g A . senticosus /kg feed) were established and maintained for 8 weeks. Dietary supplementation with A . senticosus at 4 g/kg promoted growth of the hybrid yellow catfish. Serum total cholesterol (TC) and triacylglycerol (TG) levels at 2 g/kg A . senticosus (TC: 1.31 mmol/L; TG: 1.08 mmol/L) were significantly lower than in the control group (TC: 1.51 mmol/L; TG: 1.41 mmol/L), and 4 g/kg A . senticosus (17.20 μmol/g tissue) reduced the liver TG level compared with the control group (21.36 μmol/g tissue) ( P &lt;0.05). Comparative transcriptomic analysis of liver tissue between the control group and the group showing optimum growth (4 g/kg A . senticosus ) revealed 820 differentially expressed genes and 44 significantly enriched pathways, especially lipid metabolism pathways such as unsaturated fatty acid and fatty acid metabolism. The transcript levels of five lipid metabolism-related genes were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that 2–4 g/kg A . senticosus supplementation reduced the FADS2 , ELOVL2 , CYP24a , and PLPP3 transcript levels and 4 g/kg A . senticosus increased the DIO2 transcript level ( P &lt;0.05), leading to altered synthesis of TG and thyroxine and reduced fat deposition in the liver. Our results show that dietary A . senticosus affects the regulation of fat metabolism and promotes the growth of hybrid yellow catfish. A . senticosus is a healthy feed additive, and the appropriate dietary supplementation rate is 2–4 g/kg."
https://openalex.org/W3126527782,"Objective Previous reports have indicated that serum bilirubin levels may be associated with diabetic retinopathy. However, the detailed mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the severity of diabetic retinopathy and various factors including bilirubin levels and factors influencing bilirubin metabolism. Methods The study participants consisted of 94 consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus admitted to Kyushu University Hospital from April 2011 to July 2012. The patients were classified into three groups: no retinopathy (NDR), simple retinopathy (SDR), and pre-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy (PDR). The relationship between the severity of retinopathy and various factors was evaluated using univariate and logistic regression analyses. In addition, multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the significant determinants for bilirubin levels. Results In univariate analysis, a significant difference was found among NDR, SDR and PDR in bilirubin levels, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and macroalbuminuria. Logistic regression analysis showed that PDR was significantly associated with bilirubin levels, duration of diabetes, and systolic blood pressure (OR 0.737, 95% CI 0.570–0.952, P = 0.012; OR 1.085, 95% CI 1.024–1.149, P = 0.006; OR 1.036, 95% CI 1.011–1.062, P = 0.005, respectively). In turn, multivariate regression analysis showed that bilirubin levels were negatively associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and PDR, but positively correlated with urinary biopyrrin levels, oxidized metabolites of bilirubin. Conclusion PDR was negatively associated with bilirubin levels. This negative association may be due to a decreased production of bilirubin rather than its increased consumption considering the positive association between bilirubin and biopyrrin levels."
https://openalex.org/W3126964788,"Background Older adults represent 70–90% of seasonal influenza-related deaths and 50–70% of influenza-related hospitalizations. Vaccination is the most efficient means of preventing influenza and reducing influenza-related illnesses. We aimed to describe knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of seasonal influenza vaccination among older adults in Honduras. Methods From August 29–October 26, 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional KAP survey regarding seasonal influenza vaccinations to samples of older adults 1) admitted to nursing homes and 2) attending daycare centers. We used the Minimental State Examination (MMSE) psychometric tool to assess the cognitive status of older adults and included participants with scores of ≥23 points in the survey. We reported frequency distributions for demographics, KAP of influenza virus and vaccination, and vaccination coverage. We used logistic regression to analyze associations between demographics and verified influenza vaccination. Results Of 511 MMSE participants, 341 completed the survey (95 adults in 12 nursing homes and 246 older adults in ten daycare centers). Almost all participants knew that influenza causes severe illness and may be transmitted from person to person, vaccination is safe and protects against disease, and older adults have greater risk of complications. Of 284 participants with verified vaccinations, 81.3% were vaccinated for influenza: 87.9% attending daycare centers and 61.4% in nursing homes. Among all participants, verified current influenza vaccination was associated with self-reported influenza vaccination in previous year (aOR: 14.05; 95% CI: 5.36–36.81); no formal education (aOR: 4.83; 95% CI: 1.63–14.37) or primary school education (aOR: 4.51; 95% CI: 1.79–11.37) having ≥secondary as reference; and indigenous (aOR: 4.55; 95% CI: 1.18–17.49) having Mestizo as reference. Reasons for vaccination were perceived self-benefits, protection against influenza complications, favorable vaccination hours, and healthcare provider recommendations. Conclusion Four-fifths of older adults were vaccinated for seasonal influenza. Educational efforts provided in conjunction with vaccination campaigns resulted in high knowledge of influenza virus, transmission, and vaccination. Further outreach regarding disease risks and vaccine safety needs to be directed towards older adults in nursing homes who had lower knowledge and coverage than older adults in daycare centers."
https://openalex.org/W3127507830,"This study reports on the application of a Portfolio Decision Analysis (PDA) to support investment decisions of a non-profit funder of vaccine technology platform development for rapid response to emerging infections. A value framework was constructed via document reviews and stakeholder consultations. Probability of Success (PoS) data was obtained for 16 platform projects through expert assessments and stakeholder portfolio preferences via a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). The structure of preferences and the uncertainties in project PoS suggested a non-linear, stochastic value maximization problem. A simulation-optimization algorithm was employed, identifying optimal portfolios under different budget constraints. Stochastic dominance of the optimization solution was tested via mean-variance and mean-Gini statistics, and its robustness via rank probability analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation. Project PoS estimates were low and substantially overlapping. The DCE identified decreasing rates of return to investing in single platform types. Optimal portfolio solutions reflected this non-linearity of platform preferences along an efficiency frontier and diverged from a model simply ranking projects by PoS-to-Cost, despite significant revisions to project PoS estimates during the review process in relation to the conduct of the DCE. Large confidence intervals associated with optimization solutions suggested significant uncertainty in portfolio valuations. Mean-variance and Mean-Gini tests suggested optimal portfolios with higher expected values were also accompanied by higher risks of not achieving those values despite stochastic dominance of the optimal portfolio solution under the decision maker’s budget constraint. This portfolio was also the highest ranked portfolio in the simulation; though having only a 54% probability of being preferred to the second-ranked portfolio. The analysis illustrates how optimization modelling can help health R&amp;D decision makers identify optimal portfolios in the face of significant decision uncertainty involving portfolio trade-offs. However, in light of such extreme uncertainty, further due diligence and ongoing updating of performance is needed on highly risky projects as well as data on decision makers’ portfolio risk attitude before PDA can conclude about optimal and robust solutions."
https://openalex.org/W3128480256,"Following the pioneering efforts of a federal Head Start program, U.S. state policymakers have rapidly expanded access to Early Care and Education (ECE) programs with strong bipartisan support. Within the past decade the enrollment of 4 year-olds has roughly doubled in state-funded preschool. Despite these public investments, the content and priorities of early childhood legislation–enacted and failed–have rarely been examined. This study integrates perspectives from public policy, political science, developmental science, and machine learning in examining state ECE bills in identifying key factors associated with legislative success. Drawing from the Early Care and Education Bill Tracking Database, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a statistical topic identification model, to examine 2,396 ECE bills across the 50 U.S. states during the 2015-2018. First, a six-topic solution demonstrated the strongest fit theoretically and empirically suggesting two meta policy priorities: ‘ECE finance’ and ‘ECE services’. ‘ECE finance’ comprised three dimensions: (1) Revenues, (2) Expenditures, and (3) Fiscal Governance. ‘ECE services’ also included three dimensions: (1) PreK, (2) Child Care, and (3) Health and Human Services (HHS). Further, we found that bills covering a higher proportion of HHS, Fiscal Governance, or Expenditures were more likely to pass into law relative to bills focusing largely on PreK, Child Care, and Revenues. Additionally, legislative effectiveness of the bill’s primary sponsor was a strong predictor of legislative success, and further moderated the relation between bill content and passage. Highly effective legislators who had previously passed five or more bills had an extremely high probability of introducing a legislation that successfully passed regardless of topic. Legislation with expenditures as policy priorities benefitted the most from having an effective legislator. We conclude with a discussion of the empirical findings within the broader context of early childhood policy literature and suggest implications for future research and policy."
https://openalex.org/W3127435215,"Background Influenza during pregnancy may cause serious neonatal outcomes including stillbirth, fetal distress, preterm birth, congenital abnormalities, and stunted growth. Pregnant women are the highest priority group for seasonal influenza vaccination, but low coverage has been repeatedly reported in this population. Understanding reasons for and for not receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine is needed to design communication strategies to increase vaccination coverage. This study aimed to describe knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of seasonal influenza vaccination among women giving birth in public maternity hospitals in Honduras. Methods From August 20–October 8, 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional KAP survey regarding seasonal influenza vaccinations to a sample of postpartum women who gave birth in maternity hospitals and clinics from the Ministry of Health of Honduras and Honduran Social Security Institute. We reported frequency distributions for demographics, KAP of influenza vaccine, and vaccination coverage. We used logistic regression to analyze unadjusted and adjusted associations between sociodemographic characteristics and influenza vaccination. Results We surveyed 842 postpartum women in 17 healthcare facilities. Of 534 postpartum women with term pregnancy and verified vaccinations, 417 (78.1%; 95% CI: 74.6–81.6%) were vaccinated for influenza. Factors associated with verified influenza vaccination included receipt of vaccination recommendations by a healthcare worker during prenatal check-ups (aOR: 16.46; 95% CI: 9.73–27.85), concurrent chronic disease (aOR: 5.00; 95% CI: 1.25–20.07), and influenza vaccination of other children in the household (aOR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.19–4.39). The most cited reasons for vaccination were perceived benefits for both mother and infant and easy access. Reasons for non-vaccination were: vaccine was not offered and fear of side effects, harm to the infant, and needles or pain caused by injection. Conclusion Influenza vaccination was well received among postpartum women in Honduras. Increasing clinician recommendations for vaccination and assuring the vaccine is readily available to women during prenatal visits may increase vaccination rates."
https://openalex.org/W3127749396,"We describe a novel approach to estimating the predictability of utterances given extralinguistic context in psycholinguistic research. Predictability effects on language production and comprehension are widely attested, but so far predictability has mostly been manipulated through local linguistic context, which is captured with n -gram language models. However, this method does not allow to investigate predictability effects driven by extralinguistic context. Modeling effects of extralinguistic context is particularly relevant to discourse-initial expressions, which can be predictable even if they lack linguistic context at all. We propose to use script knowledge as an approximation to extralinguistic context. Since the application of script knowledge involves the generation of prediction about upcoming events, we expect that scrips can be used to manipulate the likelihood of linguistic expressions referring to these events. Previous research has shown that script-based discourse expectations modulate the likelihood of linguistic expressions, but script knowledge has often been operationalized with stimuli which were based on researchers’ intuitions and/or expensive production and norming studies. We propose to quantify the likelihood of an utterance based on the probability of the event to which it refers. This probability is calculated with event language models trained on a script knowledge corpus and modulated with probabilistic event chains extracted from the corpus. We use the DeScript corpus of script knowledge to obtain empirically founded estimates of the likelihood of an event to occur in context without having to resort to expensive pre-tests of the stimuli. We exemplify our method at a case study on the usage of nonsentential expressions ( fragments ), which shows that utterances that are predictable given script-based extralinguistic context are more likely to be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3128328439,"Older adults are at increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and HZ vaccines are available to help prevent infection. The objective of our study was to provide updated data on incidence of HZ and PHN related to clinical and demographic factors in older adults to inform immunization practices. We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study and included all cases of HZ seen in outpatient, emergency department, and hospital settings for adults aged 65 years and over between April 1, 2002 to August 31, 2016 in Ontario, Canada. We calculated the incidence of HZ and PHN, and estimated the proportion within each subgroup that developed PHN. We also assessed incidence by neighbourhood-level income quintile before and after the availability of vaccine for private purchase. The average annual incidence of HZ in any setting was 59.0 per 10,000 older adults, with higher incidence in outpatient as opposed to hospital settings. Incidence was higher in the oldest age groups, females, and those classified as immunocompromised or frail. Relative to the pre-vaccine era, the disparities in incidence of HZ by neighbourhood-level income increased, with higher rates of HZ and PHN seen in those residing in lower income quintiles. Additional prevention efforts should be targeted toward adults who are immunocompromised, frail, and those living in lower socioeconomic quintiles. Future work should assess the impact of the zoster vaccine program with a particular focus on equity in the publicly-funded era."
https://openalex.org/W3128429881,"Discharge reduction, as caused by water diversion for hydropower, and fine sediments deposition, are prevalent stressors that may affect multiple ecosystem functions in streams. Periphytic biofilms play a key role in stream ecosystem functioning and are potentially affected by these stressors and their interaction. We experimentally assessed the interactive effects of discharge and fine sediments on biofilm metabolism in artificial indoor channels using a factorial split-plot design with two explanatory variables: water discharge (20, 39, 62, 141 and 174 cm 3 s -1 ) and fine sediments (no sediment or 1100 mg L -1 of sediments). We incubated artificial tiles for 25 days in an unpolluted stream to allow biofilm colonization, and then placed them into the indoor channels for acclimation for 18 days. Subsequently, we manipulated water discharge and fine sediments and, after 17 days, we measured biofilm chlorophyll-a concentration and metabolism. Water velocity (range, 0.5 to 3.0 cm s -1 ) and sediment deposition (range, 6.1 to 16.6 mg cm -2 ) increased with discharge, the latter showing that the effect of increased inputs prevailed over sloughing. In the no-sediment treatments, discharge did not affect biofilm metabolism, but reduced chlorophyll-a. Sediments, probably as a consequence of nutrients released, promoted metabolism of biofilm and chlorophyll-a, which became independent of water discharge. Our results indicate that pulses of fine sediments can promote biofilm algal biomass and metabolism, but show interactive effects with discharge. Although discharge reduction can affect the abundance of basal resources for food webs, its complex interactions with fine sediments make it difficult to forecast the extent and direction of the changes."
https://openalex.org/W3128820939,"When making decisions involving risk, people may learn about the risk from descriptions or from experience. The description-experience gap refers to the difference in decision patterns driven by this discrepancy in learning format. Across two experiments, we investigated whether learning from description versus experience differentially affects the direction and the magnitude of a context effect in risky decision making. In Study 1 and 2, a computerized game called the Decisions about Risk Task (DART) was used to measure people’s risk-taking tendencies toward hazard stimuli that exploded probabilistically. The rate at which a context hazard caused harm was manipulated, while the rate at which a focal hazard caused harm was held constant. The format by which this information was learned was also manipulated; it was learned primarily by experience or by description. The results revealed that participants’ behavior toward the focal hazard varied depending on what they had learned about the context hazard. Specifically, there were contrast effects in which participants were more likely to choose a risky behavior toward the focal hazard when the harm rate posed by the context hazard was high rather than low. Critically, these contrast effects were of similar strength irrespective of whether the risk information was learned from experience or description. Participants’ verbal assessments of risk likelihood also showed contrast effects, irrespective of learning format. Although risk information about a context hazard in DART does nothing to affect the objective expected value of risky versus safe behaviors toward focal hazards, it did affect participants’ perceptions and behaviors—regardless of whether the information was learned from description or experience. Our findings suggest that context has a broad-based role in how people assess and make decisions about hazards."

This study aimed to identify the main areas of the health-related quality of life environment domain that are affected in patients with myositis. Methods A qualitative study was performed using focus groups and applying the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Participants were recruited from a cohort of 323 adult inflammatory myopathy patients consulting at a reference center for idiopathic inflammatory myopathy in Spain, selected by the maximum variation strategy, and placed in focus groups with 5 to 7 patients per group. The number of focus groups required was determined by data saturation. Results Twenty-five patients distributed in 4 focus groups were interviewed. The verbatim provided 54 categories directly related with environmental factors. Those associated with products or substances for personal consumption (e110), health professionals (e355), health services , systems and policies (e580), products and technology for personal use in daily living (e115), and immediate family (e310) were the ones most frequently reported. Conclusion The results of this study led to identification of several environmental factors that affect the health-related quality of life of patients with myositis. Remedial interventions should be designed to address some of these factors."
https://openalex.org/W3126218388,"This study compares the strength of the native bone-cement bond and the old-new cement bond under cyclic loading, using third generation cementing technique, rasping and contamination of the surface of the old cement with biological tissue. The possible advantages of additional drilling of the cement surface is also taken into account. Femoral heads from 21 patients who underwent a total hip arthroplasty performed for hip arthritis were used to prepare bone-cement samples. The following groups of samples were prepared. A bone—cement sample and a composite sample of a 6 weeks old cement part attached to new cement were tested 24 hours after preparation to avoid bone decay. Additionally, a uniform cement sample was prepared as control (6 weeks polymerization time) and 2 groups of cement-cement samples with and without anchoring drill hole on its surface, where the old cement polymerized for 6 weeks before preparing composite samples and then another 6 weeks after preparation. The uniaxial cyclic tension-compression tests were carried out using the Zwick-Roell Z020 testing machine. The uniform cement sample had the highest ultimate force of all specimens ( n = 15; R m = 3149 N). The composite cement sample ( n = 15; R m = 902 N) had higher ultimate force as the bone-cement sample ( n = 31; R m = 284 N; p &lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between composite samples with 24 hours ( n = 15; R m = 902 N) and 6 weeks polymerization periods (n = 22; R m = 890 N; p = 0.93). The composite cement samples with drill hole (n = 16; R m = 607 N) were weaker than those without it (n = 22; R m = 890 N; p &lt; 0.001). This study shows that the bond between the old and new cement was stronger than the bond between cement and bone. This suggests that it is better to leave the cement that is not loosened from the bone and perform cement in cement revision, than compromising bone stock by removal of the old cement with the resulting weaker cement-bone interface. The results support performing cement-in-cement revision arthroplasty The drill holes in the old cement mantle decrease cement binding strength and are not recommended in this type of surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3127753312,"Previous work has demonstrated that certain speech patterns vary systematically between sociodemographic groups, so that in some cases the way a person speaks is a valid cue to group membership. Our work addresses whether or not participants use these linguistic cues when assessing a speaker’s likely political identity. We use a database of speeches by U.S. Congressional representatives to isolate words that are statistically diagnostic of a speaker’s party identity. In a series of four studies, we demonstrate that participants’ judgments track variation in word usage between the two parties more often than chance, and that this effect persists even when potentially interfering cues such as the meaning of the word are controlled for. Our results are consistent with a body of literature suggesting that humans’ language-related judgments reflect the statistical distributions of our environment."
https://openalex.org/W3128666366,"Production of the biosurfactant syringafactin by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae B728a is a surface contact-dependent trait. Expression of syfA , as measured using a gfp reporter gene fusion was low in planktonic cells in liquid cultures but over 4-fold higher in cells immobilized on surfaces as varied as glass, plastic, paper, parafilm, agar, membrane filters, and leaves. Induction of syfA as measured by GFP fluorescence was rapid, occurring within two hours after immobilization of cells on surfaces. Comparison of the global transcriptome by RNA sequencing of planktonic cells in a nutrient medium with that of cells immobilized for 2 hours on filters placed on this solidified medium revealed that, in addition to syfA , 3156 other genes were differentially expressed. Genes repressed in immobilized cells included those involved in quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) metabolism and transport, compatible solute production, carbohydrate metabolism and transport, organic acid metabolism and transport, phytotoxin synthesis and transport, amino acid metabolism and transport, and secondary metabolism. Genes induced in immobilized cells included syfA plus those involved in translation, siderophore synthesis and transport, nucleotide metabolism and transport, flagellar synthesis and motility, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis and transport, energy generation, transcription, chemosensing and chemotaxis, replication and DNA repair, iron-sulfur proteins, peptidoglycan/cell wall polymers, terpenoid backbone synthesis, iron metabolism and transport, and cell division. That many genes are rapidly differentially expressed upon transfer of cells from a planktonic to an immobilized state suggests that cells experience the two environments differently. It seems possible that surface contact initiates anticipatory changes in P . syringae gene expression, which enables rapid and appropriate physiological responses to the different environmental conditions such as might occur in a biofilm. Such responses could help cells survive transitions from aquatic habitats fostering planktonic traits to attachment on surfaces, conditions that alternatively occur on leaves."
https://openalex.org/W3044954158,"Just like everything in the nature, scientific topics flourish and perish. While existing literature well captures article's life-cycle via citation patterns, little is known about how scientific popularity and impact evolves for a specific topic. It would be most intuitive if we could `feel' topic's activity just as we perceive the weather by temperature. Here, we conceive knowledge temperature to quantify topic overall popularity and impact through citation network dynamics. Knowledge temperature includes 2 parts. One part depicts lasting impact by assessing knowledge accumulation with an analogy between topic evolution and isobaric expansion. The other part gauges temporal changes in knowledge structure, an embodiment of short-term popularity, through the rate of entropy change with internal energy, 2 thermodynamic variables approximated via node degree and edge number. Our analysis of representative topics with size ranging from 1000 to over 30000 articles reveals that the key to flourishing is topics' ability in accumulating useful information for future knowledge generation. Topics particularly experience temperature surges when their knowledge structure is altered by influential articles. The spike is especially obvious when there appears a single non-trivial novel research focus or merging in topic structure. Overall, knowledge temperature manifests topics' distinct evolutionary cycles."
https://openalex.org/W3126406762,"In view of the current severe situation of illegal land use in China, it is of great significance to explore the impact of the evolution and promotion of land law enforcement effectiveness, which will improve China’s land law enforcement system and effectively curb illegal land use. This paper explains the changes and enhancements of the effectiveness of land law enforcement since the implementation of China’s National Land Supervision System in terms of the deterrence, difficulty, and strength of land law enforcement, and explores the role of land law enforcement effectiveness in changing illegal land use behaviors from a theoretical level. Then, a corresponding empirical test was carried out using the provincial panel data of Mainland China from 2007 to 2016. The results show that the increase in land law enforcement deterrence and strength will help reduce the number of illegal land use cases, but it will drive the lawbreakers to ""commit major cases in desperation"", leading to the increase of the degree of illegal land use; and with the decrease of land law enforcement difficulty, the degree of illegal land use will be significantly reduced. At the end of this paper, several policy suggestions are put forward to effectively curb the illegal land use from the perspective of improving the land law enforcement system and enhancing the effectiveness of law enforcement."
https://openalex.org/W3126883776,"We study a sequence of “double-slit” experiments designed to perform repeated measurements of an attribute in a large pool of subjects using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk . Our findings contrast the prescriptions of decision theory in novel and interesting ways. The response to an identical sequel measurement of the same attribute can be at significant variance with the initial measurement. Furthermore, the response to the sequel measurement depends on whether the initial measurement has taken place. In the absence of the initial measurement, the sequel measurement reveals additional variability, leading to a multimodal frequency distribution which is largely absent if the first measurement has taken place."
https://openalex.org/W3127071158,"Previous studies have shown that functional mobility, along with other physical functions, decreases with advanced age. However, it is still unclear which domains of functioning (body structures, body functions, and activities) are most closely related to functional mobility. This study used machine learning classification to predict the rankings of Timed Up and Go tests based on the results of four assessments (soft lean mass, FEV 1 /FVC, knee extension torque, and one-leg standing time). We tested whether assessment results for each level could predict functional mobility assessments in older adults. Using support vector machines for machine learning classification, we verified that the four assessments of each level could classify functional mobility. Knee extension torque (from the body function domain) was the most closely related assessment. Naturally, the classification accuracy rate increased with a larger number of assessments as explanatory variables. However, knee extension torque remained the highest of all assessments. This extended to all combinations (of 2–3 assessments) that included knee extension torque. This suggests that resistance training may help protect individuals suffering from age-related declines in functional mobility."

https://openalex.org/W3128707694,"Introduction Active pharmacovigilance studies are pivotal to better characterize vaccine safety. Methods These are multicenter prospective cohort studies to evaluate the safety of the 2017 and 2018 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) manufactured by Instituto Butantan, by means of active pharmacovigilance practices. Elderly, children, healthcare workers, pregnant women, and women in the puerperium period were invited to participate in the study during the 2017 and 2018 Brazilian national seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns. Following immunization, participants were observed for 30 minutes and they received a participant card to register adverse events information. All safety information registered were checked at a clinical site visit 14 days after immunization and by a telephone contact 42 days after immunization for unsolicited Adverse Events (AE) and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Results A total of 942 volunteers participated in the two studies: 305 elderly, 109 children, 108 pregnant women, 32 women in the postpartum period, and 388 health workers. Overall, the median number of AR per participant ranged from 1 to 4. The lowest median number of AR per participant was observed among healthcare workers (1 AR per participant) and the highest among pregnant women (4 AR per participant). Overall, local pain (46.6%) was the most frequent solicited local AR. The most frequent systemic ARs were: headache (22.5%) followed by fatigue (16.0%), and malaise (11.0%). The majority of solicited ARs (96%) were mild, Grades 1 or 2), only 3% were Grade 3, and 1% was Grade 4. No serious AEs, including Guillain-Barré Syndrome, were reported up to 42 days postvaccination. Conclusion The results from the two studies confirmed that the 2017 and 2018 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines produced by Instituto Butantan were safe and that active pharmacovigilance studies should be considered, when it is feasible, as an important initiative to monitor vaccine safety in the post-marketing period."
https://openalex.org/W3126260742,"Many small parasitoid wasps have a black head, an orange mesosoma and a black metasoma (BOB color pattern), which is usually present in both sexes. A likely function of this widespread pattern is aposematic (warning) coloration, but this has never been investigated. To test this hypothesis, we presented spider predators ( Lyssomanes jemineus ), both field-captured and bred in captivity from eggs, to four wasp genera ( Baryconus , Chromoteleia , Macroteleia and Scelio ), each genus being represented by a BOB morphospecies and black morphospecies. We also used false prey, consisting of lures made of painted rice grains. Behavioral responses were analyzed with respect to presence or absence of the BOB pattern. In order to better understand the results obtained, two additional studies were performed. First, the reflection spectrum of the cuticle of the wasp and a theoretical visual sensibility of the spider were used to calculate a parameter we called “absorption contrast” that allows comparing the perception contrast between black and orange in each wasp genus as viewed by the spider. Second, acute toxicity trials with the water flea, Daphnia magna , were performed to determine toxicity differences between BOB and non-BOB wasps. At least some of the results suggest that the BOB color pattern may possibly play an aposematic role."
https://openalex.org/W3127840797,"Background Symptom resolution is the most common clinical practice during assessment and evaluation of helicobacter pylori infected patients after employing eradication therapy. Objective Prediction of eradication of H . pylori with symptom resolution and assess factors affecting symptom resolution. Method Facility based follow up study was done on consented H . pylori positive adult patients who received standard triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin from May 2016 to April 2018 at Bahir Dar city in Ethiopia. Sociodemographic and clinical data was collected before and after eradication therapy by using pre-developed structured questionnaire. Both positive and negative predictive values were calculated. SPSS version 23 was used to conduct bivariate and backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression to analyze data. P-value &lt; 0.05 at 95%CI was considered as significant. Result The study involved a total of 421 patients who completed follow up. Patients’ mean age and body weight (±SD) were 30.63 (± 10.74) years and 56.71 (± 10.19) kg, respectively. Complete symptom resolution was achieved in 84.3% of the patients and eradication of H . pylori was successful in 90% of patients. Positive predictive value of complete symptom resolution for H . pylori eradication was 98.9% (351/355) and whereas negative predictive value was 57.6%(38/66). Factors associated with complete symptom resolution were regimen completion (AOR: 2.77 95%CI (1.12–6.86), p = 0.028) and no use of traditional homemade supplements prepared from Fenugreek or Flaxseed (AOR: 2.09 95%CI (1.22–3.58), p = 0.007). Conclusion Complete symptom resolution is a powerful predictor of success of H . pylori eradication and can be used to assess H . pylori status after eradication therapy. Assessment of complete symptom resolution should consider regimen completion and traditional practice of using homemade supplements prepared from Fenugreek or Flaxseed."
https://openalex.org/W3128325708,"Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a hereditary disorder affecting the auditory system and pigmentation of hair, eyes, and skin. Different variants of the disease exist with the involvement of mutation in six genes. The aim of the study is to identify the genetic defects underlying Waardenburg syndrome in a large family with multiple affected individuals. Here, in this study, we recruited a large family with eleven affected individuals segregating WS type 2. We performed whole genome SNP genotyping, whole exome sequencing and segregation analysis using Sanger approach. Whole genome SNP genotyping, whole exome sequencing followed by Sanger validation of variants of interest identified a novel single nucleotide deletion mutation (c.965delA) in the MITF gene. Moreover, a rare heterozygous, missense damaging variant (c.101T&gt;G; p.Val34Gly) in the C2orf74 has also been identified. The C2orf74 is an uncharacterized gene present in the linked region detected by DominantMapper. Variants in MITF and C2orf74 follows autosomal dominant segregation with the phenotype, however, the variant in C2orf74 is incompletely penetrant. We proposed a digenic inheritance of variants as an underlying cause of WS2 in this family."
