https://openalex.org/W2078964320,"Methylation of the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is a posttranscriptional modification of RNA with poorly understood prevalence and physiological relevance. The recent discovery that FTO, an obesity risk gene, encodes an m6A demethylase implicates m6A as an important regulator of physiological processes. Here, we present a method for transcriptome-wide m6A localization, which combines m6A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). We use this method to identify mRNAs of 7,676 mammalian genes that contain m6A, indicating that m6A is a common base modification of mRNA. The m6A modification exhibits tissue-specific regulation and is markedly increased throughout brain development. We find that m6A sites are enriched near stop codons and in 3′ UTRs, and we uncover an association between m6A residues and microRNA-binding sites within 3′ UTRs. These findings provide a resource for identifying transcripts that are substrates for adenosine methylation and reveal insights into the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian transcriptome.

In humans, FTO polymorphisms that increase FTO expression are associated with elevated body mass index and increased risk for obesity (reviewed in Fawcett and Barroso, 2010Fawcett K.A. Barroso I.

FTO is a member of the Fe(II)- and oxoglutarate-dependent AlkB oxygenase family and was originally shown to catalyze the oxidative demethylation of methylated thymidine and uracil (Gerken et al., 2007Gerken T.

However, FTO exhibits low activity toward these base modifications, and they are relatively infrequent with unclear physiological relevance (Klagsbrun, 1973Klagsbrun M.

Chem. 1973; 248: 2612-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the physiologically relevant targets of FTO were unclear until recent studies that showed that FTO can demethylate N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a naturally occurring adenosine modification (Jia et al., 2011Jia G. Fu Y. Zhao X. Dai Q. Zheng G. Yang Y. Yi C. Lindahl T. Pan T. Yang Y.G. et al.N6-methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). These studies link adenosine methylation to physiological roles in human biological processes. The distribution of m6A in RNA is poorly understood. Previous studies have found that m6A exists in RNA from a variety of unique organisms, including viruses, yeast, and mammals (Beemon and Keith, 1977Beemon K. Keith J.

Although m6A is detectable in mRNA-enriched RNA fractions (Desrosiers et al., 1974Desrosiers R. Friderici K. Rottman F.

USA. 1974; 71: 3971-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), it has been confirmed in vivo in only one mammalian mRNA (Horowitz et al., 1984Horowitz S. Horowitz A. Nilsen T.W. Munns T.W. Rottman F.M. Mapping of N6-methyladenosine residues in bovine prolactin mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1984; 81: 5667-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The abundance of m6A has been shown to be 0.1%–0.4% of total adenosine residues in cellular RNA (Dubin and Taylor, 1975Dubin D.T. Taylor R.H. The methylation state of poly A-containing messenger RNA from cultured hamster cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1975; 2: 1653-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Perry et al., 1975Perry R.P.

Gershowitz A. Moss B. Methylated nucleotides block 5′ terminus of HeLa cell messenger RNA.Cell. 1975; 4: 379-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), suggesting that this modification may be widespread throughout the transcriptome. Although the existence of m6A has been known for many years, progress in establishing the prevalence of m6A in mRNA has lagged behind that of other modified bases. This is due in large part to the lack of available methods for detecting the presence of m6A. Because methylation of adenosine does not alter its ability to base pair with thymidine or uracil, m6A is not amenable to detection with standard hybridization or sequencing-based methods. Here, we examine the prevalence, regulation, and functional roles of m6A in the transcriptome. We show that m6A is a developmentally regulated RNA modification that is dynamically modified. Using antibodies that recognize m6A, we have developed an affinity enrichment strategy that, when coupled with next-generation sequencing, allows for the high-throughput identification of m6A sites. Using this approach, we present the first transcriptome-wide profile of m6A localization in RNA. We find that m6A is a widespread modification that is present in the mRNAs of >7,600 genes and in >300 noncoding RNAs. Additionally, m6A is highly enriched near the stop codon and in the 3′ UTR. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of m6A localization reveals consensus sites for m6A and identifies a potential interaction between m6A and microRNA pathways. Because m6A exhibits the same base pairing as unmodified adenosine, it is not readily detectable by standard sequencing or hybridization-based approaches. Additionally, m6A is not susceptible to chemical modifications that might otherwise facilitate its detection, such as bisulfite treatment, which is used to detect 5mC in DNA. The methods used thus far to detect m6A have involved treating cells with radiolabeled methionine, the precursor of the endogenous methylating agent S-adenosylmethionine, to impart radiolabeled methyl groups to adenosine (Csepany et al., 1990Csepany T.

Radiolabeled m6A residues are subsequently mapped with thin-layer chromatography or HPLC. In order to simplify detection of m6A, we sought to develop an immunoblotting strategy. For these experiments, we used a previously described anti-m6A antibody (Bringmann and Lührmann, 1987Bringmann P. Lührmann R. Antibodies specific for N6-methyladenosine react with intact snRNPs U2 and U4/U6.FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Jia et al., 2011Jia G. Fu Y. Zhao X. Dai Q.

Characterization of antibodies specific for N6-methyladenosine and for 7-methylguanosine.Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2163-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To ensure the specificity of this antibody for m6A, we performed dot blots using modified oligonucleotides immobilized to a membrane. The m6A antibody selectively bound to oligonucleotides containing a single m6A residue and exhibited negligible binding to oligonucleotides containing unmodified adenosine (Figure 1A ). The binding was competed by incubating the antibody with increasing concentrations of an m6A-rich competitor RNA (Figure 1B). However, RNA containing unmodified adenosine did not compete for binding. Furthermore, binding was competed by N6-methyladenosine triphosphate, but not by ATP or other modified adenosine triphosphates, including N1-methyladenosine and 2′-O-methyladenosine (Figure 1C). Finally, to examine the specificity of the antibody in the context of other nucleotide sequences, we took advantage of the fact that the enzyme encoded by the DNA adenine methylase (dam) gene in E. coli methylates the N6 position of adenosine in DNA. Upon subjecting digested DNA isolated from dam+ and dam- E. coli to immunoblotting using the m6A antibody, we found robust signals only in the DNA samples from the dam+ strain (Figure 1D). Collectively, these data demonstrate the high sensitivity and selectivity of this antibody for m6A, as well as its ability to detect m6A within cellular nucleotide pools. To explore the abundance of m6A within various RNA populations, we isolated RNA from several mouse tissues and subjected it to immunoblot analysis using the m6A antibody (Figure 2A ). We found that m6A was present in all RNA samples tested, indicating that this modified nucleotide is widely distributed in many tissues, with particularly high enrichment in liver, kidney, and brain (Figure 2B). In addition, we observed large differences in the m6A content of various immortalized cell lines, including several cancer cell lines, which further indicates that large differences in m6A levels exist in different cell populations (Figure S1A available online).Figure S1m6A-Containing Transcripts Are Found at Varying Levels across Individual Cell Lines and Are Not Detected in Poly(A) Tails, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) Cell line-specific changes in the levels of m6A indicate its dynamic nature. RNA was isolated from various mammalian cell lines and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-m6A antibody. The levels of m6A vary substantially across different cell lines. For instance, the cancer cell lines HEPG2 and MCF7 appear to have relatively high levels of m6A, whereas the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and PC9 have comparatively low levels. m6A immunoblotting of total mRNA often reveals two bands of low signal intensity that are approximately 1.9 kb and 5 kb in size, which correspond to the 18S and 28S rRNA species, respectively. This likely indicates low levels of m6A within these rRNAs.(B) Developmentally regulated increases in m6A abundance are observed in cultured neurons. RNA was collected from cultured neurons isolated from embryonic day 18 (E18) and postnatal day 3 (P3) rat brain and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-m6A antibody. A substantial increase in m6A abundance is observed in P3 neurons compared to E18 neurons, despite loading of less RNA in the P3 sample (indicated by ethidium bromide staining of 28S rRNA bands, bottom panel). Additionally, compared to RNA isolated from adult rat brain tissue, the m6A content of E18 or P3 cultured neuronal RNA is significantly enriched in lower molecular weight RNA species.(C) Probing for m6A content in isolated poly(A) tails alone indicates an absence of m6A. To further explore whether poly(A) tails contain m6A residues, we purified poly(A) tails from poly(A) RNA, and directly assayed for m6A. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from total brain RNA using oligo(dT) Dynabeads. To harvest the poly(A) tails, half the sample was digested with RNase A, which cleaves after C and U residues. Whereas poly(A) tails are resistant to this treatment, the remainder of the transcript is digested (Perry et al., 1975Perry R.P. Kelley D.E. Friderici K. Rottman F.

In this experiment, the transcript is amplified only if it contains a poly(A) tail, which is utilized in the 3′RACE procedure. As expected, the target amplicon is observed only in the total poly(A) RNA sample.(E) To confirm the presence of poly(A) tails in the poly(A) tail-only sample, 3′RACE and RT-PCR were performed using a GGA(18) forward primer. This primer binds to the 5′ end of any poly(A) tails that contain two guanine residues immediately preceding the poly(A) segment, which are not cleaved off by RNase A. When this primer is coupled with a 3′RACE-specific reverse primer and used for RT-PCR, several products of predominantly low molecular weight are observed in the poly(A) tail-only sample (arrow, middle lane), indicating that poly(A) tails are indeed present. This result is not due to nonspecific amplification, since a control PCR lacking template cDNA has no amplified product (“No cDNA” lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Cell line-specific changes in the levels of m6A indicate its dynamic nature.

This result is not due to nonspecific amplification, since a control PCR lacking template cDNA has no amplified product (“No cDNA” lane). m6A immunoreactivity was detected in bands throughout the molecular weight range of the blot (∼0.2 kb to ∼10 kb), consistent with incorporation of m6A in mRNA. Indeed, fractionation of whole cellular RNA into polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNAs indicates that m6A immunoreactivity is enriched in the polyadenylated RNA pool, which further suggests that m6A in cellular RNA is localized to mature mRNA (Figure 2C). To determine whether m6A is present in poly(A) tails, we selectively removed the poly(A) tail from cellular mRNA using oligo(dT) hybridization and RNase H treatment. Transcripts depleted of the poly(A) tail did not exhibit an appreciable reduction in m6A levels (Figure 2D). In addition, immunoblotting poly(A) tails alone showed minimal m6A immunoreactivity (Figures S2C–S2E ). Together, these data demonstrate that m6A is primarily an internal modification that is largely absent from the poly(A) tail. Our observation that m6A is highly enriched within the brain prompted us to investigate the temporal dynamics of m6A levels during different stages of neural development. Immunoblotting RNA samples with the m6A antibody indicates that m6A is present in mRNA at low levels throughout embryogenesis but increases dramatically by adulthood (Figure 3A ). A similar increase in m6A levels is also observed in RNA isolated from embryonic and postnatal rat brain cultured neurons (Figure S1B), which suggests that upregulation of m6A levels accompanies neuronal maturation. We next asked whether adenosine methylation is a dynamically regulated posttranscriptional modification and whether its levels can be regulated by specific demethylating enzymes. In our search for potential demethylating enzymes that act to remove the methyl group from m6A, we focused on members of the family of Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases, several of which have previously been shown to demethylate both DNA and RNA (Falnes et al., 2007Falnes P.O.

Consistent with the findings of Jia et al., 2011Jia G. Fu Y. Zhao X. Dai Q. Zheng G. Yang Y. Yi C. Lindahl T. Pan T. Yang Y.G. et al.N6-methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 885-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar, we observed that FTO decreased m6A levels when overexpressed in mammalian cells (Figure 3B). Furthermore, we find that overexpression of FTO resulted in a broad size range of RNAs that exhibit reduced m6A immunoreactivity (Figure 3B). In order to obtain insight into potential roles for m6A, we sought to characterize its distribution throughout the transcriptome. To do this, we first determined whether the m6A antibody could be used to enrich m6A-containing RNAs. In vitro immunoprecipitation experiments showed that a single round of MeRIP produces ∼70-fold enrichment, and two rounds produce >130-fold enrichment for m6A-containing targets (Figure S3). To identify m6A sites throughout the transcriptome, we developed a method that combines m6A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) with next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq). The procedure for MeRIP-Seq (outlined in Figure 4A ) involves randomly fragmenting the RNA to ∼100 nt sized fragments prior to immunoprecipitation. Because an m6A site could lie anywhere along the length of a given immunoprecipitated 100 nt fragment, sequencing reads are expected to map to a region that contains the m6A site near its center. At its extremes, this region would be predicted to be roughly 200 nt wide (100 nt up- and downstream from the m6A site) (Figures 4B and 4C).Figure 4Outline of MeRIP-Seq Protocol and Distribution of Sequencing ReadsShow full caption(A) Schematic representation of MeRIP-Seq. Total RNA is subjected to RiboMinus treatment to remove rRNA species. RNAs containing m6A are then immunoprecipitated by mixing the RNA with m6A antibody-coupled Dynabeads. m6A-containing RNAs are then eluted from the antibody-coupled beads and subjected to a second round of m6A immunoprecipitation. The resulting RNA pool, which is highly enriched for m6A-containing RNAs, is then subjected to next-generation sequencing.(B) Schematic of sequencing reads and their alignment to locations in the genome surrounding an m6A site.

Peak height is displayed as reads per base per million mapped reads (BPM). See also Figures S2 and S3. We next utilized MeRIP-Seq to identify m6A sites in total mouse brain RNA. Reads from the MeRIP sample frequently mapped to mRNAs and clustered as distinct peaks. As predicted, these peaks frequently converged to ∼100 nt wide regions near their midpoint (Figure 4C). Furthermore, enrichment of reads in these regions was not observed in the non-IP control sample, which was composed of the input RNA prior to m6A immunoprecipitation, demonstrating the specificity of these peaks (Figure S3). To determine the location of these peaks throughout the transcriptome and thus characterize the regions of m6A localization, we developed an algorithm for identifying m6A peaks (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Additionally, we performed replicate MeRIP-Seq experiments in which we utilized: (1) a different sequencing platform (Illumina's GAIIx versus HiSeq2000), (2) independently prepared RNA samples from different animals, and (3) an unrelated m6A antibody (Kong et al., 2000Kong H.

We employed our algorithm to identify m6A peaks that met a minimum p value (p ≤ 0.05, Benjamini and Hochberg corrected) within each individual sample. From the three samples, we identified a total of 41,072 distinct peaks in the RNAs of 8,843 genes, which we call our “filtered” set of m6A peaks (Table S1). Of these peaks, 80% were detected in at least two different replicates. The high concordance between these samples indicates that MeRIP-Seq is highly reproducible across different sequencing platforms and using different m6A antibodies. For subsequent bioinformatic"
https://openalex.org/W2129136620,"All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the DNA damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed ""kataegis,"" was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2109991075,"Cancer evolves dynamically as clonal expansions supersede one another driven by shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes. These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis."

Affinity purification-based methods cannot precisely locate 5hmC nor accurately determine its relative abundance at each modified site. We here present a genome-wide approach, Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-Seq), that when combined with traditional bisulfite sequencing can be used for mapping 5hmC at base resolution and quantifying the relative abundance of 5hmC as well as 5mC. Application of this method to embryonic stem cells not only confirms widespread distribution of 5hmC in the mammalian genome but also reveals sequence bias and strand asymmetry at 5hmC sites. We observe high levels of 5hmC and reciprocally low levels of 5mC near but not on transcription factor-binding sites. Additionally, the relative abundance of 5hmC varies significantly among distinct functional sequence elements, suggesting different mechanisms for 5hmC deposition and maintenance.

However, in all cases, the resolution of these maps was restricted by the size of the immunoprecipitated or chemically captured DNA, which varied from several hundred to over a thousand bases. The study of 5mC has been facilitated by the development of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing methods that can resolve the genomic location of methylcytosine at single-base resolution (Cokus et al., 2008Cokus S.J.

(2009). Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences. Nature 462, 315–322.Google Scholar). However, current bisulfite sequencing methods cannot distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC (Huang et al., 2010Huang Y. Pastor W.A. Shen Y. Tahiliani M. Liu D.R. Rao A. The behaviour of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in bisulfite sequencing.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, Jin et al., 2010Jin S.G. Kadam S. Pfeifer G.P. Examination of the specificity of DNA methylation profiling techniques towards 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e125Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, the genome-wide bisulfite sequencing maps generated in recent years may not accurately capture the true abundance of 5mC at each base in the genome. A more detailed understanding of the function of 5hmC as well as 5mC has, therefore, been hampered by the lack of a single-base resolution sequencing technology capable of detecting the relative abundance of 5hmC per cytosine. Here we present a Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-Seq) strategy, which provides a method for single-base resolution detection of 5hmC amenable to both genome-wide and loci-specific sequencing. Applying this method, we have generated genome-wide, single-base resolution maps of 5hmC in ESCs. Distinct classes of functional elements exhibit variable abundance of 5hmC, with promoter-distal regulatory elements harboring the highest levels of 5hmC. High levels of 5hmC and reciprocally low levels of 5mC can be found near binding sites of transcription factors. In contrast to 5mC, 5hmC sites display strand asymmetry and sequence bias. Finally, the base-resolution maps of 5hmC provide more accurate estimates of both 5hmC and 5mC levels at each modified cytosine than previous whole-genome bisulfite sequencing approaches. Our results support a dynamic DNA methylation process at distal-regulatory elements and suggest that different mechanisms of DNA modification may be involved at distinct classes of functional sequences in the genome. Traditional bisulfite sequencing cannot discriminate 5mC from 5hmC because both resist deamination by bisulfite treatment (Huang et al., 2010Huang Y. Pastor W.A. Shen Y. Tahiliani M. Liu D.R. Rao A. The behaviour of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in bisulfite sequencing.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, Jin et al., 2010Jin S.G. Kadam S. Pfeifer G.P. Examination of the specificity of DNA methylation profiling techniques towards 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e125Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We have recently found that TET proteins not only oxidize 5mC to 5hmC but also further oxidize 5hmC to 5caC, and that 5caC exhibits behavior similar to that of unmodified cytosine after bisulfite treatment (He et al., 2011He Y.F. Li B.Z. Li Z. Liu P. Wang Y. Tang Q. Ding J. Jia Y. Chen Z. Li L. et al.Tet-mediated formation of 5-carboxylcytosine and its excision by TDG in mammalian DNA.Science. 2011; 333: 1303-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar, Ito et al., 2011Ito S. Shen L. Dai Q. Wu S.C. Collins L.B. Swenberg J.A. He C. Zhang Y. Tet proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine.Science. 2011; 333: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). This deamination difference between 5caC and 5mC/5hmC under standard bisulfite conditions inspired us to explore TAB-Seq. In this approach, we use β-glucosyltransferase (βGT) to introduce a glucose onto 5hmC, generating β-glucosyl-5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5gmC) to protect 5hmC from further TET oxidation. After blocking of 5hmC, all 5mC is converted to 5caC by oxidation with an excess of recombinant Tet1 protein. Bisulfite treatment of the resulting DNA then converts all C and 5caC (derived from 5mC) to uracil or 5caU, respectively, whereas the original 5hmC bases remain protected as 5gmC. Thus, subsequent sequencing will reveal 5hmC as C, which, when combined with traditional bisulfite sequencing results, will provide an accurate assessment of abundance of this modification at each cytosine (Figure 1A ). We first confirmed that 5gmC is read as C in traditional bisulfite sequencing (data not shown). We cloned and expressed the catalytic domain of mouse Tet1 (mTet1) (Figure S1A available online), as previously reported (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y. Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). We tested a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with site-specifically incorporated 5mC or 5hmC modification (Figure 1B). Application of our method with Sanger sequencing of the PCR-amplified products showed that the original 5mC was completely converted into T after treatment, indicating efficient oxidation of 5mC to 5caC by mTet1 (Figure 1B). However, the original 5hmC was sequenced as C, confirming that the protected 5gmC is resistant to deamination under bisulfite treatment (Figure 1B). The products of each step were confirmed by MALDI-TOF/TOF using a shorter model duplex DNA (Figure 1C). Full conversion of 5mC in the context of genomic DNA was also confirmed by conventional bisulfite, PCR, and both Sanger and semiconductor sequencing (Figures S1B and S1C). Additionally, application to genomic DNA confirmed conversion of 5mC to 5caC and protection of 5hmC, and that 5fC is undetectable by immunoblot on the final reaction products (Figure 1D). Thus, coupling βGT-mediated transfer of glucose to 5hmC with mTet1-catalyzed oxidation of 5mC to 5caC enables the distinction of 5hmC from both C and 5mC after sodium bisulfite treatment.Figure S1TAB-Seq of Specific Loci and 5mC Conversion Rate Test in the Context of Genomic DNA, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Purified mTet1 catalytic domain used for oxidation of genomic DNA.(B) Sanger sequencing of M.SssI treated lambda DNA spiked into a genomic DNA background at 0.5% before (− mTet1) and after (+ mTet1) subjecting the DNA to TAB-Seq.(C) Semiconductor sequencing of M.SssI-treated lambda DNA spiked into a genomic DNA background at 0.5% before (− mTet1) and after (+ mTet1) subjecting the DNA to TAB-Seq.

We applied traditional bisulfite sequencing and TAB-Seq to known 5hmC-enriched loci in mouse cerebellum that were identified previously (Song et al., 2011Song C.X. Szulwach K.E. Fu Y. Dai Q. Yi C. Li X. Li Y. Chen C.H. Zhang W. Jian X. et al.Selective chemical labeling reveals the genome-wide distribution of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, Szulwach et al., 2011bSzulwach K.E. Li X. Li Y. Song C.X. Wu H. Dai Q. Irier H. Upadhyay A.K. Gearing M. Levey A.I. et al.5-hmC-mediated epigenetic dynamics during postnatal neurodevelopment and aging.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1607-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Comparing the sequencing results, we were able to identify genuine 5hmC and 5mC sites (Figure S1D). We next applied TAB-Seq to genomic DNA from H1 hESCs and E14Tg2a mESCs and sequenced to an average depth of 26.5× and 17× per cytosine, respectively. Successful detection of 5hmC is governed by three key parameters: (1) efficient conversion of unmodified cytosine to uracil; (2) efficient conversion of 5mC to 5caU/U; and (3) efficient protection of 5hmC. To directly assess these conversion rates in the context of genomic DNA, sequenced samples were spiked in with fragments of lambda DNA amplified by PCR to contain three distinct domains having either unmodified cytosine, 5mC, or 5hmC. We observe low nonconversion rates for unmodified cytosine (0.38%) and 5mC (2.21%), contrasted to a high nonconversion rate of 5hmC (84.4%) (Figure S2B ). Further analysis indicates that this latter value is an underestimate of the true 5hmC protection rate in H1, which is close to 92.0% (Figures S2D and S2E). These data further confirm the capability of TAB-Seq for robust distinction of 5hmC from 5mC and unmodified cytosine in the context of genomic DNA. We next focused our analysis on the map of H1 hESCs. To confidently identify 5hmC-modified bases, we took advantage of the highly annotated H1 methylome generated with methylC-Seq, which identifies both 5mC as well as 5hmC. Accordingly, we restricted our search for 5hmC to the subset of methylated bases previously identified by methylC-Seq (Lister et al., 2009Lister R. Pelizzola M. Dowen R.H. Hawkins R.D. Hon G. Tonti-Filippini J. Nery J.R. Lee L. Ye Z. Ngo Q.M. et al.Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences.Nature. 2009; 462: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). The probability that a cytosine can be confidently identified as 5hmC is governed by the sequencing depth at the cytosine and abundance of the modification (Figure S2C). Modeling this probabilistic event with a binomial distribution (Lister et al., 2009Lister R. Pelizzola M. Dowen R.H. Hawkins R.D. Hon G. Tonti-Filippini J. Nery J.R. Lee L. Ye Z. Ngo Q.M. et al.Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences.Nature. 2009; 462: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) with N as the depth of sequencing at the cytosine and p as the 5mC nonconversion rate, we identified a total of 691,414 5hmCs with a false discovery rate of 5% (Figure S2F; see Extended Experimental Procedures). Given an average sequencing depth of 26.5, our assay can on average resolve 5hmC having an abundance of 20% or higher (Figure S2C). Genomic profiles of absolute 5hmC levels are comparable to a map previously generated with an affinity-based approach (Szulwach et al., 2011aSzulwach K.E. Li X. Li Y. Song C.X. Han J.W. Kim S. Namburi S. Hermetz K. Kim J.J. Rudd M.K. et al.Integrating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine into the epigenomic landscape of human embryonic stem cells.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002154Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A ). As sequenced fragments are equally distributed among the population of cells, TAB-Seq provides a steady-state glimpse of 5hmC in the entire population. This is in contrast to affinity-based approaches, which bias sequencing toward 5hmC-enriched DNA fragments. By TAB-Seq, identified 5hmCs are highly clustered, unlike 5mCs (Figure S3A ), and track well with peaks of 5hmC enrichment previously identified by affinity sequencing (Figure 2A). There are 7.6 times as many 5hmCs overlapping affinity-identified regions as expected by chance (Figure 2B, Z-score = 1,579). Furthermore, 81.5% of these 82,221 affinity-identified regions were recovered by at least one 5hmC. In contrast, only 35.6% of 5hmCs are recovered by affinity-based approaches, suggesting an increased sensitivity of TAB-Seq. Using semiconductor sequencing, we verified the presence/absence of 5hmC at 57 out of 59 individual cytosines (9 out of 11 hydroxymethylated CpGs, with depth ≥ 30) within regions that previously escaped detection by 5hmC affinity capture (Figure S2A), underscoring the sensitivity and specificity of our approach.Figure S3Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The distribution of pairwise distances between all 5hmCs identified in H1 (red), compared to the same number of randomly selected 5mCs (black).(B) The distribution of base-level phastCons conservation scores (Siepel et al., 2005Siepel, A., Bejerano, G., Pedersen, J.S., Hinrichs, A.S., Hou, M., Rosenbloom, K., Clawson, H., Spieth, J., Hillier, L.W., Richards, S., et al.

Sharon et al. present a high-throughput method to measure the expression of thousands of designed yeast promoters in a single experiment and use it to reveal new features of transcriptional regulation. Despite extensive research, our understanding of the rules according to which cis-regulatory sequences are converted into gene expression is limited. We devised a method for obtaining parallel, highly accurate gene expression measurements from thousands of designed promoters and applied it to measure the effect of systematic changes in the location, number, orientation, affinity and organization of transcription-factor binding sites and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Our analyses reveal a clear relationship between expression and binding-site multiplicity, as well as dependencies of expression on the distance between transcription-factor binding sites and gene starts which are transcription-factor specific, including a striking ∼10-bp periodic relationship between gene expression and binding-site location. We show how this approach can measure transcription-factor sequence specificities and the sensitivity of transcription-factor sites to the surrounding sequence context, and compare the activity of 75 yeast transcription factors. Our method can be used to study both cis and trans effects of genotype on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational control."
https://openalex.org/W2143742274,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a potential therapy for a range of neural insults. In animal models of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that targets oligodendrocytes and myelin, treatment with human MSCs results in functional improvement that reflects both modulation of the immune response and myelin repair. Here we demonstrate that conditioned medium from human MSCs (MSC-CM) reduces functional deficits in mouse MOG35–55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and promotes the development of oligodendrocytes and neurons. Functional assays identified hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its primary receptor cMet as critical in MSC-stimulated recovery in EAE, neural cell development and remyelination. Active MSC-CM contained HGF, and exogenously supplied HGF promoted recovery in EAE, whereas cMet and antibodies to HGF blocked the functional recovery mediated by HGF and MSC-CM. Systemic treatment with HGF markedly accelerated remyelination in lysolecithin-induced rat dorsal spinal cord lesions and in slice cultures. Together these data strongly implicate HGF in mediating MSC-stimulated functional recovery in animal models of multiple sclerosis."

Here we show that O-GlcNAcylation directly regulates core components of the pluripotency network. Blocking O-GlcNAcylation disrupts ESC self-renewal and reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells. The core reprogramming factors Oct4 and Sox2 are O-GlcNAcylated in ESCs, but the O-GlcNAc modification is rapidly removed upon differentiation. O-GlcNAc modification of threonine 228 in Oct4 regulates Oct4 transcriptional activity and is important for inducing many pluripotency-related genes, including Klf2, Klf5, Nr5a2, Tbx3, and Tcl1. A T228A point mutation that eliminates this O-GlcNAc modification reduces the capacity of Oct4 to maintain ESC self-renewal and reprogram somatic cells. Overall, our study makes a direct connection between O-GlcNAcylation of key regulatory transcription factors and the activity of the pluripotency network."

They show with simulations and real exome-sequencing data that low-coverage sequencing can increase power for GWAS relative to genotyping arrays. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be a powerful method to identify common genetic variants contributing to susceptibility to common diseases. Here, we show that extremely low-coverage sequencing (0.1–0.5×) captures almost as much of the common (>5%) and low-frequency (1–5%) variation across the genome as SNP arrays. As an empirical demonstration, we show that genome-wide SNP genotypes can be inferred at a mean r2 of 0.71 using off-target data (0.24× average coverage) in a whole-exome study of 909 samples. Using both simulated and real exome-sequencing data sets, we show that association statistics obtained using extremely low-coverage sequencing data attain similar P values at known associated variants as data from genotyping arrays, without an excess of false positives. Within the context of reductions in sample preparation and sequencing costs, funds invested in extremely low-coverage sequencing can yield several times the effective sample size of GWAS based on SNP array data and a commensurate increase in statistical power."

However, its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces two phases of PKC-δ hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. The late phase is mediated by Gα(12), which specifically activates ARAF, leading to upregulation of the RFFL E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation of the PRR5L subunit of mTORC2. Destabilization of PRR5L, a suppressor of mTORC2-mediated hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of PKC-δ, but not AKT, results in PKC-δ hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and activation. This Gα(12)-mediated signalling pathway for mTORC2 regulation is critically important for fibroblast migration and pulmonary fibrosis development."

But how does the dog mind actually work? To develop a methodology to answer this question, we trained two dogs to remain motionless for the duration required to collect quality fMRI images by using positive reinforcement without sedation or physical restraints. The task was designed to determine which brain circuits differentially respond to human hand signals denoting the presence or absence of a food reward. Head motion within trials was less than 1 mm.

https://openalex.org/W2014462125,"Understanding how proresolving agonists selectively activate FPR2/ALX is a crucial step in the clarification of proresolution molecular networks that can be harnessed for the design of novel therapeutics for inflammatory disease. FPR2/ALX, a G protein-coupled receptor belonging to the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family, conveys the biological functions of a variety of ligands, including the proresolution mediators annexin A1 (AnxA1) and lipoxin A(4), as well as the activating and proinflammatory protein serum amyloid A. FPR2/ALX is the focus of intense screening for novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics, and the small molecule compound 43 was identified as a receptor ligand. Here, we used chimeric FPR1 and FPR2/ALX clones (stably transfected in HEK293 cells) to identify the N-terminal region and extracellular loop II as the FPR2/ALX domain required for AnxA1-mediated signaling. Genomic responses were also assessed with domain-specific effects emerging, so the N-terminal region is required for AnxA1 induction of JAG1 and JAM3, whereas it is dispensable for modulation of SGPP2. By comparison, serum amyloid A non-genomic responses were reliant on extracellular loops I and II, whereas the small molecule compound 43 activated extracellular loop I with downstream signaling dependent on transmembrane region II. In desensitization experiments, the N-terminal region was dispensable for AnxA1-induced FPR2/ALX down-regulation in both the homologous and heterologous desensitization modes."

https://openalex.org/W2053495452,"Accumulating evidence supports that tumor growth and cancer relapse are driven by cancer stem cells. Our previous work has demonstrated the existence of CD90(+) liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, the characteristics of these cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we employed a more sensitive RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the gene expression profiling of CD90(+) cells sorted from tumor (CD90(+)CSCs) with parallel non-tumorous liver tissues (CD90(+)NTSCs) and elucidate the roles of putative target genes in hepatocarcinogenesis.CD90(+) cells were sorted respectively from tumor and adjacent non-tumorous human liver tissues using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The amplified RNAs of CD90(+) cells from 3 HCC patients were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. A differential gene expression profile was established between CD90(+)CSCs and CD90(+)NTSCs, and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on the same set of amplified RNAs, and further confirmed in an independent cohort of 12 HCC patients. Five hundred genes were differentially expressed (119 up-regulated and 381 down-regulated genes) between CD90(+)CSCs and CD90(+)NTSCs. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the over-expressed genes in CD90(+)CSCs were associated with inflammation, drug resistance and lipid metabolism. Among the differentially expressed genes, glypican-3 (GPC3), a member of glypican family, was markedly elevated in CD90(+)CSCs compared to CD90(+)NTSCs. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that GPC3 was highly expressed in forty-two human liver tumor tissues but absent in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Flow cytometry indicated that GPC3 was highly expressed in liver CD90(+)CSCs and mature cancer cells in liver cancer cell lines and human liver tumor tissues. Furthermore, GPC3 expression was positively correlated with the number of CD90(+)CSCs in liver tumor tissues.The identified genes, such as GPC3 that are distinctly expressed in liver CD90(+)CSCs, may be promising gene candidates for HCC therapy without inducing damages to normal liver stem cells."

Interhemisferic transfer of motor inhibition was assessed by recording the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) to transcranial magnetic stimulation. We evaluated cognitive function using the Brief Repeatable Battery and physical disability using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the MS Functional Composite (MSFC) z-score.The iSP latency correlated with physical disability scores (r ranged from 0.596 to 0.657, P values from 0.004 to 0.001), and with results of visual memory (r = -0.645, P = 0.002), processing speed (r = -0.51, P = 0.018) and executive cognitive domain tests (r = -0.452, P = 0.039). The area of the rostrum correlated with the EDSS (r = -0.442, P = 0.045). MD and RD correlated with cognitive performance, mainly with results of visual and verbal memory tests (r ranged from -0.446 to -0.546, P values from 0.048 to 0.011).

https://openalex.org/W2008578494,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) activates a widely expressed family of G protein-coupled receptors, serves as a muscle trophic factor and activates muscle stem cells called satellite cells (SCs) through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that muscle injury induces dynamic changes in S1P signaling and metabolism in vivo. These changes include early and profound induction of the gene encoding the S1P biosynthetic enzyme SphK1, followed by induction of the catabolic enzyme sphingosine phosphate lyase (SPL) 3 days later. These changes correlate with a transient increase in circulating S1P levels after muscle injury. We show a specific requirement for SphK1 to support efficient muscle regeneration and SC proliferation and differentiation. Mdx mice, which serve as a model for muscular dystrophy (MD), were found to be S1P-deficient and exhibited muscle SPL upregulation, suggesting that S1P catabolism is enhanced in dystrophic muscle. Pharmacological SPL inhibition increased muscle S1P levels, improved mdx muscle regeneration and enhanced SC proliferation via S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2)-dependent inhibition of Rac1, thereby activating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), a central player in inflammatory signaling. STAT3 activation resulted in p21 and p27 downregulation in a S1PR2-dependent fashion in myoblasts. Our findings suggest that S1P promotes SC progression through the cell cycle by repression of cell cycle inhibitors via S1PR2/STAT3-dependent signaling and that SPL inhibition may provide a therapeutic strategy for MD."

While the size of salivary glands, hnRNP levels in larval tissues, and thermotolerance of larvae/adult flies improved significantly following feeding either of the two formulations, the median life span and starvation resistance improved only with AR. Feeding on AR or RS supplemented food improved fecundity differently. Feeding of larvae and adults with AR increased the fecundity while the same with RS had opposite effect. On the contrary, feeding larvae on normal food and adults on AR supplement had no effect on fecundity but a comparable regime of feeding on RS-supplemented food improved fecundity. RS feeding did not cause heavy metal toxicity.The present study with two Ayurvedic formulations reveals formulation-specific effects on several parameters of the fly's life, which seem to generally agree with their recommended human usages in Ayurvedic practices. Thus, Drosophila, with its very rich genetic tools and well-worked-out developmental pathways promises to be a very good model for examining the cellular and molecular bases of the effects of different Ayurvedic formulations."

In this study, we show that phosphatidylcholine (PC), an important structural component of cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins, can be a precursor of ~65% of the triacylglycerols in liver. Mice were injected with [(3)H]PC-labeled high density lipoproteins (HDLs). Hepatic uptake of HDL-PC was ~10 μmol/day, similar to the rate of hepatic de novo PC synthesis. Consistent with this finding, measurement of the specific radioactivity of PC in plasma and liver indicated that 50% of hepatic PC is derived from the circulation. Moreover, one-third of HDL-derived PC was converted into triacylglycerols. Importantly, ~65% of the total hepatic pool of triacylglycerol appears to be derived from hepatic PC, half of which is derived from HDL. Thus, lipoprotein-associated PC should be considered a quantitatively significant source of triacylglycerol for the etiology of hepatic steatosis."

https://openalex.org/W1995996219,"Background Experimental data suggest a role for iron in the course of tuberculosis (TB) infection, but there is limited evidence on the potential effects of iron deficiency or iron overload on the progression of TB disease in humans. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the association of iron status with the risk of TB progression and death. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed plasma samples and data collected as part a randomized micronutrient supplementation trial (not including iron) among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected TB patients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We prospectively related baseline plasma ferritin concentrations from 705 subjects (362 HIV-infected and 343 HIV-uninfected) to the risk of treatment failure at one month after initiation, TB recurrence and death using binomial and Cox regression analyses. Overall, low (plasma ferritin<30 µg/L) and high (plasma ferritin>150 µg/L for women and>200 µg/L for men) iron status were seen in 9% and 48% of patients, respectively. Compared with normal levels, low plasma ferritin predicted an independent increased risk of treatment failure overall (adjusted RR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.52) and of TB recurrence among HIV-infected patients (adjusted RR = 4.21, 95% CI: 1.22 to 14.55). High plasma ferritin, independent of C-reactive protein concentrations, was associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (adjusted RR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.95 to 4.67). Conclusions/Significance Both iron deficiency and overload exist in TB patients and may contribute to disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. Strategies to maintain normal iron status in TB patients could be helpful to reduce TB morbidity and mortality."

Higher levels correlate with a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) and with a slower rate of PD progression. In this study we investigated the effects of modulating intracellular urate concentration on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP(+))-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in cultures of mouse ventral mesencephalon prepared to contain low (neuron-enriched cultures) or high (neuron-glial cultures) percentage of astrocytes. Urate, added to the cultures 24 hours before and during treatment with MPP(+), attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in neuron-enriched cultures and fully prevented their loss and atrophy in neuron-astrocyte cultures. Exogenous urate was found to increase intracellular urate content in cortical neuronal cultures. To assess the effect of reducing cellular urate content on MPP(+)-induced toxicity, mesencephalic neurons were prepared from mice over-expressing urate oxidase (UOx). Transgenic UOx expression decreased endogenous urate content both in neurons and astrocytes. Dopaminergic neurons expressing UOx were more susceptible to MPP(+) in mesencephalic neuron-enriched cultures and to a greater extent in mesencephalic neuron-astrocyte cultures. Our findings correlate intracellular urate content in dopaminergic neurons with their toxin resistance in a cellular model of PD and suggest a facilitative role for astrocytes in the neuroprotective effect of urate."
https://openalex.org/W1977400158,"Background Cellular senescence is a specialized form of growth arrest that is generally irreversible. Upregulated p16, p53, and p21 expression and silencing of E2F target genes have been characterized to promote the establishment of senescence. It can be further aided by the transcriptional repression of proliferation-associated genes by the action of HP1γ, HMGA, and DNMT proteins to produce a repressive chromatin environment. Therefore, senescence has been suggested to functions as a natural brake for tumor development and plays a critical role in tumor suppression and aging. Methodology/Principal Findings An in vitro senescence model has been established by using K562 cells treated with 50 nM doxorubicin (DOX). Since p53 and p16 are homozygously deleted in the K562 cells, the DOX-induced senescence in K562 cells ought to be independent of p53 and p16-pRb pathways. Indeed, no change in the expression of the typical senescence-associated premalignant cell markers in the DOX-induced senescent K562 cells was found. MicroRNA profiling revealed upregulated miR-375 in DOX-induced senescent K562 cells. Treatment with miR-375 inhibitor was able to reverse the proliferation ability suppressed by DOX (p<0.05) and overexpression of miR-375 suppressed the normal proliferation of K562 cells. Upregulated miR-375 expression was associated with downregulated expression of 14-3-3zeta and SP1 genes. Autophagy was also investigated since DOX treatment was able to induce cells entering senescence and eventually lead to cell death. Among the 24 human autophagy-related genes examined, a 12-fold increase of ATG9B at day 4 and a 20-fold increase of ATG18 at day 2 after DOX treatment were noted. Conclusions/Significance This study has demonstrated that in the absence of p53 and p16, the induction of senescence by DOX was associated with upregulation of miR-375 and autophagy initiation. The anti-proliferative function of miR-375 is possibly exerted, at least in part, by targeting 14-3-3zeta and SP1 genes."
https://openalex.org/W2147263604,"To promote glucose uptake into fat and muscle cells, insulin causes the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface. Previous data support a model in which TUG traps GLUT4-containing vesicles and tethers them intracellularly in unstimulated cells and in which insulin mobilizes this pool of vesicles by releasing this tether. Here we show that TUG undergoes site-specific endoproteolytic cleavage, which separates a GLUT4-binding, N-terminal region of TUG from a C-terminal region previously suggested to bind an intracellular anchor. Cleavage is accelerated by insulin stimulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is highly dependent upon adipocyte differentiation. The N-terminal TUG cleavage product has properties of a novel 18-kDa ubiquitin-like modifier, which we call TUGUL. The C-terminal product is observed at the expected size of 42 kDa and also as a 54-kDa form that is released from membranes into the cytosol. In transfected cells, intact TUG links GLUT4 to PIST and also binds Golgin-160 through its C-terminal region. PIST is an effector of TC10α, a GTPase previously shown to transmit an insulin signal required for GLUT4 translocation, and we show using RNAi that TC10α is required for TUG proteolytic processing. Finally, we demonstrate that a cleavage-resistant form of TUG does not support highly insulin-responsive GLUT4 translocation or glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Together with previous results, these data support a model whereby insulin stimulates TUG cleavage to liberate GLUT4 storage vesicles from the Golgi matrix, which promotes GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface and enhances glucose uptake.Background: GLUT4 glucose transporters are trapped and sequestered intracellularly in adipocytes by TUG.Results: Insulin stimulates TUG cleavage, which separates regions of TUG that bind GLUT4 and Golgi matrix proteins.

To increase glucose uptake into fat and muscle cells, insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters (1Rubin B.R. Bogan J.S.

In unstimulated cells, GLUT4 is sequestered intracellularly in insulin-responsive “GLUT4 storage vesicles” (GSVs) 7The abbreviations used are: GSVGLUT4 storage vesicleCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorERendoplasmic reticulumLMlight microsomeHMheavy microsomePMplasma membraneSUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierTGNtrans-Golgi networkUBLubiquitin-likeUBXubiquitin regulatory X.

GSVs are formed in a cell type-specific manner, which is differentiation-dependent in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These vesicles constitute a pool that is mobilized within minutes after insulin addition. Efficient GLUT4 sequestration in GSVs limits the number of GLUT4 transporters that are present at the surface of unstimulated cells and restricts basal glucose uptake. Insulin is then able to increase plasma membrane GLUT4 abundance severalfold and to markedly enhance the rate of glucose uptake. GSV mobilization is quantitatively the most important of the trafficking steps at which insulin acts to modulate overall GLUT4 distribution, yet how GSVs are retained within unstimulated cells and how they are translocated upon insulin stimulation are not well understood.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TUG is a 60-kDa protein present in the cytosol and on membranes, which binds and sequesters GLUT4 intracellularly in the absence of insulin. To translocate GLUT4, insulin stimulates the release of GLUT4 from TUG (6Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F.

Release occurs prior to significant GLUT4 movement out of a light microsome (LM) fraction, which contains GSVs, and the number of released proteins determines the number of GLUT4 molecules that are translocated to the cell surface within 3–6 min after insulin addition (1Rubin B.R.

Cresswell J. Löffler M.G. Bogan J.S. The glucose transporter 4-regulating protein TUG is essential for highly insulin-responsive glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7710-7722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Like acute insulin stimulation, TUG depletion mobilizes ∼60-nm vesicles to the cell surface; these vesicles carry GSV cargoes and fuse directly with the plasma membrane (10Xu Y. Rubin B.R. Orme C.M. Karpikov A. Yu C. Bogan J.S. Toomre D.K. Dual-mode of insulin action controls GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This vesicle size is characteristic of GSVs and distinct from other exocytic vesicles (10Xu Y. Rubin B.R. Orme C.M. Karpikov A. Yu C. Bogan J.S. Toomre D.K. Dual-mode of insulin action controls GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). During ongoing (≥15-min) insulin exposure, GSV cargoes recycle in ∼150-nm vesicles characteristic of endosomes and bypass a TUG-regulated membrane trafficking step. Thus, GLUT4 participates in two different exocytic pathways, which are active at distinct times after insulin addition in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The data support the idea that the initially translocated vesicles are GSVs that are regulated by TUG, whereas subsequent GLUT4 exocytosis bypasses this GSV sequestration compartment and returns directly to the plasma membrane from endosomes. The notion that insulin stimulates the release of sequestered GSVs to the cell surface and that GLUT4 then participates in an endosomal recycling pathway is consistent with previous data suggesting a “quantal release” mechanism for GLUT4 mobilization (12Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Insulin increases cell surface GLUT4 levels by dose-dependently discharging GLUT4 into a cell surface recycling pathway.Mol. Cell.

According to this model, discrete packets of GLUT4 molecules are liberated from a sequestered storage compartment into the recycling pool, yet the mechanism by which GLUT4 is released from TUG is not understood. Here we show that TUG is a substrate for site-specific endoproteolytic cleavage, which is required to translocate GLUT4. Our data support the concept that TUG proteolysis is a novel enzymatic activity by which insulin mobilizes GSVs to stimulate glucose uptake. 3T3-L1 and 293T cells were cultured as described (7Yu C.

https://openalex.org/W2047448307,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal disease characterized by a progressive loss of motoneurons. The clinical symptoms include skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy, which impairs motor performance and eventually leads to respiratory failure. We tested whether dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which has both anabolic effects on muscle and neuroprotective effects on axons and motoneurons, can ameliorate clinical symptoms in ALS. A silastic tube containing DHT crystals was implanted subcutaneously in SOD1-G93A mice at early symptomatic age when decreases in body weight and grip-strength were observed as compared to wild-type mice. DHT-treated SOD1-G93A mice demonstrated ameliorated muscle atrophy and increased body weight, which was associated with stronger grip-strength. DHT treatment increased the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 in muscle, which can exert myotrophic as well as neurotrophic effects through retrograde transport. DHT treatment attenuated neuromuscular junction denervation, and axonal and motoneuron loss. DHT-treated SOD1-G93A mice demonstrated improvement in motor behavior as assessed by rota-rod and gait analyses, and an increased lifespan. Application of DHT is a relatively simple and non-invasive procedure, which may be translated into therapy to improve the quality of life for ALS patients."

The purpose of this study was to investigate these motions in differential finger motion using ultrasound, and to compare them in healthy people and carpal tunnel syndrome patients.Transverse ultrasounds clips were taken during fist, index finger, middle finger and thumb flexion in 29 healthy normal subjects and 29 CTS patients. Displacement in palmar-dorsal and radial-ulnar direction was calculated using Analyze software. Additionally, the distance between the median nerve and the tendons was calculated.We found a changed motion pattern of the median nerve in middle finger, index finger and thumb motion between normal subjects and CTS patients (p<0.05). Also, we found a changed motion direction in CTS patients of the FDS III tendon in fist and middle finger motion, and of the FDS II and flexor pollicis longus tendon in index finger and thumb motion, respectively (p<0.05). The distance between the median nerve and the FDS II or FPL tendon is significantly greater in patients than in healthy volunteers for index finger and thumb motion, respectively (p<0.05).Our results suggest a changed motion pattern of the median nerve and several tendons in carpal tunnel syndrome patients compared to normal subjects. Such motion patterns may be useful in distinguishing affected from unaffected individuals, and in studies of the pathomechanics of carpal tunnel syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2108058168,"Influenza A virus causes seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics threatening the health of millions of people each year. Vaccination is an effective strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality, and in the absence of drug resistance, the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis is comparable to that of vaccines. However, the rapid emergence of drug resistance has emphasized the need for new drug targets. Knowledge of the host cell components required for influenza replication has been an area targeted for disease intervention. In this study, the human protease genes required for influenza virus replication were determined and validated using RNA interference approaches. The genes validated as critical for influenza virus replication were ADAMTS7, CPE, DPP3, MST1, and PRSS12, and pathway analysis showed these genes were in global host cell pathways governing inflammation (NF-κB), cAMP/calcium signaling (CRE/CREB), and apoptosis. Analyses of host microRNAs predicted to govern expression of these genes showed that eight miRNAs regulated gene expression during virus replication. These findings identify unique host genes and microRNAs important for influenza replication providing potential new targets for disease intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2023684807,"Background Cross-talk between integrins and cadherins regulates cell function. We tested the hypothesis that vitronectin (VN), a multi-functional adhesion molecule present in the extracellular matrix and plasma, regulates vascular permeability via effects on VE-cadherin, a critical regulator of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion. Methodology/Principal Findings Addition of multimeric VN (mult VN) significantly increased VE-cadherin internalization in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) monolayers. This effect was blocked by the anti-αVβ3 antibody, pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of Src kinase. In contrast to mult VN, monomeric VN did not trigger VE-cadherin internalization. In a modified Miles assay, VN deficiency impaired vascular endothelial growth factor-induced permeability. Furthermore, ischemia-induced enhancement of vascular permeability, expressed as the ratio of FITC-dextran leakage from the circulation into the ischemic and non-ischemic hindlimb muscle, was significantly greater in the WT mice than in the Vn−/− mice. Similarly, ischemia-mediated macrophage infiltration was significantly reduced in the Vn−/− mice vs. the WT controls. We evaluated changes in the multimerization of VN in ischemic tissue in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model. VN plays a previously unrecognized role in regulating endothelial permeability via conformational- and integrin-dependent effects on VE-cadherin trafficking. Conclusion/Significance These results have important implications for the regulation of endothelial function and angiogenesis by VN under normal and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1974833407,"Previous genome-wide expression studies have highlighted distinct gene expression patterns in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to control samples, but the interpretation of these studies has been limited by sample heterogeneity with respect to disease phenotype, disease activity, and anatomic sites. To further improve molecular classification of inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes we focused on a single anatomic site, the disease unaffected proximal ileal margin of resected ileum, and three phenotypes that were unlikely to overlap: ileal Crohn's disease (ileal CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and control patients without IBD. Whole human genome (Agilent) expression profiling was conducted on two independent sets of disease-unaffected ileal samples collected from the proximal margin of resected ileum. Set 1 (47 ileal CD, 27 UC, and 25 Control non-IBD patients) was used as the training set and Set 2 was subsequently collected as an independent test set (10 ileal CD, 10 UC, and 10 control non-IBD patients). We compared the 17 gene signatures selected by four different feature-selection methods to distinguish ileal CD phenotype with non-CD phenotype. The four methods yielded different but overlapping solutions that were highly discriminating. All four of these methods selected FOLH1 as a common feature. This gene is an established biomarker for prostate cancer, but has not previously been associated with Crohn's disease. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed increased expression of FOLH1 in the ileal epithelium. These results provide evidence for convergent molecular abnormalities in the macroscopically disease unaffected proximal margin of resected ileum from ileal CD subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2029767909,"We have previously shown that peroxisome proliferator activating receptor ß/δ (PPAR β/δ is overexpressed in psoriasis. PPAR β/δ is not present in adult epidermis of mice. Targeted expression of PPAR β/δ and activation by a selective synthetic agonist is sufficient to induce an inflammatory skin disease resembling psoriasis. Several signalling pathways dysregulated in psoriasis are replicated in this model, suggesting that PPAR β/δ activation contributes to psoriasis pathogenesis. Thus, inhibition of PPAR β/δ might harbour therapeutical potential. Since PPAR β/δ has pleiotropic functions in metabolism, skin-targeted inhibition offer the potential of reducing systemic adverse effects. Here, we report that three selective PPAR β/δ antagonists, GSK0660, compound 3 h, and GSK3787 can be formulated for topical application to the skin and that their skin concentration can be accurately quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/mass spectrometry. These antagonists show efficacy in our transgenic mouse model in reducing psoriasis-like changes triggered by activation of PPAR β/δ. PPAR β/δ antagonists GSK0660 and compound 3 do not exhibit systemic drug accumulation after prolonged application to the skin, nor do they induce inflammatory or irritant changes. Significantly, the irreversible PPAR β/δ antagonist (GSK3787) retains efficacy when applied topically only three times per week which could be of practical clinical usefulness. Our data suggest that topical inhibition of PPAR β/δ to treat psoriasis may warrant further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2047841437,"We have recently shown in a patient with mild bleeding that the PDZ-binding motif of the platelet G protein-coupled P2Y(12) receptor (P2Y(12)R) is required for effective receptor traffic in human platelets. In this study we show for the first time that the PDZ motif-binding protein NHERF1 exerts a major role in potentiating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) internalization. NHERF1 interacts with the C-tail of the P2Y(12)R and unlike many other GPCRs, NHERF1 interaction is required for effective P2Y(12)R internalization. In vitro and prior to agonist stimulation P2Y(12)R/NHERF1 interaction requires the intact PDZ binding motif of this receptor. Interestingly on receptor stimulation NHERF1 no longer interacts directly with the receptor but instead binds to the receptor via the endocytic scaffolding protein arrestin. These findings suggest a novel model by which arrestin can serve as an adaptor to promote NHERF1 interaction with a GPCR to facilitate effective NHERF1-dependent receptor internalization."

We previously reported that S. pneumoniae up-regulates MUC5AC expression in a MAPK ERK-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2074217318,"Numts are an integral component of many eukaryote genomes offering a snapshot of the evolutionary process that led from the incorporation of an α-proteobacterium into a larger eukaryotic cell some 1.8 billion years ago. Although numt sequence can be harnessed as molecular marker, these sequences often remain unidentified and are mistaken for genuine mtDNA leading to erroneous interpretation of mtDNA data sets. It is therefore indispensable that during the process of amplifying and sequencing mitochondrial genes, preventive measures are taken to ensure the exclusion of numts to guarantee the recovery of genuine mtDNA. This applies to mtDNA analyses in general but especially to studies where mtDNAs are sequenced de novo as the launch pad for subsequent mtDNA-based research. By using a combination of dilution series and nested rolling circle amplification (RCA), we present a novel strategy to selectively amplify mtDNA and exclude the amplification of numt sequence. We have successfully applied this strategy to de novo sequence the mtDNA of the Black Field Cricket Teleogryllus commodus, a species known to contain numts. Aligning our assembled sequence to the reference genome of Teleogryllus emma (GenBank EU557269.1) led to the identification of a numt sequence in the reference sequence. This unexpected result further highlights the need of a reliable and accessible strategy to eliminate this source of error."
https://openalex.org/W2015338723,"The integrity of antibody structure, stability, and biophysical characterization are becoming increasingly important as antibodies receive increasing scrutiny from regulatory authorities. We altered the disulfide bond arrangement of an IgG4 molecule by mutation of the Cys at the N terminus of the heavy chain constant domain 1 (C(H)1) (Kabat position 127) to a Ser and introduction of a Cys at a variety of positions (positions 227-230) at the C terminus of C(H)1. An inter-LC-C(H)1 disulfide bond is thus formed, which mimics the disulfide bond arrangement found in an IgG1 molecule. The antibody species present in the supernatant following transient expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells were analyzed by immunoblot to investigate product homogeneity, and purified product was analyzed by a thermofluor assay to determine thermal stability. We show that the light chain can form an inter-LC-C(H)1 disulfide bond with a Cys when present at several positions on the upper hinge (positions 227-230) and that such engineered disulfide bonds can consequently increase the Fab domain thermal stability between 3 and 6.8 °C. The IgG4 disulfide mutants displaying the greatest increase in Fab thermal stability were also the most homogeneous in terms of disulfide bond arrangement and antibody species present. Importantly, mutations did not affect the affinity for antigen of the resultant molecules. In combination with the previously described S241P mutation, we present an IgG4 molecule with increased Fab thermal stability and reduced product heterogeneity that potentially offers advantages for the production of IgG4 molecules."

In the present study, we found that presence of a naturally occurring H681 in gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER) of a clade C envelope (Env) obtained from a recently infected Indian patient conferred increased sensitivity to autologous and heterologous plasma antibodies. Furthermore, Env-pseudotyped viruses expressing H681 showed increased sensitivity to soluble CD4, b12 and 4E10 monoclonal antibodies both in related and unrelated Envs and was corroborated with increased Env susceptibility and binding to cellular CD4 as well as with prolonged exposure of MPER epitopes. The increased gp120-CD4 interaction was further associated with relative exposure of CD4-induced epitopes and macrophage infectivity. In summary, our data indicate that Y681H substitution exposes neutralizing epitopes in CD4bs and MPER towards comprehensive interference in HIV-1 entry."
https://openalex.org/W1982632955,"Thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been the key treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke for the past decade. Recent studies, however, suggest that this clot-busting protease also plays various roles in brain physiological and pathophysiological glutamatergic-dependent processes, such as synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. In addition, increasing evidence implicates tPA as an important neuromodulator of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant human tPA cleaves the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor. Analysis of NR2B in rat brain lysates and cortical neurons treated with tPA revealed concentration- and time-dependent degradation of NR2B proteins. Peptide sequencing studies performed on the cleaved-off products obtained from the tPA treatment on a recombinant fusion protein of the amino-terminal domain of NR2B revealed that tPA-mediated cleavage occurred at arginine 67 (Arg(67)). This cleavage is tPA-specific, plasmin-independent, and removes a predicted ~4-kDa fragment (Arg(27)-Arg(67)) from the amino-terminal domain of the NR2B protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of putative cleavage site Arg(67) to Ala(67) impeded tPA-mediated degradation of recombinant protein. This analysis revealed that NR2B is a novel substrate of tPA and suggested that an Arg(27)-Arg(67)-truncated NR2B-containing NMDA receptor could be formed. Heterologous expression of NR2B with Gln(29)-Arg(67) deleted is functional but exhibits reduced ifenprodil inhibition and increased glycine EC(50) with no change in glutamate EC(50). Our results confirmed NR2B as a novel proteolytic substrate of tPA, where tPA may directly interact with NR2B subunits leading to a change in pharmacological properties of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors."

IL-12p40, a known important mediator in limiting lung inflammation, is induced by hMPV and its production is sustained after the resolution phase of infection suggesting that this cytokine plays a role in the immune response against hMPV. In this work, we demonstrated that in mice deficient in IL-12p40, hMPV infection induced an exacerbated pulmonary inflammatory response and mucus production, altered cytokine response, and decreased lung function. However, hMPV infection in these mice does not have an effect on viral replication. These results identify an important regulatory role of IL-12p40 in hMPV infection."

Deletion of either PPH3 or PSY2 resulted in enhanced filamentous growth during MMS treatment and continuous filamentous growth even after MMS removal. Moreover, during this growth, Rad53 remained hyperphosphorylated, MBF-regulated genes were downregulated, and hypha-specific genes were upregulated. We have also identified S461 and S545 on Rad53 as potential dephosphorylation sites of Pph3/Psy2 that are specifically involved in cellular responses to MMS. Therefore, our studies have identified a novel molecular mechanism mediating DNA damage response to MMS in C. albicans."

The cyclope gene of Drosophila encodes a cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIc homolog.Genetics. 2001; 158: 1629-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic core of the enzyme is composed of three subunits encoded in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA): mt-CO1, mt-CO2, and mt-CO3. The structural subunits that surround the catalytic core are encoded by the nuclear genome (4Fontanesi F. Soto I.C. Barrientos A. Cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis: new levels of regulation.IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The nuclear genome-encoded subunits must be imported into the mitochondria, processed, and assembled together with the mtDNA-encoded subunits to form the holoenzyme. The nuclear genome-encoded subunits are necessary for the assembly/stability of the holoenzyme (5Galati D. Srinivasan S. Raza H. Prabu S.K. Hardy M. Chandran K. Lopez M. Kalyanaraman B. Avadhani N.G.

More than 20 assembly factors required for correct COX function have been described in yeast; albeit the specific function of many of these factors remains elusive (for a review, see Ref. 8Barrientos A.

They are involved in different biological processes, for example in the biogenesis and/or insertion of prosthetic groups (9Papadopoulou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishino I. Sadlock J.E.

Transcription of genes in bacteria and Archaea occurs in polycistronic messenger RNA, whereas in Eukaryota, the majority of genes are transcribed monocistronically (16Blumenthal T. Operons in eukaryotes.Brief. Funct. Genomic. Proteomic. 2004; 3: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, there are some exceptions in Eukaryota where genes are transcribed in polycistronic messages, and in general, these polycistronic genes tend to be involved in the same biological process as occurs in bacteria (17Andrews J.

Mitochondrial gene expression is regulated by several nuclearly encoded proteins, including the mitochondrial transcription factor B1 (mtTFB1) (21Scarpulla R.C. Transcriptional paradigms in mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis and function.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 611-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). mtTFB1 is dual function protein that can activate mtDNA transcription in vitro (22Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A.

Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and act as an rRNA methyltransferase in vivo (23Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S.

Evol. 2006; 63: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous work from our group in cultured Drosophila cells indicated a major role for mtTFB1 in mitochondrial translation (25Matsushima Y. Adán C. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. Drosophila mitochondrial transcription factor B1 modulates mitochondrial translation but not transcription or DNA copy number in Schneider cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16815-16820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). And more recently, Larsson and co-workers (26Metodiev M.D. Lesko N. Park C.B. Cámara Y. Shi Y. Wibom R. Hultenby K. Gustafsson C.M. Larsson N.G. Methylation of 12S rRNA is necessary for in vivo stability of the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome.Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have corroborated these data in mammals where they showed methylation of the 12 S rRNA mediated by mtTFB1 is required for assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome and therefore for mitochondrial translation. The mtTFB1 gene in Drosophila melanogaster was annotated as the protein-coding gene number CG7319 in the fly genome database (FlyBase). More recently, the FlyBase genome annotators have published changes affecting the annotation of the mtTFB1 gene that indicates the existence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in its 5′-untranslated region. The putative protein coding gene is annotated as CG42630 in the FlyBase database. Here we show that CG42630 is transcribed in a bicistronic RNA messenger with the mtTFB1 gene and is expressed in flies. BLAST analysis of the novel uORF indicated 42% amino acid identity with the human annotated coiled coil domain-containing protein 56 (CCDC56; NCBI accession number NP_001035521.1). Thus, we propose Drosophila CG42630 as the homolog of human CCDC56. Although the function of CCDC56 is unknown, it is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes. To study the function of the CCDC56 protein, we generated a D. melanogaster knock-out model by inducing genomic deletions by imprecise P element excision. Our results indicate that the CCDC56 homolog is a mitochondrial protein required for COX activity and assembly in D. melanogaster, suggesting a role as a COX assembly factor. All fly crosses and stocks were grown at 25 °C on a standard Drosophila medium. ccdc56D6 and ccdc56D11 mutants were generated by inducing the transposition of the SUPor-P[kg07792] P element insertion using standard procedures (27Engels W.R. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Eggleston W.B. Sved J. High-frequency P element loss in Drosophila is homolog dependent.Cell. 1990; 62: 515-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Deletion break points of alleles were determined by PCR followed by sequencing using specific primers (see Fig. 3, B and C). Sequences were assembled and analyzed using the Vector NTI software (Invitrogen). Transgenic lines for the pUASP-ccdc56, pUASP-mtTFB1, and pUASP-cDNAbi constructs were generated by the injection of Drosophila embryos (BestGene). cDNAs from Drosophila control larvae (w1118 and Oregon R-C) and Schneider cells were prepared using the First Choice RLM-RACE cDNA amplification kit (Ambion). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNAs ends (RACE) was performed using the following specific primers for Drosophila mtTFB1 cDNA (CG42631; formerly CG7319): R1, R2, and R3 (depicted in Fig. 1A). RACE products were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequence analysis was performed using Vector NTI Advance 10 software (Invitrogen). Human CCDC56 (NCBI accession number NP_001035521.1) and CCDC56 homologs were identified by BLAST using the deduced amino acid sequence of the D. melanogaster CG2630 coding gene (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59727) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of the predicted CCDC56 polypeptides were performed using the ClustalW 2.0.12 algorithm (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55612) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total RNA from control flies were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad) following standard procedures. Invitrogen's 0.5–10-kb RNA ladder was used as a molecular size marker. A PCR fragment of 280 bp containing the complete ccdc56 ORF (261 bp) was used as a ccdc56-specific probe. This probe was amplified by PCR from the pUASP-ccdc56 construct using primers 9558F and 9559R (see below). The specific probe for the mtTFB1 coding sequence (322 bp) was obtained by PCR amplification using the primers F9 (5′-AGCACATCCCGGACACCTCA-3′) and R4 (5′-TTTAGGGGAATTAGCTTGACG-3′). Probes were radiolabeled with [P32]dCTP using the Amersham Biosciences Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. We carried out 2-h egg laying from the control w1118 stock and the stable mutant stocks ccdc56D6/TM6b-Tb and ccdc56D11/TM6B-Tb. To determine whether mutant larvae were developmentally arrested, developmentally delayed, or merely slow growing, their mouth hooks were examined daily under the microscope from the 5th day after egg laying (AEL). Fly vials were also photographed daily. To express d-CCDC56 in Escherichia coli, a PCR fragment encoding the d-CCDC56 open reading frame was cloned into the pRSET-B vector (Invitrogen) cut with NcoI and HindIII. The following primers were used: Fw, 5′-TTCCATGGCGGCGTCGGAGCAGGGACC-3′; and Rv, 5′-AGAAGCTTCTAGGAAGACACCTTCTTGGGCTC-3′ (bold nucleotides mean restriction enzyme sites). Polyclonal antibody was generated using standard procedures. The bicistronic ccdc56-mtTFB1 cDNA (1574 bp) was obtained from the cDNA clone LD40326 (GenBankTM accession number AY069635) and cloned into the BglII/XbaI restriction sites of the pUAST transformation vector to generate the pUAST-cDNAbi construct. To generate the pUASP-ccdc56 vector for transformation, a fragment containing exclusively the complete ccdc56 ORF (261 bp) was amplified by PCR using the primers 9558F (5′-TTTAGCAGCGTTTATAATGTCG-3′) and 9559R (5′-TAGGGATAACTAACGCGGACA-3′), subcloned into the pCAP vector (Roche Applied Science), and cloned into the NotI/XbaI restriction sites in the pUASP vector. To generate the pUASP-mtTFB1 construct, mtTFB1 ORF (990 bp) was obtained by digestion with KpnI/NotI of the pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene) containing the mtTFB1 cDNA and cloned into the pUASP vector for transformation. D. melanogaster CCDC56 ORF was amplified by PCR from the pUASP-ccdc56 construct indicated above using the primers F (5′-TTGGTACCATGTCGGCGTCGGAGCAGGGACC-3′) and R (5′-TTGCGGCCGCCTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGAAGACACCTTCTTGGGCTCC-3′) containing the FLAG epitope at the C terminus and the KpnI/NotI sites needed for cloning into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Fidelity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing. Human HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). 1.5 × 105 HeLa cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with 2 μg of the pcDNA3-d-ccdc56-FLAG construct. Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was used as a transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. To label the mitochondrial compartment, cells were incubated for 30 min with a 250 nm concentration of the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red (Invitrogen) 24 h after transfection, washed, and fixed for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde. Primary anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000; Stratagene) and secondary Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (1:200; Molecular Probes) were used. Images were collected using a confocal microscope (Leica). Imaginal discs from third instar larvae of each genotype were dissected in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. They were blocked in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h; incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (dilution, 1:50); washed; and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature in the dark (dilution, 1:200). Finally, they were washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-phosphohistone 3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit anti-caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies were coupled to the fluorochrome Alexa Fluor 647 or Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen). Preparations were visualized under a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning microscope. For enzymatic activity measurements, mitochondrion-enriched homogenates were prepared from ∼30 third instar larvae ground in SETH buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 100 units/liter heparin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), fractionated by differential centrifugation, and sonicated (6 s at 4 °C). The activities of the respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, and IV and the mitochondrial mass marker citrate synthase were measured by spectrophotometric methods as described previously (30Pérez-Carreras M. Del Hoyo P. Martín M.A. Rubio J.C. Martín A. Castellano G. Colina F. Arenas J. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Defective hepatic mitochondrial respiratory chain in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Hepatology. 2003; 38: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and expressed in nanomoles of substrate catalyzed/minute/milligram of protein. For mtRNA quantification, RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg from each genotype was converted into cDNA and amplified in a 7900 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan probes. For relative quantification of mtDNA, genomic DNA was isolated from third instar larvae and quantified using standard methods. Ten nanograms of each DNA were used as template. TaqMan probes for mt-ND5 and mt-CO1 were used. Thirty micrograms of each mitochondrial protein extract, obtained by differential centrifugation, were separated on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P PVDF membranes (Millipore). Filters were preincubated for 1 h in 5% skim milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 followed by an overnight incubation with the corresponding primary antibody. Monoclonal antibody against porin (1:2000; voltage-dependent anion channel) was obtained from Molecular Probes, polyclonal antibody against d-CCDC56 was generated as described above (1:50), and polyclonal antibody anti-mtTFB1 was previously generated by Dr. L. S. Kaguni (1:1000) (25Matsushima Y. Adán C. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. Drosophila mitochondrial transcription factor B1 modulates mitochondrial translation but not transcription or DNA copy number in Schneider cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16815-16820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation, D. melanogaster embryos were homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm TES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 with five strokes at 1000 rpm using a motor-driven Teflon pestle. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 9000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondrial fraction (pellet) and postmitochondrial supernatant. Fifty micrograms of each fraction were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with anti-porin (1:1000), anti-GAPDH (1:1000; Stressgene), and anti-d-CCDC56 (1:50) antibodies. Mitochondrial pellets isolated from larvae were resuspended in 1.5 m aminocaproic acid, 75 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0. Respiratory chain complexes were extracted with 2% lauryl maltoside for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (two-dimensional SDS-PAGE) were performed as described (31Calvaruso M.A. Smeitink J. Nijtmans L. Electrophoresis techniques to investigate defects in oxidative phosphorylation.Methods. 2008; 46: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), loading 40 μg of mitochondrial protein per lane. A 4–18% native acrylamide gradient gel was used for the first dimension, and 10% acrylamide gels were used for electrophoresis in the second dimension. Proteins were transferred overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-mt-CO3 (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:200 dilution; polyclonal antibody against β-ATPase, generated in our laboratory (32Peña P. Garesse R. The β subunit of the Drosophila melanogaster ATP synthase: cDNA cloning, amino acid analysis and identification of the protein in adult flies.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was used at 1:1000; and secondary goat-anti mouse antibody IgG-HRP (provided by Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used at 1:2000. Statistical data analysis was performed with Prism 4.03 software (GraphPad Software). One-way analysis of variance (plus Bonferroni post-test) and Student's t test were used to determine statistical significance of the results, which was assumed at p < 0.05. A search in the Drosophila genome database (FlyBase) indicated the existence of a uORF in the 5′-UTR of the mtTFB1 transcript located in the first exon of the mRNA (Fig. 1A). This putative polypeptide is denoted as CG42630 in FlyBase, and the biological processes in which it is potentially involved are unknown. To confirm the existence of a bona fide bicistronic transcript of CG42630-mtTFB1, we isolated mRNA from Drosophila strains and from Drosophila SL2 Schneider cells and carried out RACE (Fig. 1B) using the strategy described under “Experimental Procedures.” We sequenced the cDNA clones obtained by 5′-RACE from different Drosophila strains (w1118, n = 8; Oregon R-C, n = 6) and from cultured Schneider cells (n = 6), and in all cases, sequence analyses detected a single transcript with a heterogeneous transcription start point located upstream from the CG42630 uORF (Fig. 1B). We excluded the presence of transcripts coding only for CG42630 by 3′-RACE (data not shown). These results suggest strongly that d-mtTFB1 and the putative gene, CG42630, are transcribed in the same mRNA and therefore are encoded in a bicistron. We tested the existence of this CG42630-mtTFB1 bicistronic mRNA by Northern blot in total RNA extracted from D. melanogaster flies (Fig. 1C) using two different probes: a 280-nucleotide probe specific for the CG42630 coding sequence and a 320-nucleotide probe specific for the mtTFB1 coding sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). We detected with both probes a single signal of about the expected size of 1574 bp (Fig. 1A), confirming the existence of the CG42630-mtTFB1 bicistronic structure in D. melanogaster. The putative CG42630 gene encodes a predicted polypeptide of 87 amino acids (FlyBase). The deduced amino acid sequence from Drosophila CG42630 was used to perform a BLAST analysis of the human genome (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59727) Google Scholar), and a single protein of unknown function was identified: CCDC56. We found a 42% amino acid identity between D. melanogaster and its human homolog. CCDC56 has two putative domains: a single pass transmembrane domain (from amino acids 58 to 78 in humans and from amino acids 49 to 69 in D. melanogaster) and a protein-protein interaction coiled coil domain (from amino acids 79 to 104 in humans and from amino acids 70 to 87 in D. melanogaster) (Fig. 1E). We refer to the Drosophila CG42630 gene as ccdc56. In contrast to the bicistronic structure detected in flies, human CCDC56 is encoded in a single transcript, and the gene is located on chromosome 17q.21.31 (Entrez Gene ID 28958). Human CCDC56 protein contains 106 amino acids (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9Y2R0). Orthologous CCDC56 proteins are present in metazoans, showing a"
https://openalex.org/W1966387313,"Background Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is thought to be associated with more mood symptoms and worse cognitive functioning. This study examined whether variation in HPA axis activity underlies the association between mood symptoms and cognitive functioning. Methodology/Principal Findings In 65 bipolar patients cognitive functioning was measured in domains of psychomotor speed, speed of information processing, attentional switching, verbal memory, visual memory, executive functioning and an overall mean score. Severity of depression was assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self rating version. Saliva cortisol measurements were performed to calculate HPA axis indicators: cortisol awakening response, diurnal slope, the evening cortisol level and the cortisol suppression on the dexamethasone suppression test. Regression analyses of depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning on each HPA axis indicator were performed. In addition we calculated percentages explanation of the association between depressive symptoms and cognition by HPA axis indicators. Depressive symptoms were associated with dysfunction in psychomotor speed, attentional switching and the mean score, as well as with attenuation in diurnal slope value. No association was found between HPA axis activity and cognitive functioning and HPA axis activity did not explain the associations between depressive symptoms and cognition. Conclusions/Significance As our study is the first one in this field specific for bipolar patients and changes in HPA-axis activity did not seem to explain the association between severity of depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning in bipolar patients, future studies are needed to evaluate other factors that might explain this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2011782726,DNA sequence amplification is a phenomenon that occurs predictably at defined stages during normal development in some organisms. Developmental gene amplification was first described in amphibians during gametogenesis and has not yet been described in humans. To date gene amplification in humans is a hallmark of many tumors. We used array-CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) and FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) to discover gene amplifications during in vitro differentiation of human neural progenitor cells. Here we report a complex gene amplification pattern two and five days after induction of differentiation of human neural progenitor cells. We identified several amplified genes in neural progenitor cells that are known to be amplified in malignant tumors. There is also a striking overlap of amplified chromosomal regions between differentiating neural progenitor cells and malignant tumor cells derived from astrocytes. Gene amplifications in normal human cells as physiological process has not been reported yet and may bear resemblance to developmental gene amplifications in amphibians and insects.
https://openalex.org/W2083815337,"The development and progression of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) shares a number of similarities with atherosclerosis. Recently we could demonstrate that regular exercise training (ET) as primary prevention prevents aortic valve disease in LDL-receptor deficient (LDLR(-/-)) mice. We aimed to investigate the impact of exercise training on the progression of CAVD in LDLR(-/-) mice in the setting of secondary preventionSixty-four LDLR(-/-) mice were fed with high cholesterol diet to induce aortic valve sclerosis. Thereafter the animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1 continuing on high cholesterol diet, group 2 continuing with cholesterol diet plus 1 h ET per day, group 3 continuing with normal mouse chow. After another 16 weeks the animal were sacrificed. Histological analysis of the aortic valve thickness demonstrated no significant difference between the three groups (control 98.3±4.5 µm, ET 88.2±6.6 µm, change in diet 87.5±4.0). Immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cells revealed a disrupted endothelial cell layer to the same extend in all groups. Furthermore no difference between the groups was evident with respect to the expression of inflammatory, fibroblastic and osteoblastic markers.Based on the present study we have to conclude that once the development of a CAVD is initiated, exercise training or a change in diet does not have the potential to attenuate the progress of the CAVD."
https://openalex.org/W1989536970,"Drosophila is a well-established model organism for studying innate immunity because of its high resistance against microbial infections and lack of adaptive immunity. In addition, the immune signaling cascades found in Drosophila are evolutionarily conserved. Upon infection, activation of the immune signaling pathways, Toll and Imd, leads to the expression of multiple immune response genes, such as the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Previously, we identified an uncharacterized gene edin among the genes, which were strongly induced upon stimulation with Escherichia coli in Drosophila S2 cells. Edin has been associated with resistance against Listeria monocytogenes, but its role in Drosophila immunity remains elusive. In this study, we examined the role of Edin in the immune response of Drosophila both in vitro and in vivo. We report that edin expression is dependent on the Imd-pathway NF-κB transcription factor Relish and that it is expressed upon infection both in vitro and in vivo. Edin encodes a pro-protein, which is further processed in S2 cells. In our experiments, Edin did not bind microbes, nor did it possess antimicrobial activity to tested microbial strains in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, edin RNAi did not significantly affect the expression of AMPs in vitro or in vivo. However, edin RNAi flies showed modestly impaired resistance to E. faecalis infection. We conclude that Edin has no potent antimicrobial properties but it appears to be important for E. faecalis infection via an uncharacterized mechanism. Further studies are still required to elucidate the exact role of Edin in the Drosophila immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2013953615,"The ferret is commonly used as a model for studies of infectious diseases. The genomic sequence of this animal model is not yet characterized, and only a limited number of fully annotated cDNAs are currently available in GenBank. The majority of genes involved in innate or adaptive immune response are still lacking, restricting molecular genetic analysis of host response in the ferret model. To enable de novo identification of transcriptionally active ferret genes in response to infection, we performed de-novo transcriptome sequencing of animals infected with H1N1 A/California/07/2009. We also included splenocytes induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide to allow for identification of transcripts specifically induced by Gram-negative bacteria. We pooled and normalized the cDNA library in order to delimit the risk of sequencing only highly expressed genes. While normalization of the cDNA library removes the possibility of assessing expression changes between individual animals, it has been shown to increase identification of low abundant transcripts. In this study, we identified more than 19000 partial ferret transcripts, including more than 1000 gene orthologs known to be involved in the innate and the adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2068500654,"Mitochondria are descendants of the endosymbiotic α-proteobacterium most likely engulfed by the ancestral eukaryotic cells, and the proto-mitochondrial genome should have been severely streamlined in terms of both genome size and gene repertoire. In addition, mitochondrial (mt) sequence data indicated that frequent intron gain/loss events contributed to shaping the modern mt genome organizations, resulting in the homologous introns being shared between two distantly related mt genomes. Unfortunately, the bulk of mt sequence data currently available are of phylogenetically restricted lineages, i.e., metazoans, fungi, and land plants, and are insufficient to elucidate the entire picture of intron evolution in mt genomes. In this work, we sequenced a 12 kbp-fragment of the mt genome of the katablepharid Leucocryptos marina. Among nine protein-coding genes included in the mt genome fragment, the genes encoding cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cob and cox1) were interrupted by group I introns. We further identified that the cob and cox1 introns host open reading frames for homing endonucleases (HEs) belonging to distantly related superfamilies. Phylogenetic analyses recovered an affinity between the HE in the Leucocryptos cob intron and two green algal HEs, and that between the HE in the Leucocryptos cox1 intron and a fungal HE, suggesting that the Leucocryptos cob and cox1 introns possess distinct evolutionary origins. Although the current intron (and intronic HE) data are insufficient to infer how the homologous introns were distributed to distantly related mt genomes, the results presented here successfully expanded the evolutionary dynamism of group I introns in mt genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1970110968,"Increased mast cell (MC) density and changes in their distribution in airway tissues is thought to contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of asthma. However, the time sequence for these changes and how they impact small airway function in asthma is not fully understood. The aim of the current study was to characterise temporal changes in airway MC density and correlate these changes with functional airway responses in sheep chronically challenged with house dust mite (HDM) allergen.MC density was examined on lung tissue from four spatially separate lung segments of allergic sheep which received weekly challenges with HDM allergen for 0, 8, 16 or 24 weeks. Lung tissue was collected from each segment 7 days following the final challenge. The density of tryptase-positive and chymase-positive MCs (MC(T) and MC(TC) respectively) was assessed by morphometric analysis of airway sections immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against MC tryptase and chymase. MC(T) and MC(TC) density was increased in small bronchi following 24 weeks of HDM challenges compared with controls (P<0.05). The MC(TC)/MC(T) ratio was significantly increased in HDM challenged sheep compared to controls (P<0.05). MC(T) and MC(TC) density was inversely correlated with allergen-induced increases in peripheral airway resistance after 24 weeks of allergen exposure (P<0.05). MC(T) density was also negatively correlated with airway responsiveness after 24 challenges (P<0.01).MC(T) and MC(TC) density in the small airways correlates with better lung function in this sheep model of chronic asthma. Whether this finding indicates that under some conditions mast cells have protective activities in asthma, or that other explanations are to be considered requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2108718642,"Animal models which allow the temporal regulation of gene activities are valuable for dissecting gene function in tumorigenesis. Here we have constructed a conditional inducible estrogen receptor-K-rasG12D (ER-K-rasG12D) knock-in mice allele that allows us to temporally switch on or off the activity of K-ras oncogenic mutant through tamoxifen administration. In vitro studies using mice embryonic fibroblast (MEF) showed that a dose of tamoxifen at 0.05 µM works optimally for activation of ER-K-rasG12D independent of the gender status. Furthermore, tamoxifen-inducible activation of K-rasG12D promotes cell proliferation, anchor-independent growth, transformation as well as invasion, potentially via activation of downstream MAPK pathway and cell cycle progression. Continuous activation of K-rasG12D in vivo by tamoxifen treatment is sufficient to drive the neoplastic transformation of normal lung epithelial cells in mice. Tamoxifen withdrawal after the tumor formation results in apoptosis and tumor regression in mouse lungs. Taken together, these data have convincingly demonstrated that K-ras mutant is essential for neoplastic transformation and this animal model may provide an ideal platform for further detailed characterization of the role of K-ras oncogenic mutant during different stages of lung tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1986247529,"Single cell imaging studies suggest that transcription is not continuous and occurs as discrete pulses of gene activity. To study mechanisms by which retroviral transgenes can transcribe to high levels, we used the MS2 system to visualize transcriptional dynamics of high expressing proviral integration sites in embryonic stem (ES) cells. We established two ES cell lines each bearing a single copy, self-inactivating retroviral vector with a strong ubiquitous human EF1α gene promoter directing expression of mRFP fused to an MS2-stem-loop array. Transfection of MS2-EGFP generated EGFP focal dots bound to the mRFP-MS2 stem loop mRNA. These transcription foci colocalized with the transgene integration site detected by immunoFISH. Live tracking of single cells for 20 minutes detected EGFP focal dots that displayed frequent and rapid fluctuations in transcription over periods as short as 25 seconds. Similarly rapid fluctuations were detected from focal doublet signals that colocalized with replicated proviral integration sites by immunoFISH, consistent with transcriptional pulses from sister chromatids. We concluded that retroviral transgenes experience rapid transcriptional pulses in clonal ES cell lines that exhibit high level expression. These events are directed by a constitutive housekeeping gene promoter and may provide precedence for rapid transcriptional pulsing at endogenous genes in mammalian stem cells."
