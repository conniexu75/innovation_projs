https://openalex.org/W1596679547,"Growing HepG2 cells contain 50,000 functional surface transferrin-binding sites (Ciechanover, A., Schwartz, A.L., and Lodish, H.F. (1983) Cell 32,267-275) and 100,000 intracellular sites. At saturating concentrations of [59Fe]transferrin, and under conditions in which protein synthesis is blocked, iron uptake is linear for several hours at a rate of 9,500 transferrin molecules/cell/min. Thus, each receptor must recycle a ligand, on the average, each 15.8 min. Surface-bound transferrin is rapidly endocytosed (t1/2 = 3.5 min). All of the iron remains within the cell, while the apotransferrin is rapidly (t1/2 = 5.0 min) secreted into the medium. Previously, we showed (Dautry-Varsat, A., Ciechanover, A., and Lodish, H.F. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 2258-2262) that exposure of a ferrotransferrin-receptor complex to medium of pH less than 5.0 results in dissociation of iron, but that apotransferrin remains bound to its receptor. If the pH is raised to 7.0, such as would occur when an acidic intracellular vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, apotransferrin is very rapidly dissociated (t1/2 = 17 s at 37 degrees C) from its receptor. Taken together, these results indicate that transferrin remains bound to its receptor throughout the endocytic cycle. In the present study, we have directly measured all the kinetic parameters involved in the transferrin receptor cycle. They are similar to those of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in the same cell line, and can be described by a simple kinetic model. In the presence of lysosomotropic agents, ferrotransferrin binds to its surface receptor and is internalized normally. However, iron is not dissociated from transferrin, and ferrotransferrin recycles back to the cell surface and is secreted into the medium. We conclude that the low pH in endocytic vesicles is essential for the dissociation of iron from transferrin and its delivery to the cell, but is not required for recycling of transferrin, and presumably of its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1595835172,"We have studied the compartmentation of cyclic AMP action in purified ventricular cardiomyocytes prepared by collagenase perfusion of adult rabbit hearts. Incubation of purified adult myocytes with 1 microM isoproterenol causes rapid accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP in both soluble (2.3 leads to 7.7 pmol/ mg of protein) and particulate (3.0 leads to 9.2) fractions of cell homogenates (3000 X g for 5 min), increases in the total activity and activity ratio of soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (0.21 leads to 0.66), a decrease in protein kinase activity remaining in the particulate fraction (47 leads to 30%), and an increase in the activity ratio of glycogen phosphorylase (0.15 leads to 0.47). Incubation of myocytes with 10 microM prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) leads to a comparable increase in soluble cyclic AMP (2.3 leads to 5.8 pmol/mg of protein) and activation of soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (0.21 leads to 0.39) but does not result in any change in cAMP or protein kinase in the particulate fraction and fails to cause an activation of glycogen phosphorylase. PGE1 does not inhibit the effects of isoproterenol; when myocytes are incubated with both isoproterenol and PGE1, the accumulation of cyclic AMP, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase b leads to a conversion are equal to that achieved with isoproterenol alone. Perturbation of cellular calcium using the ionophore A23187, verapamil, or high or low extracellular calcium did not alter the ability of isoproterenol to cause activation of particulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase or influence the inability of PGE1 to do so. Activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin (30 microM) caused immediate activation of both soluble and particulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase leading to rapid activation of phosphorylase. We conclude that the hormonally specific compartmentation of cyclic AMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase that occurs in intact heart (Hayes, J. S., Brunton, L. L., Brown, J. H., Reese, J. B., and Mayer, S. E. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 1570-1574) is not explained on the basis of cellular heterogeneity but has a subcellular basis within the cardiomyocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1497104674,"Phosphorylation of the somatomedin-C receptor was investigated both in intact IM-9 cells and in IM-9 cells that had been solubilized with Triton X-100. Intact IM-9 cells were incubated with [32P]H3PO4 for 1 h and for an additional 5 min in the absence or presence of insulin or somatomedin-C. The cells were then solubilized and subjected to wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose chromatography. The extent of phosphorylation of insulin and somatomedin-C receptors was assessed by immunoprecipitating the wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose eluates with monoclonal antibodies specific for each receptor and analyzing the immunoprecipitates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The beta-subunits of both receptors were phosphorylated in the absence of hormone, and the extent of phosphorylation of each receptor was enhanced by both hormones. However, each hormone was more potent than the other in enhancing phosphorylation of its own receptor. The beta-subunit of the somatomedin-C receptor was also phosphorylated when solubilized IM-9 cells that had been purified on wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. In this soluble preparation, phosphorylation occurred on tyrosyl residues and was enhanced by concentrations of somatomedin-C in the range of 2.5 to 250 ng/ml, which is consistent with its receptor affinity. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of the somatomedin-C receptor also occurred when highly purified receptor, prepared by wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by immunoprecipitation, was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. This indicates that the responsible tyrosyl kinase activity is intrinsic to the receptor or tightly associated with it."
https://openalex.org/W1622269784,"Control and stimulated platelets were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine whether proteins are altered during platelet activation. Platelets were stimulated with thrombin, collagen, or the calcium ionophore A23187, and aggregation was brought about by stirring in the presence of Ca2+. These activated platelets contained at least three polypeptides not found in control platelets: 1) Mr = 200,000, pI between 6.2 and 6.4; 2) Mr = 100,000, pI = 6.3; and 3) Mr = 91,000, pI = 6.1. An additional polypeptide, polypeptide 4, with Mr = 97,000 and pI = 5.9, was present only in platelets activated by thrombin. When aggregation was prevented, either by adding 5 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to the platelet suspension or by incubating the platelet suspension without stirring, polypeptides 1-3 were not formed. Partial hydrolysis of polypeptides 2 and 4 with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease yielded distinct sets of peptide hydrolytic fragments. These differed from those produced by the hydrolysis of alpha-actinin, a major platelet protein, which has a molecular weight similar to polypeptides 2 and 4. Polypeptides 1-3 were also produced during incubation of platelet lysates in the presence of Ca2+. Generation of these polypeptides in lysates was prevented either by chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA or by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide, leupeptin, or mersalyl, inhibitors of the calcium-dependent protease. These data show that the calcium-dependent protease is activated during aggregation of platelets by physiological agents and suggest that this protease could have a role in platelet response to stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W125040153,"Release of Ca2+ from a heavy fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was triggered by several different methods: (a) increasing extravesicular [Ca2+] [( CaO2+] from about 0.1 microM to 10 microM), (b), adding caffeine, (c) adding quercetin, and (d) substituting a solution containing equimolar choline+ for K+-containing solution (depolarization-induced Ca2+ release). The maximal rate of Ca2+ release triggered by caffeine or quercetin in the presence of 12.5 microM [CaO2+] (21-25 nmol of Ca2+/mg/s) is similar to that of the depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (19 nmol of Ca2+/mg/s), as determined by stopped flow spectrometry of changes in [CaO2+] with arsenazo III. The release is transient and all of the released Ca2+ is reaccumulated. The rates of Ca2+ release triggered by caffeine, quercetin, or membrane depolarization sharply decrease at high [CaO2+], suggesting a negative feedback effect of the released Ca2+. Inhibition of the release pathway allows the sarcoplasmic reticulum to reaccumulate Ca2+. The rate of Ca2+ release triggered by caffeine or quercetin, but not that triggered by membrane depolarization, is also reduced upon decreasing [CaO2+] to the submicromolar range. Passive efflux of intravesicular Ca2+ in solutions containing lower [CaO2+] in the absence of Mg.ATP is attenuated at about the same time (congruent to 1 min) regardless of the amounts of Ca2+ released, indicating that the opened Ca2+ channels close spontaneously. These results suggest that kinetically identical channels are responsible for Ca2+ release independent of the methods of triggering and this in vitro release is consistent with the physiological mechanism both in terms of the rapidity and the reversibility of Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W1651094673,"Two-dimensional electrophoretic techniques were used to identify and characterize a protein that is not produced in quiescent isolated rat adrenal cells but is produced in response to acute stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or dibutyryl cAMP. The molecular weight of this protein is 28,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis), and its isoelectric point is 6.5 (isoelectric focusing). Mapping of proteolytic peptides suggests that this induced protein (i) is quite similar in primary structure to another protein (p), which is produced only in nonstimulated adrenal cells. The time course of formation of protein i and its ACTH dose response closely parallel the increase of corticosteroid production in stimulated cells. The possibility that protein i is produced in response to increased levels of some steroid of the glucocorticoid pathway is precluded by the observation that inhibition of corticosteroid synthesis by aminoglutethimide does not alter the rate of production of i. Addition of cycloheximide before ACTH, which prevents stimulation of corticosteroidogenesis, also prevents formation of protein i implying that the production of protein i depends on continuing protein synthesis. [35S/32S]Methionine pulse-chase experiments, i.e. addition of excess [32S] methionine and ACTH after prelabeling with [35S]methionine, show that protein i is not produced from pre-existing protein p or other pre-existing proteins even if protein synthesis (and increased steroid production) is not inhibited. These findings exclude post-translational modification as a mechanism for the production of i but are consistent with p and i being related by cotranslational modification. Addition of cycloheximide after stimulation causes the formation of protein i to cease, but the amount of the protein does not decrease with the same kinetics as the return of corticosteroid production to its unstimulated level. [35S/32S]Methionine pulse-chase experiments imply protein i, even under conditions of ongoing ACTH stimulation and protein synthesis, is degraded with approximately the same kinetics as after cycloheximide inhibition. The close concurrence under a wide variety of experimental conditions between the appearance of protein i and the increase in adrenal corticosteroid production, coupled with the fact that the former does not occur as a result of the latter, make protein i a likely candidate for the postulated corticosteroidogenic stimulatory protein (Ferguson, J.J. (1962) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 57, 616-617). The fact that stimulation of steroidogenesis may occur via co-translational modification of a regulatory protein is an intriguing possibility which readily explains both the observed rapid and protein synthesis-dependent stimulation and the lack of dependence of stimulation on transcription (Schulster, D. (1974) Mol. Cell. Endocr. 1, 55-64)."
https://openalex.org/W1501448308,"The nucleotide sequence of the mtlA gene, which codes for the mannitol-specific Enzyme II of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system, is presented. From the gene sequence, the primary translation product is predicted to consist of 637 amino acids (Mr = 67,893). This result is compared to the amino acid composition and molecular weight of the purified mannitol Enzyme II protein. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the enzyme were evaluated along its amino acid sequence using a computer program (Kyte, J., and Doolittle, R. F. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132). The computer analysis predicts that the NH2-terminal half of the enzyme resides within the membrane, whereas the COOH-terminal half of the enzyme has the properties of a soluble protein. The possible functions of such a protein structure are discussed. RNA mapping has identified the promoter and mRNA start point for the mtl operon."
https://openalex.org/W1590867663,"Three overlapping genomic clones covering 28 kilobases of the human pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene have been isolated from a lambda phage library. The analysis of 12 introns and 12 exons in the 3' end region has shown that the human gene has a structure remarkably similar to that reported for the homologous chicken gene. One large intron, in the alpha-chain domain, contains an AluI sequence flanked by short direct repeats; a second AluI sequence is present 4 kilobases downstream from the termination codon. The analysis of the exon coding for the 3'-untranslated region has revealed that the pro-alpha 2(I) collagen gene transcribes at least four different mRNAs in cultured fibroblasts. The colinearity and exact location of the termini of these transcripts was determined by Northern blots, R-looping analysis, S1 protection, and DNA sequencing. The ends of two transcripts are closely preceded by the canonical polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA), whereas two of its variations (AUUAAA and AUUAA) precede the ends of the other two transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1525290642,"Equilibrium binding of EcoRI endonuclease to DNA has been analyzed by nitrocellulose filter and preferential DNA cleavage methods. Association constants for pBR322 and a 34-base pair molecule containing the EcoRI site of this plasmid in a central position were determined to be 1.9 X 10(11) M-1 and 1.0 X 10(11) M-1 at 37 degrees C, respectively, with the stoichiometry of binding being 0.8 +/- 0.1 mol of endonuclease dimer per mol of DNA. In contrast, the affinity of the enzyme for a pBR322 derivative from which the EcoRI site has been deleted is 3.2 X 10(9) M-1 as judged by competitive binding experiments. If it is assumed that each base pair can define the beginning of a nonspecific binding site, this value corresponds to an affinity for nonspecific sites of 7.4 X 10(5) M-1. Furthermore, the affinity of the endonuclease for the EcoRI-methylated sequence is at least three orders of magnitude less than that for the unmodified recognition site. The dependence on temperature and ionic strength of the equilibrium constant governing specific interactions has also been examined. The temperature dependence of the reaction indicates that entropy increase accounts for 70% of the free energy of specific binding at 37 degrees C. Affinity of the endonuclease for the EcoRI site is highly dependent on NaCl concentration. Analysis of this dependence according to the theory of Record and colleagues (Record, T. M., Jr., Lohman, T. M., and deHaseth, P. (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 107, 145-158) has implicated 8 ion pairs in the stability of specific complexes, a value identical with the number of phosphate contacts determined by ethylation interference analysis (Lu, A. L., Jack, W. E., and Modrich, P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13200-13206). Extrapolation to 1 M NaCl suggests that nonelectrostatic interactions account for 40% of the free energy change associated with specific complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1568433810,"The binding of 16 derivatives of cAMP to the surface of Dictyostelium discoideum cells was analyzed. The binding affinity is strongly reduced (more than 14.5 kJ/mol) if a cAMP derivative is no longer able to form a hydrogen bond at N6H2, or at O3'. Decreasing polarity of the base moiety is closely correlated to increasing binding affinity to the cAMP receptor (r = 0.98, p less than 0.1%). Based on these results we propose that cAMP is bound to the receptor via hydrogen bonds at N6H2 and O3', and that the adenine moiety is bound in a hydrophobic cleft of the receptor. A stereospecific interaction between the receptor and the phosphate moiety of cAMP has not been observed. The first detectable response of D. discoideum cells to cAMP is an increase of intracellular cGMP levels. A close correlation exists between the binding affinity of the cAMP derivatives and the potency to induce a cGMP response (r = 0.97, p less than 0.01%). There are two exceptions; both derivatives are modified in the exocyclic oxygen atoms of the phosphate moiety (sulfur in equatorial position or dimethylamino in apical position). These derivatives bind with approximately the same affinity as their stereoisomers (respectively sulfur in apical or dimethylamino in equatorial position), but in contrast to their stereoisomers, they do not induce elevations of cGMP levels. This suggests that, in addition to the binding interactions mentioned above, activation of the receptor requires a stereospecific interaction between the receptor and the phosphate moiety of cAMP. Quantum-chemical calculations by Van Ool and Buck (Van Ool, P. J. J. M., and Buck, H. M. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 121, 329-334) suggest that this activating interaction is a covalent bond between cAMP and the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1601105911,"We studied the interactions of Na+, Li+, and amiloride on the Na+/H+ antiporter in brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbit renal cortex. Cation-mediated collapse of an outwardly directed proton gradient (pHin = 6.0; pHout = 7.5) was monitored with the fluorescent amine, acridine orange. Proton efflux resulting from external addition of Na+ or Li+ exhibited simple saturation kinetics with Hill coefficients of 1.0. However, kinetic parameters for Na+ and Li+ differed (Km for Li+ = 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; Km for Na+ = 14.3 +/- 0.8 mM; Vmax for Li+ = 2.40 +/- 0.07 fluorescence units/s/mg of protein; Vmax for Na+ = 7.10 +/- 0.24 fluorescence units/s/mg of protein). Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by Li+ and amiloride was also studied. Li+ inhibited the Na+/H+ antiporter by two mechanisms. Na+ and Li+ competed with each other at the cation transport site. However, when [Na+] was markedly higher than [Li+], [( Na+] = 90 mM; [Li+] less than 1 mM), we observed noncompetitive inhibition (Vmax for Na+/H+ exchange reduced by 25%). The apparent Ki for this noncompetitive inhibition was congruent to 50 microM. In addition, 2-30 mM intravesicular Li+, but not Na+, resulted in trans inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange. Amiloride was a mixed inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange (Ki = 30 microM, Ki' = 90 microM) but was only a simple competitive inhibitor of Li+/H+ exchange (Ki = 10 microM). At [Li] = 1 mM and [amiloride] less than 100 microM, inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by a combination of the two inhibitors was always less than additive. These results suggest the presence of a cation-binding site (separate from the cation-transport site) which could be a modifier site of the Na+/H+ antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1517662067,"Acetylglyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC), or 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl 3-phosphorylcholine, has been shown to have a dramatic influence on phosphoinositide metabolism in isolated rat hepatocytes and upon glycogenolysis in the intact perfused rat liver. Addition of 5 X 10(-10) M AGEPC to 32Pi-labeled rat hepatocytes resulted in up to a 30 to 40% decrease in the [32Pi]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate within 10 s. The 32P content of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate decreased approximately 25% within 60 s, while a 5 to 8% decrease in [32P]phosphatidylinositol was observed only after 2 to 5 min of incubation of hepatocytes with AGEPC. Infusion of AGEPC (2 X 10(-10) M) into perfused livers resulted in a 3-fold increase in the glucose output in the effluent perfusate within 2 min. Interestingly, when a 500-fold higher concentration, i.e. 1 X 10(-7) M, of 1-O-alkyl-sn-glyceryl 3-phosphorylcholine or the stereoisomer 3-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl 1-phosphorylcholine was infused, no increase in the hepatic glucose output was seen. These observations lead to the conclusion that AGEPC exerts a potent influence on the polyphosphoinositide metabolism and glycogenolysis in rat liver and establishes the liver as an ideal system in which to conduct a detailed inquiry into the biochemical mechanism(s) responsible for the biological action of this unusual phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1562140236,"Phosphorylation of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase by a cyclic nucleotide and Ca2+-independent protein kinase, PC0.7, caused the enzyme to be a better substrate for phosphorylation by another cyclic nucleotide and Ca2+-independent protein kinase, FA/GSK-3. In contrast, phosphorylation by the combination of FA/GSK-3 and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase led to less phosphorylation than predicted from the individual actions of the protein kinases. These results are explained in part by the existence of cooperative interactions among the phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation by FA/GSK-3 also correlated with a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, of the glycogen synthase subunit from an apparent molecular weight of 85,000-86,000 to values of 88,000 and ultimately 90,000. The synergistic phosphorylation by PC0.7 and FA/GSK-3 was associated with an increased formation of the species of reduced electrophoretic mobility. The effects on subunit mobility were also reflected in the behavior of a larger phosphorylated CNBr fragment of glycogen synthase, CB-2, which gave apparent molecular weights of 22,000-27,000 depending on its phosphorylation state."
https://openalex.org/W1608197224,"The ribonucleotide reductase induced by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was purified in high yield from serum-starved baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells infected with HSV-1 (strain H-29). The enzyme preparation was essentially free of both eucaryotic ribonucleotide reductase and contaminating enzymes that could cause significant depletion of substrates. The HSV-1-induced enzyme was assayed in 0.2 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-Na at the pH optimum of 8.1 and the optimal dithiothreitol concentration of 10 mM. Nucleoside diphosphates were the substrates of this enzyme. The HSV-1-induced ribonucleotide reductase was inhibited by anions. EDTA also inhibited the enzyme and this inhibition was not reversed by the addition of FeCl2. Hydroxyurea acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor versus CDP reduction (Kii = 1.3 mM Kis = 2.4 mM). The enzyme was inhibited by either free Mg2+ or free ATP. However, it was neither inhibited nor activated by the ATP X Mg complex. Reduction of either CDP or ADP was only weakly inhibited by dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. No activation of this enzyme by these compounds was observed. The V'm values for reduction of CDP, UDP, and ADP were similar, while the GDP V'm was 2-fold greater. The K'm values were 80, 12, 1.2, and 0.65 microM for UDP, ADP, GDP, and CDP, respectively. The K'm values for CDP, GDP, and ADP were the lowest values observed for any ribonucleotide reductase. Each ribonucleoside diphosphate substrate competitively inhibited the reduction of each other substrate. The K'is values obtained for inhibition by a given ribonucleoside diphosphate were similar to the K'm value obtained for that compound as a substrate. Kinetic analysis of the combined rate of product formation when both CDP and ADP were simultaneously present as substrates produced patterns that were consistent with reduction at a common catalytic site. The 2'-deoxynucleoside diphosphate products were also competitive inhibitors versus the substrates. The K'is values versus CDP reduction were 310, 140, 9, and 5 microM for dUDP, dADP, dGDP, and dCDP, respectively. Similar K'is values were obtained when ADP was the substrate. All of these data are most consistent with the hypothesis that the HSV-1-induced ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the reduction of all substrates at a common site. The apparent lack of significant allosteric modulation of HSV-1-induced ribonucleotide reductase, its kinetic behavior, and its low K'm for CDP, GDP, and ADP clearly differentiate this enzyme from other ribonucleotide reductases."
https://openalex.org/W1481238256,"Macrophages activated by infection or elicited by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, release greater amounts of superoxide anion (O-2) than do normal resident macrophages. This enhanced production of O-2 and of other oxygen metabolites derived from O-2 is responsible, at least in part, for the enhanced microbicidal activity of these cells. To investigate the molecular basis for the enhanced oxygen metabolite response, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme responsible for NADPH-dependent production of O-2 (NADPH oxidase) were compared in LPS-elicited and resident mouse peritoneal macrophages. Resident and LPS-elicited macrophages were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, disrupted by sonication, assayed for their content of NADPH, and fractionated by centrifugation. The distribution of NADPH oxidase activity among the fractions was similar in both types of macrophage. A membrane-rich 27,000 X g pellet, which had the highest specific activity for the oxidase among the various fractions, was utilized to study the kinetic parameters of the oxidase from normal and LPS macrophages. The oxidase from LPS-elicited macrophages displayed a higher Vmax and a lower Km for NADPH than did the oxidase from normal cells. LPS-elicited cells also had a higher intracellular concentration of NADPH than did normal cells. The altered Km and Vmax, combined with the higher concentration of NADPH, resulted in a 2.2- to 3.5-fold increase in the calculated velocity of the oxidase from LPS-elicited macrophages compared with that from resident macrophages. These results suggest that the enhanced oxygen metabolite response of activated macrophages is due, in part, to modification of the enzyme responsible for the production of O-2."
https://openalex.org/W1507867204,"The availability of a fresh, unfrozen liver biopsy specimen permitted the characterization of a unique type of glycogen storage disease. The subject, an 11-year-old female, showed the classic clinical symptoms of type I glycogenosis. However, her hepatic D-glucose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) level as determined with detergent-activated homogenate was normal. The underlying mechanism was studied with intact microsomes from this fresh liver homogenate. Glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase was 75% latent, compared with 25% in normal controls matched for age and sex. Inorganic pyrophosphatase, PPi:glucose phosphotransferase, and carbamyl-P:glucose phosphotransferase activities of glucose 6-phosphatase were totally latent. While not observed with intact microsomes, these activities were fully manifested with detergent-disrupted microsomes. D-Glucose inhibited glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase activity of both intact and disrupted microsomes, but exogenous Pi inhibited only with the detergent-disrupted preparation. These observations are interpreted on the basis of the multicomponent glucose 6-phosphatase system of Arion et al. (Arion, W. J., Lange, A. J., Walls, H. E., and Ballas, L. M. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10396-10406). All are consistent with a defect in T2, the putative translocase specific for Pi, PPi, and carbamyl-P. However, Pi produced endogenously from glucose-6-P hydrolysis within the microsomal lumen did not inhibit. This suggests that (i) a pathway for egress of Pi from the microsomal lumen exists independently of T2, (ii) T2 in this case works only unidirectionally, or (iii) the catalytic unit of glucose 6-phosphatase in situ has become desensitized to interactions with Pi, PPi, and carbamyl-P in this mutant model. Defects in both T1, the translocase specific for glucose-6-P, and T2 thus appear involved in this unique glycogenosis."
https://openalex.org/W1482567533,"Abstract Three distinct enzymes hydrolyzing either ApppA or AppppA, or both, were separated and purified from yellow lupin seed extracts. Two of the enzymes were purified to homogeneity. These enzymes differ greatly in their catalytic and physical properties. One hydrolase, with a native molecular weight of 41,000, exhibits broad pH (from 5-8) optimum for activity, requires Mg2+ for activity, is inhibited by zinc ions (I0.5 = 25 microM) and hydrolyses ApppA (V = 1), ApppC (V = 0.38), ApppG (V = 0.2), and ribose(5')pppA (V = 0.2). The enzyme exhibits much lower activity with AppppA (V = 0.1), and ApppppA, AppppppA, ppppA, and ATP are hydrolyzed 25- to 100-fold slower then ApppA. ADP was always one of the products of the reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. AppA, NAD, NADP, FAD, cAMP, and p-nitrophenyl-thymidine 5'-phosphate were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The enzyme is diadenosine 5',5'-P1, P3-triphosphatase. The second hydrolase, composed of one polypeptide chain of a molecular weight 18,000-18,500, exhibits optimal activity in the pH range from 7.5-9, requires Mg2+ for activity, is inhibited by calcium ions (I0.5 for calcium depends on the concentration of Mg2+ and is 35-180 microM in the presence of 0.5-10 mM Mg2+, respectively), and hydrolyzes AppppA (V = 1, Km = 1 microM), ApppppA (V = 0.42, Km = 1.8 microM), AppppppA (V = 0.34), AppppU (V = 0.73), AppppC (V = 0.67), AppppG (V = 0.27), and ppppA. ATP was always one of the products of the reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. Dinucleoside di- and triphosphates, ATP, cAMP, and p-nitrophenylthymidine 5'-phosphate were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. This enzyme is diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.17). The third hydrolase, composed of one polypeptide chain of a molecular weight of 56,000, exhibits maximal activity at pH 9-10.5, does not require Mg2+ ions for activity, is inhibited neither by divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+) nor by EDTA, and uses as substrates all compounds which are substrates for the diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P3-triphosphatase and diadenosine 5',5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphatase. In addition, the enzyme hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl-thymidine 5'-phosphate, p-nitrophenylthymidine 3'-phosphate, bis-p-nitrophenylphosphate, ADP, AppA, NAD, NADP, and FAD, but not cAMP. With the exception of p-nitrophenylphosphate derivatives all other substrates of the enzyme yield AMP as one of the products of hydrolysis. This enzyme has a specificity similar to that of phosphodiesterases (EC 3.1.4.1) from other sources. With the lupin phosphodiesterase, ApppA (V = 1, Km = 2.2 microM) and AppppA (V = 1, Km = 2.0 microM) are better substrates than NAD (V = 0.8, Km = 9.6 microM), AppA (V = 0.4), ApppppA (V = 0.6), and AppppppA (V = 0.34)."
https://openalex.org/W1590476158,"Exonuclease VIII from Escherichia coli was shown to preferentially degrade linear duplex DNA, although a limited amount of activity with single-stranded linear DNA substrates was detected. No nucleolytic activity was observed with double-stranded circular substrates containing single strand breaks or gaps. Exonuclease VIII was shown to degrade linear duplex DNA from the 5' termini of the molecules and proceed in the 5' to 3' direction via a processive reaction mechanism. Initiation could occur from either a 5'-hydroxyl or 5'-phosphate residue at equal rates. The products of degradation of linear duplex DNA were an equivalent amount of 5'-mononucleotides and single-stranded DNA. Possible roles for exonuclease VIII in genetic recombination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1502377225,"We have examined the rate of dissociation of internalized 125I-asialo-orosomucoid-receptor complexes in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. Cell suspensions were washed with ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid at 0 degrees C to remove surface-bound ligand and then assessed for the retention of radioactive glycoprotein in the presence of digitonin, which permeabilized the cells and released the internal soluble contents. In cells which initially contained only surface-bound ligand, about 50% of the internalized ligand dissociated from receptor very rapidly (t1/2 less than or equal to 2.5 min, k greater than or equal to 0.28 min-1), at 37 degrees C, whereas the other 50% dissociated more slowly with apparent first order kinetics (t1/2 = 50 min, k = 0.014 min-1). This equal distribution of internalized ligand into two compartments, from which dissociation occurred with very different kinetics, did not depend on the extent of surface receptor occupancy and also occurred under non-steady state conditions of continuous exposure to ligand. Ligand entering both the rapid and slow dissociation compartments was eventually degraded with apparent first order kinetics (k = 0.0047 min-1), suggesting that the intracellular routing of ligand to lysosomes after dissociation from either compartment was via the same pathway. The fast and slow dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes were also distinguished by different temperature sensitivities; the slow dissociation process ceased below 18 degrees C, whereas the fast dissociation process still proceeded. The equal partition of internalized complexes into the two kinetic compartments did not change as a function of temperature but did change as cells continued to endocytose asialo-orosomucoid at 37 degrees C. As the internal receptor pool approached a steady state level of occupancy, there was an increase in the average time for receptor recycling and an increase in the fraction of incoming receptor-ligand complexes which dissociated rapidly (approximately 75%). In addition, under steady state conditions, the rate of the slow dissociation process increased (k = 0.026 min-1, t1/2 = 27 min)."
https://openalex.org/W1544108259,"Fibrinogen binding to platelet plasma membranes, which is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation, was determined by incubating 125I-labeled fibrinogen with isolated membranes and measuring the amount of radioactivity sedimenting with the membranes through 15% sucrose. Fibrinogen binding was optimal at 10(-3) M Ca2+. Scatchard analyses of the fibrinogen binding showed that the membrane capacity for fibrinogen was 1.6 X 10(-12) mol/mg of membrane protein, with a dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.2 X 10(-8) M. When Ca2+ levels were manipulated by the addition of varying amounts of EGTA at a fixed Mg2+ concentration of 3 X 10(-3) M, specific binding of fibrinogen to platelet membranes occurred only at Ca2+ concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-6) M. Membranes isolated from platelets of an individual with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia bound only 12% as much fibrinogen as control platelets. The data in the present study suggest that there are two divalent cation binding sites that must be occupied for fibrinogen to bind: one site is specific for calcium and is saturated at 10(-6) M Ca2+; the other site is less specific and is saturated at a 10(-3) M concentration of either Ca2+ or Mg2+. Fibrinogen binding to intact platelets and, consequently, platelet aggregation only required 10(-3) M extracellular divalent cation and was not specific for Ca2+. These data indicate that the cytoplasm is a potential source for the requirement of 10(-6) M Ca2+, and that changes in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ may cause the expression of fibrinogen receptors during ADP-induced platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1498983751,"Washed human platelets were not able to convert eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to thromboxane B3 (TXB3) and 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (AA) to washed human platelets induced conversion of EPA to TXB3 and 12-HEPE. Esculetin, a specific inhibitor of 12-lipoxygenase, prevented the effect of AA, but cyclooxygenase inhibitor did not. The conversion of AA to TXB2 was not affected by the same dose of esculetin. These data suggest that products of AA formed by 12-lipoxygenase in human platelets have stimulatory effects on EPA metabolism. When AA was preincubated with washed human platelets, its effect on EPA conversion was reduced, suggesting that a labile product of AA formed by 12-lipoxygenase is involved in the facilitation of EPA metabolism. Addition of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid directly to washed human platelets caused dose-dependent synthesis of TXB3 and 12-HEPE, while addition of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid had no effect. Thus, 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid formed from AA promotes the metabolism of EPA in washed human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1545921634,"Southern blot analysis suggests that multiple sequences homologous to a phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 cDNA are present in the rat and mouse genomes. A cDNA (pP-450b-5) to a major phenobarbital-inducible cytochrome P-450 mRNA species in the rat detected 6 polymorphic DNA fragments when hybridized to DNA from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice restricted with endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, and PvuII. Using the BXD recombinant inbred strains, five of these polymorphisms were mapped to the Coh (coumarin hydroxylase) locus on chromosome 7 of the mouse. The Coh locus has previously been shown to code for a phenobarbital-inducible enzyme, believed to be a cytochrome P-450, which catalyzes the conversion of coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone). The DNA polymorphisms appear to reflect changes in either cytochrome P-450 genes or pseudogenes that are very closely linked to the gene responsible for differential coumarin hydroxylase in mice or it may represent a change(s) in the Coh gene itself. The region of the Coh locus on chromosome 7 may be the site of a cluster of cytochrome P-450 genes."
https://openalex.org/W1513406115,"Escherichia coli glycyl-tRNA synthetase is one of two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases which is comprised of two different subunits (in an alpha 2 beta 2 structure). The two coding regions occur in tandem in the order alpha + beta and are synthesized from a single mRNA (Keng, T., Webster, T. A., Sauer, R. T., and Schimmel, P. R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12503-12508). Primary structures of both proteins were determined by DNA sequencing of each coding region and by analysis of tryptic fragments of the enzyme. The alpha-subunit is 303 codons and terminates with TAA; the beta-subunit is 689 codons followed by tandem TAA stops. S1 nuclease mapping of the 3'-end of the two-cistron glyS mRNA showed that it predominantly ends 33/34 bases beyond the tandem stops with an RNA polymerse terminator sequence. Altogether, 43% of the translated polypeptide sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments including confirmation of the COOH-terminal end of the beta-chain. This involved determinations, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, of the masses of numerous whole tryptic fragments (with an accuracy of better than 1 Da) and of fragments truncated by one to three cycles of Edman degradations. The primary structures of the two subunits show no homologies with each other and have no internal sequence repeats of significance. While there are no extensive homologies with five other sequenced, or partially sequenced, synthetases, the alpha-subunit has a short sequence which can be aligned with sequences found in functionally important areas of two other synthetases and in uncharacterized parts of a third and fourth synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1486071030,"Abstract We have examined the transcriptional role of the DNA region which lies between the two intragenic control sequences (D-control and T-control) of tRNA genes. Deletion templates (3' and 5') of a Drosophila tRNAArg gene, which contain either the D- or T-control region, were joined together through XhoI linkers such that the mutant tRNA genes formed now contain an internal cloning site. DNA fragments of different lengths were inserted into the newly formed cloning site to create a series of mutant tRNAArg genes which have an increased separation between the two intragenic control regions of 12 to 1530 nucleotides. Increased separation of the two intragenic control regions did not alter the transcription initiation or termination sites from those of the wild type tRNAArg gene. Transcription, while most efficient in the wild type gene, is still efficient when the two regions are further separated by a distance of 12-77 nucleotides. However, any further increase in length of the sequence separating the control regions resulted in a decreased transcription efficiency and in a decreased ability to compete in the binding of transcription factors in Drosophila Kc cell extracts. The reduction in transcription efficiency is directly related to the decreased ability of the insertion mutant tDNAs to form stable transcription complexes. The tRNAArg gene forms detectable stable complexes up to a separation of the two intragenic control regions by approximately 200 to 400 base pairs. These results suggest a model for tRNA gene transcription that involves factor recognition of sequences within each control region and that the control regions interact only via these factors."
https://openalex.org/W1502716368,"A COOH-terminal tryptic fragment (Mr approximately equal to 20,000) of colicin E1 has been proposed to contain the membrane channel-forming domain of the colicin molecule. A comparison is made of the conductance properties of colicin E1 and its COOH-terminal fragment in planar bilayer membranes. The macroscopic and single channel properties of colicin E1 and its COOH-terminal tryptic fragment are very similar, if not indistinguishable, implying that the NH2-terminal, two-thirds of the colicin E1 molecule, does not significantly influence its channel properties. The channel-forming activity of both polypeptides is dependent upon the presence of a membrane potential, negative on the trans side of the membrane. The average single channel conductance of colicin E1 and the COOH-terminal fragment is 20.9 +/- 3.9 and 19.1 +/- 2.9 picosiemens, respectively. The rate at which both proteins form conducting channels increases as the pH is lowered from 7 to 5. Both molecules require negatively charged lipids for activity to be expressed, exhibit the same ion selectivity, and rectify the current to the same extent. Both polypeptides associate irreversibly with the membrane in the absence of voltage, but subsequent formation of conducting channels requires a negative membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1588714918,"Abstract The study of the regulation of uteroglobin gene in the rabbit endometrium constitutes a model for analyzing the mechanism of action of progesterone in mammals. The gene has been cloned into lambda phage and sequenced. Comparison of the sequence of the gene with the amino acid sequence of preuteroglobin and the three-dimensional structure of uteroglobin established by crystal x-ray diffraction showed that the 3 exons correspond to different functional domains of the protein and that at least one of the splice junctions does not map at the surface of the protein. S1 mapping allowed us to define the RNA polymerase initiation site. No difference was observed when analyzing premessengers from the endometrium, where the gene is controlled by progesterone and estradiol, and from lung where the gene is constitutively expressed and not controlled by these hormones. In addition, S1 mapping revealed the existence of several minor transcription initiation sites. In the 5' flanking region between positions -33 and -24 there is the sequence AATACAAAAA which may correspond to a Goldberg-Hogness box. Two other A- and T-rich sequences were found further upstream from the gene, one of these preceding by about 30 nucleotides a minor start of transcription. No obvious feature, possibly related to steroid regulation, was observed in the nucleotide sequence. A fragment of the gene containing the promoter region (from nucleotide +10 to nucleotide -394) was preferentially retained on nitrocellulose filters after incubation with purified rabbit uterine receptor. A competitive binding assay was used to compare the affinity for the receptor of various DNA fragments. Labeled promoter region DNA was incubated with receptor and various concentrations of nonlabeled competing DNA, and the nitrocellulose-bound radioactivity was measured. This method showed the existence of several high affinity binding sites in the 5' part of the gene and in adjacent regions. However, no high affinity binding sites were observed in the 3' part of the gene. Also, within the promoter region there were at least two high affinity binding sites for the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2159859179,"Dictyostelium discoideum cells contain one class of cAMP receptors and two classes of adenosine receptors (respectively, adenosine alpha- and beta-receptors). A cell has 3.5 X 10(4) adenosine alpha-receptors with a Kd = 0.8 microM and 8 X 10(6) adenosine beta-receptors with a Kd = 350 microM. Binding of adenosine to the beta-receptors inhibits up to 90% of the binding of cAMP to the cAMP receptors in a noncompetitive way. Measurement of the chemotactic and antagonistic activity of 18 cAMP and adenosine derivatives for aggregative D. discoideum cells resulted in four functional groups. 1) Nine compounds are full agonists; they are chemotactic but have no antagonistic effects on the chemotactic activity of cAMP. 2) Five compounds are partial antagonists; they can be both agonists as well as antagonists, depending on the concentration used. 3) Two compounds are competitive full antagonists, and 4) three compounds are noncompetitive full antagonists. Comparison of the quantitative data on the chemotactic and antagonistic activities of all compounds with their binding data for cAMP and adenosine cell surface receptors leads to the following conclusions on the mechanism of action of the antagonists. The two competitive full antagonists bind to the cAMP receptor, but they do not activate the receptor; therefore, they do not induce a response, and at the same time prevent the detection of cAMP. The three noncompetitive antagonists bind to the adenosine beta-receptor which inhibits the binding of cAMP to the cAMP receptor; also these compounds prevent the detection of cAMP. The five competitive partial antagonists bind to the cAMP receptor and induce a normal cGMP response. Also cAMP induces a normal cGMP response in the presence of partial antagonists. This indicates that partial antagonists do not prevent the detection of cAMP, but extinguish the intracellular response to cAMP. A model is presented for the mechanism of action of these partial antagonists which is based on false reading of chemotactic signals in terms of excitation and adaptation processes."
https://openalex.org/W1606723080,"In previous work from this laboratory, a partially purified protein kinase from the soil amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii was shown to phosphorylate the heavy chain of the two single-headed Acanthamoeba myosin isoenzymes, myosin IA and IB, resulting in a 10- to 20-fold increase in their actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities (Maruta, H., and Korn, E.D. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8329-8332). A myosin I heavy chain kinase has now been purified to near homogeneity from Acanthamoeba by chromatography on DE-52 cellulose, phosphocellulose, and Procion red dye, followed by chromatography on histone-Sepharose. Myosin I heavy chain kinase contains a single polypeptide of 107,000 Da by electrophoretic analysis. Molecular sieve chromatography yields a Stokes radius of 4.1 nm, consistent with a molecular weight of 107,000 for a native protein with a frictional ratio of approximately 1.3:1. The kinase catalyzes the incorporation of 0.9 to 1.0 mol of phosphate into the heavy chain of both myosins IA and IB. Phosphoserine has been shown to be the phosphorylated amino acid in myosin IB. The kinase has highest specific activity toward myosin IA and IB, about 3-4 mumol of phosphate incorporated/min/mg (30 degrees C) at concentrations of myosin I that are well below saturating levels. The kinase also phosphorylates histone 2A, isolated smooth muscle light chains, and, to a very small extent, casein, but has no activity toward phosvitin or myosin II, a third Acanthamoeba myosin isoenzyme with a very different structure from myosin IA and IB. Myosin I heavy chain kinase requires Mg2+ but is not dependent on Ca2+, Ca2+/calmodulin, or cAMP for activity. The kinase undergoes an apparent autophosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1493202457,"A thyroliberin (TRH)-responsive particulate bound adenylyl cyclase is present in two rat anterior pituitary tumor cell strains (GH4C1 and GH3) which synthesize and secrete prolactin. At a given Mg2+ concentration, ATP and the guanyl nucleotides GTP and guanyl 5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) caused a dose-dependent increase in adenylyl cyclase activity. The maximum response to thyroliberin occurred with ATP and GTP at concentrations above 0.30 mM and 2 microM, respectively. The maximal stimulatory effect of thyroliberin on adenylyl cyclase activity was 2-fold in the presence of GTP. GMP-P(NH)P increased the basal enzyme activity 4- to 10-fold over and above that of equimolar concentrations of GTP but supported poorly the TRH-induced response. Mg2+ caused a dose-dependent increase in the basal enzyme activity and reduced TRH and fluoride-induced responses. Also, Mn2+ and Co2+ stimulated the basal adenylyl cyclase activity while Zn2+, Ca2+, and Cu2+ inhibited the enzyme, and neither cations supported the TRH response. Half-maximal stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase by TRH and half-maximum binding of [3H]TRH to membranes at 35 degrees C were 102 and 56 nM, respectively. Pretreatment with TRH decreased the apparent Vmax of the enzyme and the maximal binding of [3H]TRH. Of 6 TRH analogs tested, only one was able to displace [3H]TRH from its receptor and to increase the adenylyl cyclase activity. We suggest that adenylyl cyclase activation is an early event in the stimulus secretion coupling between TRH and prolactin-producing GH cells."

The entire gamma-casein structural gene is contained in a single 17-kb phage clone. R-loop and restriction enzyme mapping analyses revealed that the gamma-casein gene is approximately 15 kb long and is, therefore, 17.4 times larger than the mature gamma-casein mRNA. The coding regions of the gamma-casein gene are split into at least nine small segments, interspersed with long intervening sequences. Sequence analysis of the 5' end of the gamma-casein gene revealed the presence of a TATA sequence which may play a role in the initiation of gene transcription. The first exon is 44 nucleotides long and encodes part of the 5' noncoding sequences of the gamma-casein mRNA. The first intron was found to contain a short interspersed repeated DNA sequences which shares a 92% homology with a cloned rat repeated DNA sequence found at the 3' end of several other rat genes. In addition, the gamma-casein gene contains several families of highly repeated sequences interspersed throughout the intervening and flanking regions, including a family of evolutionary conserved repeats. Thus, the gamma-casein gene represents an unusually large and complex split mammalian gene."

https://openalex.org/W1484423608,"Hepa-1c1c7, a mouse hepatoma cell line, was used to study the effect of cytochrome P1-450 inducers on the binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF), 125I-insulin, or [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate each to its specific cell-surface receptor. After a 24-h exposure to the cultured cells, several polycyclic hydrocarbon P1-450 inducers decrease the binding of EGF to EGF receptors much more than phenobarbital does. There appears to be a selectivity in the inhibitory effects: whereas EGF binding to EGF receptors is blocked, the binding of either phorbol ester or insulin each to its specific cell-surface receptors remains unaffected. The rank order of binding affinities of these chemicals to the cytosolic Ah receptor (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin much greater than benzo[a]pyrene greater than benzo[a]anthracene greater than 6-aminochrysene much greater than phenobarbital) is not correlated with their effects on EGF binding capacity. The effect of polycyclic hydrocarbons on EGF binding takes 24 h at 37 degrees C to be maximal, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a potent tumor-promoting compound, inhibits EGF binding in less than 30 min. Removal of benzo[a]anthracene from the growth medium after 24 h results in a gradual recovery in EGF binding, indicating that the effect is reversible. Benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]anthracene are relatively ineffective at decreasing EGF binding to the EGF receptors in Hepa-1 mutant clones c2 and c4, which lack a normally functioning Ah receptor and inducible aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity (P1-450). The very toxic metabolite (+)-7 beta,8 alpha-dihydroxy-9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene, when added directly to the growth medium of c4 cells, however, is effective at decreasing EGF binding. These data suggest that electrophilic metabolites of polycyclic aromatic compounds, formed by P1-450 induced during the exposure of Hepa-1 cells to these chemicals, are important in decreasing EGF binding to the EGF cell-surface receptor. Occupancy of the Ah receptor per se does not affect EGF binding."
https://openalex.org/W1538758413,"Photoaffinity labeling techniques using p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzylcarazolol have recently demonstrated that both the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor-binding subunits from mammalian tissues including heart, lung, and erythrocytes reside on peptides of Mr approximately equal to 62,000-64,000. In this study, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method for peptide mapping was used to investigate and compare the structure of beta 1 - and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes. When the photoaffinity labeled Mr approximately equal to 62,000 peptides from the beta 2-adrenergic receptors of rat lung and erythrocyte are subjected to simultaneous proteolysis using Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase or papain, exactly the same peptide fragments are generated from each subunit. In contrast, when the Mr approximately equal to 62,000 peptide containing the beta 1-adrenergic receptor-binding subunit derived from the rat heart is proteolyzed simultaneously with the Mr approximately equal to 62,000 peptide containing the beta 2-adrenergic receptors from either lung or erythrocyte, the peptide fragments generated are distinctly different. Peptide maps of beta 1-adrenergic receptors from the myocardial tissue of different species (pig versus rat) yield slightly different maps while the maps derived from the beta 2-adrenergic receptors of hamster lung and rat lung or erythrocytes reveal no interspecies differences. These data suggest: 1) alterations in the primary structure of the beta-adrenergic receptor may be responsible for the pharmacological specificities characteristic of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes; and 2) alterations in the primary structure of similar beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes across different species may relate to the magnitude of their phylogenetic differences."
https://openalex.org/W1570376076,"More than 97% of spectrin phosphatase activity in human erythrocyte hemolysate was recovered in cytosol.

Although these phosphoprotein phosphatases also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a, glycogen synthase b, and phosphorylated H1 and H2B histones, the phosphatases differed from each other in preferences for substrates and the Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirements for their activities. The treatment with 80% ethanol converted phosphatases I, III, and IV to Mr = 31,000 forms which had essentially the same physical and catalytic properties. By contrast, the molecular weight and catalytic properties of phosphatase II, which was Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent, were not changed by the same ethanol treatment. The major spectrin phosphatase, phosphatase IV, was purified to near homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was composed of one 32,000-Da polypeptide (alpha) and one 69,000-Da polypeptide (beta). Km values of the enzyme for phosphorylated spectrin and H2B histone were 1.63 +/- 0.45 and 48.2 +/- 7.6 microM, respectively. The spectrin phosphatase activity was stimulated about 2-fold by 5-25 mM Mg2+, but was completely inhibited by the same concentration of Mn2+. Physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides, 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, cyclic nucleotides, or Ca2+ and/or calmodulin had no significant effect on the reaction, but 20 mg/ml of hemoglobin inhibited the reaction by 60%. -SH-blocking agents but not iodoacetate inhibited the reaction."

In the presence of 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, formation of a cross-linked alpha, beta-dimer was affected specifically by K+ + ATP or enzyme phosphorylation. The same conditions affected the formation of cross-linked alpha, alpha-dimer in the presence of 4,4‘-difluoro-3,3‘-dinitrodiphenyl sulfone or o-phenanthroline-Cu2+. Since noncovalent alpha, beta-association has been established, the data suggest K+ + ATP-induced or phosphorylation-induced changes in alpha, beta-domain and alpha, alpha-domain of an oligomer of alpha, beta-dimer. When the formation of cross-linked alpha, beta-dimer or alpha, alpha-dimer was induced by phosphorylation, only half of the subunits were cross-linked, suggesting the existence of a cooperative tetramer of alpha, beta-dimer. When microsomes or red cell membranes were exposed to 32Pi under phosphorylation-induced cross-linking conditions, the only products were alpha, beta-dimer and alpha, alpha-dimer, indicating the existence of an oligomer of alpha, beta-dimer in crude membranes. Subunits of the enzyme solubilized with octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether, by methods that have been suggested to yield unassociated alpha, beta-dimers, underwent spontaneous cross-linking that was not affected by enzyme dilution. Since the largest product was alpha 2 beta 2, the solubilized enzyme is at least a dimer of alpha, beta-dimer. The findings establish that the membrane-bound enzyme is an oligomer of alpha, beta-dimer. Whether or not a single alpha, beta-dimer is capable of catalytic and transport functions has not been determined."

The phosphate incorporation increases during the first 4 h of treatment. The pp60src kinase activity in extracts of cells treated with 8-bromo-cyclic AMP was stimulated about 2- to 3-fold. This stimulation of kinase activity increased during the first 3 h of treatment with 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP and the activity was increased in both the soluble and particulate fraction of the cells. These results suggest that cyclic AMP can modulate the activity of pp60src in transformed cells."

We describe here the role of Ca2+-dependent proteinases in the turnover of myofibrillar protein in normal anecdysial (intermolt) claw muscle. Crab Ca2+-dependent proteinase degrades the myofibrillar proteins actin, myosin heavy and light chains, paramyosin, tropomyosin, and troponin-T and -I. Ca2+-dependent proteinase activity in whole homogenates and 90,000 X g supernatant fractions from muscle homogenates has been characterized with respect to Ca2+ requirement, substrate specificity, and effects of proteinase inhibitors. The enzyme is inhibited by antipain, leupeptin, E-64, and iodoacetamide; it is insensitive to pepstatin A. The Ca2+-dependent proteinase is a sarcoplasmic cysteine proteinase that shows maximal activation at 1 mM Ca2+ at neutral pH. Since approximately 28% of the activity remains at 1.5 microM Ca2+, the enzyme is partially active at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. The specificity of crab Ca2+-dependent proteinase was examined with native myosin with normal ATPase activity as well as with radioiodinated myosin and radioiodinated hemolymph proteins. Hydrolysis of 125I-myosin occurs in two phases, both Ca2+-dependent: 1) heavy chain (Mr = 200,000) is cleaved into four large fragments (Mr = 160,000, 110,000, 73,000, 60,000) and numerous smaller fragments; light chain (Mr = 18,000) is cleaved to a 15,000-Da fragment; 2) the fragments produced in the first phase are hydrolyzed to acid-soluble material. Although radioiodinated native hemolymph proteins are not susceptible to the Ca2+-dependent proteinase, those denatured by carboxymethylation are degraded. These data suggest that crab Ca2+-dependent proteinase is involved in turnover of myofibrillar protein in normal muscle and muscle undergoing proecdysial atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1545806139,"Abstract Calcium efflux from rat liver perfused with nonrecirculating medium was observed at 1.4 s following 10(-6) M (-)epinephrine infusion, when the perfusate Ca2+ was 60 microM. Net calcium efflux was also seen in livers perfused with 1.3 microM Ca2+ at approximately 8 s. In isolated rat hepatocytes, phosphorylase, a cytosolic enzyme, was activated significantly at 3 s and maximally at approximately 15 s by phenylephrine (10(-5) M), epinephrine (10(-6) M), and vasopressin (10(-8) M). Hexose phosphates were elevated at between 3 and 6 s with vasopressin. Phenylephrine and vasopressin stimulated hepatocyte respiration relatively slowly. The effects took 10 s to become evident, were dependent on the presence of Ca2+, and were probably the result of increased total cellular reduced pyridine nucleotide observed at 5 s. The slowness of the increase in respiration indicates that it cannot be the cause of the Ca2+ mobilization, but is more likely to be a consequence of it. From these studies, it is proposed that, following binding of catecholamines to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, Ca2+ is first mobilized from the plasma membrane resulting in an elevation of the free Ca2+ ion concentration in the cytosol (Charest, R., Blackmore, P. F., Berthon, B., and Exton, J. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8769-8773) which stimulates phosphorylase kinase and, hence, phosphorylase. These events begin to occur within the first 2 to 3 s. Following this, the concentration of reduced pyridine nucleotide(s) increases at 5 s resulting in the stimulation of respiration seen at 10 s. These events occur more slowly than the mobilization of cell Ca2+ and activation of phosphorylase, and may be secondary to the rise in cytosolic Ca2+. The time at which mitochondrial Ca2+ decreases is not known, but it accounts for most of the Ca2+ mobilized."
https://openalex.org/W62788495,"The 3'-termini of the mitochondrial 12 S and 16 S ribosomal RNAs from mouse L cells have been definitively characterized by mobility-shift RNA sequencing, RNase digestion followed by fingerprinting using two-dimensional homochromatography, and precise mapping of RNA-DNA duplexes using nuclease S1. The results have been correlated with the known DNA sequence of the rRNA region. The vast majority of the 12 S rRNA consists of a family of transcripts whose last template-encoded nucleotide corresponds to a position immediately adjacent to the 5' end of the tRNAVal gene in the DNA sequence. These transcripts are oligoadenylated at their 3'-ends with from 1 to about 5 adenylate residues that are not encoded in the DNA sequence. A minor proportion of the 12 S rRNA ends one nucleotide before the 12 S/tRNAVal gene boundary and is also oligoadenylated. In contrast, the 3'-termini of 16 S rRNA have considerably greater heterogeneity, with the genomic location of the last template-encoded nucleotide varying from the nucleotide immediately adjacent to the 5'-end of the tRNALeuUUR gene to any position up to 7 nucleotides downstream within the tRNALeuUUR gene sequence. These various 16 S rRNA transcripts are oligoadenylated to a somewhat greater degree than the 12 S rRNA. The extent of the 16 S rRNA 3' heterogeneity, as compared to the 12 S rRNA, suggests that the 16 S rRNA 3'-termini may be generated by a mechanism involving termination of transcription rather than by processing of a primary transcript. The data are similar to those reported for human mitochondrial rRNA 3'-termini, and support a general role for adenylation of 3'-termini in the termination or processing of mammalian mitochondrial RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1495799172,"Complex III immunoprecipitated from yeast cells labeled in vivo with [35S]sulfate or [3H]leucine contained seven subunits with molecular weights ranging from 15,000 to 47,000 when analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. The subunit composition of the immunoprecipitates was identical with that of the purified complex III isolated from bakers' yeast suggesting that the antiserum recognizes the holoenzyme assembled properly in the membrane (Sidhu, A., and Beattie, D.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7879-7886). Kinetic studies using double-labeled yeast cells followed by immunoprecipitation of complex III indicated that the subunits of the complex are assembled into the holoenzyme at very different rates. Cytochromes b and c1 and the 15,000-dalton subunit were the first polypeptides to be assembled into the complex with a half-time of labeling of 2.0-2.4 min. Core protein I and the iron-sulfur protein were inserted more slowly into the complex with a half-time of labeling of 4.6 and 5.3 min, respectively. Calculations of precursor pool sizes of the subunits indicated that for both core protein I and the iron-sulfur protein, there are large pools of precursors. The iron-sulfur protein was synthesized in vivo as a larger precursor polypeptide of molecular mass 28,000 Da. The precursor was subsequently cleaved, in a process requiring an energized mitochondrial inner membrane, into an intermediate form 1,500 Da larger than the mature subunit. The conversion of the intermediate to the mature form occurred in the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1570950682,"Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from guinea pig peritoneal exudate neutrophils, using nitrogen cavitation to rupture the plasma membrane and differential centrifugation to separate the vesicles. The vesicles were enriched 13.2-fold in (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity and had a cholesterol:protein ratio of 0.15, characteristic of plasma membranes. Contamination of the vesicle preparation with DNA or marker enzyme activities for intracellular organelles was very low. Studies designed to determine vesicle sidedness and integrity indicated that 33% were sealed, inside-out; 41% were sealed, right side-out, and 26% were leaky. The vesicles accumulated 45Ca2+ in a linear fashion for 45 min. The uptake was dependent on the presence of oxalate and MgATP in the incubating medium. Uptake showed a Ka for free Ca2+ of 164 nM and a Vmax of 17.2 nmol/mg . min (based on total protein). GTP, ITP, CTP, UTP, ADP, or AMP supported uptake at rates less than or equal to 11% of ATP. Ca2+ uptake was maximal at pH 7-7.5. Calcium stimulated the hydrolysis of ATP by the vesicles with a Ka for free Ca2+ of 440 nM and Vmax of 17.5 nmol/mg . min (based on total protein). When the Ca2+ uptake rate was based upon those vesicles expected to transport Ca2+ (33% sealed, inside-out vesicles) and Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity was based upon those vesicles expected to express that activity (26% leaky + 33% sealed, inside-out vesicles), the molar stoichiometry of Ca2+ transported:ATP hydrolyzed was 2.12 +/- 0.12. Calmodulin did not increase either Vmax or Ka for free Ca2+ of the uptake system in the vesicles, even when they were treated previously with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The high affinity of this system for Ca2+, specificity for ATP, physiological pH optimum, and stoichiometry of Ca2+ transported:ATP hydrolyzed suggest that it represents an important mechanism by which neutrophils maintain low levels of cytoplasmic free Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1593254516,"The synthesis of cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome P-450scc) and adrenodoxin was studied both in freshly harvested bovine granulosa cells and in granulosa cells maintained in primary monolayer culture. In addition, the action of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and cyclic AMP analogs to stimulate the synthesis of cytochrome P-450scc was investigated in cultured cells. Precursor forms of cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin were immunoisolated from a cell-free translation system directed by RNA prepared from freshly obtained granulosa cells that were not luteinized. Furthermore, the presence of cytochrome P-450scc in lysates of granulosa cells freshly obtained from very small follicles (containing less than 0.1 ml of follicular fluid) and in mitochondria of freshly obtained granulosa cells was demonstrated by using an immunoblotting technique. Continuous treatment of cultured granulosa cells with FSH or with cyclic AMP analogs (dibutyryl cyclic AMP or 8-bromo cyclic AMP) for 72 h increased incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable cytochrome P-450scc. Moreover, FSH, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and 8-bromo cyclic AMP stimulated pregnenolone production by cultured granulosa cells (2.3-, 4.0-, and 7.5-fold increase over control, respectively), indicative of an increase in cholesterol side chain cleavage activity. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time the presence of two components of the cholesterol side chain cleavage system in freshly obtained granulosa cells, and provide direct evidence for the trophic effect of FSH and its presumed mediator, cyclic AMP, on the synthesis of cytochrome P-450scc in granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1910312098,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has been implicated by Rognstad (Rognstad, R. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 1875-1878) as the rate-limiting step for gluconeogenesis from lactate on the basis of a linear Dixon plot (reciprocal rate of gluconeogenesis versus concentration of inhibitor, mercaptopicolinate). We have confirmed this result with isolated hepatocytes incubated in the absence, but not the presence, of bovine serum albumin. Nonlinear plots are likely the result of mercaptopicolinate binding to the albumin. Both norepinephrine and dibutyryl cyclic AMP decreased the slopes and intercepts of the Dixon plots, but a linear relationship was still obtained. When aminooxyacetate inhibited transaminase reactions sufficiently to depress gluconeogenesis, the resulting mercaptopicolinate inhibition plot was still linear in the presence or absence of norepinephrine. Thus, linearity in the Dixon plot does not assure that the enzyme at the site of inhibition is the rate-limiting step for a pathway. Flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase does not appear to be hormonally regulated by changes in oxalacetate concentration since this compound was unchanged by norepinephrine or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Ca2+ enhanced norepinephrine stimulation of gluconeogenesis from asparagine and glutamine and of ureogenesis from glutamine, indicating both mitochondrial and cytosolic sites of action for this hormone. The effects of catecholamines and cyclic AMP were most clearly distinguished by their influence on glutamate concentration when glutamine was the substrate. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased, but norepinephrine decreased glutamate. It is possible that decreased glutamate concentration is a reflection of a catecholamine-directed oxidation of mitochondrial NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1547082486,"We have isolated three mutants of Escherichia coli which have elevated levels of the phospholipid synthetic enzyme phosphatidylserine synthase. One of these strains carries a mutation, designated pssR1, which maps near minute 84 of the chromosome, distinct from the synthase structural gene (pss) at minute 56. The pssR1 mutation causes selective overproduction of phosphatidylserine synthase, since the levels of six other lipid synthetic enzymes are unaltered. The specific activity of the synthase in crude cell extracts of mutants harboring pssR1 is about five times greater than wild type. The synthase can also be overproduced 10-fold in wild type strains with hybrid ColE1 plasmids carrying the synthase structural gene (pss). A pssR1 mutant harboring such a pss plasmid overproduces the synthase about 50-fold. This multiplicative interaction of pssR1 and cloned pss demonstrates that pssR1 is trans-acting. The synthase has been purified in parallel from pssR1 and pssR+ strains. The pssR1 mutant yields more total synthase protein than pssR+, but the pure enzyme has the same specific activity in both cases. Therefore, pssR1 acts by increasing the amount of the normal protein, not by activating the enzyme. The discovery of pssR shows that there are regulatory loci which control the production of enzymes involved in membrane lipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1509613623,"Chemical modification and electron spin resonance techniques were used to study the topography of carboxyl residues in purple membranes. The results showed that buried carboxyl groups are located in hydrophobic protein domains at least 16 A from the membrane surface, and that the carboxyl-terminal tail is partially immobilized. Carboxyl groups on bacteriorhodopsin in purple membranes were covalently spin-labeled with 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl using N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline as a highly specific coupling agent. Spin-labeled bacteriorhodopsin preparations containing an average of 2.1 +/- 0.5 spins/molecule retained photocycling and proton-pumping functions. Accessibility to the paramagnetic broadening agents, Fe(CN)3-6 and Ni2+, revealed a highly mobile surface group quenched at low concentrations of these agents, and a buried, immobilized group whose ESR signal remained at high quencher concentration. Treatment with denaturing agents greatly increased the mobility and quenching of these buried residues. A series of stearic acid spin labels bound to purple membranes was used to define the depth of paramagnetic interactions. Fe(CN)3-6 interactions were limited to surfaces whereas Ni2+ and Cu2+ effects extended into hydrophobic domains. A double modification procedure, which first blocked surface groups, selectively spin-labeled only buried carboxyl group(s) having a strongly immobilized signal. ESR analysis of the isolated carboxyl-terminal tail after trypsin treatment showed it had increased mobility, indicating that it is moderately immobilized in the native structure. These data provide evidence consistent with several models of bacteriorhodopsin tertiary structure which place carboxyls within hydrophobic domains of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1480225178,"Extracts of a mutant S49 lymphoma cell line, termed K30a, hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP at rates much faster than do wild type S49 extracts. This elevated phosphodiesterase activity, called K-PDE, elutes as a single peak of activity on DEAE-cellulose columns (Brothers, V. M., Walker, N., and Bourne, H. R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9349-9355). Direct photoaffinity labeling of K30a extracts with [32P]cGMP results in radiolabeling of a unique polypeptide, not observed in wild type extracts, which migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels with an Mr = 106,000. The 106-kDa band was identified as the catalytic K-PDE polypeptide based on the following observations: competitive inhibitors and substrates of K-PDE inhibit photolabeling of the 106-kDa band, indicating that [32P] cGMP photolabels the enzyme at its catalytic site; on DEAE-cellulose chromatography the polypeptide that is susceptible to photolabeling co-elutes with K-PDE activity; the 106-kDa band is detectable in extracts of WT X K30a hybrids (where WT denotes wild type) in amounts proportional to the K-PDE activity in the hybrids, but is undetectable in wild type. The hybrid phenotype strongly suggests that the K30a phenotype is not due to mutations that affect either a diffusible regulator of transcription or an enzyme that modifies K-PDE. Although wild type cells contain a minor cGMP phosphodiesterase activity distinct from the major cAMP phosphodiesterase, the wild type cGMP phosphodiesterase is not susceptible to radiolabeling with [32P]cGMP; this rules out the possibility that the K30a phenotype is caused by overexpression of a wild type phosphodiesterase. We conclude that the K30a mutation produced expression of a new species of phosphodiesterase molecule that is not detectably expressed in the parental S49 wild type cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1510775270,"An analog of GTP, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl guanosine (5'-p-FSO2BzGuo), appears to interact irreversibly with guanine nucleotide-binding sites on human platelet membranes. This conclusion is based on the observation that incubation of human platelet membranes with 1.4 mM 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo followed by extensive membrane washing results in a reduction in the density of binding sites for [3H]guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), a hydrolysis-resistant analog of GTP. The alpha 2-adrenergic receptor of human platelets is felt to interact with a GTP-binding protein that modulates alpha 2-receptor-agonist interactions and mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The present data suggest that 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo attains saturating, or near saturating, occupancy of this alpha 2-receptor-associated GTP-binding protein, since incubation of human platelet membranes with 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo mimics the effects of optimal concentrations of Gpp(NH)p (0.1 mM) in reducing alpha 2-receptor affinity for agonist agents: 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo increases the EC50 for epinephrine competition for [3H]yohimbine antagonist binding to alpha 2-receptors from 0.15 to 1.5 microM and promotes a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in high affinity [3H]epinephrine agonist binding. The persistent effects of 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo on alpha 2-receptor-agonist interactions following extensive washing of the platelet membranes suggest that 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo modification of the alpha 2-receptor-associated GTP-binding protein is irreversible. Taken together, the above findings suggest that 5'-p-FSO2BzGuo may be the appropriate reagent to prepare in a radiolabeled form to affinity label the GTP-binding proteins in human platelet membranes and compare the properties of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-associated GTP-binding protein(s) with those of the presumably distinct GTP-binding protein that mediates stimulation of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W97692943,"The construction of recombinant M13 phages containing adenovirus DNA inserts was undertaken to provide strand-specific hybridization probes for analyses of adenovirus type 2 RNA transcripts. A library of molecular probes was constructed by cloning restriction endonuclease fragments of adenovirus types 2 and 5 DNA in the duplex replicative form DNA of the single-stranded bacteriophage vectors, M13mp7, M13mp8, and M13mp9 (Messing, J., and Vieira, J. (1982) Gene 19,269-276). Adenovirus DNA segments from early, intermediate, and late gene regions, accounting for at least 95% of the adenovirus chromosome, have been cloned in both possible orientations using these M13 derivatives as vectors. DNA cloned into these vectors can readily be obtained in a circular single-stranded form directly from mature phage particles. The cloned DNA fragments have been oriented and further characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and hybridization with 32P-labeled adenovirus DNA. The polarity and fidelity of the adenovirus DNA in the recombinant phages has been confirmed by hybridization with labeled adenovirus 2 early and late mRNA. Restriction endonuclease analyses of M13 clones containing adenovirus DNA inserts spanning genome coordinates 31.7-56.9 have indicated that the relative locations of some restriction coordinates located within this region do not correspond to the mapped restriction sites in the DNA of adenovirus 2. Potential uses for these M13 clones in studies of adenovirus gene expression are discussed."
