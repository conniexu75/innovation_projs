https://openalex.org/W1980396381,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a master regulator of protein synthesis that couples nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer. However, the downstream translationally regulated nodes of gene expression that may direct cancer development are poorly characterized. Using ribosome profiling, we uncover specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signalling, revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell proliferation, metabolism and invasion. We extend these findings by functionally characterizing a class of translationally controlled pro-invasion messenger RNAs that we show direct prostate cancer invasion and metastasis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signalling. Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure. Together, these findings extend our understanding of how the ‘cancerous’ translation machinery steers specific cancer cell behaviours, including metastasis, and may be therapeutically targeted. Ribosome profiling reveals specialized translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signalling; stringent inhibition of mTOR signalling reduces prostate cancer invasion and metastasis in a mouse model. The mTOR pathway is important in the regulation of protein synthesis and is activated in many human cancers. Two papers in this issue of Nature use ribosome profiling to study the control of messenger RNA translation by mTOR signalling. Hsieh et al. find that in prostate cancer cells and mouse prostate tumours, the translation of several genes involved in cancer invasion is regulated by mTOR by means of the 4EBP1 translational repressor. The experimental drug INK128, currently in clinical trials in people with prostate cancer, inhibits mTOR signalling and reduces the progression of prostate cancers to invasive carcinomas in a mouse model. Thoreen et al. show that through the 4E-BP protein family, the mTORC1 kinase recognizes and regulates a subset of mRNAs with an oligopyrimidine motif at the 5′ end."
https://openalex.org/W2090978188,"Introduced in its contemporary form in 1946 (ref. 1), but with roots that go back to the eighteenth century, the gravity law is the prevailing framework with which to predict population movement, cargo shipping volume and inter-city phone calls, as well as bilateral trade flows between nations. Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes."

https://openalex.org/W2023386301,"An improved understanding of enhancers in mammalian genomes could facilitate the design of new regulatory elements. Melnikov et al. synthesize thousands of ~90 nt enhancer variants, assay their activity in human cells and use the data to rationally optimize synthetic enhancers. Learning to read and write the transcriptional regulatory code is of central importance to progress in genetic analysis and engineering. Here we describe a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that facilitates the systematic dissection of transcriptional regulatory elements. In MPRA, microarray-synthesized DNA regulatory elements and unique sequence tags are cloned into plasmids to generate a library of reporter constructs. These constructs are transfected into cells and tag expression is assayed by high-throughput sequencing. We apply MPRA to compare >27,000 variants of two inducible enhancers in human cells: a synthetic cAMP-regulated enhancer and the virus-inducible interferon-β enhancer. We first show that the resulting data define accurate maps of functional transcription factor binding sites in both enhancers at single-nucleotide resolution. We then use the data to train quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAMs) of the two enhancers. We show that QSAMs from two cellular states can be combined to design enhancer variants that optimize potentially conflicting objectives, such as maximizing induced activity while minimizing basal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2065235521,"Type VI secretion systems are bacterial virulence-associated nanomachines composed of proteins that are evolutionarily related to components of bacteriophage tails. Here we show that protein secretion by the type VI secretion system of Vibrio cholerae requires the action of a dynamic intracellular tubular structure that is structurally and functionally homologous to contractile phage tail sheath. Time-lapse fluorescence light microscopy reveals that sheaths of the type VI secretion system cycle between assembly, quick contraction, disassembly and re-assembly. Whole-cell electron cryotomography further shows that the sheaths appear as long tubular structures in either extended or contracted conformations that are connected to the inner membrane by a distinct basal structure. These data support a model in which the contraction of the type VI secretion system sheath provides the energy needed to translocate proteins out of effector cells and into adjacent target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989004527,"Two groups describe approaches for synthesizing and assaying the function of thousands of variants of mammalian DNA regulatory elements. Melnikov et al. use their results to engineer short optimized regulatory elements in human cells, whereas Patwardhan et al. study enhancers hundreds of bases long in mice. The functional consequences of genetic variation in mammalian regulatory elements are poorly understood. We report the in vivo dissection of three mammalian enhancers at single-nucleotide resolution through a massively parallel reporter assay. For each enhancer, we synthesized a library of >100,000 mutant haplotypes with 2–3% divergence from the wild-type sequence. Each haplotype was linked to a unique sequence tag embedded within a transcriptional cassette. We introduced each enhancer library into mouse liver and measured the relative activities of individual haplotypes en masse by sequencing the transcribed tags. Linear regression analysis yielded highly reproducible estimates of the effect of every possible single-nucleotide change on enhancer activity. The functional consequence of most mutations was modest, with ∼22% affecting activity by >1.2-fold and ∼3% by >2-fold. Several, but not all, positions with higher effects showed evidence for purifying selection, or co-localized with known liver-associated transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating the value of empirical high-resolution functional analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2045933100,"After entering the cerebral cortex, sensory information spreads through six different horizontal neuronal layers that are interconnected by vertical axonal projections. It is believed that through these projections layers can influence each other's response to sensory stimuli, but the specific role that each layer has in cortical processing is still poorly understood. Here we show that layer six in the primary visual cortex of the mouse has a crucial role in controlling the gain of visually evoked activity in neurons of the upper layers without changing their tuning to orientation. This gain modulation results from the coordinated action of layer six intracortical projections to superficial layers and deep projections to the thalamus, with a substantial role of the intracortical circuit. This study establishes layer six as a major mediator of cortical gain modulation and suggests that it could be a node through which convergent inputs from several brain areas can regulate the earliest steps of cortical visual processing."
https://openalex.org/W2056203351,Insulin-expressing cells that have been differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro lack the glucose responsiveness characteristic of mature beta cells. Beta-cell maturation in mice was studied to find genetic markers that enable screens for factors that induce bona fide beta cells in vitro. We find that functional beta-cell maturation is marked by an increase in the glucose threshold for insulin secretion and by expression of the gene urocortin 3.
https://openalex.org/W1993093810,"Pressure plays an essential role in the induction1 and control2,3 of superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. Substitution of a smaller rare-earth ion for the bigger one to simulate the pressure effects has surprisingly raised the superconducting transition temperature Tc to the record high 55 K in these materials4,5. However, Tc always goes down after passing through a maximum at some pressure and the superconductivity eventually tends to disappear at sufficiently high pressures1-3. Here we show that the superconductivity can reemerge with a much higher Tc after its destruction upon compression from the ambient-condition value of around 31 K in newly discovered iron chalcogenide superconductors. We find that in the second superconducting phase the maximum Tc is as high as 48.7 K for K0.8Fe1.70Se2 and 48 K for (Tl0.6Rb0.4)Fe1.67Se2, setting the new Tc record in chalcogenide superconductors. The presence of the second superconducting phase is proposed to be related to pressure-induced quantum criticality. Our findings point to the potential route to the further achievement of high-Tc superconductivity in iron-based and other superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2066229820,"Sudden cardiac death exhibits diurnal variation in both acquired and hereditary forms of heart disease, but the molecular basis of this variation is unknown. A common mechanism that underlies susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is abnormalities in the duration (for example, short or long QT syndromes and heart failure) or pattern (for example, Brugada's syndrome) of myocardial repolarization. Here we provide molecular evidence that links circadian rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice. Specifically, we show that cardiac ion-channel expression and QT-interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent oscillator, krüppel-like factor 15 (Klf15). Klf15 transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP2), a critical subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current. Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repolarization and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. These findings identify circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for cardiac arrhythmogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964314383,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program of signaling pathways that determine commitment to epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. In the prostate, EMT processes have been implicated in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer progression. In a model of Pten- and TP53-null prostate adenocarcinoma that progresses via transforming growth factor β-induced EMT, mesenchymal transformation is characterized by plasticity, leading to various mesenchymal lineages and the production of bone. Here we show that SLUG is a major regulator of mesenchymal differentiation. As microRNAs (miRs) are pleiotropic regulators of differentiation and tumorigenesis, we evaluated miR expression associated with tumorigenesis and EMT. Mir-1 and miR-200 were reduced with progression of prostate adenocarcinoma, and we identify Slug as one of the phylogenetically conserved targets of these miRs. We demonstrate that SLUG is a direct repressor of miR-1 and miR-200 transcription. Thus, SLUG and miR-1/miR-200 act in a self-reinforcing regulatory loop, leading to amplification of EMT. Depletion of Slug inhibited EMT during tumorigenesis, whereas forced expression of miR-1 or miR-200 inhibited both EMT and tumorigenesis in human and mouse model systems. Various miR targets were analyzed, and our findings suggest that miR-1 has roles in regulating EMT and mesenchymal differentiation through Slug and functions in tumor-suppressive programs by regulating additional targets."
https://openalex.org/W2133819225,"OTUB1 is an atypical deubiquitinating enzyme which prevents ubiquitin attachment and is important in the DNA damage pathway; structural analysis of OTUB1 in complex with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme reveals that the ability of OTUB1 to inhibit ubiquitin chain synthesis is regulated by an allosteric feedback mechanism. Modification of proteins with ubiquitin is important for a range of cellular processes. Ubiquitylation is a reversible process in which deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from protein substrates. OTUB1 is an atypical DUB that prevents ubiquitin attachment and is important in the DNA damage pathway. In this study, Cynthia Wolberger and colleagues present structural analysis of OTUB1 in complex with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The study reveals that the ability of OTUB1 to inhibit ubiquitin-chain synthesis is regulated by an allosteric feedback mechanism, in which binding of free ubiquitin or K63-linked ubiquitin chains to OTUB1 converts it into a repressor. Histones are ubiquitinated in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), promoting recruitment of repair proteins to chromatin1. UBC13 (also known as UBE2N) is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that heterodimerizes with UEV1A2 (also known as UBE2V1) and synthesizes K63-linked polyubiquitin (K63Ub) chains at DSB sites in concert with the ubiquitin ligase (E3), RNF168 (ref. 3). K63Ub synthesis is regulated in a non-canonical manner by the deubiquitinating enzyme, OTUB1 (OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1), which binds preferentially to the UBC13∼Ub thiolester4. Residues amino-terminal to the OTU domain, which had been implicated in ubiquitin binding4, are required for binding to UBC13∼Ub and inhibition of K63Ub synthesis5. Here we describe structural and biochemical studies elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. We unexpectedly find that OTUB1 binding to UBC13∼Ub is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13∼Ub, while at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A in a manner that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an OTUB1–UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a chemical UBC13∼Ub conjugate show that binding of free ubiquitin to OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of a ubiquitin-binding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13∼Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be important for ubiquitin transfer6,7. The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. The general features of the inhibition mechanism explain how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes4 in a non-catalytic manner."
https://openalex.org/W1999503941,"The hypothesis of cancer stem cells has been proposed to explain the therapeutic failure in a variety of cancers including lung cancers. Previously, we demonstrated acquisition of epithelial–mesenchymal transition, a feature highly reminiscent of cancer stem-like cells, in gefitinib-resistant A549 cells (A549/GR). Here, we show that A549/GR cells contain a high proportion of CXCR4+ cells that are responsible for having high potential of self-renewal activity in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. A549/GR cells exhibited strong sphere-forming activity and high CXCR4 expression and SDF-1α secretion compared with parent cells. Pharmacological inhibition (AMD3100) and/or siRNA transfection targeting CXCR4 significantly suppressed sphere-forming activity in A549 and A549/GR cells, and in various non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. A549/GR cells showed enhanced Akt, mTOR and STAT3 (Y705) phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase or transfection with wild-type PTEN suppressed phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and STAT3 (Y705), sphere formation, and CXCR4 expression in A549/GR cells, whereas mutant PTEN enhanced these events. Inhibition of STAT3 by WP1066 or siSTAT3 significantly suppressed the sphere formation, but not CXCR4 expression, indicating that STAT3 is a downstream effector of CXCR4-mediated signaling. FACS-sorted CXCR4+ A549/GR cells formed many large spheres, had self-renewal capacity, demonstrated radiation resistance in vitro and exhibited stronger tumorigenic potential in vivo than CXCR4− cells. Lentiviral-transduction of CXCR4 enhanced sphere formation and tumorigenicity in H460 and A549 cells, whereas introduction of siCXCR4 suppressed these activities in A549/GR cells. Our data indicate that CXCR4+ NSCLC cells are strong candidates for tumorigenic stem-like cancer cells that maintain stemness through a CXCR4-medated STAT3 pathway and provide a potential therapeutic target for eliminating these malignant cells in NSCLC."

https://openalex.org/W2018263869,"Invasion and metastasis are the major features of malignant tumors that are responsible for 90% of cancer-related deaths. Recently, microRNAs have been discovered to have a role in suppressing tumor metastasis. This study's aim was to clarify the roles of miR-145 in gastric carcinomas and its underlying molecular mechanism in regulating tumor metastasis. Here, we demonstrate a stepwise downregulation of miR-145 level in nontumorous gastric mucosa, primary gastric cancers and their secondary metastases. In vitro analysis of miR-145's ectopic expression and loss-of-function suggests that it suppresses gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. In vivo spontaneous metastasis and experimental metastasis assay further confirm its function in suppressing the invasion–metastasis cascade, including impairing local invasion and inhibiting hematogenous metastasis in gastric cancers. Furthermore, we identified a novel mechanism of miR-145 to suppress metastasis. N-cadherin (CDH2) was proved to be a direct target of miR-145, using luciferase assay and western blot. Re-expressing N-cadherin in miR-145-transfected cells reverses their migration and invasion defects. Although not a direct target of miR-145, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), but not MMP2, was also significantly decreased in miR-145-expressing cells. We suggest that miR-145 suppresses tumor metastasis by inhibiting N-cadherin protein translation, and then indirectly downregulates its downstream effector MMP9."

https://openalex.org/W2042233932,"O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine, or O-GlcNAc, is a dynamic post-translational modification that cycles on and off serine and threonine residues of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. The O-GlcNAc modification shares a complex relationship with phosphorylation, as both modifications are capable of mutually inhibiting the occupation of each other on the same or nearby amino acid residue. In addition to diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, O-GlcNAc appears to play a significant role in cell growth and cell cycle progression, although the precise mechanisms are still not well understood. A recent study also found that all four core nucleosomal histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) are modified with O-GlcNAc, although no specific sites on H3 were reported. Here, we describe that histone H3, a protein highly phosphorylated during mitosis, is modified with O-GlcNAc. Several biochemical assays were used to validate that H3 is modified with O-GlcNAc. Mass spectrometry analysis identified threonine 32 as a novel O-GlcNAc site. O-GlcNAc was detected at higher levels on H3 during interphase than mitosis, which inversely correlated with phosphorylation. Furthermore, increased O-GlcNAcylation was observed to reduce mitosis-specific phosphorylation at serine 10, serine 28, and threonine 32. Finally, inhibiting OGA, the enzyme responsible for removing O-GlcNAc, hindered the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle, displaying a phenotype similar to preventing mitosis-specific phosphorylation on H3. Taken together, these data indicate that O-GlcNAcylation regulates mitosis-specific phosphorylations on H3, providing a mechanistic switch that orchestrates the G2-M transition of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1975940353,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, NM 006164, 605 AA) is essential for the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-mediated expression of a group of detoxifying antioxidant genes that detoxify carcinogens and protect against oxidative stress. Several proteins have been identified as Nrf2-interacting molecules. In this study, we found that the overexpression of receptor-associated coactivator 3 (RAC3)/AIB-1/steroid receptor coactivator-3, a nuclear coregulator and oncogene frequently amplified in human breast cancers, induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through Nrf2 transactivation in HeLa cells. Next, we determined the interaction between RAC3 and Nrf2 proteins using a co-immunoprecipitation assay and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. The results showed that RAC3 bound directly to the Nrf2 protein in the nucleus. Subsequently, we identified the interacting domains of Nrf2 and RAC3 using a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. The results showed that both the N-terminal RAC3-pasB and C-terminal RAC3-R3B3 domains were tightly bound to the Neh4 and Neh5 transactivation domains. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that RAC3 bound tightly to the ARE enhancer region of the HO-1 promoter via Nrf2 binding. These data suggest that Nrf2 activation is modulated and directly controlled through interactions with the RAC3 protein in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977448566,"Peroxin 5 (PEX5), the peroxisomal protein shuttling receptor, binds newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol and promotes their translocation across the organelle membrane. During the translocation step, PEX5 itself becomes inserted into the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery. PEX5 is then monoubiquitinated at a conserved cysteine residue and extracted back into the cytosol in an ATP-dependent manner. We have previously shown that the ubiquitin-PEX5 thioester conjugate (Ub-PEX5) released into the cytosol can be efficiently disrupted by physiological concentrations of glutathione, raising the possibility that a fraction of Ub-PEX5 is nonenzymatically deubiquitinated in vivo. However, data suggesting that Ub-PEX5 is also a target of a deubiquitinase were also obtained in that work. Here, we used an unbiased biochemical approach to identify this enzyme. Our results suggest that ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) is by far the most active deubiquitinase acting on Ub-PEX5, both in female rat liver and HeLa cells. We also show that USP9X is an elongated monomeric protein with the capacity to hydrolyze thioester, isopeptide, and peptide bonds. The strategy described here will be useful in identifying deubiquitinases acting on other ubiquitin conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2077259663,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of their target genes. They are involved in many biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, and are considered as promising new therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the identity of miRNAs involved in apoptosis and their respective targets remain largely unknown. Given the elevated complexity of miRNA regulation of gene expression, we performed a functional screening as an alternative strategy to identify those miRNAs that in lung cancer cells may interfere with the apoptotic process. To this aim, we generated a derivative of the non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cell line in which caspase-8, a critical upstream initiator of apoptosis, can be activated by administration of the small dimerizer drug AP20187. We found a number of miRNAs that may rescue cell viability from caspase-8 activation. They included miRNAs already described as oncogenic such as miR-17, miR-135 and miR-520, but also some miRNAs such as miR-124-1 and miR-34c for which a tumor-suppressive role has instead been described or expected. Among them, miR-34c-5p markedly increased resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that Bmf (Bcl-2-modifying factor) is a target of miR-34c-5p, and that its silencing, together with that of c-myc, a known target of miR-34c-5p, contributes to resistance to apoptosis induced by paclitaxel through p53 downregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2009335881,"The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a macromolecular system distributed in Gram-negative bacteria, responsible for the secretion of effector proteins into target cells. The T6SS has a broad versatility as it can target both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It is therefore involved in host pathogenesis or killing neighboring bacterial cells to colonize a new niche. At the architecture level, the T6SS core apparatus is composed of 13 proteins, which assemble in two subcomplexes. One of these subcomplexes, composed of subunits that share structural similarities with bacteriophage tail and baseplate components, is anchored to the cell envelope by the membrane subcomplex. This latter is constituted of at least three proteins, TssL, TssM, and TssJ. The crystal structure of the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein and its interaction with the inner membrane TssM protein have been recently reported. TssL and TssM share sequence homology and characteristics with two components of the Type IVb secretion system (T4bSS), IcmH/DotU and IcmF, respectively. In this study, we report the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of the TssL inner membrane protein from the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Sci-1 T6SS. It folds as a hook-like structure composed of two three-helix bundles. Two TssL molecules associate to form a functional complex. Although the TssL trans-membrane segment is the main determinant of self-interaction, contacts between the cytoplasmic domains are required for TssL function. Based on sequence homology and secondary structure prediction, we propose that the TssL structure is the prototype for the members of the TssL and IcmH/DotU families."
https://openalex.org/W2161589982,"Our purpose was to identify epigenetic markers of breast cancer risk, which can be reliably measured in peripheral blood and are amenable for large population screening. We used 2 independent assays, luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) and long interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1) to measure ""global methylation content"" in peripheral blood DNA from a well-characterized population-based case-control study. We examined associations between methylation levels and breast cancer risk among 1055 cases and 1101 controls and potential influences of 1-carbon metabolism on global methylation. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of LUMA methylation, those in the highest quintile had a 2.41-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.83-3.16; P, trend<0.0001). The association did not vary by other key tumor characteristics and lifestyle risk factors. Consistent with LUMA findings, genome-wide methylation profiling of a subset of samples revealed greater promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer case participants (P=0.04); higher LUMA was associated with higher promoter methylation in the controls (P=0.05). LUMA levels were also associated with functional sodium nitroprusside in key 1-carbon metabolizing genes, MTHFR C677T (P=0.001) and MTRR A66G (P=0.018). LINE-1 methylation was associated with neither breast cancer risk nor 1-carbon metabolism. Our results show that global promoter hypermethylation measured in peripheral blood was associated with breast cancer risk."

Wingless-type MMTV integration site family members (WNTs) are secreted glycoproteins involved in embryogenesis and, on inappropriate expression in the adult, in cancer. Here, we show expression of WNT6 in GC patient specimens, human GC cell lines and in a mouse model of GC. In human GC cells, WNT6 expression was enhanced by caveolin-1 (Cav1), a scaffold protein of plasma membrane caveolae. WNT6 knock-down and overexpression experiments demonstrated that WNT6 increased the resistance to apoptotic cell death induced by the anthracycline chemotherapeutics epirubicin (Epi) and doxorubicin (Dox). Epi increased the activity of the human WNT6 promoter through Cav1-dependent binding of β-catenin to the proximal WNT6 promoter. Epi increased both WNT6/Wnt6 and Cav1 expression in human GC cells and within the tumor area of a murine model of GC (CEA424-SV40 TAg). In GC patients, WNT6 expression was positively associated with the tumor stage and the nodal status, and inversely correlated with the response to ECF (Epi, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy. These results showed that WNT6 and Cav1 are upregulated by chemotherapeutics and enhance the resistance of GC cells to anthracycline drugs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving WNT6/Cav1-induced drug resistance will provide benefits in developing new therapies for GC."

We found that activation of the latent Pik3caH1047R allele resulted in breast tumors with multiple histological types. Whole-exome analysis of the Pik3caH1047R-driven mammary tumors identified multiple mutations, including Trp53 mutations that appeared spontaneously during the development of adenocarinoma and spindle cell tumors. Further, we used this model to test the efficacy of GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, in clinical development, and showed that the tumors respond to PI3K inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2012291430,"Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide range of human disease ranging from localized skin and soft tissue infections to potentially lethal systemic infections. S. aureus has the biosynthetic ability to generate numerous virulence factors that assist in circumventing the innate immune system during disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have uncovered a set of extracellular peptides produced by community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) with homology to the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) from Staphylococcus epidermidis. CA-MRSA PSMs contribute to skin infection and recruit and lyse neutrophils, and truncated versions of these peptides possess antimicrobial activity. In this study, novel CA-MRSA PSM derivatives were discovered by the use of microbial imaging mass spectrometry. The novel PSM derivatives are compared with their parent full-length peptides for changes in hemolytic, cytolytic, and neutrophil-stimulating activity. A potential contribution of the major S. aureus secreted protease aureolysin in processing PSMs is demonstrated. Finally, we show that PSM processing occurs in multiple CA-MRSA strains by structural confirmation of additional novel derivatives. This work demonstrates that IMS can serve as a useful tool to go beyond genome predictions and expand our understanding of the important family of small peptide virulence factors."

In vitro circadian period was determined using luminometry of cultured fibroblasts, in which the expression of firefly luciferase was driven by the promoter of the circadian gene Arntl (Bmal1). The period of the melatonin rhythm was assessed in a 9-d forced desynchrony protocol, minimizing confounding effects of sleep-wake and light-dark cycles on circadian rhythmicity. In vitro periods (32 participants, 24.61±0.33 h, mean±SD) were longer than in vivo periods (31 participants, 24.16±0.17 h; P> 0.0001) but did not differ between PER3 genotypes (P>0.4). Analyses of replicate in vitro assessments demonstrated that circadian period was reproducible within individuals (intraclass correlation=0.62), but in vivo and in vitro period assessments did not correlate (P>0.9).

https://openalex.org/W1998169432,"Murine double minute (MDM2) binding protein (MTBP) has been implicated in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate one mechanism by which MTBP inhibits cancer metastasis. Overexpression of MTBP in human osteosarcoma cell lines lacking wild-type p53 did not alter primary tumor growth in mice, but significantly inhibited metastases. MTBP downregulation increased the migratory potential of MDM2(-/-)p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that MTBP inhibited cell migration independently of the Mdm2-p53 pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis identified alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4) as an MTBP-interacting protein. Endogenous MTBP interacted with and partially colocalized with ACTN4. MTBP overexpression inhibited cell migration and filopodia formation mediated by ACTN4. Increased cell migration by MTBP downregulation was inhibited by concomitant downregulation of ACTN4. MTBP also inhibited ACTN4-mediated F-actin bundling. We furthermore demonstrated that nuclear localization of MTBP was dispensable for inhibiting ACTN4-mediated cell migration and filopodia formation. Thus, MTBP suppresses cell migration, at least partially, by inhibiting ACTN4 function. Our study not only provides a mechanism of metastasis suppression by MTBP, but also suggests MTBP as a potential biomarker for cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W1988051213,"We have provided the first evidence for specific heteromerization between the α1A-adrenoceptor (α1AAR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) in live cells. α1AAR and CXCR2 are both expressed in areas such as the stromal smooth muscle layer of the prostate. By utilizing the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromer identification technology on the live cell-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay platform, our studies in human embryonic kidney 293 cells have identified norepinephrine-dependent β-arrestin recruitment that was in turn dependent upon co-expression of α1AAR with CXCR2. These findings have been supported by co-localization observed using confocal microscopy. This norepinephrine-dependent β-arrestin recruitment was inhibited not only by the α1AR antagonist Terazosin but also by the CXCR2-specific allosteric inverse agonist SB265610. Furthermore, Labetalol, which is marketed for hypertension as a nonselective β-adrenoceptor antagonist with α1AR antagonist properties, was identified as a heteromer-specific-biased agonist exhibiting partial agonism for inositol phosphate production but essentially full agonism for β-arrestin recruitment at the α1AAR-CXCR2 heteromer. Finally, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies with both receptors tagged suggest that α1AAR-CXCR2 heteromerization occurs constitutively and is not modulated by ligand. These findings support the concept of GPCR heteromer complexes exhibiting distinct pharmacology, thereby providing additional mechanisms through which GPCRs can potentially achieve their diverse biological functions. This has important implications for the use and future development of pharmaceuticals targeting these receptors.

Our understanding of GPCR signaling is now evolving from considering these seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) simply as “on-off” switches consisting of only one functional unit to accepting that they probably act more like “microprocessors” (1Kenakin T.P. Cellular assays as portals to seven-transmembrane receptor-based drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), signaling complexes containing potentially multiple GPCRs along with various other interacting proteins. Termed heteromerization, the accepted definition states that a receptor heteromer is a “macromolecular complex composed of at least two (functional) receptor units with biochemical properties that are demonstrably different from those of its individual components” (2Ferré S. Baler R. Bouvier M. Caron M.G. Devi L.A. Durroux T. Fuxe K. George S.R. Javitch J.A. Lohse M.J. Mackie K. Milligan G. Pfleger K.D. Pin J.P. Volkow N.D. Waldhoer M. Woods A.S. Franco R. Building a new conceptual framework for receptor heteromers.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that GPCRs can function as monomers (3Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P. Rasmussen S.G. Huang B. Zare R.N. Kobilka B. Sunahara R.K.

Bouvier M. Caron M.G. Devi L.A. Durroux T. Fuxe K. George S.R. Javitch J.A. Lohse M.J. Mackie K. Milligan G. Pfleger K.D. Pin J.P. Volkow N.D. Waldhoer M. Woods A.S. Franco R. Building a new conceptual framework for receptor heteromers.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar)). Consequently, for most GPCRs, heteromerization is probably not obligatory. However, it does have the potential to provide additional mechanisms for signal integration and allosteric modulation when it occurs, and with these come exciting new opportunities for novel pharmaceutical development.

The α1AAR is coupled to the Gq/11 protein/phospholipase C signaling pathway. Subsequent activation of phospholipase C causes the production of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, particularly resulting in contraction of smooth muscle (7Eckert R.E. Schreier U. Drescher P. Madsen P.O. Derouet H. Becht E. Steffens J. Ziegler M. Regulation of prostatic smooth muscle contractility by intracellular second messengers.

Currently, α1AARs can be functionally subclassified into two pharmacologically distinct phenotypes; the “standard” α1AAR phenotype is predominantly found in brain, heart, and blood vessels, whereas a functional isoform of α1AAR, the so-called “α1LAR,” is more prominent in prostate and bladder neck (8Muramatsu I. Oshita M. Ohmura T. Kigoshi S. Akino H. Gobara M. Okada K. Pharmacological characterization of α1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the human prostate. Functional and binding studies.Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 209-215PubMed Google Scholar). Using genetically modified knock-out mice, it has recently been shown that both functional phenotypes arise from the same α1AAR gene (10Gray K. Short J. Ventura S. The α1A-adrenoceptor gene is required for the α1L-adrenoceptor-mediated response in isolated preparations of the mouse prostate.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 155: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) even though studies have indicated that a splice variant or polymorphism is not responsible for the difference in pharmacology (11Shibata K. Hirasawa A. Moriyama N. Kawabe K. Ogawa S. Tsujimoto G. α1a-adrenoceptor polymorphism. Pharmacological characterization and association with benign prostatic hypertrophy.Br. J.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α1LAR phenotype is not observed in radioligand binding experiments using homogenized prostate tissue but is seen in functional studies using whole tissue or cells (14Muramatsu I. Tanaka T. Suzuki F. Li Z. Hiraizumi-Hiraoka Y. Anisuzzaman A.S. Yamamoto H. Horinouchi T. Morishima S. Quantifying receptor properties.

Urol. 2010; 17: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that an interacting protein may be associated with the α1AAR in tissues exhibiting α1LAR pharmacology (14Muramatsu I. Tanaka T. Suzuki F. Li Z. Hiraizumi-Hiraoka Y. Anisuzzaman A.S. Yamamoto H. Horinouchi T. Morishima S. Quantifying receptor properties. The tissue segment binding method; a powerful tool for the pharmacome analysis of native receptors.J.

Indeed, a recent publication has provided evidence for cysteine-rich with epidermal growth factor-like domain 1α (CRELD1α) interacting with α1AAR to modulate function, largely in terms of receptor expression levels (16Nishimune A. Suzuki F. Yoshiki H. Morishima S. Muramatsu I. Identification of cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like domain 1α (CRELD1α) as a novel α1A-adrenoceptor-down-regulating protein and establishment of an α1L-adrenoceptor-expressing cell line.J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 113: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Evidence for α1AAR forming complexes with itself (13Ramsay D. Carr I.C. Pediani J. Lopez-Gimenez J.F. Thurlow R.

Effects on receptor expression and pharmacological properties.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) has also been published. No effects on receptor pharmacological properties were observed, but co-expression of α1BAR did appear to increase α1AAR expression levels (17Uberti M.A. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Subtype-specific dimerization of α 1-adrenoceptors. Effects on receptor expression and pharmacological properties.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is that α1AAR function can also be modulated by heteromerization with GPCRs from outside the adrenoceptor family. Interestingly, in addition to the aforementioned precedents for α1AAR being modulated by interacting proteins, recent evidence for heteromerization of the β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 playing a potential role in cardiac myocyte survival has provided a precedent for adrenoceptor-chemokine receptor heteromerization (18LaRocca T.J. Schwarzkopf M. Altman P. Zhang S. Gupta A. Gomes I. Alvin Z. Champion H.C. Haddad G. Hajjar R.J. Devi L.A. Schecter A.D. Tarzami S.T. β2-Adrenergic receptor signaling in the cardiac myocyte is modulated by interactions with CXCR4.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2010; 56: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Taken together with suggestions that the diverse functional effects mediated by the α1ARs may not be entirely explicable by Gq/11 signaling pathways (19Cotecchia S. The α1-adrenergic receptors. Diversity of signaling networks and regulation.J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2010; 30: 410-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that heteromerization may provide a mechanism for such diversity. This in turn provides a potential opportunity to develop therapies that target this receptor only when in a complex with another GPCR and, therefore, possibly also in a tissue-selective manner. Although the chemokine receptors clearly play a major role in the immune system, their widespread expression pattern suggests their role may extend beyond chemotaxis and cell migration. CXCR2 is activated by multiple chemokines, and signaling via this receptor has been shown to reinforce cell growth arrest (cellular senescence) (20Acosta J.C. O'Loghlen A. Banito A. Guijarro M.V. Augert A. Raguz S. Fumagalli M. Da Costa M. Brown C. Popov N. Takatsu Y. Melamed J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Bernard D. Hernando E. Gil J. Chemokine signaling via the CXCR2 receptor reinforces senescence.Cell. 2008; 133: 1006-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). In contrast, depletion of CXCR2 results in escape from senescence. A role for CXCR2 in senescence has been elucidated in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, with fibroblasts that are undergoing oncogene-induced senescence up-regulating CXCR2 and its ligands, suggestive of a positive feedback loop (20Acosta J.C. O'Loghlen A. Banito A. Guijarro M.V. Augert A. Raguz S. Fumagalli M. Da Costa M. Brown C. Popov N. Takatsu Y. Melamed J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Bernard D. Hernando E. Gil J. Chemokine signaling via the CXCR2 receptor reinforces senescence.Cell. 2008; 133: 1006-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CXCR2 is well established as a receptor that is capable of forming complexes with both itself (21Trettel F. Di Bartolomeo S. Lauro C. Catalano M. Ciotti M.T. Limatola C.

J. 2008; 412: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although establishment of novel heteromer-specific pharmacology in native tissue is the ultimate goal, this is hampered by the general lack of experimental tools to study heteromerization of endogenously expressed receptors (24Mustafa S. Ayoub M.A. Pfleger K.D. Uncovering GPCR heteromer-biased ligands.Drug Discov. Today: Technol. 2010; 7: e77-e85Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, our first step has been to provide evidence at least of receptor co-localization, which we have done using immunohistochemistry that indicates CXCR2 expression specifically in a region of the prostate well established as expressing α1AAR (25Morishima S. Suzuki F. Nishimune A. Yoshiki H. Akino H. Yokoyama O. Muramatsu I. Visualization and tissue distribution of α1L-adrenoceptor in human prostate by the fluorescently labeled ligand Alexa-488-silodosin.J. Urol. 2010; 183: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our next step has been to establish the existence and novel pharmacology of α1AAR heteromerization in a recombinant system, to identify the “biochemical fingerprint of a receptor heteromer.” By applying the GPCR heteromer identification technology (HIT) approach (24Mustafa S. Ayoub M.A. Pfleger K.D. Uncovering GPCR heteromer-biased ligands.Drug Discov. Today: Technol. 2010; 7: e77-e85Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Ayoub M.A. Pfleger K.D.

This is in stark contrast to the very weak β-arrestin2 interaction observed with α1AAR monomers/homomers in transfected HEK293 cells (30Stanasila L. Abuin L. Dey J. Cotecchia S.

HEK293FT cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and complete media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.3 mg/ml glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen)) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were carried out 24 h after seeding about 550,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate. Genejuice (Novagen) transfection reagent was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). For testing the CXCR2 antibody specificity, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well of a 12-well plate and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and high glucose (25 mm) DMEM (supplemented with 4 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 5% FCS, 16 mm HEPES, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mg/ml hygromycin B, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate). CHO cells were immunostained 36 h after transfecting with 1 μg of CXCR2 or CCR2 cDNA per well of a 12-well plate. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After three 10-min washes in PBS, the cells were blocked and permeabilized (30 min, RT) with 5% donkey serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-CXCR2 antibodies (1:200; Abcam, ab14935) in PBS containing 5% donkey serum, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then washed as above and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (1:200; Invitrogen; 1 h, RT). Cells were washed again as above, and the nucleus was stained with TO-PRO-3 Iodide (1:3000 in PBS, Invitrogen). Images were acquired using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with 561 and 640 lasers and 595/50 and 700/75 emission filters, respectively, as well as a Nikon S Plan Fluor 40× objective lens. 12 bit (1024 × 1024) images were collected using the NIS Elements software. Male C57Bl6/J mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the ventral prostate was dissected out. Tissue was fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS (2 h, RT), washed 4 times with 7% sucrose in PBS containing 0.01% sodium azide (10 min each time), and stored in this solution (48 h, 4 °C). Prostates were then embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek), snap-frozen in melting isopentane, and stored at −80 °C until use. Frozen 10-μm prostate sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM 1850), thawed onto Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel-Glaser), and left to air dry (1 h). Sections were washed with PBS (10 min) then blocked with 10% donkey serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.1% lysine, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.2% Tween 20 (30 min, RT). After blocking, slide-mounted sections were incubated (40–48 h, 4 °C) with rabbit polyclonal anti-CXCR2 antibodies (1:100; Abcam, ab14935) in PBS containing 0.01% BSA, 5% donkey serum, 0.1% lysine, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.1% Tween 20. For negative control sections, rabbit polyclonal anti-CXCR2 antibodies were omitted. Sections were washed 4 times with PBS (10 min each time) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1 h, RT). After secondary antibody incubation, sections were again washed 4 times with PBS (10 min each time), then stained (10 min, RT) with DAPI (300 ng/ml, Sigma) in PBS. Sections were then washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Sections were viewed using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope fitted with an Olympus mercury burner light source attachment and Olympus UPlanSApo 20× and 40× objectives. CXCR2 staining (FITC, green) was viewed using an Olympus U-MNIBA3 filter cube consisting of a DM505 dichroic mirror, BP470-490 exciter filter, and BA515-550 barrier filter. Staining for DAPI (blue) was viewed using an Olympus U-MNUA2 filter cube consisting of a DM400 dichroic mirror, BP360-370 exciter filter, and BA420-460 barrier filter.

https://openalex.org/W2067365764,"Secreted phosphoprotein-1 (SPP1) promotes cancer cell survival and regulates tumor-associated angiogenesis and inflammation, both central to the pathogenesis of malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Here, we examined the impact of tumor- and host-derived SPP1 in MPE formation and explored the mechanisms by which the cytokine exerts its effects. We used a syngeneic murine model of lung adenocarcinoma-induced MPE. To dissect the effects of tumor- versus host-derived SPP1, we intrapleurally injected wild-type and SPP1-knockout C57/BL/6 mice with either wild-type or SPP1-deficient syngeneic lung cancer cells. We demonstrated that both tumor- and host-derived SPP1 promoted pleural fluid accumulation and tumor dissemination in a synergistic manner (P<0.001). SPP1 of host origin elicited macrophage recruitment into the cancer-affected pleural cavity and boosted tumor angiogenesis, whereas tumor-derived SPP1 curtailed cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, the cytokine directly promoted vascular hyper-permeability independently of vascular endothelial growth factor. In addition, SPP1 of tumor and host origin differentially affected the expression of proinflammatory and angiogenic mediators in the tumor microenvironment. These results suggest that SPP1 of tumor and host origin impact distinct aspects of MPE pathobiology to synergistically promote pleural fluid formation and pleural tumor progression. SPP1 may present an attractive target of therapeutic interventions for patients with MPE."
https://openalex.org/W2033940835,"The integrin α9β1 binds a number of extracellular matrix components to mediate cell adhesion, migration and tissue invasion. Although expressed in a variety of normal human cells including endothelium, it is also expressed in cancer cells. We have previously shown that α9β1 binds VEGF-A to facilitate angiogenesis, an important component of the tumor microenvironment. As α9β1 induces accelerated cancer cell migration, we wished to determine what role it played in cancer growth and metastasis. In this study, we show that α9β1 expression induces molecular changes consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, we found that α9β1 forms a tri-partite protein complex with β-catenin and E-cadherin, which dissociates following integrin activation and subsequent src and β-catenin phosphorylation. These findings were consistent in cells in which: α9β1 was exogenously over-expressed, or when its expression was suppressed in cancer cells endogenously expressing α9β1. These in vitro results are biologically significant as α9β1-expressing cancer cells induce greater tumor growth and metastases in mice as compared to the cells without α9β1 expression or when integrin expression is suppressed. Furthermore, integrin α9β1 is expressed in primary human small cell lung cancer and patients having a high expression of α9β1 demonstrated significantly worse long-term survival compared with patients with low α9β1 expression. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of integrin α9β1 function in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2057243830,"Two members of the R7 subfamily of regulators of G protein signaling, RGS7 and RGS11, are present at dendritic tips of retinal depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). Their involvement in the mGluR6/Gα(o)/TRPM1 pathway that mediates DBC light responses has been implicated. However, previous genetic studies employed an RGS7 mutant mouse that is hypomorphic, and hence the exact role of RGS7 in DBCs remains unclear. We have made a true RGS7-null mouse line with exons 6-8 deleted. The RGS7(-/-) mouse is viable and fertile but smaller in body size. Electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave implicit time in young RGS7(-/-) mice is prolonged at eye opening, but the phenotype disappears at 2 months of age. Expression levels of RGS6 and RGS11 are unchanged in RGS7(-/-) retina, but the Gβ5S level is significantly reduced. By characterizing a complete RGS7 and RGS11 double knock-out (711dKO) mouse line, we found that Gβ5S expression in the retinal outer plexiform layer is eliminated, as is the ERG b-wave. Ultrastructural defects akin to those of Gβ5(-/-) mice are evident in 711dKO mice. In retinas of mice lacking RGS6, RGS7, and RGS11, Gβ5S is undetectable, whereas levels of the photoreceptor-specific Gβ5L remain unchanged. Whereas RGS6 alone sustains a significant amount of Gβ5S expression in retina, the DBC-related defects in Gβ5(-/-) mice are caused solely by a combined loss of RGS7 and RGS11. Our data support the notion that the role of Gβ5 in the retina, and likely in the entire nervous system, is mediated exclusively by R7 RGS proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2127034410,"Although preconditioning injury on the peripheral nerve induces axonal regenerative capacity in neurons, it is not known whether similar lesion effects occur in glial cells. Here we demonstrate that Schwann cells are activated by peripheral nerve preinjury and primed to mediate axon regeneration. Cdc2, which was induced from Schwann cells after sciatic nerve injury, phosphorylated vimentin almost exclusively in the distal nerve area. Phospho-vimentin-positive Schwann cells showed increased migration activity and were in close contact with process outgrowth of co-cultured neurons. Vimentin phosphorylation by Cdc2 was involved in β1-integrin activation leading to FAK phoshorylation and associated with Erk1/2 activation in Schwann cells. Neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons was increased by co-culture with activated Schwann cells, in which phospho-vimentin signaling was transmitted into β1-integrin activation. Then neurite outgrowth was suppressed by genetic depletion of phospho-vimentin and β1 integrin as well as inhibition of vimentin phosphorylation by Cdc2 inhibitor purvalanol A. The sciatic nerve graft harboring activated Schwann cells into the spinal cord induced Schwann cell migration beyond the graft-host barrier and facilitated regeneration of spinal axons, which was inhibited by purvalanol A pretreatment of the graft. This is the first report to our knowledge demonstrating that activation of phospho-vimentin linked to β1-integrin pathway may mediate transcellular signaling to promote axon growth."

https://openalex.org/W2068810487,"Recruitment of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) to promoters plays an important role in gene repression. Glucocorticoid signaling represses the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and AP-1 through direct binding, yet the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we report that OGT is an important component of GR-mediated transrepression. OGT associates with ligand-bound GR in a multi-protein repression complex. Overexpression of OGT potentiates the GR transrepression pathway, whereas depletion of endogenous OGT by RNA interference abolishes the repression. The recruitment of OGT by GR leads to increased O-GlcNAcylation and decreased phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II on target genes. Functionally, overexpression of OGT enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in resistant cell lines while knockdown of OGT prevents sensitive cell lines from apoptosis. These studies identify a molecular mechanism of GR transrepression, and highlight the function of O-GlcNAc in hormone signaling."

Myocilin interacted with α1-syntrophin via its N-terminal domain and co-immunoprecipitated with α1-syntrophin from C2C12 myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle.

Despite significant progresses in understanding how HuR functions, the mechanism by which HuR expression is controlled is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that RNA-binding protein RNPC1 post-transcriptionally regulates HuR expression via mRNA stability. Specifically, we showed that overexpression of RNPC1 increases, whereas knockdown or knock-out of RNPC1 decreases, the level of HuR transcript and protein. Moreover, we showed that RNPC1, but not mutant RNPC1 deficient in RNA binding, stabilizes HuR transcript via binding to its 3'-untranslated region. Furthermore, to determine the biological significance of RNPC1-enhanced HuR expression, we showed that HuR, by repressing c-Myc expression, facilitates RNPC1-mediated growth suppression. Together, we have uncovered a novel mechanism by which HuR is regulated by RNPC1 via mRNA stability and HuR is a mediator of RNPC1-induced growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1978193648,"Biological invasions are recognized as a major cause of biodiversity decline and have considerable impact on the economy and human health. The African big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala is considered one of the world's most harmful invasive species.To better understand its ecological and demographic features, we combined behavioural (aggression tests), chemical (quantitative and qualitative analyses of cuticular lipids) and genetic (mitochondrial divergence and polymorphism of DNA microsatellite markers) data obtained for eight populations in Cameroon. Molecular data revealed two cryptic species of P. megacephala, one inhabiting urban areas and the other rainforests. Urban populations belong to the same phylogenetic group than those introduced in Australia and in other parts of the world. Behavioural analyses show that the eight populations sampled make up four mutually aggressive supercolonies. The maximum distance between nests from the same supercolony was 49 km and the closest distance between two nests belonging to two different supercolonies was 46 m. The genetic data and chemical analyses confirmed the behavioural tests as all of the nests were correctly assigned to their supercolony. Genetic diversity appears significantly greater in Africa than in introduced populations in Australia; by contrast, urban and Australian populations are characterized by a higher chemical diversity than rainforest ones.Overall, our study shows that populations of P. megacephala in Cameroon adopt a unicolonial social structure, like invasive populations in Australia. However, the size of the supercolonies appears several orders of magnitude smaller in Africa. This implies competition between African supercolonies and explains why they persist over evolutionary time scales."
https://openalex.org/W2107839228,"When mTOR inhibitor rapalogs prevent cap-dependent translation of cell-cycle proteins like c-myc, continuing tumor cell growth depends on cap-independent translation, which is mediated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) located in the 5'-UTR (untranslated region) of transcripts. To investigate if rapalog-induced activation of MNK kinases had a role in such IRES activity, we studied multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Rapamycin (RAP)-activated MNK1 kinase activity in MM cell lines and primary specimens by a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism. Pharmacological inhibition of MNK activity or genetic silencing of MNK1 prevented a rapalog-induced upregulation of c-myc IRES activity. Although RAP, used alone, had little effect on myc protein expression, when combined with a MNK inhibitor, myc protein expression was abrogated. In contrast, there was no inhibition of myc RNA, consistent with an effect on myc translation. In a RAP-resistant MM cell lines as well as a resistant primary MM specimen, co-exposure to a MNK inhibitor or MNK1 knockdown significantly sensitized cells for RAP-induced cytoreduction. Studies in MNK-null murine embryonic fibroblasts additionally supported a role for MNK kinases in RAP-induced myc IRES stimulation. These results indicate that MNK kinase activity has a critical role in the fail-safe mechanism of IRES-dependent translation when mTOR is inhibited. As kinase activity also regulated sensitivity to RAP, the data also provide a rationale for therapeutically targeting MNK kinases for combined treatment with mTOR inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1969393758,"Enzymatic phosphorylation through a family of enzymes called aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferases (APHs) is a major mechanism by which bacteria confer resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Members of the APH(2″) subfamily are of particular clinical interest because of their prevalence in pathogenic strains and their broad substrate spectra. APH(2″) enzymes display differential preferences between ATP or GTP as the phosphate donor, with aminoglycoside 2″-phosphotransferase IVa (APH(2″)-IVa) being a member that utilizes both nucleotides at comparable efficiencies. We report here four crystal structures of APH(2″)-IVa, two of the wild type enzyme and two of single amino acid mutants, each in complex with either adenosine or guanosine. Together, these structures afford a detailed look at the nucleoside-binding site architecture for this enzyme and reveal key elements that confer dual nucleotide specificity, including a solvent network in the interior of the nucleoside-binding pocket and the conformation of an interdomain linker loop. Steady state kinetic studies, as well as sequence and structural comparisons with members of the APH(2″) subfamily and other aminoglycoside kinases, rationalize the different substrate preferences for these enzymes. Finally, despite poor overall sequence similarity and structural homology, analysis of the nucleoside-binding pocket of APH(2″)-IVa shows a striking resemblance to that of eukaryotic casein kinase 2 (CK2), which also exhibits dual nucleotide specificity. These results, in complement with the multitude of existing inhibitors against CK2, can serve as a structural basis for the design of nucleotide-competitive inhibitors against clinically relevant APH enzymes."

The ion permeation pathway of ASIC1a is defined by residues 426-450 in the second transmembrane (TM2) segment. The gate, formed by the intersection of the TM2 segments, localizes near the extracellular boundary of the plasma membrane. We explored the contribution to ion permeation and selectivity of residues in the TM2 segment of ASIC1a. Studies of accessibility with positively charged methanethiosulfonate reagents suggest that the permeation pathway in the open state constricts below the gate, restricting the passage to large ions. Substitution of residues in the intracellular vestibule at positions 437, 438, 443, or 446 significantly increased the permeability to K(+) versus Na(+). ASIC1a shows a selectivity sequence for alkali metals of Na(+)>Li(+)>K(+)≫Rb(+)>Cs(+). Alanine and cysteine substitutions at position 438 increased, to different extents, the relative permeability to Li(+), K(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+). For these mutants, ion permeation was not a function of the diameter of the nonhydrated ion, suggesting that Gly-438 encompasses an ion coordination site that is essential for ion selectivity. M437C and A443C mutants showed slightly increased permeability to K(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+), suggesting that substitutions at these positions influence ion discrimination by altering molecular sieving. Our results indicate that ion selectivity is accomplished by the contribution of multiple sites in the pore of ASIC1a."

RhoAV14 induced large increases in the contractile forces of single cells, with Rac1L61 and RhoDV26 having more moderate effects. The RhoAV14- and RhoDV26-induced forces showed similar spatial distributions and were accompanied by reduced or unaltered cell spreading. In contrast, the Rac1L61-induced force had different, scattered, force distributions that were linked to increased cell spreading. All three of these Rho GTPase activities caused a loss of thick stress fibers and focal adhesions and a more homogenous distribution of nanoscale adhesion-related particles over the ventral surface of the cells. Interestingly, only RhoAV14 increased the density of these particles. Our data suggest a Rac1-specific mode for cells to generate contractile forces.

https://openalex.org/W2118753217,"The epithelial brush border (BB) Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) accounts for most renal and intestinal Na+ absorption. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibits NHE3 activity under basal conditions in intact intestine, acting in the BB, but the mechanism is unclear. We now demonstrate that in both PS120 fibroblasts and polarized Caco-2BBe cells expressing NHE3, CaMKII inhibits basal NHE3 activity, because the CaMKII-specific inhibitors KN-93 and KN-62 stimulate NHE3 activity. This inhibition requires NHERF2. CaMKIIγ associates with NHE3 between aa 586 and 605 in the NHE3 C terminus in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with less association when Ca2+ is increased. CaMKII inhibits NHE3 by an effect on its turnover number, not changing surface expression. Back phosphorylation demonstrated that NHE3 is phosphorylated by CaMKII under basal conditions. This overall phosphorylation of NHE3 is not affected by the presence of NHERF2. Amino acids downstream of NHE3 aa 690 are required for CaMKII to inhibit basal NHE3 activity, and mutations of the three putative CaMKII phosphorylation sites downstream of aa 690 each prevented KN-93 stimulation of NHE3 activity. These studies demonstrate that CaMKIIγ is a novel NHE3-binding protein, and this association is reduced by elevated Ca2+. CaMKII inhibits basal NHE3 activity associated with phosphorylation of NHE3 by effects requiring aa downstream of NHE3 aa 690 and of the CaMKII-binding site on NHE3. CaMKII binding to and phosphorylation of the NHE3 C terminus are parts of the physiologic regulation of NHE3 that occurs in fibroblasts as well as in the BB of an intestinal Na+-absorptive cell.

https://openalex.org/W2012666925,"A gene from the thermophilic archaeon Thermoplasma volcanium encoding an L-threonine dehydrogenase (L-ThrDH) with a predicted amino acid sequence that was remarkably similar to the sequence of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GalE) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product was purified and characterized. The expressed enzyme was moderately thermostable, retaining more than 90% of its activity after incubation for 10 min at up to 70 °C. The catalytic residue was assessed using site-directed mutagenesis, and Tyr(137) was found to be essential for catalysis. To clarify the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism, four different crystal structures were determined using the molecular replacement method: L-ThrDH-NAD(+), L-ThrDH in complex with NAD(+) and pyruvate, Y137F mutant in complex with NAD(+) and L-threonine, and Y137F in complex with NAD(+) and L-3-hydroxynorvaline. Each monomer consisted of a Rossmann-fold domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain, and the fold of the catalytic domain showed notable similarity to that of the GalE-like L-ThrDH from the psychrophilic bacterium Flavobacterium frigidimaris KUC-1. The substrate binding model suggests that the reaction proceeds through abstraction of the β-hydroxyl hydrogen of L-threonine via direct proton transfer driven by Tyr(137). The factors contributing to the thermostability of T. volcanium L-ThrDH were analyzed by comparing its structure to that of F. frigidimaris L-ThrDH. This comparison showed that the presence of extensive inter- and intrasubunit ion pair networks are likely responsible for the thermostability of T. volcanium L-ThrDH. This is the first description of the molecular basis for the substrate recognition and thermostability of a GalE-like L-ThrDH."
https://openalex.org/W1986407689,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a caspase-independent death effector. Normally residing in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, AIF is released and translocated to the nucleus in response to proapoptotic stimuli. Nuclear AIF binds to DNA and induces chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, characteristics of apoptosis. Until now, it remained to be clarified how the mitochondrial-nuclear translocation of AIF is regulated. Here we report that steroid receptor coactivator-interacting protein (SIP) interacts directly with AIF in mitochondria and specifically inhibits caspase-independent and AIF-dependent apoptosis. Challenging cells with apoptotic stimuli leads to rapid degradation of SIP, and subsequently AIF is liberated from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus to induce apoptosis. Together, our data demonstrate that SIP is a novel regulator in caspase-independent and AIF-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2170719700,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a therapeutic target of anti-angiogenesis. Here, we report that a novel sulfated glycopeptide derived from Gekko swinhonis Guenther (GSPP), an anticancer drug in traditional Chinese medicine, inhibits tumor angiogenesis by targeting bFGF. GSPP significantly decreased the production of bFGF in hepatoma cells by suppressing early growth response-1. GSPP inhibited the release of bFGF from extracellular matrix by blocking heparanase enzymatic activity. Moreover, GSPP competitively inhibited bFGF binding to heparin/heparan sulfate via direct binding to bFGF. Importantly, GSPP abrogated the bFGF-stimulated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, whereas it had no inhibitory effect on endothelial cells in the absence of bFGF. Further study revealed that GSPP prevented bFGF-induced neovascularization and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. These results demonstrate that GSPP inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking bFGF production, release from the extracellular matrix, and binding to its low affinity receptor, heparin/heparan sulfate."
