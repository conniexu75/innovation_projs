This species possesses a high degree of tolerance for heat and has a greater capacity for temperature regulation than is reported for many of the desert rodents."

This enzymatic abnormality is known to be associated with an increased susceptibility to hæmolysis following ingestion of a number of drugs as well as of fava beans4,5, and appears to be transmitted as a sex-linked incompletely dominant trait6."

https://openalex.org/W2056442575,"CANINE distemper virus was cultivated in dog kidney tissue culture with a clear cytopathogenic effect1 and the 56th passage of the virus was tested in ferrets. Each of four non-immune ferrets were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 ml. of tissue culture fluid (105.5 TCID 50). Three non-immune ferrets were kept in the same laboratory as control animals and a further two in a neighbouring room in order to test for possible air-borne contamination from the inoculated animals. During an observation period of 25 days no animal showed any signs of disease. Blood was drawn from all the animals before the experiment and 17 days after inoculation. Tissue culture neutralization tests were performed with the sera, inactivated for half an hour at 56°C., against 300 TCID 50 of canine distemper virus after incubation at room temperature for one hour. The 50 per cent neutralizing titre of sera from inoculated animals was more than 10−2 (final dilution of serum) on day 17, while neutralizing antibodies were not found, either in the pre-inoculation sera or in the sera from the control animals on day 17."
https://openalex.org/W2000264265,"ABNORMALLY high rates of excretion of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid, a metabolite of both adrenaline and noradrenaline, are now well known to be associated with phaeochromocytoma and sympathoblastoma1–3. A convenient chromatographic technique enabling the substance to be estimated visually has been described elsewhere3. It seemed of interest to examine the possibility that the method would prove sufficiently sensitive to detect the increased secretions of the catecholamines to be anticipated in subjects exposed to stress."

https://openalex.org/W2058469912,"DURING experiments designed to explore possible short-term effects of ‘Busulphan’ (1 : 4-dimethane-sulphonyloxybutane or ‘Myleran’) on mouse ascites tumour cells, the drug was injected intraperitoneally in suspension in arachis oil or in an aqueous solution of compound powder of tragacanth into C+ male mice bearing the Landschutz ascites tumour. Neither the arachis oil suspension of ‘Busulphan’ nor the oil alone produced any inhibition of tumour cell growth. However, both the suspension of ‘Busulphan’ in compound powder of tragacanth solution and the tragacanth solution alone totally inhibited the tumour, as judged by absence of ascites tumour cells (and of solid tumour) seven days after injection of 25 mgm. of the compound in ½ c.c. water or saline. The same result was obtained after a lower dose of the powder (2.5 mgm. per mouse), in all cases injected one day after the inoculation of the tumour cells. A dose of 10 mgm. per mouse in a 3-day-old tumour prolonged longevity two-fold (longevity in days for treated: control tumour-bearing animals = 33 : 16). Of other tumours tested, total inhibition was also obtained at a dose of 2.5 mgm. per mouse seven days after inoculation of the Bp8 ascites tumour in C3H mice; but no effect was observed by intravenous or subcutaneous administration to C+ mice bearing a solid subcutaneous implant of the C+ leucaemia. (This arose in the Chester Beatty Research Institute as a spontaneous lymphocytic leucaemia in C+ mice.)"

https://openalex.org/W2085065474,"Neurohistological and neurophysiological studies have shown that the bilaterally represented Mauthner's cells in teleosts are related both structurally and functionally. The VIIIth nerve afferents, as well as the axoaxonal collaterals, display a distribution pattern which supports the concept of polar function of the neuron. Inasmuch as it is possible to alter the staining reaction of both the Mauthner's cells by unilateral stimulation of the entering VIIIth nerve roots, it is proposed that the synaptic endings serve principally as activators and that neuronal excitation or inhibition is determined by the chemical state of the dendrites, the cell body, and the axon hillock region."
https://openalex.org/W2015371093,"EXCESS vitamin A ingestion increases bleeding tendency1, depresses basal metabolism2 and increases excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids in urine of albino rats3. The Qo2 of liver slices of hypervitaminotic A rats is lower than that of control rats (Ray, Amal and Sadhu, D. P., unpublished observations), the weight of the thyroid is diminished and that of the adrenal increased2. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of hypometabolism induced in hypervitaminosis A, liver was studied for glycogen and fat contents and diaphragm as an index of glucose utilization in peripheral tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1967695213,"THE standard method of rendering visible radioactive compounds on paper chromatograms is to place the paper against a fast X-ray film for the requisite exposure period. The energies of β-particles emitted by tritium are so low (E max = 18 keV.) that the paper itself and the inevitable air gap between paper and film absorb most, if not all, of the radiation, reducing the sensitivity of the technique below useful limits. Wilson1 has described the preparation of scintillation autographs, in which the chromatographie strip, in close contact with a fast film, is immersed in a tank of scintillation fluid; but his method cannot be applied to the study of compounds, such as steroid hormones, which are soluble in toluene, the primary solvent of most scintillating fluids."

https://openalex.org/W2020169103,A naturally occurring anaplasma-antibody complex was detected by exposing erythrocytes of infected cattle to fluorescein-labeled bovine antiglobulin. This technique revealed not only the classical marginal bodies but also the initial Anaplasma bodies in the erythrocytes of acutely infected animals. Singly occurring initial bodies were observed in the erythrocytes of healthy carriers.

https://openalex.org/W1994378534,"CRAWHALL, Hawkins and Smyth1 have reported the preparation of tritiated antibody by biosynthesis. The report of successful labelling of lysozyme and ribonuclease by in vitro tritium exchange2 suggested that antibodies might also be amenable to tritiation by the latter method, which has the advantages of simplicity, larger yields, and usually results in products of sufficiently high specific activity to permit their use as reagents in radioautographic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2085785033,"IN the course of the studies concerning the interrelationship of leucine and norleucine1,2,3 it was observed that rats fed low protein diets supplemented with norleucine or norleucine and leucine were retarded. When the animals were killed and their livers analyzed for vitamin A content, it was found that these animals invariably stored a lower amount of vitamin A when compared with the control group of animals (Table 1). In view of the fact that the inhibition of growth was always associated with a depressed appetite, it was of considerable interest to determine whether the low liver vitamin A values were a consequence of the reduced food intake and thus low vitamin A consumption or whether they resulted from apparent ‘amino-acid imbalance’. In order to determine this a study was made in which the vitamin A intake was controlled."

https://openalex.org/W2051979849,"IN an investigation of the protection afforded by various sugars in the preservation of the viability of dried cultures, Hellier1 directed attention to the advantage of a sucrose/peptone mixture over either sucrose or peptone alone. In 1951, Fry and Greaves2 proposed their mist. desiccans, a serum/broth mixture containing 7.5 per cent glucose, and this has come into extensive use as a medium in which to dry a wide variety of organisms with a high retention of viability. In general, in the presence of either sugar or protein alone, the percentage survival is relatively poor; only in a mixture of the two in suitable proportions and in adequate concentration is a high degree of viability retained after drying and reconstitution. The underlying action of such mixtures has not hitherto been satisfactorily explained."
