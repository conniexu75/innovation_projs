https://openalex.org/W2114650648,"A new class of ultra-long-duration (more than 10,000 seconds) γ-ray bursts has recently been suggested. They may originate in the explosion of stars with much larger radii than those producing normal long-duration γ-ray bursts or in the tidal disruption of a star. No clear supernova has yet been associated with an ultra-long-duration γ-ray burst. Here we report that a supernova (SN 2011kl) was associated with the ultra-long-duration γ-ray burst GRB 111209A, at a redshift z of 0.677. This supernova is more than three times more luminous than type Ic supernovae associated with long-duration γ-ray bursts, and its spectrum is distinctly different. The slope of the continuum resembles those of super-luminous supernovae, but extends further down into the rest-frame ultraviolet implying a low metal content. The light curve evolves much more rapidly than those of super-luminous supernovae. This combination of high luminosity and low metal-line opacity cannot be reconciled with typical type Ic supernovae, but can be reproduced by a model where extra energy is injected by a strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar), which has also been proposed as the explanation for super-luminous supernovae."

However, no direct data from randomized trials exists to support these indirect observations. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible relationship of aerobic exercise dose on cognition. Underactive or sedentary participants without cognitive impairment were randomized to one of four groups: no-change control, 75, 150, and 225 minutes per week of moderate-intensity semi-supervised aerobic exercise for 26-weeks in a community setting. Cognitive outcomes were latent residual scores derived from a battery of 16 cognitive tests: Verbal Memory, Visuospatial Processing, Simple Attention, Set Maintenance and Shifting, and Reasoning. Other outcome measures were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and measures of function functional health. In intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses (n = 101), cardiorespiratory fitness increased and perceived disability decreased in a dose-dependent manner across the 4 groups. No other exercise-related effects were observed in ITT analyses. Analyses restricted to individuals who exercised per-protocol (n = 77) demonstrated that Simple Attention improved equivalently across all exercise groups compared to controls and a dose-response relationship was present for Visuospatial Processing. A clear dose-response relationship exists between exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness. Cognitive benefits were apparent at low doses with possible increased benefits in visuospatial function at higher doses but only in those who adhered to the exercise protocol. An individual’s cardiorespiratory fitness response was a better predictor of cognitive gains than exercise dose (i.e., duration) and thus maximizing an individual’s cardiorespiratory fitness may be an important therapeutic target for achieving cognitive benefits.

https://openalex.org/W853016887,"Histamine is a mediator of allergic inflammation released mainly from mast cells. Although histamine strongly increases vascular permeability, its precise mechanism under in vivo situation remains unknown. We here attempted to reveal how histamine induces vascular hyperpermeability focusing on the key regulators of vascular permeability, blood flow and endothelial barrier. Degranulation of mast cells by antigen-stimulation or histamine treatment induced vascular hyperpermeability and tissue swelling in mouse ears. These were abolished by histamine H1 receptor antagonism. Intravital imaging showed that histamine dilated vasculature, increased blood flow, while it induced hyperpermeability in venula. Whole-mount staining showed that histamine disrupted endothelial barrier formation of venula indicated by changes in vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) localization at endothelial cell junction. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) by L-NAME or vasoconstriction by phenylephrine strongly inhibited the histamine-induced blood flow increase and hyperpermeability without changing the VE-cadherin localization. In vitro, measurements of trans-endothelial electrical resistance of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) showed that histamine disrupted endothelial barrier. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), NOS attenuated the histamine-induced barrier disruption. These observations suggested that histamine increases vascular permeability mainly by nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vascular dilation and subsequent blood flow increase and maybe partially by PKC/ROCK/NO-dependent endothelial barrier disruption."
https://openalex.org/W807920197,"Tamoxifen resistance is often observed in the majority of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers and it remains as a serious clinical problem in breast cancer management. Increased aerobic glycolysis has been proposed as one of the mechanisms for acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer cells such as adriamycin. Herein, we report that the glycolysis rates in LCC2 and LCC9--tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer cell lines derived from MCF7--are higher than those in MCF7S, which is the parent MCF7 subline. Inhibition of key glycolytic enzyme such as hexokinase-2 resulted in cell growth retardation at higher degree in LCC2 and LCC9 than that in MCF7S. This implies that increased aerobic glycolysis even under O2-rich conditions, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, is closely associated with tamoxifen resistance. We found that HIF-1α is activated via an Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in LCC2 and LCC9 cells without hypoxic condition. Importantly, specific inhibition of hexokinase-2 suppressed the activity of Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α axis in LCC2 and LCC9 cells. In addition, the phosphorylated AMPK which is a negative regulator of mTOR was decreased in LCC2 and LCC9 cells compared to MCF7S. Interestingly, either the inhibition of mTOR activity or increase in AMPK activity induced a reduction in lactate accumulation and cell survival in the LCC2 and LCC9 cells. Taken together, our data provide evidence that development of tamoxifen resistance may be driven by HIF-1α hyperactivation via modulation of Akt/mTOR and/or AMPK signaling pathways. Therefore, we suggest that the HIF-1α hyperactivation is a critical marker of increased aerobic glycolysis in accordance with tamoxifen resistance and thus restoration of aerobic glycolysis may be novel therapeutic target for treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1193047888,"FFAR1/GPR40 is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor (7TMR) expressed in pancreatic β cells and activated by FFAs. Pharmacological activation of GPR40 is a strategy under consideration to increase insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes. GPR40 is known to signal predominantly via the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq/11. However, 7TMRs can also activate functionally distinct G protein-independent signaling via β-arrestins. Further, G protein- and β-arrestin-based signaling can be differentially modulated by different ligands, thus eliciting ligand-specific responses (“biased agonism”). Whether GPR40 engages β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms and is subject to biased agonism is unknown. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors for real-time monitoring of cell signaling in living cells, we detected a ligand-induced GPR40-β-arrestin interaction, with the synthetic GPR40 agonist TAK-875 being more effective than palmitate or oleate in recruiting β-arrestins 1 and 2. Conversely, TAK-875 acted as a partial agonist of Gq/11-dependent GPR40 signaling relative to both FFAs. Pharmacological blockade of Gq activity decreased FFA-induced insulin secretion. In contrast, knockdown or genetic ablation of β-arrestin 2 in an insulin-secreting cell line and mouse pancreatic islets, respectively, uniquely attenuated the insulinotropic activity of TAK-875, thus providing functional validation of the biosensor data. Collectively, these data reveal that in addition to coupling to Gq/11, GPR40 is functionally linked to a β-arrestin 2-mediated insulinotropic signaling axis. These observations expose previously unrecognized complexity for GPR40 signal transduction and may guide the development of biased agonists showing improved clinical profile in type 2 diabetes.

GPR40 is predominately expressed in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells and mediates part of the acute stimulatory effects of various FFAs on insulin secretion. However, GPR40 does not mediate the long-term lipotoxic effects of FFAs on β-cell function (3Kebede M. Alquier T. Latour M.G. Semache M. Tremblay C. Poitout V.

Given that FFAs stimulate insulin secretion only when glucose levels are elevated, GPR40 could be targeted to enhance insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes (T2D) without the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Accordingly, GPR40 is generating substantial interest as a therapeutic target to enhance insulin secretion in T2D (5Negoro N. Sasaki S. Mikami S. Ito M. Suzuki M. Tsujihata Y. Ito R. Harada A.

However, despite significant investment in the development of selective GPR40 agonists, our understanding of the pharmacobiology of GPR40 remains incomplete (8Mancini A.D. Poitout V.

To date, the predominant view holds that GPR40 signals primarily via the heterotrimeric G protein Gq/11 and that its biological effects are mediated by downstream second messenger molecules, namely diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as well as Ca2+ mobilization (9Ferdaoussi M.

Commun. 2005; 335: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, coupling of GPR40 to the Gs/PKA/cAMP pathway has also been reported (11Feng D.D. Luo Z. Roh S.G. Hernandez M.

It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that 7TMRs are more than mere bimodal molecular switches that signal via linear G protein-dependent transduction pathways. Indeed, 7TMRs can also engage functionally distinct, G protein-independent signaling mechanisms via the multifunctional adapter proteins β-arrestins 1 and 2. Once believed to solely mediate receptor desensitization and internalization, β-arrestins are now recognized as key signaling hubs acting downstream of 7TMRs. According to the concept of “biased agonism,” binding of structurally/chemically different ligands to a given 7TMR can stabilize unique receptor conformations, each differentially modulating β-arrestin- and G protein-dependent signaling (13Kenakin T.

Restructuring G-protein-coupled receptor activation.Cell. 2012; 151: 14-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As a result, different ligands may impart distinct signaling and biological attributes to a given receptor. By selectively engaging only part of a receptor's potential intracellular partners and signaling cascades, biased ligands may provide refined pharmacological specificity and therapeutic efficacy with fewer side effects. Recently, Qian et al. (16Qian J. Wu C. Chen X. Li X. Ying G. Jin L. Ma Q. Li G. Shi Y. Zhang G. Zhou N. Differential requirements of arrestin-3 and clathrin for ligand-dependent and -independent internalization of human G protein-coupled receptor 40.Cell. Signal. 2014; 26: 2412-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that β-arrestin 2 is implicated in linoleate-induced internalization of GPR40. Whether β-arrestin 1 and/or 2 partake in GPR40-dependent signaling and whether this receptor is subject to biased agonism, however, is unknown. This question is of particular relevance to the pharmacotherapy of T2D as several synthetic agonists of GPR40 are under clinical development. Among them, TAK-875 demonstrated encouraging therapeutic potential in Phase I and II clinical trials (17Burant C.F. Viswanathan P. Marcinak J. Cao C. Vakilynejad M. Xie B. Leifke E.

GPR40 agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: life after “TAKing” a hit.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2015; 17: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the important implications of biased agonism at this emerging drug target, we aimed to ascertain (i) whether GPR40 engages β-arrestin-dependent signaling and (ii) whether Gq/11- and β-arrestin-mediated signaling can be differentially modulated by distinct ligands. Our results provide the first account of a functionally relevant, ligand-biased interaction between β-arrestin 2 and GPR40 that is involved in regulating the insulinotropic activity of GPR40. DMEM was from MultiCell Technologies, whereas FBS and RPMI 1640 were from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). TAK-875 was purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX); palmitate and oleate were obtained from Sigma. Murine GPR40 cDNA was purchased from OriGene (pCMV6-mGPR40; SKU MC212962). The GPR40-GFP10 fusion construct was created by deleting the GPR40 stop codon in pCMV6-mGPR40 with subsequent downstream insertion of linker-GFP10 cDNA (all performed by GenScript). HEK-293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. INS832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 11 mm glucose, 10% FBS, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK-293T cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. The following day, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of cDNA encoding the Ca2+ biosensor obelin and 100 ng of either pcDNA3.1 or GPR40 cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight (18 h) incubation, transfected HEK-293T cells were passed and plated at ∼1.0 × 105 cells/well in poly-l-ornithine-coated 96-well white-walled microtiter plates. The following day, HEK-293T cells were washed twice with 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 0.2% glucose (pH 7.4) and then incubated for 2–3 h with 1 μm coelenterazine CP (Biotium) in the dark. Agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ flux is reflected by the magnitude of the bioluminescent signal emitted by the obelin biosensor, which was recorded before and every 0.3 s after agonist injection in the SpectraMax L Microplate reader (Molecular Devices) for a total of 62.5 s. The indicated concentrations of palmitate, oleate, and TAK-875 were precomplexed to a fixed concentration (20 μm final) of fatty acid-free BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. Control wells were stimulated with vehicle (20 μm fatty acid-free BSA and 0.1% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (TAK-875 solvent) or 0.17% v/v ethanol (palmitate solvent)). The area under the resulting curves was calculated using Prism GraphPad 6.0 as a measure of total Ca2+ flux; area under the resulting curves values were used to construct dose curves. Data were expressed as a percentage versus the maximal response, which was consistently obtained with 80 μm palmitate. HEK-293T cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. The following day, the three subunits of the multimolecular Gq activation biosensor (20 ng each of RLucII-Gαq and Gβ1 and 100 ng of GFP10-tagged Gγ1) and 100 ng of pcDNA3.1 or GPR40 cDNA were transfected using 25-kDa linear PEI (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) (20Longo P.A. Kavran J.M. Kim M.S. Leahy D.J. Transient mammalian cell transfection with polyethylenimine (PEI).Methods Enzymol. 2013; 529: 227-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) at a 3:1 μl of PEI/μg of DNA ratio. The total amount of DNA transfected in each well was consistently adjusted to 2 μg with salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, HEK-293T cells were washed once with Tyrode's buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 12 mm NaHCO3, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), detached, and plated in poly-l-ornithine-coated 96-well white-walled plates (∼0.2 × 106 cells/well). Cells were allowed to adhere for 3 h at 37 °C, after which time vehicle or BSA-complexed GPR40 agonists (as for obelin Ca2+ flux assay above) were added to cells for 5 min at 37 °C. Coelenterazine 400a (Biotium) was then added to a final concentration of 5 μm in Tyrode's buffer for 5 min. Readings were subsequently collected with a Mithras LB 940 multidetector plate reader (Berthold Technologies), allowing the sequential integration of the signals detected at 410 ± 40 nm (RLucII light emission) and 515 ± 15 nm (GFP10 light emission). The bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal was calculated as the ratio of the GFP10 light emission to RLucII light emission. Values are expressed as net BRET by first subtracting vehicle-induced BRET from ligand-induced BRET (i.e. ΔBRET) and then subtracting the ΔBRET values calculated for cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 from the ΔBRET values obtained in cells transfected with GPR40. HEK-293T cells were seeded as for obelin and Gq activity biosensor experiments. Cells were co-transfected (using 25-kDa linear PEI) with 12.5 ng of either β-arrestin 1-RLucII or β-arrestin 2-RLucII and 500 ng of pcDNA3.1 or GPR40-GFP10 cDNA. The total amount of DNA transfected in each well was always adjusted to 2 μg. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with Tyrode's buffer, detached, and plated in poly-l-ornithine-coated 96-well microplates (∼0.2 × 106 cells/well). Cells were allowed to adhere for 3 h at 37 °C. Total fluorescence was subsequently recorded with a FlexStation (Molecular Devices; excitation filter at 400 nm; emission filter at 510 nm) to ensure equal GPR40-GFP10 expression across different wells and plates. For experiments in which Gq activity was inhibited, cells were preincubated with 100 nm UBO-QIC. Vehicle or BSA-complexed GPR40 agonists were then added to all wells, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 10 min. Thereafter, coelenterazine 400a (Biotium) was added to each well at a final concentration of 2.5 μm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark for an additional 5 min, after which time ligand-induced BRET was recorded with the Mithras LB940 multimode microplate reader (Berthold Technologies) equipped with the BRET400-GFP2/10-filter set (acceptor at 515 ± 20-nm filter and donor at 400 ± 70-nm filter). Values are expressed as net BRET by first subtracting vehicle-induced BRET from ligand-induced BRET (i.e. ΔBRET) and then subtracting the ΔBRET values calculated for cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 and either RLucII-linked β-arrestin 1 or RLucII-linked β-arrestin 2 from the ΔBRET values obtained in cells co-transfected with GPR40-GFP10 and the β-arrestin biosensors. INS832/13 (∼6 × 106) cells were electroporated with 350 pmol of either non-targeting (negative control) or anti-β-arrestin 2 siRNAs via nucleofection (Amaxa® Nucleofector®) and subsequently seeded in 24-well culture plates at ∼0.4 × 106 cells/well (for insulin secretion) and in 12-well plates at 1.2 × 106 cells/well (for protein extraction). Medium was replaced the day following nucleofection. Protein extraction and immunoblotting were performed as described (21Hagman D.K. Hays L.B. Parazzoli S.D. Poitout V.

Membranes were subsequently stripped using Re-Blot Plus stripping solution (Millipore) and reprobed for α-tubulin (Abcam). Electroporated cells were seeded as described above. For experiments with UBO-QIC, cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates at ∼0.25 × 106 cells/well. At ∼48 h after seeding, electroporated cells and those used in UBO-QIC experiments were starved for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 1 mm glucose, followed by a wash and 1-h incubation in KRB supplemented with 1 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA. For UBO-QIC experiments, 100 nm of the inhibitor was added 30 min into the 1-h KRB incubation. Following the aforementioned incubations, cells were treated with the reagents indicated in the text in KRB and insulin secretion was assayed following a 1-h static incubation. Insulin content was extracted with acid-alcohol. Secreted and intracellular insulin levels were measured using a rat insulin RIA kit (Millipore, St. Charles, MO). Each experimental condition was performed in triplicate. Pancreatic islets were isolated from whole-body β-arrestin 2−/− mice or WT littermates as described in Ref. 22Ravier M.A. Leduc M. Richard J.

The following day, insulin secretion was assessed in 1-h static incubations using batches of 10 islets in bicarbonate KRB supplemented with 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose with or without TAK-875 or palmitate. Both TAK-875 and palmitate were complexed for 1 h at 37 °C with fatty acid-free BSA to a final molar ratio of 1:5 as described previously (9Ferdaoussi M. Bergeron V. Zarrouki B. Kolic J. Cantley J.

Control conditions contained an equal amount of BSA and vehicle (50% (v/v) ethanol). Secreted and intracellular insulin levels were measured using a rat insulin RIA kit (Millipore). Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software) and are presented as mean ± S.E. Dose-response curves were fitted using the log(agonist) versus response function (four parameters).

Recent work by Qian et al. (16Qian J. Wu C. Chen X. Li X. Ying G. Jin L. Ma Q. Li G. Shi Y. Zhang G. Zhou N. Differential requirements of arrestin-3 and clathrin for ligand-dependent and -independent internalization of human G protein-coupled receptor 40.Cell. Signal. 2014; 26: 2412-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that β-arrestin 2 is recruited to GPR40 in response to the FFA linoleate. However, it remains unknown whether different GPR40 ligands exhibit qualitative differences in the β-arrestin isoform they recruit and whether such ligands are equi-efficacious in recruiting β-arrestins to the receptor. Thus, as a first step in establishing the existence of possible biased agonism at GPR40, we compared the potencies and efficacies of three distinct GPR40 agonists for β-arrestin 1 and 2 recruitment: the saturated and monounsaturated FFAs palmitate (PA; (C16:0)) and oleate (OA: (C18:1)), respectively, as well as the synthetic GPR40 agonist TAK-875. PA and OA were selected as the two most abundant circulating FAs in humans (24Hagenfeldt L. Wahren J. Pernow B. Räf L. Uptake of individual free fatty acids by skeletal muscle and liver in man.J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The choice of TAK-875 was justified by its high selectivity for GPR40 versus other fatty acid receptors (5Negoro N. Sasaki S. Mikami S. Ito M. Suzuki M. Tsujihata Y. Ito R. Harada A. Takeuchi K. Suzuki N. Miyazaki J. Santou T. Odani T. Kanzaki N. Funami M. Tanaka T. Kogame A. Matsunaga S. Yasuma T. Momose Y. Discovery of TAK-875: a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable GPR40 agonist.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), its lack of GPR40-independent insulinotropic action (25Yabuki C. Komatsu H. Tsujihata Y. Maeda R. Ito R. Matsuda-Nagasumi K. Sakuma K. Miyawaki K. Kikuchi N. Takeuchi K. Habata Y. Mori M. A novel antidiabetic drug, fasiglifam/TAK-875, acts as an ago-allosteric modulator of FFAR1.PLoS One. 2013; 8e76280Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and its overall structural dissimilarity to endogenous GPR40 ligands. Ligand-induced engagement of each β-arrestin by GFP10-tagged GPR40 was determined using a BRET-based assay that enables real-time monitoring of protein-protein interactions in living cells. These experiments were performed in HEK-293T cells, which lack endogenous GPR40 expression (26Atwood B.K. Lopez J. Wager-Miller J. Mackie K. Straiker A. Expression of G protein-coupled receptors and related proteins in HEK293, AtT20, BV2, and N18 cell lines as revealed by microarray analysis.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). PA and OA (conjugated to a fixed concentration of 20 μm BSA) dose-dependently promoted the recruitment of β-arrestins 1 and 2 to GPR40 (Fig. 1, A and B) with EC50 values in the low μm range (β-arrestin 1: 43.7 μm for PA; 51.7 μm for OA; β-arrestin 2: 42.4 μm for PA; 58.4 μm for OA). The synthetic GPR40 ligand TAK-875 (conjugated to a fixed concentration of 20 μm BSA) was much more potent (EC50: 64.1 nm for β-arrestin 1; 54.7 nm for β-arrestin 2) and efficacious in promoting β-arrestin recruitment to GPR40. At its maximally effective concentration of 100 μm, the efficacy of PA for β-arrestin 1 and 2 recruitment was 38 ± 4 and 52 ± 7%, respectively, of that of 10 μm TAK-875. Similarly, the maximal effect of OA (150 μm) on β-arrestin 1 and 2 was 51 ± 4 and 55 ± 7%, respectively, of that of 10 μm TAK-875. These findings establish that relative to the synthetic GPR40 agonist TAK-875, the two endogenous GPR40 agonists PA and OA behave as partial agonists for the recruitment of β-arrestins. Having established that TAK-875 is more efficacious than either PA or OA at promoting β-arrestin 1 and 2 coupling to GPR40, we next determined whether these ligands exhibit similar relative efficacies for activation of heterotrimeric G protein (Gq/11)-dependent signaling. We used a BRET-based biosensor to directly monitor agonist-induced activation of Gq. The Gq activation biosensor consists of an RLucII-tagged Gαq subunit, an untagged Gβ1 subunit, and a GFP10-tagged Gγ1 subunit and monitors the physical separation of Gαq from Gβ/γ subunits upon agonist stimulation and receptor activation. Consequently, G protein activation results in a decreased BRET signal whose magnitude is tightly correlated to ligand efficacy (27Denis C. Saulière A. Galandrin S. Sénard J.M. Galés C. Probing heterotrimeric G protein activation: applications to biased ligands.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2012; 18: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Galés C. Van Durm J.J. Schaak S.

Biol. 2006; 13: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Gq activation was assayed in response to increasing concentrations of BSA-conjugated PA, OA, or TAK-875. As shown in Fig. 2A, TAK-875 weakly activated Gq with an apparent EC50 around 60 nm. Gq activation by PA or OA displayed no sign of saturation up to the highest testable concentrations (100 μm for PA and 150 μm for OA), due to insolubility (Fig. 2A). The maximal response produced by TAK-875 was 70 ± 4% of that observed with 100 μm PA and 58 ± 10% of that observed for 150 μm OA, thus demonstrating that relative to FFAs, TAK-875 is a partial agonist of GPR40-coupled Gq/11 activity. Analysis of downstream Ca2+ levels using the Ca2+ biosensor obelin corroborated the Gq activation data by showing that TAK-875 was 57 ± 7 and 66 ± 9% as effective as 80 μm PA and 100 μm OA, respectively, in increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2B). Examination of [Ca2+]i mobilization kinetics revealed that at maximally effective concentrations, all three ligands quickly (within 2 s after stimulation) triggered intracellular Ca2+ flux and elicited a maximal response at ∼10 s after stimulation (Fig. 2B, inset). These data establish that relative to the FFAs PA and OA, TAK-875 is a partial agonist of the Gq/Ca2+ signaling axis downstream of GPR40 and behaves as a β-arrestin-biased ligand. Conversely, the endogenous GPR40 ligands PA and OA act as Gq/11-biased GPR40 ligands by favoring Gq/11 activation over β-arrestin recruitment. It is now recognized that β-arrestin recruitment to 7TMRs can occur independently of G protein coupling (29Violin J.D.

The genome of S. brachiata has two paralogs of the SbASR-1 gene (2549 bp), which is comprised of a single intron of 1611 bp, the largest intron of the abscisic acid stress ripening [ASR] gene family yet reported. In silico analysis of the 843-bp putative promoter revealed the presence of ABA, biotic stress, dehydration, phytohormone, salinity, and sugar responsive cis-regulatory motifs. The SbASR-1 protein belongs to Group 7 LEA protein family with different amino acid composition compared to their glycophytic homologs. Bipartite Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) was found on the C-terminal end of protein and localization study confirmed that SbASR-1 is a nuclear protein. Furthermore, transgenic groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) plants over-expressing the SbASR-1 gene constitutively showed enhanced salinity and drought stress tolerance in the T1 generation. Leaves of transgenic lines exhibited higher chlorophyll and relative water contents and lower electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde content, proline, sugars, and starch accumulation under stress treatments than wild-type (Wt) plants. Also, lower accumulation of H2O2 and O2.- radicals was detected in transgenic lines compared to Wt plants under stress conditions. Transcript expression of APX (ascorbate peroxidase) and CAT (catalase) genes were higher in Wt plants, whereas the SOD (superoxide dismutase) transcripts were higher in transgenic lines under stress. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that the SbASR-1 protein binds at the consensus sequence (C/G/A)(G/T)CC(C/G)(C/G/A)(A/T). Based on results of the present study, it may be concluded that SbASR-1 enhances the salinity and drought stress tolerance in transgenic groundnut by functioning as a LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) protein and a transcription factor."

Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutations define a small subgroup of GBM patients with favourable prognosis. However, it remains controversial whether long-term survivors (LTS) are found among those IDH1/2 mutated patients.We retrospectively analyzed 207 GBM patients followed at Lariboisière Hospital (Paris) between 2005 and 2010. Clinical parameters were obtained from medical records. Mutations of IDH1/2 were analyzed in these patients, by immunohistochemistry for the R132H mutation of IDH1 and by high-resolution melting-curve analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing for IDH1 and IDH2 exon 4 mutations. Mutation rates in LTS and non-LTS groups were compared by Chi square Pearson test.Seventeen patients with survival >3 years were identified (8.2% of the total series). The median overall survival in long-term survivors was 4.6 years. Subgroup analysis found that the median age at diagnosis was significantly higher for non long-term survivors (non-LTS) compared to LTS (60 versus 51 years, p <0.03). The difference in the rate of IDH mutation between non-LTS and LTS was statistically not significant (1.16% versus 5.9%, p = 0.144). Among LTS, 10 out of 16 tumors presented a methylation of MGMT promoter.This study confirms that long-term survival in GBM patients is if at all only weakly correlated to IDH-mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1859263414,"The formation, evolution and death of massive stars release large quantities of energy and momentum into the gas surrounding the sites of star formation. This process, generically termed 'feedback', inhibits further star formation either by removing gas from the galaxy, or by heating it to temperatures that are too high to form new stars. Observations reveal feedback in the form of galactic-scale outflows of gas in galaxies with high rates of star formation, especially in the early Universe. Feedback in faint, low-mass galaxies probably facilitated the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies when the Universe was about 500 million years old, so that the hydrogen between galaxies changed from neutral to ionized--the last major phase transition in the Universe."

Sensitivity and specificity for fetal aneuploidies, trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and monosomy X, were estimated using published data and modeling of both first- and second trimester screening. Costs were assigned for each prenatal test component and for an affected birth. The overall cost to the healthcare system considered screening costs, the number of aneuploid cases detected, invasive procedures performed, procedure-related euploid losses, and affected pregnancies averted. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of variation in parameters. Costs were reported in 2014 US Dollars.Replacing conventional screening with NIPT would reduce healthcare costs if it can be provided for $744 or less in the general pregnancy population. The most influential variables were timing of screening entry, screening costs, and pregnancy termination rates. Of the 13,176 affected pregnancies undergoing screening, NIPT detected 96.5% (12,717/13,176) of cases, compared with 85.9% (11,314/13,176) by conventional approaches. NIPT reduced invasive procedures by 60.0%, with NIPT and conventional methods resulting in 24,596 and 61,430 invasive procedures, respectively. The number of procedure-related euploid fetal losses was reduced by 73.5% (194/264) in the general screening population.Based on our analysis, universal application of NIPT would increase fetal aneuploidy detection rates and can be economically justified. Offering this testing to all pregnant women is associated with substantial prenatal healthcare benefits."
https://openalex.org/W1512557505,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia in the Caucasian population, is a multisystemic disease caused by a significant decrease in the frataxin level. To identify genes capable of modifying the severity of the symptoms of frataxin depletion, we performed a candidate genetic screen in a Drosophila RNAi-based model of FRDA. We found that genetic reduction in TOR Complex 1 (TORC1) signalling improves the impaired motor performance phenotype of FRDA model flies. Pharmacologic inhibition of TORC1 signalling by rapamycin also restored this phenotype and increased the lifespan and ATP levels. Furthermore, rapamycin reduced the altered levels of malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals and total glutathione of the model flies. The rapamycin-mediated protection against oxidative stress is due in part to an increase in the transcription of antioxidant genes mediated by cap-n-collar (Drosophila ortholog of Nrf2). Our results suggest that autophagy is indeed necessary for the protective effect of rapamycin in hyperoxia. Rapamycin increased the survival and aconitase activity of model flies subjected to high oxidative insult, and this improvement was abolished by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. These results point to the TORC1 pathway as a new potential therapeutic target for FRDA and as a guide to finding new promising molecules for disease treatment."

The purpose of the present study was to develop elastic liposomes for naringenin topical application. Naringenin-loaded elastic liposomes containing different amounts of Tween 80 and cholesterol were prepared. The physicochemical properties including vesicle size, surface charge, encapsulation efficiency, and permeability capacity were determined to evaluate the effect of components. The stability of formulation and skin irritation caused by drug-loaded elastic liposomes were also evaluated for assessment of the clinical utility of elastic liposomes. Saturated aqueous solution of naringenin and naringenin dissolved in 10% Tween 80 solution (5 mg/mL) were used as the control group. The result showed that in using elastic liposomes as carrier, the deposition amounts in the skin of naringenin were significantly increased about 7.3~11.8-fold and 1.2~1.9-fold respectively, when compared with the saturated aqueous solution and Tween 80 solution-treated groups. The level of drug was more than 98.89±3.90% after 3 months of storage at 4℃. In a skin irritation test, the result showed experimental formulation exhibit considerably less irritating than the positive control (paraformaldehyde-treated) group, suggesting its potential therapeutic application."
https://openalex.org/W1511561107,"In medical and industrial applications of computed tomography (CT) imaging, limited by the scanning environment and the risk of excessive X-ray radiation exposure imposed to the patients, reconstructing high quality CT images from limited projection data has become a hot topic. X-ray imaging in limited scanning angular range is an effective imaging modality to reduce the radiation dose to the patients. As the projection data available in this modality are incomplete, limited-angle CT image reconstruction is actually an ill-posed inverse problem. To solve the problem, image reconstructed by conventional filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm frequently results in conspicuous streak artifacts and gradual changed artifacts nearby edges. Image reconstruction based on total variation minimization (TVM) can significantly reduce streak artifacts in few-view CT, but it suffers from the gradual changed artifacts nearby edges in limited-angle CT. To suppress this kind of artifacts, we develop an image reconstruction algorithm based on ℓ0 gradient minimization for limited-angle CT in this paper. The ℓ0-norm of the image gradient is taken as the regularization function in the framework of developed reconstruction model. We transformed the optimization problem into a few optimization sub-problems and then, solved these sub-problems in the manner of alternating iteration. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the efficiency and the feasibility of the developed algorithm. From the statistical analysis results of the performance evaluations peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized root mean square distance (NRMSD), it shows that there are significant statistical differences between different algorithms from different scanning angular ranges (p<0.0001). From the experimental results, it also indicates that the developed algorithm outperforms classical reconstruction algorithms in suppressing the streak artifacts and the gradual changed artifacts nearby edges simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1945799687,"Rhipicephalus microplus, better known as the Asiatic cattle tick, is a largely invasive ectoparasite of great economic importance due to the negative effect it has on agricultural livestock on a global scale, particularly cattle. Tick-borne diseases (babesiosis and anaplasmosis) transmitted by R. microplus are alarming as they decrease the quality of livestock health and production. In sub-Saharan Africa, cattle represent a major source of meat and milk, but this region of the world is severely affected by the Rhipicephalus microplus tick. The principal method for tick control is the use of chemical acaricides, notably amitraz, which was implemented in the 1990's after resistance to other acaricides surfaced. However, the efficiency of chemical control is hindered by an increase in the frequency of mutant resistance alleles to amitraz in tick populations. Presently, the only way to assess amitraz resistance is by means of larval packet tests, but this technique is time-consuming and not particularly cost effective. The main aims of this study were three-fold. First, we attempted to correlate two known SNPs in the octopamine/tyramine (OCT/Tyr) receptor with amitraz resistance in South African field samples of R. microplus. Second, we calculated gametic disequilibrium for these SNPs to determine whether they are randomly associated. Lastly, we conducted a study to assess the evolutionary effects of recombination within the OCT/Tyr receptor. Our results confirmed that the two SNPs are associated with amitraz resistance in the South African tick strain, and that they are in gametic disequilibrium. Additionally, recombination was detected in the OCT/Tyr receptor generating two recombinant haplotypes. These results are of concern to farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, and the emergence of amitraz resistance should be closely monitored in future. Therefore, we present a quick and affordable RFLP based diagnostic technique to assess amitraz resistance in field samples of R. microplus."

The aim of this study, on nine healthy subjects, was to compare the cortical network activation profile and pain ratings during NMES of the right forearm wrist extensor muscles at increasing current intensities up to and slightly over the individual maximal tolerated intensity (MTI), and with reference to voluntary (VOL) wrist extension movements. By exploiting the capability of the multi-channel time domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy technique to relate depth information to the photon time-of-flight, the cortical and superficial oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin concentrations were estimated. The O2Hb and HHb maps obtained using the General Linear Model (NIRS-SPM) analysis method, showed that the VOL and NMES-evoked movements significantly increased activation (i.e., increase in O2Hb and corresponding decrease in HHb) in the cortical layer of the contralateral sensorimotor network (SMC, PMC/SMA, and S2). However, the level and area of contralateral sensorimotor network (including PFC) activation was significantly greater for NMES than VOL. Furthermore, there was greater bilateral sensorimotor network activation with the high NMES current intensities which corresponded with increased pain ratings. In conclusion, our findings suggest that greater bilateral sensorimotor network activation profile with high NMES current intensities could be in part attributable to increased attentional/pain processing and to increased bilateral sensorimotor integration in these cortical regions."

In addition, Danish and Norwegian immigrant women follow the national recommendations for attendance at cervical screening to much lesser extent than Swedish-born women. The aim of this study was to explore how Danish and Norwegian immigrant women in Sweden reason about attending cervical screening, focusing on women's perceptions as to why they and their compatriots do not attend.Eight focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with Danish and Norwegian immigrant women living in Stockholm. The women were between 26 and 66 years of age at the time of the FGDs, and were aged between <1 and 48 years old when they immigrated to Sweden. A FGD guide was used, which included questions related to cervical screening, and obstacles and motivators to attend cervical screening. The FGDs were tape recorded and transcribed, and the results analysed according to the principles of qualitative content analysis.The main theme was ""Women have a comprehensive rationale for postponing cervical screening, yet do not view themselves as non-attenders"". Investigation of women's rationale for non-attendance after being invited to cervical screening revealed some complex reasons related to immigration itself, including competing needs, organisational and structural factors and differences in mentality, but also reasons stemming from other factors. Postponing attendance at cervical screening was the category that linked all these factors as the reasons to why women did not attend to cervical screening according to the recommendations of the authorities.The rationale used to postpone cervical screening, in combination with the fact that women do not consider themselves to be non-attenders, indicates that they have not actively taken a stance against cervical screening, and reveals an opportunity to motivate these women to attend."

In initial studies in primary neuroglial cultures, rAAV-mediated expression of IFN-γ did not alter endogenous τ production or paired helical filament τ phosphorylation. Next, we tested the effect of rAAV-mediated expression of IFN-γ in the brains of 2 mouse models of tauopathy: JNPL3 and rTg4510. In both models, IFN-γ increased 1) signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 levels and gliosis, and 2) hyperphosphorylation and conformational alterations of soluble τ compared with control cohorts. However, sarkosyl-insoluble phosphorylated τ levels and ubiquitin staining were unaltered in the IFN-γ cohorts. Notably, IFN-γ-induced τ hyperphosphorylation was associated with release of the inhibitory effect of glycogen synthase kinase 3β function by decreasing Ser9 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that type II IFN signaling can promote τ phosphorylation by modulating cellular kinase activity, though this is insufficient in accelerating neuritic tangle pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1506225011,"Phosphoinositide signaling has been implicated in the regulation of numerous cellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics, cellular motility, vesicle trafficking, and gene transcription. Studies have also shown that nuclear phosphoinositide(s) regulates processes such as mRNA export, cell cycle progression, gene transcription, and DNA repair. We have shown previously that the nuclear form of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 1α (PIP5K), the enzyme responsible for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synthesis, is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1. In this study, we have shown that due to the site-specific Lys to Ala mutations of PIP5K at Lys-244 and Lys-490, it is unable to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus, respectively. Furthermore, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have observed that PIP5K associates with the chromatin silencing complex constituted of H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein 1α at multiple ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci. These interactions followed a definite cyclical pattern of occupancy (mostly G1) and release from the rDNA loci (G1/S) throughout the cell cycle. Moreover, the immunoprecipitation results clearly demonstrate that PIP5K SUMOylated at Lys-490 interacts with components of the chromatin silencing machinery, H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein 1α. However, PIP5K does not interact with the gene activation signature protein H3K4me3. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that PIP5K, an enzyme actively associated with lipid modification pathway, has additional roles in rDNA silencing.

Phosphoinositide, a specific phospholipid, serves as a potent signal transducer in multiple cellular events. Reversible phosphorylation of its inositol ring at positions 3–5 generates several phosphoinositide species (1Roth M.G. Phosphoinositides in constitutive membrane traffic.Physiol.

Although classical phosphoinositide signaling is concentrated in the plasma membrane, recent studies have suggested the presence of a distinct phosphoinositide signaling in the nucleus (3Shah Z.H.

J. 2002; 363: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in pre-mRNA processing. Studies indicate that PIP2 can bind to both histones H1 and H3 and is therefore involved in regulating the state of chromatin in the nucleus (6Yu H. Fukami K. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate reverses the inhibition of RNA transcription caused by histone H1.Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Further observations showed that PIP2 can regulate the interaction of the chromatin remodeling complex BRG1- or HRBM-associated factors (BAF) with the nuclear matrix (7Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R.

Recent evidence also has identified PIP2 in the nucleolus interacting with Pol I and upstream binding factor, implicating a possible role in Pol I transcription by interacting with pre-rRNA production and processing machineries (8Yildirim S. Castano E. Sobol M. Philimonenko V.V. Dzijak R. Venit T. Hozák P. Involvement of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in RNA polymerase I transcription.J.

Although there have been some reports on the role of PIP2 in the nucleus, only a few studies have documented spatial and functional characterization of PIP5K in the nucleus. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, it was demonstrated that speckle-targeted PIPKIα regulated-poly(A) polymerase was a novel interacting partner of PIP5K, and together they could regulate pre-mRNA processing (9Mellman D.L. Gonzales M.L. Song C. Barlow C.A. Wang P. Kendziorski C. Anderson R.A.

Additionally, it was shown that the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which recruits the BAF complex to transcription sites, can interact with and activate PIP5KIα (10Divecha N. Roefs M. Los A. Halstead J.

J. 2014; 461: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most of these studies implicated PIP2 in mediating the aforesaid nuclear functions. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the nuclear pool of PIP5K is modified by SUMO-1, and during apoptotic stress in addition to the increase in this SUMOylated pool, poly-SUMO-2-modified PIP5K also occurs in the nucleus (12Chakrabarti R. Bhowmick D. Bhargava V. Bhar K. Siddhanta A. Nuclear pool of phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5 kinase 1α is modified by polySUMO-2 during apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 439: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the present study, we document that SUMOylation of PIP5K at Lys-244 is essential for its nuclear targeting. It was shown to accumulate in the fibrillar center (FC) region of the nucleolus during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The results also demonstrated that PIP5K, SUMOylated at Lys-490, is present in the chromatin silencing complex consisting of H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1-α) at the rDNA loci. Together, our results indicate a possible novel epigenetic role of PIP5K protein per se in the silencing of rRNA genes in particular. The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165), β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 4970), and anti-nucleophosmin (Abcam, FC82291). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (A11001 and A11008, respectively) and 568 (A11004 and A11011, respectively) were purchased from Life Technologies. Secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (A3562 (mouse) and A3687 (rabbit)) were from Sigma. Anti-H3K4Me3 (39159) and anti-H3K9Me3 (39161) were from Active Motif, and anti-H3 (ab1791) antibody was from Abcam. Antibody for endogenous PIP5K was generated in rabbit as described previously (13Ghosh S. Ghosh R. Das P. Chattopadhyay D. Expression and purification of recombinant Giardia fibrillarin and its interaction with small nuclear RNAs.Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antisera was verified by Western blot analysis (see “Results”). HEK-293, MCF-7, and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells were transfected using Qiagen Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable cell lines (HEK-293-FLAG-PIP5K) were made by selecting the cells using 500 μg/ml G418 for a week and then maintained at 50 μg/ml G418 concentration. Nucleolar segregation was induced by actinomycin D treatment (0.05 μg/ml) for 4 h (14Kalt I. Levy A. Borodianskiy-Shteinberg T. Sarid R. Nucleolar localization of GLTSCR2/PICT-1 is mediated by multiple unique nucleolar localization sequences.PLoS One. 2012; 7e30825Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PIP5K was subcloned from GFP-PIP5K1α (kindly donated by Dr. J. Kunz from Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) into pCMV-Tag2B to generate FLAG-PIP5K1α and into pET-33b to generate His-tagged PIP5K1α. The kinase-dead construct was also obtained from Dr. J. Kunz. Point mutations of PIP5K were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were synchronized at G1/S phase using the thymidine double blocking method (15Cui Y. Cheng X. Zhang C. Zhang Y. Li S. Wang C. Guadagno T.M.

Briefly, cells were plated in 60-mm Petri dishes, and thymidine was added to a final concentration of 2 mm after cell adherence. The cells were cultured for 16 h. After removal of the thymidine and incubation for 10 h in fresh DMEM solution, thymidine was added to a final concentration of 2 mm for an additional 16 h. The synchronized cells were collected and washed twice with PBS solution. Cells were fixed with chilled 70% alcohol at −20 °C for at least 24 h. The cell sediment was collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm for 3 min), washed twice with PBS solution, incubated with RNase A (20 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The cell cycle distribution was then evaluated using flow cytometry (BD FACSVerse). Cell lysate preparation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (12Chakrabarti R. Bhowmick D. Bhargava V. Bhar K. Siddhanta A. Nuclear pool of phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5 kinase 1α is modified by polySUMO-2 during apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mounted cells were imaged using Nikon inverted research microscope ECLIPSE Ti-U and Olympus FV1000 LSM confocal microscope. Images were processed using NIS-Elements, Adobe Photoshop CS5, and FluoView 1000 software. Total RNA was isolated by TRI Reagent (Sigma) extraction according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and RevertAid reverse transcriptase kit (Fermentas). The synthesized cDNA was used for RT-qPCR using Maxima SYBR Green/ROXTM qPCR Master Mix (2×) (Fermentas) using the following primer sequences: β-actin forward, 5′-AGGCACCAGGGCGTGAT-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-GCCCACATAGGAATCCTTCTGAC-3′; 18S rRNA forward, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′; 18S rRNA reverse, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′; 45S pre-rRNA forward, 5′-CTCCGTTATGGTAGCGCTGC-3′; 45S pre-rRNA reverse, 5′-GCGGAACCCTCGCTTTC-3′. ChIP assays were performed according to a standard protocol (16Tsai W.W. Wang Z. Yiu T.T. Akdemir K.C. Xia W. Winter S. Tsai C.Y. Shi X. Schwarzer D. Plunkett W. Aronow B. Gozani O. Fischle W.

Briefly, after cross-linking the cells with 1% formaldehyde and stopping the reaction by 0.125 m glycine, cell lysis was done in cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (with fresh protease inhibitor)). After centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was lysed with nucleus lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS (with fresh protease inhibitor)). After sonication and preclearing of the chromatin, immunoprecipitation was subsequently performed with anti-FLAG, anti-H3K9me3, anti-H3, anti-H3K4me3, and IgG. Dynabeads, which were previously blocked, were used to pull down the chromatin complex. Beads were then washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and Tris-EDTA consecutively followed by RNase A and Proteinase K digestion at 37 °C. The beads were kept for overnight decross-linking at 65 °C, and the next day the samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNAs were amplified by real time PCR using StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems) and FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Roche Applied Science). Primers for real time PCR were designed as reported previously (17Cong R. Das S. Douet J. Wong J. Buschbeck M. Mongelard F. Bouvet P. macroH2A1 histone variant represses rDNA transcription.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). p53 primers used for ChIP analysis were designed from the upstream regulatory region and are as follows: p53 forward, 5′-CACGTAGCCCTTTTAGACTGAG-3′; p53 reverse, 5′-CCCCAGTTCCTTACCATTTCTG-3′. In general, -fold enrichment values were calculated after normalizing with respect to input DNA and IgG control. Briefly, the calculations were as follows for the input (Ct1), IgG_IP (Ct2), and Antibody_IP (Ct3) values. Adjusted input (A) = Ct1 - 6.644Eq. 1 ΔlgG_IP (B)=Ct2-AEq. 2 ΔAntibody_IP (C)=Ct3-AEq. 3 ΔΔAntibody_IP (D) = C - B(normalization with lgG)Eq. 4 −Fold enrichment =2-DEq. 5 Re-ChIP assays were performed as described elsewhere (18Das C.

Biol. 2010; 397: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunocomplex pulled down by the first antibody (anti-FLAG) was treated with 0.05 m DTT at 30 °C for 60 min followed by a 20-fold dilution before performing the pulldown with the second antibody (anti-H3K9me3, anti-HP1-α, or IgG). The -fold enrichment values were calculated and normalized with values obtained from pulldown with anti-FLAG antibody and IgG. PIP5K is a soluble enzyme that has been shown to be present in both the nucleus and cytosol. Previous reports from our laboratory confirmed that nuclear PIP5K is modified by SUMO-1 (12Chakrabarti R. Bhowmick D. Bhargava V. Bhar K. Siddhanta A. Nuclear pool of phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5 kinase 1α is modified by polySUMO-2 during apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 439: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis of PIP5K by SUMOplotTM displays six possible sites for SUMOylation, three of which (Lys-33, Lys-244, and Lys-490) have a probability score higher than 0.50 (Table 1). To identify the specific SUMOylation site(s) responsible for its nuclear targeting, we generated Lys to Ala mutants in the above sites. Expression of FLAG-tagged WT and mutant PIP5Ks in HEK-293 cells showed that the mutants having PIP5K-K244A failed to get imported into the nucleus (Fig. 1A, panels j–l, panels m–o, and panels s–u), whereas PIP5K-K33A (Fig. 1A, panels d–f) and PIP5K-K490A (Fig. 1A, panels g–i) mutants had normal nuclear distribution. To determine whether SUMOylation at Lys-244 is sufficient for nuclear import of PIP5K, we created double point mutations at Lys-33 and Lys-490 residues. Expression of this construct, which only had Lys-244 unmodified, showed a normal nuclear occupancy of the mutant protein, signifying that SUMOylation at Lys-244 is sufficient for nuclear import of PIP5K (Fig. 1A, panels p–r). To verify whether Lys-244 is modified by SUMO-1, we subjected anti-SUMO-1 immunoprecipitates from nuclear and cytosolic lysates of cells expressing WT-PIP5K, PIP5K-K33A, PIP5K-K490A, PIP5K-K244A, PIP5K-K33A/K490A, PIP5K-K244A/K490A, and PIP5K-K33A/K244A/K490A to Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Mutants that had unmodified Lys-244 showed an immunoreactive band in the nuclear fraction, whereas PIP5K-K244A, PIP5K-K244A/K490A, and PIP5K-K33A/K244A/K490A did not (Fig. 1B). The presence of the immunoreactive band in the cytosolic fraction of PIP5K-K244A and PIP5K-K244A/K490A suggests that although other lysines in these two mutants could be modified by SUMO-1 it is not sufficient to translocate the protein into the nucleus. Moreover, analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions from HEK cells expressing PIP5K-K33A/K244A/K490A revealed that SUMOylation is abolished in the triple mutant (Fig. 1B). The presence of the immunoreactive band in the nuclear fraction of the double mutant (PIP5K-K33A/K490A) and absence of the nuclear form in the case of Lys-244-modified mutants suggests that Lys-244 is indeed SUMOylated and is necessary and sufficient for nuclear import of PIP5K. Thus, it can be concluded that SUMOylation at Lys-244 is instrumental in regulating the nuclear import of PIP5K.TABLE 1SUMO modification sites of PIP5K by in silico analysis using SUMOplotSL no.PositionSequenceScore1Lys-244SVKMHIKYDLKGST0.942Lys-33SSASGIKRPMASEV0.843Lys-490TSTTLEKLEVAESE0.50 Open table in a new tab Immunolocalization of FLAG-PIP5K in asynchronous HEK-293 cells showed varied patterns of nuclear distribution (Ref. 4Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Phosphoinositide signaling pathways in nuclei are associated with nuclear speckles containing pre-mRNA processing factors.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A). To explore the possibility that the various nuclear staining patterns of PIP5K is regulated by cell cycle phases, we first used a double thymidine block on HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-PIP5K to synchronize them at the G1/S stage. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that substantial enrichment of PIP5K occurred in the nucleoli of G1/S-arrested cells (Fig. 2B, panels e–h) as compared with asynchronous cells (Fig. 2B, panels a–d). A similar experiment to reveal the nucleolar enrichment of endogenous PIP5K in G1/S arrested cells showed that localization of endogenous PIP5K is identical to that of its FLAG-tagged counterpart (Fig. 2C, panels a–d). The nucleolar enrichment of PIP5K was found to be very similar in other cell lines arrested at G1/S phase (Fig. 2C, panels e–l). Thus, our observation that PIP5K accumulates in the nucleolus at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle seems to be a general feature of the mammalian cell lines of different origin so far examined. The nucleolus contains three distinct regions: FC, dense fibrillar components, and the granular components (19Scheer U. Hock R. Structure and function of the nucleolus.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To verify the exact subnucleolar location of PIP5K, we treated G1/S-arrested cells with the Pol I inhibitor actinomycin D, which causes nucleolar components to segregate such that FC is removed from the dense fibrillar components and forms nucleolar caps termed fibrillar caps (20Reynolds R.C. Montgomery P.O. Hughes B. Nucleolar “caps” produced by actinomycin D.Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 1269-1277PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleolar caps thus formed contained immunoreactive spots of PIP5K (Fig. 3, panel b). Human topoisomerase I (hTop I) has been shown to be preferentially located in the FC of nucleolus placed in the vicinity of the rDNA and RNA polymerase I (21Christensen M.O. Krokowski R.M. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Boege F. Mielke C. Distinct effects of topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase I inhibitors suggest a dual mechanism of nucleolar/nucleoplasmic partitioning of topoisomerase I.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21873-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To verify whether PIP5K occupied the FC region, after actinomycin D treatment, the cells were doubly labeled with antibodies against FLAG and hTop I. We observed a very strong co-localization of PIP5K and hTop I in the nucleolar caps, confirming PIP5K occupancy in the FC region (Fig. 3, panels b–d). The FC region is known to contain Pol I-enriched rDNA transcription units (22Shav-Tal Y. Blechman J. Darzacq X. Montagna C. Dye B.T. Patton J.G. Singer R.H. Zipori D. Dynamic sorting of nuclear components into distinct nucleolar caps during transcriptional inhibition.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2395-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, PIP5K localization in the FC region suggests a possible role of this protein in rDNA transcription. To investigate the role of PIP5K in rDNA transcription, we monitored the occupancy pattern of modified histone H3 in the context of rRNA gene in cells expressing either wild type or kinase-dead PIP5K. We chose to use kinase-dead PIP5K (PIP5KD) as a negative control because our previous studies (12Chakrabarti R. Bhowmick D. Bhargava V. Bhar K. Siddhanta A. Nuclear pool of phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate 5 kinase 1α is modified by polySUMO-2 during apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 439: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and results from other laboratories (23Coppolino M.G. Dierckman R. Loijens J. Collins R.F. Pouladi M. Jongstra-Bilen J. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Anderson R. Grinstein S. Inhibition of phosphatidylinosiol-4-phosphate 5-kinase 1α impairs localized actin remodeling and suppresses phagocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43849-43857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have shown that this mutant fails to get translocated into the nucleus. We sought to study the relative occupancy pattern of an activation mark, H3K4me3, and a repression mark, H3K9me3, throughout the human rDNA loci using ChIP assays (Fig. 4A). The results of the ChIP assay showed significantly increased enrichment of the H3K9me3 mark at different regions of rRNA gene in the cells expressing the wild type PIP5K as compared with the PIP5KD (Fig. 4B), whereas the level of occupancy for the activation mark H3K4me3 remained almost unchanged in both cases (Fig. 4C). Thus, it was evident that nuclear expression of PIP5K was associated with the transcriptionally repressed state of rDNA. Furthermore, looking at the transcription profile of rRNA gene in asynchronous cells, it was evident that overexpression of PIP5K inhibited expressions of 18S (Fig. 4D) and 45S pre-rRNA (Fig. 4E) as compared with the parental HEK, whereas both their expressions were increased considerably in cells expressing PIP5KD (Fig. 4, D and E). We were intrigued by the fact that the absence of PIP5KD in the nucleus should not have modulated rRNA expression as observed here (Fig. 4, D and E). Because it has been demonstrated by others that the PIP5KD has dominant negative activity (24Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Wojtasiak M.L. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Membrane ruffling requires coordination between type Iα phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase and Rac signalling.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23036-23045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we wanted to verify whether or not in our case it acts in a dominant negative manner by suppressing the nuclear translocation of the endogenous PIP5K. To address this, we sought to determine the relative amounts of endogenous nuclear PIP5K in HEK, HEK-PIP5K, and HEK-PIP5KD cells. Western blot analysis of nuclear lysate from these cells using anti-PIP5K antibody revealed that HEK-PIP5KD cells contained a reduced (about 35% as compared with untransfected HEK cells) amount of endogenous nuclear PIP5K (Fig. 4F). Therefore, indeed expression of PIP5KD partly suppresses the nuclear translocation of endogenous PIP5K, resulting in an enhanced synthesis of rRNA in these cells. To further understand whether this effect was due to an alteration in the signal transduction cascade of PIP5K or a direct recruitment of the protein to the rDNA loci, we carried out ChIP studies using anti-FLAG antibody in HEK cells expressing FLAG-PIP5K. Results revealed that there was indeed a substantial recruitment of PIP5K in almost all the rDNA loci with greater recruitment at the intergenic sequence loci (H27) (Fig. 4G). To verify whether the recruitment of PIP5K was on the repressed regions of rDNA loci, a ChIP experiment was carried out separately with anti-H3K9me3, anti-histone H3, and anti-HP1-α antibodies. HP1-α is another well documented member of the gene silencing complex where it binds to and works in conjunction with H3K9me3 (25Grant P.A. A tale of histone modifications.Genome Biol. 2001; 2REVIEWS0003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). It is indeed interesting to note that the increased occupancy of PIP5K was concomitant to the elevated levels of both H3K9me3 (Fig. 4H), HP1-α (Fig. 4I), and histone H3 (Fig. 4J) at the respective rDNA loci. Moreover, the occupancy of PIP5K was greatly reduced at the above mentioned regions of the rDNA with the onset of S phase (Fig. 4G). H3K9me3 (Fig. 4H), HP1-α (Fig. 4I), and histone H3 (Fig. 4J) occupancy at similar sites also followed an identical pattern. It is notable that although in asynchronous phase 18S and 45S pre-rRNA synthesis was repressed in cells expressing WT-PIP5K as compared with the untransfected HEK-293 cells the initiation of S phase showed that synthesis of both 18S and 45S pre-rRNAs in cells expressing WT-PIP5K was elevated in a manner similar to that of untransfected HEK-293 cells. This all the more indicated that, despite its enrichment in the nucleolus, PIP5K was not associated with the rRNA genes during the G1/S phase (Fig. 4, D and E). Although the similar occupancy pattern of PIP5K, H3K9me3, and HP1-α over the rRNA gene suggested a role of PIP5K in rDNA repression, it was still not clear whether PIP5K is a component of the heterochromatin complex comprising H3K9me3 and HP1-α. We carried out re-ChIP assays where the DNA·protein complexes from HEK cells overexpressing PIP5K were first pulled down by anti-FLAG antibody. This immunoprecipitate was subjected to a second pulldown by either anti-H3K9me3 antibody or anti-HP1-α antibody. The precipitated DNA from the above immunoprecipitates was analyzed by qPCR, which showed considerable recruitment of PIP5K·H3K9me3 and PIP5K·HP1-α complexes at the rDNA loci (Fig. 4K). Because HP1-α and H3K9me3 are established interacting proteins of the repression complex (25Grant P.A.

https://openalex.org/W1523177761,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF), whether silent or symptomatic, is a frequent and severe complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous eNOS inhibitor, is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction. We addressed the relationship between ADMA plasma levels and AF occurrence in AMI. Methods 273 patients hospitalized for AMI were included. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring (CEM) ≥48 hours was recorded and ADMA was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography on admission blood sample. Results The incidence of silent and symptomatic AF was 39(14%) and 29 (11%), respectively. AF patients were markedly older than patients without AF (≈ 20 y). There was a trend towards higher ADMA levels in patients with symptomatic AF than in patients with silent AF or no AF (0.53 vs 0.49 and 0.49 μmol/L, respectively, p = 0.18,). After matching on age, we found that patients with symptomatic AF had a higher heart rate on admission and a higher rate of patients with LV dysfunction (28% vs. 3%, p = 0.025). Patients who developed symptomatic AF had a higher ADMA level than patients without AF (0.53 vs. 0.43 μmol/L; p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate symptomatic AF occurrence showed that ADMA was independently associated with symptomatic AF (OR: 2.46 [1.21–5.00], p = 0.013) beyond history of AF, LVEF<40% and elevated HR. Conclusion We show that high ADMA level is associated with the occurrence of AF. Although no causative role can be concluded from our observational study, our work further supports the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of AF in AMI."

We have previously identified HDAC5 as an injury-regulated tubulin deacetylase that functions at the injury site to promote axon regeneration. However, the mechanisms involved in the spatial control of HDAC5 activity remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that HDAC5 interacts with the actin binding protein filamin A via its C-terminal domain. Filamin A plays critical roles in HDAC5-dependent tubulin deacetylation because, in cells lacking filamin A, the levels of acetylated tubulin are elevated markedly. We found that nerve injury increases filamin A axonal expression in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. Reducing filamin A levels or interfering with the interaction between HDAC5 and filamin A prevents injury-induced tubulin deacetylation as well as HDAC5 localization at the injured axon tips. In addition, neurons lacking filamin A display reduced axon regeneration. Our findings suggest a model in which filamin A local translation following axon injury controls localized HDAC5 activity to promote axon regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W1577130089,"Linear-bilinear models, especially the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model, are widely applicable to genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) studies in plant breeding programs. These models allow a parsimonious modeling of GE interactions, retaining a small number of principal components in the analysis. However, one aspect of the AMMI model that is still debated is the selection criteria for determining the number of multiplicative terms required to describe the GE interaction pattern. Shrinkage estimators have been proposed as selection criteria for the GE interaction components. In this study, a Bayesian approach was combined with the AMMI model with shrinkage estimators for the principal components. A total of 55 maize genotypes were evaluated in nine different environments using a complete blocks design with three replicates. The results show that the traditional Bayesian AMMI model produces low shrinkage of singular values but avoids the usual pitfalls in determining the credible intervals in the biplot. On the other hand, Bayesian shrinkage AMMI models have difficulty with the credible interval for model parameters, but produce stronger shrinkage of the principal components, converging to GE matrices that have more shrinkage than those obtained using mixed models. This characteristic allowed more parsimonious models to be chosen, and resulted in models being selected that were similar to those obtained by the Cornelius F-test (α = 0.05) in traditional AMMI models and cross validation based on leave-one-out. This characteristic allowed more parsimonious models to be chosen and more GEI pattern retained on the first two components. The resulting model chosen by posterior distribution of singular value was also similar to those produced by the cross-validation approach in traditional AMMI models. Our method enables the estimation of credible interval for AMMI biplot plus the choice of AMMI model based on direct posterior distribution retaining more GEI pattern in the first components and discarding noise without Gaussian assumption as requested in F-based tests or deal with parametric problems as observed in traditional AMMI shrinkage method."
https://openalex.org/W1820735544,"Health monitoring is an integral part of laboratory animal quality standards. However, current or past prevalence data as well as regulatory requirements dictate the frequency, type and the expanse of health monitoring. In an effort to understand the prevalence of rodent pathogens in India, a preliminary study was carried out by sero-epidemiology. Sera samples obtained from 26 public and private animal facilities were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against minute virus of mice (MVM), ectromelia virus (ECTV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Sendai virus (SeV), and Mycoplasma pulmonis in mice, and SeV, rat parvo virus (RPV), Kilham's rat virus (KRV) and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) in rats, by sandwich ELISA. It was observed that MHV was the most prevalent agent followed by Mycoplasma pulmonis and MVM in mice, and SDAV followed by RPV were prevalent in rats. On the other hand, none of the samples were positive for ECTV in mice, or SeV or KRV in rats. Multiple infections were common in both mice and rats. The incidence of MHV and Mycoplasma pulmonis was higher in facilities maintained by public organizations than in vivaria of private organizations, although the difference was not statistically different. On the other hand the prevalence of rodent pathogens was significantly higher in the northern part of India than in the South. These studies form the groundwork for detailed sero-prevalence studies which should further lay the foundations for country-specific guidelines for health monitoring of laboratory animals."
https://openalex.org/W1517094948,"Poly-γ-glutamate (γ-PGA) is an industrially interesting polymer secreted mainly by members of the class Bacilli which forms a shield able to protect bacteria from phagocytosis and phages. Few enzymes are known to degrade γ-PGA; among them is a phage-encoded γ-PGA hydrolase, PghP. The supposed role of PghP in phages is to ensure access to the surface of bacterial cells by dismantling the γ-PGA barrier. We identified four unannotated B. subtilis genes through similarity of their encoded products to PghP; in fact these genes reside in prophage elements of B. subtilis genome. The recombinant products of two of them demonstrate efficient polymer degradation, confirming that sequence similarity reflects functional homology. Genes encoding similar γ-PGA hydrolases were identified in phages specific for the order Bacillales and in numerous microbial genomes, not only belonging to that order. The distribution of the γ-PGA biosynthesis operon was also investigated with a bioinformatics approach; it was found that the list of organisms endowed with γ-PGA biosynthetic functions is larger than expected and includes several pathogenic species. Moreover in non-Bacillales bacteria the predicted γ-PGA hydrolase genes are preferentially found in species that do not have the genetic asset for polymer production. Our findings suggest that γ-PGA hydrolase genes might have spread across microbial genomes via horizontal exchanges rather than via phage infection. We hypothesize that, in natural habitats rich in γ-PGA supplied by producer organisms, the availability of hydrolases that release glutamate oligomers from γ-PGA might be a beneficial trait under positive selection."
https://openalex.org/W1908446713,"Although mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in tumor metastasis, it is unclear how it regulates tumor cell aggressiveness. We have reported previously that human hepatoma cells harboring mitochondrial defects have high tumor cell invasion activity via increased claudin-1 (Cln-1) expression. In this study, we demonstrated that mitochondrial respiratory defects induced Cln-1 transcription via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activation, which contributed to hepatoma invasiveness. We first confirmed the inverse relationship between mitochondrial defects and Cln-1 induction in SNU hepatoma cells and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. We then examined five different respiratory complex inhibitors, and complex I inhibition by rotenone most effectively induced Cln-1 at the transcriptional level. Rotenone increased both mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS. In addition, rotenone-induced Cln-1 expression was attenuated by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, and exogenous H2O2 treatment was enough to increase Cln-1 transcription, implying the involvement of ROS. Next we found that ROS-mediated HSF1 activation via hyperphosphorylation was the key event for Cln-1 transcription. Moreover, the Cln-1 promoter region (from −529 to +53) possesses several HSF1 binding elements, and this region showed increased promoter activity and HSF1 binding affinity in response to rotenone treatment. Finally, we demonstrated that the invasion activity of SNU449 cells, which harbor mitochondrial defects, was blocked by siRNA-mediated HSF1 knockdown. Taken together, these results indicate that mitochondrial respiratory defects enhance Cln-1-mediated hepatoma cell invasiveness via mitochondrial ROS-mediated HSF1 activation, presenting a potential role for HSF1 as a novel mitochondrial retrograde signal-responsive transcription factor to control hepatoma cell invasiveness.

Mitochondrial respiratory defects are distinct metabolic features of cancer cells (1Brandon M. Baldi P. Wallace D.C.

On the origin of cancer cells.Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9557) Google Scholar). In the early stages of cancer development, actively proliferating tumor cells cannot avoid hypoxia because of their rapid nodular mass formation. Therefore, this respiratory impairment has long been recognized as an epiphenomenon of tumors. However, mitochondrial defects and the accompanying activated glycolysis persist in metastatic malignant cancers even after a normoxic environment is restored by activated angiogenesis. Similar observations have been made with cultivated tumor cells under normoxia (3Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Why do cancers have high aerobic glycolysis?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar), indicating that cancerous respiratory defects are not just a transient consequence of environmental constraints in tumor tissue but may be the result of genetic changes or oncogenic modulations. Indeed, the mitochondrial defects found in cancer cells are mostly associated with mitochondrial DNA damage, such as deletions and/or point mutations, as described in many types of cancers (4Chatterjee A.

Claudins are a family of tight junction components that form paracellular barriers, thereby controlling the flow of molecules in the intercellular space of the epithelium. However, aberrant up-regulation of claudins has often been reported in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and primary colon carcinoma (21Michl P. Barth C. Buchholz M. Lerch M.M.

Among claudins, claudin-1 (Cln-1) is known to play a key role in the invasive behavior of human liver cells via the c-Abl-PKC signaling pathway (23Yoon C.H. Kim M.J. Park M.J. Park I.C. Hwang S.G.

Recently, we reported that hepatoma cells harboring mitochondrial dysfunction control cell invasion activity through augmenting Cln-1 expression. However, the molecular mechanism of how mitochondrial dysfunction controls Cln-1 expression remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mitochondrial respiratory defects augment Cln-1 expression through ROS-mediated heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activation, contributing to hepatoma cell invasiveness. Human hepatoma cells (SNU-354, SNU-387, SNU-423, and SNU-449) were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) and cultured in Gibco RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% Gibco FBS (Invitrogen) and Gibco antibiotics (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Chang cells were obtained from the ATCC. Chang cell clones were isolated by single-cell dilution and expansion of Chang cell (ATCC, Rockville, MD), and a Chang clone with strong hepatic characteristics (Ch-L), validated by confirming liver-specific expression of albumin and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase-1, was used for this study (26Kim J.H.

HCC tumor samples and surrounding control tissues were obtained from 28 patients with HCC during the period of 2003–2005 at Ajou University Hospital after surgical resection with informed consent through the Ajou Institutional Review Board. No patient in this study received chemotherapy or radiation therapy before surgery. The OCR was also measured in situ with cultured cells using an XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) according to the protocol provided. Briefly, cells were seeded on XF24 cell culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) at a density of 10,000 cells/well and preincubated with XF assay medium (Seahorse Bioscience) containing 1 mm pyruvate and 5 mm glucose. Its mitochondrial specificity was confirmed by adding 5 mm KCN. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and incubated in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h. After incubation overnight with primary antibody for Cln-1 (catalog no. 717800, Invitrogen) at 4 °C, cells were washed three times and probed with cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. After washing and mounting with mounting solution, cells were visualized by confocal microscope (LSM710, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To determine intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels, dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mitochondrial specific MitoSOX® (Invitrogen) fluorogenic probes were used, respectively (27Yu J.S.

Stained cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Vantage, BD Biosciences). Mean values of arbitrary fluorescence units of 10,000 cells were used and expressed as the percentage of negative control. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were obtained from 90% confluently grown cells on 100-mm dishes as described previously with slight modifications (28Byun H.O. Jung H.J. Seo Y.H. Lee Y.K.

Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in medium A (250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). The cell slurry was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (StedFastTM stirrer, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and spun at 500 rcf for 10 min to precipitate nuclei.

Nucleus and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0)) for Western blot analysis. To generate a cDNA plasmid, pcDNA-HSF1-HA, conventional cloning procedures were applied. Briefly, the pcDNA-HSF1-HA plasmid was constructed by conventional TA cloning using pGEMT-easy (Promega), and the HSF1 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using total cDNAs of the Ch-L clone and the primer set 5′-AGAATTCATGGATCTGCCCG and 5′-TGAGCTCGGAGACAGTGGG. The HSF1 cDNA was subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-HA vector constructed previously (29Seo Y.H. Jung H.J. Shin H.T. Kim Y.M. Yim H. Chung H.Y. Lim I.K. Yoon G. Enhanced glycogenesis is involved in cellular senescence via GSK3/GS modulation.Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Cln-1 overexpression plasmid pcDNA-Cln-1 has been constructed previously (26Kim J.H. Kim E.L. Lee Y.K. Park C.B. Kim B.W. Wang H.J. Yoon C.H. Lee S.J. Yoon G. Decreased lactate dehydrogenase B expression enhances claudin 1-mediated hepatoma cell invasiveness via mitochondrial defects.Exp. Cell Res. 2011; 317: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To introduce plasmids and siRNAs into cells, cells were transfected with plasmids and siRNA duplexes using FuGENE HD (Promega) and OligofectamineTM reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. HSF1 siRNAs (#1, 5′-ACUGUAGAUUGCUUCUGUA; #2, 5′-GAACUAAAGCCAAGGGUAU) and negative control siRNAs (5′-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGU) were obtained from Bioneer (Seoul, Korea). The human Cln-1 promoter region of 767 bp (−529 to +238, NG_021418) was cloned by targeted PCR against total genomic DNA of Ch-L using a primer set, 5′-GCTCGAGCCAATCTGTAGAGTGT and 5′-TATAGATCTTCGCTCGGGCGC. The amplified Cln-1 promoter region was inserted between the BglII and XhoI sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). After construction, the inserted promoter was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To monitor Cln-1 promoter activity, cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA (700 ng of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-HSF1-HA, 250 ng of the cloned reporter plasmid, and 50 ng of thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control) using FuGENE HD reagent. After 2 days, the luciferase activity of the cell lysate was measured by Synergy 2 multi-mode reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) according to the protocol provided with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The Cln-1 promoter-mediated luciferase activities of the reporter plasmid were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The ChIP assay was performed according to the ChIP assay kit protocol (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to stably cross-link the DNA-interacting proteins to genomic DNA. After lysis, the lysates were sonicated briefly to shear genomic DNA and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. An aliquot was saved for input control, and the other aliquots were subjected to ChIP using HSF1 antibody (catalog no. 4356S, Cell Signaling Technology) and protein G-agarose beads (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). The eluted DNA was purified using a DNA extraction kit (Inclone Biotech, Seoul, Korea), and the specific Cln-1 promoter region (−490 to +53, 543 bp) was amplified by PCR with the primer sets 5′-GAGACAAGTGATGGAACGACC and 5′-CTGGAGTCTGGATACTAGAAGC (Bioneer) and sequenced for validation. Cell invasion assays were performed with Transwell® permeable supports (Corning, Acton, MA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cells (2 × 104) prestarved with serum-free RPMI for 16 h were placed into the upper chamber with 0.2 ml of serum-free RPMI. RPMI (0.8 ml) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Uncoated porous filters (8-μm pore size) were precoated with 7% growth factor-reduced BD MatrigelTM matrix (BD Biosciences) for the assay. The cells invading the lower surface were fixed by 100% methanol for 1 min, stained with hematoxylin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI) and eosin Y solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and counted. All experiments were performed as independent triplicate experiments. Western blotting was performed using standard procedures. Cln-1 antibody (catalog no. 717800) was purchased from Invitrogen, and HSF1 antibody (catalog no. 4356S) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody for phospho-HSF1 (Ser(P)-326, catalog no. ab115702) was obtained from Abcam. Antibodies for β-actin (catalog no. sc-1616) and α-tubulin (catalog no. sc-5286) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against NDUFA9 of complex I (catalog no. A21344) and MTCOII of complex IV (catalog no. A6404) were from Molecular Probes. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was performed with 25–30 cycles of the reaction involving 95 °C for 30 s, 53–58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 70–90 s. The PCR primer sets for Cln-1 (5′-GAGCGAGTCATGGCCAACGCG and 5′-GCCTCTGTGTCACACGTAGTC), NDUFA3 (5′-CAGTGCTGGTCGTGTCCTTC and 5′-GGCATGTTCCCATCATCACG), UQCRB (5′-GCCTTTCTCTGTTCGCGATG and 5′-ATCCAGCCACTTGCCTGATG), ATP5G3 (5′-TCTCGACCAGAGGCTAGTAGG and 5′-TTGCAGCACCTGCACCAATA), and β-actin (5′-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTGT and 5′-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTC for a short fragment of 202 bp and 5′-GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTT and 5′-CTGTCACCTTCACCGTTCCA for a long fragment of 518 bp) were produced by Bioneer. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed by using ThunderbirdTM SYBRTM quantitative PCR mix (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and the Bio-Rad CFX96TM real-time system. First we examined the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and Cln-1 expression in hepatoma cells using four different SNU hepatoma cells (SNU-354, SNU-387, SNU-423, and SNU449). A previously characterized Ch-L clone that possesses liver-specific genes (30Lee Y.K. Youn H.G. Wang H.J. Yoon G. Decreased mitochondrial OGG1 expression is linked to mitochondrial defects and delayed hepatoma cell growth.Mol. Cell. 2013; 35: 489-497Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used as a control with active mitochondria. SNU-354, SNU-423, and SNU449 cells with defective mitochondrial respiration showed increased Cln-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas cells with active mitochondria (SNU387 and the Ch-L clone) had low Cln-1 expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Increased Cln-1 expression was mostly localized in the cell-to-cell contact region of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C), implying its usual function as a tight junction component. Next, we compared the expression levels of Cln-1 and a core subunit of mitochondrial respiratory complex IV using 28 individual HCC tumor samples and their surrounding specimens (Fig. 1, D and E). There was no clear one-on-one correlation between decreased complex IV subunit and increased Cln-1 expression in human hepatoma tissues. However, 20 tumor samples had decreased expression (below 0.2-fold) of the complex IV subunit, implying mitochondrial defects. Of 20 samples with mitochondrial defects, 14 (63.6%) had increased expression (more than 2.0-fold induction) of Cln-1 (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that up-regulation of Cln-1 expression may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in some hepatoma cells. Next we investigated the relationship between Cln-1 expression and mitochondrial defects. Overexpression of Cln-1, regardless of whether it was transient or stable, in Ch-L clones did not affect the OCR (Fig. 2, A and B). However, when Ch-L clones were treated with the respiratory inhibitors rotenone (complex I inhibitor), thenoyltrifluoroacetone (complex II inhibitor), antimycin A (complex III inhibitor), and oligomycin (complex V inhibitor), Cln-1 expression was increased significantly at the transcription level without altering respiratory subunit expression or any clear alterations in respiratory subunit expression (data not shown). KCN (complex IV inhibitor) did not lead to increased Cln-1 expression (Fig. 2, C and D). Of the five respiratory complex inhibitors, complex I inhibition by rotenone showed the most effective Cln-1 induction. This induction started with 1 μm rotenone and increased progressively 3 h after treatment at the transcription level (Fig. 2, E and F). We further demonstrated that a mitochondrial defect by siRNA-mediated knockdown of NDUFA9, a complex I subunit, induced Cln-1 expression (Fig. 2G). These results indicate that the mitochondrial complex I defect is involved in Cln-1 expression and also suggest that rotenone-induced Cln-1 expression can be used as a proper model to elucidate the molecular link between mitochondrial defects and Cln-1 expression. Next we asked how complex I inhibition by rotenone regulated Cln-1 transcription. To address this, we monitored intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels in hepatoma cells and compared them with those of Ch-L clones. Hepatoma cells with mitochondrial defects had increased levels of both mitochondrial and intracellular ROS (Fig. 3A). When the Ch-L clone was treated with rotenone, both mitochondrial and intracellular ROS increased in a dose-dependent manner, accompanying Cln-1 mRNA induction and showing an inverse relationship with respiratory inhibition (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, effectively blocked rotenone-induced Cln-1 transcription (Fig. 3C). When the Ch-L clone was exposed to a subcytotoxic dose of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), intracellular ROS increased in a biphasic manner, and mitochondrial ROS increased progressively (Fig. 3, Da and Fa), implying that the second peak of intracellular ROS may be linked with mitochondrial ROS, which was probably triggered by an H2O2-induced mitochondrial defect (Fig. 3F, b). This biphasic ROS generation by a subcytotoxic dose of H2O2 corresponds well with a previous report (31Lee H.W. Heo C.H. Sen D. Byun H.O. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Kim H.M. Ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe for quantitative detection of β-galactosidase activity in senescent cells.Anal. Chem. 2014; 86: 10001-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, under these conditions, Cln-1 mRNA expression also showed a biphasic profile, suggesting that a certain level of ROS may be required for Cln-1 induction (Fig. 3, D and E). These results indicate that mitochondrial ROS generated by complex I inhibition is critically involved in Cln-1 transcription. To investigate how mitochondrial ROS modulate Cln-1 expression, we analyzed potential transcription factor binding sites in the Cln-1 promoter region (−2729 to +271 bp, NCBI accession no. NG_021418) using the TFSEARCH program. The most abundant transcription binding site in the promoter region was for HSF1, which is known as a stress-responsive transcription factor (data not shown) that is regulated by oxidative signaling (32Wang K."

https://openalex.org/W2297301553,"Nacrein is the first identified and widely investigated molluscan matrix protein and is considered to play an important role in the shell formation of the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata. Here, we investigate the effect of the NF-κB signalling pathway on Nacrein gene expression in P. fucata to elucidate the mechanisms involved in shell formation. Inhibition of NF-κB signalling decreased Nacrein promoter-dependent luciferase activity. However, co-transfection of the Nacrein promoter vector with Pf-IKK or Pf-Rel expression plasmids could enhance luciferase activity, thus proving NF-κB signalling could regulate the transcriptional activity of the Nacrein promoter. Gene silencing by RNA interference and subsequent observation of the inner surface of the nacreous layer of oyster shells by SEM, showed that suppression of the gene Pf-Rel lead to a partial inhibition of Nacrein expression, not only at the mRNA level but also at the protein level. The inner surface of the shells became abnormal. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed that Pf-Rel could directly bind to the relative sites of the Nacrein promoter. These results confirm that an important component of the NF-κB signalling pathway, Pf-Rel, can directly bind the Nacrein promoter in P. fucata, and regulate its transcription and shell formation."
https://openalex.org/W751028141,"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms face two main difficulties: the curse of dimensionality, and environment non-stationarity due to the independent learning processes carried out by the agents concurrently. In this paper we formalize and prove the convergence of a Distributed Round Robin Q-learning (D-RR-QL) algorithm for cooperative systems. The computational complexity of this algorithm increases linearly with the number of agents. Moreover, it eliminates environment non sta tionarity by carrying a round-robin scheduling of the action selection and execution. That this learning scheme allows the implementation of Modular State-Action Vetoes (MSAV) in cooperative multi-agent systems, which speeds up learning convergence in over-constrained systems by vetoing state-action pairs which lead to undesired termination states (UTS) in the relevant state-action subspace. Each agent's local state-action value function learning is an independent process, including the MSAV policies. Coordination of locally optimal policies to obtain the global optimal joint policy is achieved by a greedy selection procedure using message passing. We show that D-RR-QL improves over state-of-the-art approaches, such as Distributed Q-Learning, Team Q-Learning and Coordinated Reinforcement Learning in a paradigmatic Linked Multi-Component Robotic System (L-MCRS) control problem: the hose transportation task. L-MCRS are over-constrained systems with many UTS induced by the interaction of the passive linking element and the active mobile robots."
https://openalex.org/W778562804,"Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and its associations with atherosclerosis (AS) and cardiovascular disease remain controversial. The purpose of our study was to observe changes in endothelial functioning and hemodynamics in rats with SCH and to determine whether L-thyroxine (L-T4) administration affects these changes.In total, sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into the following three groups with 20 rats each: control euthyroid rats, SCH rats and SCH rats that had been treated with thyroxine (SCH+T4). The SCH rats were induced by administration of 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) methimazole (MMI) once daily by gavage for 3 months. The SCH+T4 rats were administered the same dose of MMI for three months in addition to 2 μg x kg(-1) x d(-1) L-T4 once daily by gavage after 45 days of MMI administration. The control rats received physiological saline via gavage.The SCH group had significantly higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and endothelin (ET) levels and a lower nitric oxide (NO) level than the control and SCH+T4 groups. The tail and carotid artery blood pressures, left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate and aorta ventralis blood flow were significantly lower in the SCH group than in the control and SCH+T4 groups. ACH treatment caused concentration-dependent relaxation, which was reduced in the SCH arteries compared with the control and SCH+T4 arteries. Histopathological examination revealed the absence of pathological changes in the SCH rat arteries.These findings demonstrate that L-T4 treatment ameliorates endothelial dysfunction and hemodynamic changes in SCH rats."
https://openalex.org/W1714697825,"Tcf7l1 (also known as Tcf3) is a bimodal transcription factor that plays essential roles in embryogenesis and embryonic and adult stem cells. On one hand, Tcf7l1 works as transcriptional repressor via the recruitment of Groucho-related transcriptional corepressors to repress the transcription of Wnt target genes, and, on the other hand, it activates Wnt target genes when Wnt-activated β-catenin interacts with it. However, how its activity is modulated is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that a JmjC-domain containing protein, Jmjd6, interacts with Tcf7l and derepresses Tcf7l. We show that Jmjd6 binds to a region of Tcf7l1 that is also responsible for Groucho interaction, therefore making it possible that Jmjd6 binding displaces the Groucho transcriptional corepressor from Tcf7l1. Moreover, we show that Jmjd6 antagonizes the repression effect of Tcf7l1 on target gene transcription and is able to enhance β-catenin-induced gene activation and that, vice versa, inhibition of Jmjd6 activity compromises gene activation in both cells and Xenopus early embryos. We also show that jmjd6 is both maternally and zygotically transcribed during Xenopus embryogenesis. Loss of Jmjd6 function causes defects in anterioposterior body axis formation and down-regulation of genes that are involved in anterioposterior axis patterning.

https://openalex.org/W1564608876,"Cattle grazing and invasion by non-native plant species are globally-ubiquitous changes occurring to plant communities that are likely to reverberate through whole food webs. We used a manipulative field experiment to quantify how arthropod community structure differed in native and non-native California grassland communities in the presence and absence of grazing. The arthropod community was strongly affected by cattle grazing: the biovolume of herbivorous arthropods was 79% higher in grazed than ungrazed plots, whereas the biovolume of predatory arthropods was 13% higher in ungrazed plots. In plots where non-native grasses were grazed, arthropod biovolume increased, possibly in response to increased plant productivity or increased nutritional quality of rapidly-growing annual plants. Grazing may thus affect plant biomass both through the direct removal of biomass, and through arthropod-mediated impacts. We also expected the arthropod community to differ between native and non-native plant communities; surprisingly, arthropod richness and diversity did not vary consistently between these grass community types, although arthropod abundance was slightly higher in plots with native and ungrazed grasses. These results suggest that whereas cattle grazing affects the arthropod community via direct and indirect pathways, arthropod community changes commonly associated with non-native plant invasions may not be due to the identity or dominance of the invasive species in those systems, but to accompanying changes in plant traits or functional group composition, not seen in this experiment because of the similarity of the plant communities."
https://openalex.org/W591987734,"Environmental factors play a key role in the etiology of depression. The rodent forced swim test (FST) is commonly used as a preclinical model of depression, with increases in escape-directed behavior reflecting antidepressant effects, and increases in immobility reflecting behavioral despair. Environmental enrichment leads to serotonergic alterations in rats, but it is unknown whether these alterations may influence the efficacy of common antidepressants. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in enriched (EC), standard (SC), or isolated (IC) conditions. Following the rearing period, fluoxetine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 23.5 hrs, 5 hrs, and 1 hr before locomotor and FST measures. Following locomotor testing and FST exposure, rats were weighed to assess fluoxetine-, FST-, and environmental condition-induced moderations in weight gain. Results revealed an antidepressant effect of environmental enrichment and a depressant effect of isolation. Regardless of significant fluoxetine effects on locomotor activity, fluoxetine generally decreased swimming and increased immobility in all three environmental conditions, with IC-fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) rats and EC-fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) rats swimming less than vehicle counterparts. Subchronic 20 mg/kg fluoxetine also induced significant weight loss, and differential rearing appeared to moderate weight gain following FST stress. These results suggest that differential rearing has the ability to alter FST behaviors, fluoxetine efficacy, and post-stressor well-being. Moreover, 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, administered subchronically, may lead to atypical effects of those commonly observed in the FST, highlighting the importance and impact of both environmental condition and dosing regimen in common animal models of depression."
https://openalex.org/W804546973,"Our ecological knowledge base is extensive, but the motivations for research are many and varied, leading to unequal species representation and coverage. As this evidence is used to support a wide range of conservation, management and policy actions, it is important that gaps and biases are identified and understood. In this paper we detail a method for quantifying research effort and impact at the individual species level, and go on to investigate the factors that best explain between-species differences in outputs. We do this using British breeding birds as a case study, producing a ranked list of species based on two scientific publication metrics: total number of papers (a measure of research quantity) and h-index (a measure of the number of highly cited papers on a topic--an indication of research quality). Widespread, populous species which are native, resident and in receipt of biodiversity action plans produced significantly higher publication metrics. Guild was also significant, birds of prey the most studied group, with pigeons and doves the least studied. The model outputs for both metrics were very similar, suggesting that, at least in this example, research quantity and quality were highly correlated. The results highlight three key gaps in the evidence base, with fewer citations and publications relating to migrant breeders, introduced species and species which have experienced contractions in distribution. We suggest that the use of publication metrics in this way provides a novel approach to understanding the scale and drivers of both research quantity and impact at a species level and could be widely applied, both taxonomically and geographically."
https://openalex.org/W1484652196,"Objectives Intra-uterine growth retardation is often of unknown origin, and is of great interest as a “Fetal Origin of Adult Disease” has been now well recognized. We built a benchmark based upon a previously analysed data set related to Intrauterine Growth Retardation with 46 subjects described by 14 variables, related with the insulin-like growth factor system and pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin -6 and tumor necrosis factor -α. Design and Methods We used new algorithms for optimal information sorting based on the combination of two neural network algorithms: Auto-contractive Map and Activation and Competition System. Auto-Contractive Map spatializes the relationships among variables or records by constructing a suitable embedding space where ‘closeness’ among variables or records reflects accurately their associations. The Activation and Competition System algorithm instead works as a dynamic non linear associative memory on the weight matrices of other algorithms, and is able to produce a prototypical variable profile of a given target. Results Classical statistical analysis, proved to be unable to distinguish intrauterine growth retardation from appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) subjects due to the high non-linearity of underlying functions. Auto-contractive map succeeded in clustering and differentiating completely the conditions under study, while Activation and Competition System allowed to develop the profile of variables which discriminated the two conditions under study better than any other previous form of attempt. In particular, Activation and Competition System showed that ppropriateness for gestational age was explained by IGF-2 relative gene expression, and by IGFBP-2 and TNF-α placental contents. IUGR instead was explained by IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IL-6 gene expression in placenta. Conclusion This further analysis provided further insight into the placental key-players of fetal growth within the insulin-like growth factor and cytokine systems. Our previous published analysis could identify only which variables were predictive of fetal growth in general, and identified only some relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1487923377,"Background and Purpose Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at higher risk of stroke than those without COPD. This study aims to explore the impact of inhaled pharmacotherapy on stroke risk in COPD patients during a three-year follow-up, using a nationwide, population-based study and a matched cohort design. Methods The study cohort comprised 10,413 patients who had received COPD treatment between 2004 and 2006; 41,652 randomly selected subjects comprised the comparison cohort. Cox proportional hazard regressions and two-stage propensity score calibration were performed to determine the impact of various inhaled therapies including short-acting muscarinic antagonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, short-acting β-agonists (SABAs), long-acting β-agonists (LABAs), and LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), on the risk after adjustment for patient demographic characteristics and comorbid disorders. Results Of the 52,065 sampled patients, 2,689 (5.2%) developed stroke during follow-up, including 727 (7.0%) from the COPD cohort and 1,962 (4.7%) from the comparison cohort (p < 0.001). Treatment with SABA was associated with 1.67-fold (95% CI 1.45–1.91; p < 0.001) increased risk of stroke in COPD patients. By contrast, the cumulative incidence of stroke was significantly lower in those treated with LABA plus ICS than those treated without (adjusted hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.94, p = 0.014). Conclusions Among COPD patients, the use of inhaled SABA is associated with an increased risk of stroke, and combination treatment with inhaled LABA and ICS relates to a risk reduction. Further prospective research is needed to verify whether LABA plus ICS confers protection against stroke in patients with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W1868908156,"Type I interferons are multi-potent cytokines that serve as first line of defense against viruses and other pathogens, posses immunomudolatory functions and elicit a growth inhibitory response. In recent years it has been shown that interferons are also detrimental, for example in lupus, AIDS, tuberculosis and cognitive decline, highlighted the need to develop interferon antagonists. We have previously developed the antagonist IFN-1ant, with much reduced binding to the IFNAR1 receptor and enhanced binding to IFNAR2. Here, we further tune the IFN-1ant by producing three additional antagonists based on IFN-1ant but with altered activity profiles. We show that in all three cases the antiproliferative activity of interferons is blocked and the induction of gene transcription of immunomudolatory and antiproliferative associated genes are substantially decreased. Conversely, each of the new antagonists elicits a different degree of antiviral response, STAT phosphorylation and related gene induction. Two of the new antagonists promote decreased activity in relation to the original IFN-1ant, while one of them promotes increased activity. As we do not know the exact causes of the detrimental effects of IFNs, the four antagonists that were produced and analyzed provide the opportunity to investigate the extent of antagonistic and agonistic activity optimal for a given condition."
https://openalex.org/W1529870835,"Protein phosphorylation regulates diverse cellular functions and plays a key role in the early development of plants. To complement and expand upon previous investigations of protein phosphorylation in Arabidopsis seedlings we used an alternative approach that combines protein extraction under non-denaturing conditions with immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment of intact phosphoproteins in Rubisco-depleted extracts, followed by identification using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In-gel trypsin digestion and analysis of selected gel spots identified 144 phosphorylated peptides and residues, of which only18 phosphopeptides and 8 phosphosites were found in the PhosPhAt 4.0 and P3DB Arabidopsis thaliana phosphorylation site databases. More than half of the 82 identified phosphoproteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis/respiration or oxidative stress response mechanisms. Enrichment of intact phosphoproteins prior to 2-DE and LC-MS/MS appears to enhance detection of phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues compared with methods that utilize peptide-level enrichment, suggesting that the two approaches are somewhat complementary in terms of phosphorylation site coverage. Comparing results for young seedlings with those obtained previously for mature Arabidopsis leaves identified five proteins that are differentially phosphorylated in these tissues, demonstrating the potential of this technique for investigating the dynamics of protein phosphorylation during plant development."
https://openalex.org/W1591723565,"In stroke patients, neglect diagnostic is often performed by means of paper-pencil cancellation tasks. These tasks entail static stimuli, and provide no information concerning possible changes in the severity of neglect symptoms when patients are confronted with motion. We therefore aimed to directly contrast the cancellation behaviour of neglect patients under static and dynamic conditions. Since visual field deficits often occur in neglect patients, we analysed whether the integrity of the optic radiation would influence cancellation behaviour.Twenty-five patients with left spatial neglect after right-hemispheric stroke were tested with a touchscreen cancellation task, once when the evenly distributed targets were stationary, and once when the identic targets moved with constant speed on a random path. The integrity of the right optic radiation was analysed by means of a hodologic probabilistic approach.Motion influenced the cancellation behaviour of neglect patients, and the direction of this influence (i.e., an increase or decrease of neglect severity) was modulated by the integrity of the right optic radiation. In patients with an intact optic radiation, the severity of neglect significantly decreased in the dynamic condition. Conversely, in patients with damage to the optic radiation, the severity of neglect significantly increased in the dynamic condition.Motion may influence neglect in stroke patients. The integrity of the optic radiation may be a predictor of whether motion increases or decreases the severity of neglect symptoms."

Using Mondrian-type patterns comprising a number of paired sections in a range of five section-section areal ratios (including golden-sectioned pairs), participants were asked to indicate as rapidly and accurately as possible the polarity (light or dark) of the smallest section in the patterns. They were also asked to independently assess the aesthetic appeal of the patterns. No preference was found for golden-sectioned patterns, while reaction times (RTs) tended to decrease overall with increasing ratio independently of each pattern's fractal dimensionality. (Fractal dimensionality was unrelated to ratio and measured in terms of the Minkowski-Bouligand box-counting dimension). The ease of detecting the smallest section also decreased with increasing ratio, although RTs were found to be substantially slower for golden-sectioned patterns under 8-paired sectioned conditions. This was confirmed by a significant linear relationship between RT and ratio (p < .001) only when the golden-sectioned RTs were excluded [the relationship was non-significant for the full complement of ratios (p = .217)]. Image analysis revealed an absence of spatial frequencies between 4 and 8 cycles-per-degree that was exclusive to the 8-paired (golden)-sectioned patterns. The significance of this was demonstrated in a subsequent experiment by addition of uniformly distributed random noise to the patterns. This provided a uniform spatial-frequency profile for all patterns, which did not influence the decrease in RT with increasing ratio but abolished the elevated RTs to golden-sectioned patterns. This suggests that optical limitation in the form of reduced inter-neural synchronization during spatial-frequency coding may be the foundation for the perceptual effects of golden sectioning."
https://openalex.org/W2217762533,"The classical bordetellae are comprised of three subspecies that differ from broad to very limited host specificity. Although several lineages appear to have specialized to particular host species, most retain the ability to colonize and grow in mice, providing a powerful common experimental model to study their differences. One of the subspecies, Bordetella parapertussis, is composed of two distinct clades that have specialized to different hosts: one to humans (Bpphu), and the other to sheep (Bppov). While Bpphu and the other classical bordetellae can efficiently colonize mice, Bppov strains are severely defective in their ability to colonize the murine respiratory tract. Bppov genomic analysis did not reveal the loss of adherence genes, but substantial mutations and deletions of multiple genes involved in the production of O-antigen, which is required to prevent complement deposition on B. bronchiseptica and Bpphu strains. Bppov lacks O-antigen and, like O-antigen mutants of other bordetellae, is highly sensitive to murine complement-mediated killing in vitro. Based on these results, we hypothesized that Bppov failed to colonize mice because of its sensitivity to murine complement. Consistent with this, the Bppov defect in the colonization of wild type mice was not observed in mice lacking the central complement component C3. Furthermore, Bppov strains were highly susceptible to killing by murine complement, but not by sheep complement. These data demonstrate that the failure of Bppov to colonize mice is due to sensitivity to murine, but not sheep, complement, providing a mechanistic example of how specialization that accompanies expansion in one host can limit host range."

The obtained composite metal oxide film had a spherical structure with mass loading from 0.13 to 0.21 mg cm(-2). The structure and elements of the composite was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The electrochemical performance of different composite metal oxides was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD). As an active electrode material for a supercapacitor, the Co-Mn composite electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 285 Fg(-1) at current density of 1.85 Ag(-1) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The best composite electrode, Co-Mn electrode was then further studied in various electrolytes (i.e., 0.5 M KOH and 0.5 M KOH/0.04 M K3Fe(CN) 6 electrolytes). The pseudocapacitive nature of the material of Co-Mn lead to a high specific capacitance of 2.2 x 10(3) Fg(-1) and an energy density of 309 Whkg(-1) in a 0.5 M KOH/0.04 M K3Fe(CN) 6 electrolyte at a current density of 10 Ag(-1). The specific capacitance retention obtained 67% of its initial value after 750 cycles. The results indicate that the ex situ deposited composite metal oxide nanoparticles have promising potential in future practical applications."

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide that was originally isolated from ovine hypothalamic extracts on the basis of its capacity to stimulate cAMP synthesis in rat anterior pituitary cells (16Miyata A.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). The sequence of PACAP has been remarkably conserved throughout evolution, suggesting that this peptide is involved in the regulation of important biological functions (17Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and its receptors: from structure to functions.Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this role, the Drosophila homolog of mammalian PACAP has been implicated as essential for associative learning and memory processes (18Feany M.B. Quinn W.G. A neuropeptide gene defined by the Drosophila memory mutant amnesiac.Science. 1995; 268: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). PACAP is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems and regulates neuronal survival, neurotransmitter phenotype, axonal growth, and growth cone attraction (19Gonzalez B.J.

PACAP mediates its functions via binding to G protein-coupled receptor family members in both the developing and mature nervous systems (17Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and its receptors: from structure to functions.Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing CNS, PACAP decreases the population of mitotic cells and promotes neuroblast differentiation (21Lu N. DiCicco-Bloom E. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide is an autocrine inhibitor of mitosis in cultured cortical precursor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3357-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the mature brain, PACAP has been reported to act as a neurohormone, a neuromodulator, and a neurotrophic factor and to increase cell survival following various neuronal injures (22Dickson L.

Although the effect of PACAP through its G protein-coupled PAC1 receptor and the associated downstream signaling pathways have long been studied, little is known concerning the proteins that control the neurotrophic effects of PACAP. In this report, we examined the possible effect of PACAP on the expression of the DS-related gene RCAN1. We found that PACAP induced RCAN1.4 expression through cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. We characterized the RCAN1 gene promoters and identified a functional cAMP response element (CRE). Furthermore, we found that constitutive alterations of RCAN1 expression prevented PACAP-dependent neuronal differentiation. Our data reveal a new regulatory target that controls the neurotrophic actions of PACAP via CREB activation.

Ts65Dn mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained as described previously (24Roper R.J. VanHorn J.F. Cain C.C. Reeves R.H. A neural crest deficit in Down syndrome mice is associated with deficient mitotic response to Sonic hedgehog.Mech. Dev. 2009; 126: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).

PCR prescreen for genotyping the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome.BioTechniques. 2010; 48: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA amplification was performed on genomic DNA extracted from tails of neonatal mice using the following primers: forward, 5′-AAATAGTAGCATCTCATGAGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CATAGTGCATCTTAGACAAGC-3′. The amplified PCR fragments were digested with SacI (New England Biolabs) and visualized on a 2.0% agarose gel containing GelStar stain (Lonza Bioscience, Rockland, ME), resulting in three bands of 246, 175, and 71 bp in Ts65Dn mice and only two bands of 175 and 71 bp in littermate euploid controls. Ts65Dn neonates (P0-P1) and their littermate controls were then used for isolation of cortical neurons. Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from postnatal (P0-P1) ICR mice. Cortical hemispheres were dissected under sterile conditions, and the cells were dissociated with minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.2% trypsin. Cells were then plated onto poly-d-lysine (25 μg/ml)-coated 6-well plates for 2 h. The cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), glutamax (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 10% horse serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 1 μg of each expression vector using the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen). To obtain stable cell lines, transfected cells were selected in 250 μg/ml of G418-containing (for pcDNA-control and pcDNA-RCAN1.4) or puromycin-containing growth medium (for pRS-control and pRS-shRCAN1). The expression levels were immunoblotted with anti-RCAN1 antibody. A 1002-bp fragment of the 5′ flanking region of exon 4 of the RCAN1 gene (Gene ID no. ENSRNOG00000001979) was isolated from rat PC12 cells by genomic PCR, and the PCR products were inserted into the promoterless pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega, pGL3-RCAN1.4-luc). The 5′ deletion mutants of the RCAN1.4 promoter were produced from pGL3-RCAN1.4-luc using a PCR-based method. The putative transcription factor-binding sites in the 5′ flanking region of the RCAN1 gene were analyzed using TFSEARCH promoter analysis software. EMSA was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce Biotechnology). 4 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with biotin-labeled wild-type (5′-ACTAGGGTGTTGACGTCACCTCTTTCCA-3′) and mutant (5′-ACTAGGGTGTTGTTCTCACCTCTTTCCA-3′) CRE synthetic oligonucleotides. The reaction products were separated on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. After the oligos were fixed on the membrane by baking for 1 h at 80 °C, the membrane was incubated with a streptavidin-HRP mixture for 15 min. The membrane was then developed with a substrate solution and exposed on x-ray film. ChIP analysis was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore Corp.). Cells were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were sonicated eight times for 5 s on ice. Precleared supernatant was incubated with either anti-phospho-CREB or normal rabbit IgG antibodies overnight. Immunoprecipitated DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and amplified by PCR with primers corresponding to the RCAN1 promoter region containing the CRE. The primer pair sequences were 5′-CTTCGAGGCTCAGCAAACCTTAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGACAGGGACAAAGTGTAAGTT-3′ (reverse). Total RNA was converted into cDNA using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (TOYOBO) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The primer sequences were as follows: β-actin, 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGATAGTGATGACCTGACCGT-3′ (reverse); RCAN1.1, 5′-CATCGCCTGTCACCTGGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACAGGGGGTTGCTGAAGTT-3′ (reverse); and RCAN1.4, 5′-CTGTGTGGCAAACGGTGATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACAGGGGGTTGCTGAAGTT-3′ (reverse). All samples were run in triplicate and were normalized to β-actin. PCR amplification data were analyzed and quantified using CFX ManagerTM software version 3.0 (Bio-Rad). The cells were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, and the signals were then visualized using ECL reagent. Four days after treatment with PACAP, images of PC12 cells were acquired randomly on a computer-assisted inverted microscope. Differentiation was evaluated by counting the number of neurite-bearing cells and calculating the percentage out of the total number of cells in a field. Cells with at least one neurite with a length greater than the diameter of the cell body were counted as neurite-bearing cells. PC12 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized for transfection efficiency using a β-galactosidase-expressing vector (pCMV5.lacZ) and the Galacto-Star system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometric scans of Western blot analyses were quantified using ImageJ software. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance between two groups was performed using Student's t test. Differences between two means with p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The RCAN1 gene has been shown to undergo differential promoter usage to produce different isoforms (Fig. 1A) (3Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomic organization, alternative splicing, and expression patterns of the DSCR1 (Down syndrome candidate region 1) gene.Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the neurotrophic peptide PACAP could affect the steady-state level of RCAN1, neuronal PC12 cells were treated with PACAP, and the changes in RCAN1 expression were examined at various time points up to 24 h. By immunoblot analysis, we observed that the application of 10 nm PACAP induced a time-dependent increase in RCAN1.4 protein expression (Fig. 1, B and C). The increase of RCAN1.4 protein expression in response to PACAP reached a maximum level 3 h after treatment and decreased thereafter (Fig. 1, B and C). However, RCAN1.1 levels remained constant throughout PACAP treatment. The PACAP-mediated increase of RCAN1.4 protein expression was observed with concentrations of PACAP of up to 100 nm (Fig. 1, D and E). The increase in RCAN1.4 expression in response to PACAP was observed consistently in primary cortical neurons, confirming the effect of PACAP on RCAN1.4 protein induction in neurons (Fig. 1, F and G). Collectively, these results indicate that PACAP can effectively induce RCAN1.4 protein expression. We next analyzed the expression of RCAN1 transcripts in response to PACAP using quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistently, we found that PACAP treatment caused a time-dependent accumulation of RCAN1.4 but not RCAN1.1 transcripts (Fig. 2, A and B). To examine the mechanisms for increased RCAN1.4 expression in response to PACAP, we first examined whether RCAN1 mRNA induction was dependent on transcription. For this experiment, PC12 cells were preincubated with actinomycin D for 10 min to prevent de novo RNA synthesis prior to PACAP treatment, and RCAN1.4 mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2C, RCAN1.4 mRNA induction in response to PACAP was attenuated significantly by pretreatment with actinomycin D, suggesting that PACAP-mediated RCAN1.4 induction is due to increased gene transcription. The involvement of RCAN1.4 transcription in response to PACAP was further supported by inhibition of RCAN1.4 protein expression with actinomycin D (Fig. 2D). To investigate PACAP-induced RCAN1.4 transcription in PC12 cells, we isolated a 1002-bp fragment of the 5′ flanking region of exon 4 of the rat RCAN1 gene from genomic DNA by PCR (Fig. 2E). The PCR products were then inserted into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic. The resulting RCAN1.4-luc plasmid was transiently transfected into PC12 cells, and reporter activity was measured (Fig. 2F). As shown in Fig. 2F, PACAP induced increased RCAN1.4 promoter activity compared with untreated cells. These results demonstrate that transcriptional activation is related to RCAN1.4 up-regulation in response to PACAP. Previous studies have identified a variety of signaling cascades triggered by PACAP (26Vaudry D. Falluel-Morel A. Bourgault S. Basille M. Burel D. Wurtz O. Fournier A. Chow B.K. Hashimoto H. Galas L. Vaudry H. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and its receptors: 20 years after the discovery.Pharmacol. Rev. 2009; 61: 283-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Because PKA is one of the major intracellular effectors activated by PACAP, we set out to determine whether PKA is required for the PACAP-induced increase in RCAN1.4 expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, pharmacological inhibition of PKA with a well known inhibitor, H-89, prevented PACAP-induced RCAN1.4 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. We then examined whether PKA mediated the stimulatory effect of PACAP on RCAN1.4 promoter activity. We consistently observed that PKA inhibition significantly prevented PACAP-induced RCAN1.4 transcription (Fig. 3B). To further determine whether PACAP requires PKA signaling to increase RCAN1.4 promoter activity, we examined the effect of CREB, one of the downstream targets of PKA. For this experiment, we expressed dominant-negative mutant CREB, such as S133A-CREB and A-CREB, which are known to prevent the transcriptional activation of CREB, prior to PACAP treatment in PC12 cells (27Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. A dominant-negative inhibitor of CREB reveals that it is a general mediator of stimulus-dependent transcription of c-fos.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3C, S133A-CREB and A-CREB expression significantly prevented increased RCAN1.4 reporter activity in response to PACAP. Taken together, these results indicate that the PKA-CREB pathway mediates the stimulatory effect of PACAP on RCAN1.4 expression. The MEK-ERK pathways have been shown to be activated by PACAP (28Sakai Y. Hashimoto H. Shintani N. Katoh H. Negishi M. Kawaguchi C. Kasai A. Baba A. PACAP activates Rac1 and synergizes with NGF to activate ERK1/2, thereby inducing neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells.Brain Res. Mol.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cultured rat astrocytes.Brain Res. 1998; 795: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We next determined whether the MEK-ERK signaling pathways were involved in the PACAP-induced RCAN1 expression. As shown in Fig. 3D, although both U0126 and PD98059 efficiently blocked PACAP-induced ERK phosphorylation, the increased RCAN1 expression level in response to PACAP was not altered, indicating that the MEK-ERK pathways are not involved in PACAP-dependent RCAN1 induction. PACAP stimulates the calcium current by inducing both Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from extracellular fluid in a variety of cells (30Tatsuno I. Arimura A. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) mobilizes intracellular free calcium in cultured rat type-2, but not type-1, astrocytes.Brain Res. 1994; 662: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We next determined whether the increased calcium level in response to PACAP is crucial for RCAN1 induction. For this experiment, cells were preincubated with BAPTA-AM and EGTA, Ca2+ chelators (Fig. 3E). As shown in Fig. 3E, neither of these reagents had any effect on PACAP-dependent RCAN1 induction, indicating that increased calcium is not involved in RCAN1 induction. To identify the PACAP-responsive region of the RCAN1 promoter, we constructed a series of 5′-truncated luciferase reporter plasmids containing different upstream deletions of the RCAN1 promoter (Fig. 4A). The pRCAN1.4-Δ1, pRCAN1.4-Δ2, and pRCAN1.4-Δ3 inserts are the fragments of the RCAN1 promoter from −505, −314, and −189 bp to +1 bp, respectively (Fig. 4A). Reporter activity measured from the transient transfections with these plasmids into PC12 cells revealed that the promoter region between −314 to +1 bp (pRCAN1.4-Δ2) had a higher basal activity compared with other constructs and that PACAP augmented its promoter activity (Fig. 4B). The deletion of an additional 125 bp from −314 had no inductive effect on promoter activity in response to PACAP (pRCAN1.4-Δ3) (Fig. 4B). Therefore, it appears that the regulatory elements between nucleotides −314 and −189 of the RCAN1.4 promoter are responsible for the PACAP-dependent induction of its activity.FIGURE 4PACAP induces CREB binding to the RCAN1 promoter.

This method presumes that attention itself does not influence emotional processes, which could bias sampling. We tested whether attention influences experienced utility (the moment-by-moment experience of pleasure) by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the activity of brain systems thought to represent hedonic value while manipulating attentional load. Subjects received appetitive or aversive solutions orally while alternatively executing a low or high attentional load task. Brain regions associated with hedonic processing, including the ventral striatum, showed a response to both juice and quinine. This response decreased during the high-load task relative to the low-load task. Thus, attentional allocation may influence experienced utility by modulating (either directly or indirectly) the activity of brain mechanisms thought to represent hedonic value."

However, the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenotype remains unknown. Herein, we reported for the first time that the deregulated expression of Ddr2 cognate ligand, namely collagen type I (COL1), may account for the disruption of the testicular steroidogenesis in Ddr2slie/slie mutant testes. Methodology/Principal Findings Expression of Ddr2 increased gradually along postnatal development, whereas COL1 expression became negligible from adulthood onwards. In Ddr2slie/slie mutant testis, however, in contrast to the undetectable staining of Ddr2, COL1 expression was constantly detected, with the highest values detected during adulthood. In the experimental vasectomy model, Ddr2slie/slie mutant mice exhibited an early androgen deficiency than wild-type mice, along with the accumulation of fibrotic tissue in the interstitium. Functionally, ablation of endogenous Ddr2 resulted in a significant decrease of testosterone (T) level in TM3 cells in the presence of higher concentration of COL1 treatment. Conversely, overexpression of Ddr2 could help TM3 cells to maintain a normal testicular steroidogenesis even in the presence of high concentration of COL1. Additionally, attenuated expression of Ddr2 correlates to the deregulated level of serum T levels in human pathological testes. Conclusions Abnormal accumulation of interstitial COL1 may be responsible for the steroidogenic dysfunction in Ddr2slie/slie mutant testes."
https://openalex.org/W765241179,"As DRAM is facing the scaling difficulty in terms of energy cost and reliability, some nonvolatile storage materials were proposed to be the substitute or supplement of main memory. Phase Change Memory (PCM) is one of the most promising nonvolatile memory that could be put into use in the near future. However, before becoming a qualified main memory technology, PCM should be designed reliably so that it can ensure the computer system's stable running even when errors occur. The typical wear-out errors in PCM have been well studied, but the transient errors, that caused by high-energy particles striking on the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit of PCM chips or by resistance drifting in multi-level cell PCM, have attracted little focus. In this paper, we propose an innovative mechanism, Local-ECC-Global-ECPs (LEGE), which addresses both soft errors and hard errors (wear-out errors) in PCM memory systems. Our idea is to deploy a local error correction code (ECC) section to every data line, which can detect and correct one-bit errors immediately, and a global error correction pointers (ECPs) buffer for the whole memory chip, which can be reloaded to correct more hard error bits. The local ECC is used to detect and correct the unknown one-bit errors, and the global ECPs buffer is used to store the corrected value of hard errors. In comparison to ECP-6, our method provides almost identical lifetimes, but reduces approximately 50% storage overhead. Moreover, our structure reduces approximately 3.55% access latency overhead by increasing 1.61% storage overhead compared to PAYG, a hard error only solution."
