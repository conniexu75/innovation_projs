https://openalex.org/W4289638016,"Abstract Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death marked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation 1 , has a key role in organ injury, degenerative disease and vulnerability of therapy-resistant cancers 2 . Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular processes relevant to ferroptosis, additional cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic processes that determine cell sensitivity toward ferroptosis remain unknown. Here we show that the fully reduced forms of vitamin K—a group of naphthoquinones that includes menaquinone and phylloquinone 3 —confer a strong anti-ferroptotic function, in addition to the conventional function linked to blood clotting by acting as a cofactor for γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), a NAD(P)H-ubiquinone reductase and the second mainstay of ferroptosis control after glutathione peroxidase-4 4,5 , was found to efficiently reduce vitamin K to its hydroquinone, a potent radical-trapping antioxidant and inhibitor of (phospho)lipid peroxidation. The FSP1-mediated reduction of vitamin K was also responsible for the antidotal effect of vitamin K against warfarin poisoning. It follows that FSP1 is the enzyme mediating warfarin-resistant vitamin K reduction in the canonical vitamin K cycle 6 . The FSP1-dependent non-canonical vitamin K cycle can act to protect cells against detrimental lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis."

The advent of long-read sequencing technologies offers the opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in transcript structure8-16. In this Article, we present a large human long-read RNA-seq dataset using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform from 88 samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) tissues and cell lines, complementing the GTEx resource. We identified just over 70,000 novel transcripts for annotated genes, and validated the protein expression of 10% of novel transcripts. We developed a new computational package, LORALS, to analyse the genetic effects of rare and common variants on the transcriptome by allele-specific analysis of long reads. We characterized allele-specific expression and transcript structure events, providing new insights into the specific transcript alterations caused by common and rare genetic variants and highlighting the resolution gained from long-read data. We were able to perturb the transcript structure upon knockdown of PTBP1, an RNA binding protein that mediates splicing, thereby finding genetic regulatory effects that are modified by the cellular environment. Finally, we used this dataset to enhance variant interpretation and study rare variants leading to aberrant splicing patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4289637606,"Glucose uptake is essential for cancer glycolysis and is involved in non-shivering thermogenesis of adipose tissues1-6. Most cancers use glycolysis to harness energy for their infinite growth, invasion and metastasis2,7,8. Activation of thermogenic metabolism in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by cold and drugs instigates blood glucose uptake in adipocytes4,5,9. However, the functional effects of the global metabolic changes associated with BAT activation on tumour growth are unclear. Here we show that exposure of tumour-bearing mice to cold conditions markedly inhibits the growth of various types of solid tumours, including clinically untreatable cancers such as pancreatic cancers. Mechanistically, cold-induced BAT activation substantially decreases blood glucose and impedes the glycolysis-based metabolism in cancer cells. The removal of BAT and feeding on a high-glucose diet under cold exposure restore tumour growth, and genetic deletion of Ucp1-the key mediator for BAT-thermogenesis-ablates the cold-triggered anticancer effect. In a pilot human study, mild cold exposure activates a substantial amount of BAT in both healthy humans and a patient with cancer with mitigated glucose uptake in the tumour tissue. These findings provide a previously undescribed concept and paradigm for cancer therapy that uses a simple and effective approach. We anticipate that cold exposure and activation of BAT through any other approach, such as drugs and devices either alone or in combination with other anticancer therapeutics, will provide a general approach for the effective treatment of various cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4289638372,"Abstract Risk management has reduced vulnerability to floods and droughts globally 1,2 , yet their impacts are still increasing 3 . An improved understanding of the causes of changing impacts is therefore needed, but has been hampered by a lack of empirical data 4,5 . On the basis of a global dataset of 45 pairs of events that occurred within the same area, we show that risk management generally reduces the impacts of floods and droughts but faces difficulties in reducing the impacts of unprecedented events of a magnitude not previously experienced. If the second event was much more hazardous than the first, its impact was almost always higher. This is because management was not designed to deal with such extreme events: for example, they exceeded the design levels of levees and reservoirs. In two success stories, the impact of the second, more hazardous, event was lower, as a result of improved risk management governance and high investment in integrated management. The observed difficulty of managing unprecedented events is alarming, given that more extreme hydrological events are projected owing to climate change 3 ."

https://openalex.org/W4225531481,"Non-Hermitian theory is a theoretical framework that excels at describing open systems. It offers a powerful tool in the characterization of both the intrinsic degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a system and the interactions with the external environment. The non-Hermitian framework consists of mathematical structures that are fundamentally different from those of Hermitian theories. These structures not only underpin novel approaches for precisely tailoring non-Hermitian systems for applications but also give rise to topologies not found in Hermitian systems. In this paper, we comprehensively review non-Hermitian topology by establishing its relationship with the behaviors of complex eigenvalues and biorthogonal eigenvectors. Special attentions are given to exceptional points - branch-point singularities on the complex eigenvalue manifolds that exhibit non-trivial topological properties. We also discuss recent developments in non-Hermitian band topology, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Hermitian topological classifications"
https://openalex.org/W4289637911,"A major challenge in human genetics is to identify the molecular mechanisms of trait-associated and disease-associated variants. To achieve this, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of genetic variants with intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and splicing have been widely adopted1,2. However, despite successes, the molecular basis for a considerable fraction of trait-associated and disease-associated variants remains unclear3,4. Here we show that ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, a post-transcriptional event vital for suppressing cellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated innate immune interferon responses5-11, is an important potential mechanism underlying genetic variants associated with common inflammatory diseases. We identified and characterized 30,319 cis-RNA editing QTLs (edQTLs) across 49 human tissues. These edQTLs were significantly enriched in genome-wide association study signals for autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases. Colocalization analysis of edQTLs with disease risk loci further pinpointed key, putatively immunogenic dsRNAs formed by expected inverted repeat Alu elements as well as unexpected, highly over-represented cis-natural antisense transcripts. Furthermore, inflammatory disease risk variants, in aggregate, were associated with reduced editing of nearby dsRNAs and induced interferon responses in inflammatory diseases. This unique directional effect agrees with the established mechanism that lack of RNA editing by ADAR1 leads to the specific activation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 and subsequent interferon responses and inflammation7-9. Our findings implicate cellular dsRNA editing and sensing as a previously underappreciated mechanism of common inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4289638129,"Abstract Antibiotics that use novel mechanisms are needed to combat antimicrobial resistance 1–3 . Teixobactin 4 represents a new class of antibiotics with a unique chemical scaffold and lack of detectable resistance. Teixobactin targets lipid II, a precursor of peptidoglycan 5 . Here we unravel the mechanism of teixobactin at the atomic level using a combination of solid-state NMR, microscopy, in vivo assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The unique enduracididine C-terminal headgroup of teixobactin specifically binds to the pyrophosphate-sugar moiety of lipid II, whereas the N terminus coordinates the pyrophosphate of another lipid II molecule. This configuration favours the formation of a β-sheet of teixobactins bound to the target, creating a supramolecular fibrillar structure. Specific binding to the conserved pyrophosphate-sugar moiety accounts for the lack of resistance to teixobactin 4 . The supramolecular structure compromises membrane integrity. Atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the supramolecular structure displaces phospholipids, thinning the membrane. The long hydrophobic tails of lipid II concentrated within the supramolecular structure apparently contribute to membrane disruption. Teixobactin hijacks lipid II to help destroy the membrane. Known membrane-acting antibiotics also damage human cells, producing undesirable side effects. Teixobactin damages only membranes that contain lipid II, which is absent in eukaryotes, elegantly resolving the toxicity problem. The two-pronged action against cell wall synthesis and cytoplasmic membrane produces a highly effective compound targeting the bacterial cell envelope. Structural knowledge of the mechanism of teixobactin will enable the rational design of improved drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W4289637601,"Indium gallium nitride (InGaN)-based micro-LEDs (μLEDs) are suitable for meeting ever-increasing demands for high-performance displays owing to their high efficiency, brightness and stability1-5. However, μLEDs have a large problem in that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) decreases with the size reduction6-9. Here we demonstrate a blue InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) nanorod-LED (nLED) with high EQE. To overcome the size-dependent EQE reduction problem8,9, we studied the interaction between the GaN surface and the sidewall passivation layer through various analyses. Minimizing the point defects created during the passivation process is crucial to manufacturing high-performance nLEDs. Notably, the sol-gel method is advantageous for the passivation because SiO2 nanoparticles are adsorbed on the GaN surface, thereby minimizing its atomic interactions. The fabricated nLEDs showed an EQE of 20.2 ± 0.6%, the highest EQE value ever reported for the LED in the nanoscale. This work opens the way for manufacturing self-emissive nLED displays that can become an enabling technology for next-generation displays."

https://openalex.org/W4289638315,"The human immune system is composed of a distributed network of cells circulating throughout the body, which must dynamically form physical associations and communicate using interactions between their cell-surface proteomes1. Despite their therapeutic potential2, our map of these surface interactions remains incomplete3,4. Here, using a high-throughput surface receptor screening method, we systematically mapped the direct protein interactions across a recombinant library that encompasses most of the surface proteins that are detectable on human leukocytes. We independently validated and determined the biophysical parameters of each novel interaction, resulting in a high-confidence and quantitative view of the receptor wiring that connects human immune cells. By integrating our interactome with expression data, we identified trends in the dynamics of immune interactions and constructed a reductionist mathematical model that predicts cellular connectivity from basic principles. We also developed an interactive multi-tissue single-cell atlas that infers immune interactions throughout the body, revealing potential functional contexts for new interactions and hubs in multicellular networks. Finally, we combined targeted protein stimulation of human leukocytes with multiplex high-content microscopy to link our receptor interactions to functional roles, in terms of both modulating immune responses and maintaining normal patterns of intercellular associations. Together, our work provides a systematic perspective on the intercellular wiring of the human immune system that extends from systems-level principles of immune cell connectivity down to mechanistic characterization of individual receptors, which could offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W4289593678,"After cessation of blood flow or similar ischaemic exposures, deleterious molecular cascades commence in mammalian cells, eventually leading to their death1,2. Yet with targeted interventions, these processes can be mitigated or reversed, even minutes or hours post mortem, as also reported in the isolated porcine brain using BrainEx technology3. To date, translating single-organ interventions to intact, whole-body applications remains hampered by circulatory and multisystem physiological challenges. Here we describe OrganEx, an adaptation of the BrainEx extracorporeal pulsatile-perfusion system and cytoprotective perfusate for porcine whole-body settings. After 1 h of warm ischaemia, OrganEx application preserved tissue integrity, decreased cell death and restored selected molecular and cellular processes across multiple vital organs. Commensurately, single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed organ- and cell-type-specific gene expression patterns that are reflective of specific molecular and cellular repair processes. Our analysis comprises a comprehensive resource of cell-type-specific changes during defined ischaemic intervals and perfusion interventions spanning multiple organs, and it reveals an underappreciated potential for cellular recovery after prolonged whole-body warm ischaemia in a large mammal."
https://openalex.org/W4289637660,"Mating and aggression are innate social behaviours that are controlled by subcortical circuits in the extended amygdala and hypothalamus1-4. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr) is a node that receives input encoding sex-specific olfactory cues from the medial amygdala5,6, and which in turn projects to hypothalamic nuclei that control mating7-9 (medial preoptic area (MPOA)) and aggression9-14 (ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision (VMHvl)), respectively15. Previous studies have demonstrated that male aromatase-positive BNSTpr neurons are required for mounting and attack, and may identify conspecific sex according to their overall level of activity16. However, neural representations in BNSTpr, their function and their transformations in the hypothalamus have not been characterized. Here we performed calcium imaging17,18 of male BNSTprEsr1 neurons during social behaviours. We identify distinct populations of female- versus male-tuned neurons in BNSTpr, with the former outnumbering the latter by around two to one, similar to the medial amygdala and MPOA but opposite to VMHvl, in which male-tuned neurons predominate6,9,19. Chemogenetic silencing of BNSTprEsr1 neurons while imaging MPOAEsr1 or VMHvlEsr1 neurons in behaving animals showed, unexpectedly, that the male-dominant sex-tuning bias in VMHvl was inverted to female-dominant whereas a switch from sniff- to mount-selective neurons during mating was attenuated in MPOA. Our data also indicate that BNSTprEsr1 neurons are not essential for conspecific sex identification. Rather, they control the transition from appetitive to consummatory phases of male social behaviours by shaping sex- and behaviour-specific neural representations in the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W4289637706,"Abstract Dividing eukaryotic cells package extremely long chromosomal DNA molecules into discrete bodies to enable microtubule-mediated transport of one genome copy to each of the newly forming daughter cells 1–3 . Assembly of mitotic chromosomes involves DNA looping by condensin 4–8 and chromatin compaction by global histone deacetylation 9–13 . Although condensin confers mechanical resistance to spindle pulling forces 14–16 , it is not known how histone deacetylation affects material properties and, as a consequence, segregation mechanics of mitotic chromosomes. Here we show how global histone deacetylation at the onset of mitosis induces a chromatin-intrinsic phase transition that endows chromosomes with the physical characteristics necessary for their precise movement during cell division. Deacetylation-mediated compaction of chromatin forms a structure dense in negative charge and allows mitotic chromosomes to resist perforation by microtubules as they are pushed to the metaphase plate. By contrast, hyperacetylated mitotic chromosomes lack a defined surface boundary, are frequently perforated by microtubules and are prone to missegregation. Our study highlights the different contributions of DNA loop formation and chromatin phase separation to genome segregation in dividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W4289638081,"Bacteria encode myriad defences that target the genomes of infecting bacteriophage, including restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems1. In response, one family of large bacteriophages uses a nucleus-like compartment to protect its replicating genomes by excluding host defence factors2-4. However, the principal composition and structure of this compartment remain unknown. Here we find that the bacteriophage nuclear shell assembles primarily from one protein, which we name chimallin (ChmA). Combining cryo-electron tomography of nuclear shells in bacteriophage-infected cells and cryo-electron microscopy of a minimal chimallin compartment in vitro, we show that chimallin self-assembles as a flexible sheet into closed micrometre-scale compartments. The architecture and assembly dynamics of the chimallin shell suggest mechanisms for its nucleation and growth, and its role as a scaffold for phage-encoded factors mediating macromolecular transport, cytoskeletal interactions, and viral maturation."

However, infection by all three viruses results in substantial apoptosis in cell culture5-7 and in patient tissues8-10, suggesting a potential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that caspase-6, a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstrate that caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins, generating fragments that serve as interferon antagonists, thus facilitating virus replication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss in golden Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 and improves the survival of mice expressing human DPP4 that are infected with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV. Our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a component of the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication."

We randomly assigned patients to receive intravenous anakinra plus optimized standard of care (oSOC) vs. oSOC alone. The primary outcome was treatment success at day 14 defined as patient alive and not requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.Between 27th April and 6th October 2020, we enrolled 71 patients (240 patients planned to been enrolled): 37 were assigned to the anakinra group and 34 to oSOC group. The study ended prematurely by recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board due to safety concerns. On day 14, the proportion of treatment success was significantly lower in the anakinra group 70% (n = 26) vs. 91% (n = 31) in the oSOC group: risk difference-21 percentage points (95% CI, -39 to -2), odds ratio 0.23 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.91), p = 0.027. After a 28-day follow-up, 9 patients in the anakinra group and 3 in the oSOC group had died.

Serious adverse events occurred in 19 (51%) patients in the anakinra group and 18 (53%) in the oSOC group (p = 0·89).This trial did not show efficacy of anakinra in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, contrary to our hypothesis, we found that anakinra was inferior to oSOC in patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4289637912,"Generation of silicic magmas leads to emplacement of granite plutons, huge explosive volcanic eruptions and physical and chemical zoning of continental and arc crust1-7. Whereas timescales for silicic magma generation in the deep and middle crust are prolonged8, magma transfer into the upper crust followed by eruption is episodic and can be rapid9-12. Ages of inherited zircons and sanidines from four Miocene ignimbrites in the Central Andes indicate a gap of 4.6 Myr between initiation of pluton emplacement and onset of super-eruptions, with a 1-Myr cyclicity. We show that inherited zircons and sanidine crystals were stored at temperatures <470 °C in these plutons before incorporation in ignimbrite magmas. Our observations can be explained by silicic melt segregation in a middle-crustal hot zone with episodic melt ascent from an unstable layer at the top of the zone with a timescale governed by the rheology of the upper crust. After thermal incubation of growing plutons, large upper-crustal magma chambers can form in a few thousand years or less by dike transport from the hot-zone melt layer. Instability and disruption of earlier plutonic rock occurred in a few decades or less just before or during super-eruptions."

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety in university students in China and Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant factors contributing to the prevalence of anxiety and depression, the differences in factors affecting the different groups being investigated and to emphasize that psychological intervention are as important as the physical interventions during and after the pandemic. The study was conducted through online surveys, with 684 participants using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 standardized scales. Comparing all groups combined, of the 636 participants, 361 (56.8%) had depression and 227 (35.7%) had anxiety. Chi squared tests at significance level (P&lt;0.05) showed that country of citizenship, religion, parents’ educational background, household monthly income and, having family members with COVID-19 variables were strongly associated with depression and anxiety. In contrast, age, gender, educational background, and major showed no significant association. Comparing the individual groups separately using chi square (P&lt;0.05), the Chinese students in China group had 35.6% with depression and 13.1% with anxiety. The variable associated with both depression and anxiety was education major, with depression only was parent’s educational background and with anxiety only was gender. The African students in China group had 70.3% with depression and 45.0% with anxiety. Gender was strongly associated with both depression and anxiety, and religion and having family members with COVID-19 with anxiety only. Africans in Africa had 66.0% with depression and 50.5% with anxiety. Educational background was strongly associated with depression. There was no statistically significant variable for anxiety. Chi square test showed a statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety levels with the Chinese group compared to both African groups, and no significant difference between both African groups. Our findings demonstrated that COVID-19 had a negative psychological impact on university students. Therefore, more attention should be put on youth’s mental health during this pandemic."

We exposed mouse islets and INS-1E cells to a low dose of IL-1β and/or butyrate and measured expression of inflammatory genes and nitric oxide (NO) production. Additionally, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying butyrate activity by dissecting the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. We found that butyrate suppressed IL-1β-induced expression of inflammatory genes, such as Nos2, Cxcl1, and Ptgs2, and reduced NO production. Butyrate did not inhibit IκBα degradation nor NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, butyrate did not affect binding of NF-κB p65 to target sequences in synthetic DNA but inhibited NF-κB p65 binding and RNA polymerase II recruitment to inflammatory gene promoters in the context of native DNA. We found this was concurrent with increased acetylation of NF-κB p65 and histone H4, suggesting butyrate affects NF-κB activity via inhibition of histone deacetylases.

It is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with common complications such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney, and neuronal damage (1International Diabetes FederationIDF Diabetes Atlas.10th Ed.

Metab. 2014; 306: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a dimeric transcription factor consisting of homodimers or heterodimers of p50 and/or p65. In its inactive state, NF-κB is bound to IκB inhibitory proteins in the cytoplasm. Upon stimuli by cytokines such as IL-1β, the IκB kinase phosphorylates IκB, which in turn induces ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of IκB. This allows nuclear translocation of NF-κB that binds specific DNA elements and subsequent assembly of the transcriptional machinery which initiates transcription (28Bhatt D. Ghosh S. Regulation of the NF-κB-mediated transcription of inflammatory genes.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Regulation of NF-κB activity occurs at multiple levels and thus, identifying inhibitors of the activation has the potential to be an effective approach to prevent IL-1β-induced beta cell dysfunction.Short-chain fatty acids, predominately butyrate, propionate, and acetate, are products of bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the gut (29Hugenholtz F.

Two main mechanisms have been suggested: (1) inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) leading to increased acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins and (2) binding to the free fatty receptor 2 (FFAR2) and FFAR3 (46Zhang L.

Zhu K. Sheng C. Zhou F. et al.Sodium butyrate potentiates insulin secretion from rat islets at the expense of compromised expression of β cell identity genes.Cell Death Dis. 2022; 13: 67Google Scholar). For example, acetate and butyrate prevent oxidative and nitrosative stress (53Hu S. Kuwabara R. de Haan B.J. Smink A.M. de Vos P. Acetate and butyrate improve β-cell metabolism and mitochondrial respiration under oxidative stress.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 1542Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and recently, we found that butyrate protects pancreatic beta cells from IL-1β-induced impairment of insulin secretion and decreased insulin content (52Prause M. Pedersen S.S. Tsonkova V. Qiao M. Billestrup N. Butyrate protects pancreatic beta cells from cytokine-induced dysfunction.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 10427Google Scholar). Transcriptomic analysis showed that the protective effects are particularly associated with downregulation of inflammatory genes, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role of butyrate in beta cells (52Prause M. Pedersen S.S. Tsonkova V. Qiao M. Billestrup N. Butyrate protects pancreatic beta cells from cytokine-induced dysfunction.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 10427Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which butyrate may mediate lower inflammation in beta cells are unknown. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, in the present study, we investigated the effects of butyrate on inflammatory gene expression with focus on Nos2 transcription and the NF-κB signaling pathway in mouse islets and the insulin-secreting cell line INS-1E.ResultsButyrate inhibits IL-1β-induced expression of inflammatory genes in mouse islets and INS-1E cellsTo investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of butyrate in mouse islets and INS-1E cells, we measured the expression of selected inflammatory genes by RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure 1A, long-term exposure (10 days) of mouse islets to a noncytotoxic concentration of IL-1β (50 pg/ml) strongly increased the gene expression of the inflammation-associated enzymes Nos2 (encoding iNOS) and Ptgs2 (encoding cyclooxygenase 2), the chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl10 and the stress responder Gadd45b. In presence of butyrate (0.2 mM), the IL-1β-induced expression of Cxcl10 and Gadd45b mRNAs in islets was completely prevented and more than 60% reduced for Nos2, Ptgs2, and Cxcl1 mRNAs. Butyrate alone also significantly reduced the basal expression of Cxcl10 and Gadd45b (Fig. 1A). At the protein level, IL-1β-induced CXCL1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion into the medium was also decreased in islets co-exposed to butyrate, whereas IL-6 protein levels were unaffected by butyrate in IL-1β-exposed islets (Fig. S1).Mouse islets are clusters of different cell types, so in order to investigate the direct effect of butyrate on IL-1β-induced beta cell dysfunction, we used the insulin-secreting cell line INS-1E. INS-1E cells were exposed to IL-1β (12.5 pg/ml) for 3 days, which is known to impair glucose-stimulated insulin release (52Prause M. Pedersen S.S. Tsonkova V. Qiao M. Billestrup N. Butyrate protects pancreatic beta cells from cytokine-induced dysfunction.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 10427Google Scholar). We found that the expression of inflammatory genes was significantly increased compared to unexposed cells (Fig. 1B). When cells were co-exposed to IL-1β and butyrate (0.4 mM), we observed that the expression of Nos2, Ptgs2, and Gadd45b was significantly reduced (Fig. 1B). Butyrate did not downregulate the IL-1β-induced expression of the chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl10 (Fig. 1B) in INS-1E cells in contrast to what was observed in islets. IL-1β-induced Cxcl10 mRNA was even further upregulated by butyrate (Fig. 1B).Since several feedback and regulatory events may influence IL-1β-regulated gene expression after 3 days, we also investigated the early effects after 6 h exposure to IL-1β and butyrate. After 6 h, butyrate reduced IL-1β-induced expression of Nos2 and Ptgs2 by 80% and Cxcl1 by 25%, while the expression of Cxcl10 and Gadd45b was not affected (Fig. 1C). Together, these results show that in mouse islets, butyrate partly or completely prevents the expression of inflammatory genes induced by IL-1β and that the anti-inflammatory effect of butyrate in INS-1E cells is gene-specific and time-dependent.Butyrate inhibits IL-1β-induced Nos2 promoter activity, iNOS expression, and NO productionTo get insight into the mechanisms by which butyrate inhibits inflammatory gene expression, we focused on the effect of butyrate on Nos2 transcription in INS-1E cells. Nos2 encodes iNOS, an enzyme that produces NO, which has detrimental effects on beta cell function (15Kutlu B. Cardozo A.K. Darville M.I. Kruhøffer M. Magnusson N.

Interleukin-1b-Induced nitric oxide synthase expression by rat pancreatic P-cells : evidence for the involvement of nuclear factor KB in the signaling mechanism.Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4790-4795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether butyrate inhibited IL-1β-induced Nos2 mRNA expression at the level of transcription, INS-1E cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the Nos2 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene. Cells were then exposed to IL-1β, butyrate, or the combination for 6 h as other groups have shown a maximum induction of Nos2 expression by IL-1β at this time point (55Niemann A. Bjiirklund A. Eizirik D.L. Studies on the molecular regulation of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in insulin-producing cells.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that IL-1β increased Nos2 promoter luciferase activity, but in presence of butyrate, the IL-1β-induced response was significantly reduced by 60% (Fig. 2A). Butyrate alone also decreased basal promoter activity (Fig. 2A). Moreover, IL-1β-induced iNOS protein expression was inhibited by butyrate after both 6 and 72 h (Fig. 2B). NO production, as measured by nitrite levels in the cell culture medium, was significantly induced by IL-1β after 6 and 72 h exposure and was significantly reduced by butyrate (Fig. 2C). In mouse islets, a similar effect of butyrate on IL-1β-induced NO formation was observed after 5 days exposure (Fig. 2C). Together, these results show that butyrate downregulates IL-1β-induced Nos2 promoter activity, which leads to decreased iNOS protein level and NO production.Figure 2Nos2 promoter activity, iNOS protein level, and"

Another relevant variable shown to affect affinity is composition of the CD16a asparagine-linked (N)-glycans. It is currently not known how N-glycan composition affects CD16a F158 affinity. Here, we determined N-glycan composition affects the V158 and F158 allotypes similarly, and N-glycan composition does not explain differences in V158 and F158 binding affinity. Our analysis of binding kinetics indicated the N162 glycan slows the binding event, and shortening the N-glycans or removing the N162 glycan increased the speed of binding.

Though these correlations are known, it is not known how a single amino acid substitution in this receptor affects the ligand-binding affinity.In addition to the CD16a residue at 158, glycosylation was recently shown to affect antibody-binding affinity. CD16a is a transmembrane receptor modified with five asparagine(N)-linked carbohydrates (glycans). N-glycans on secreted proteins exhibit a high degree of compositional heterogeneity due to the template-independent glycan processing in the ER and Golgi (18Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). CD16a exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity. Among the five N-glycosylation sites, N162 appears the most heterogeneous on CD16a isolated from primary human cells (19Patel K.R. Nott J.D. Barb A.W. Primary human natural killer cells retain proinflammatory IgG1 at the cell surface and express CD16a glycoforms with donor-dependent variability.Mol. Cell.

Proteomics. 2020; 19: 362-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD16a V158 N162 glycan heterogeneity impacts Fc-binding affinity. Minimally processed oligomannose glycans, present on CD16a isolated from human donors, provide greater affinity than highly processed complex-type glycans on CD16a (21Patel K.R. Roberts J.T.

It is not currently known how the N162 N-glycan composition affects the antibody-binding affinity of the CD16a F158 allotype.We investigated the structural and functional consequences of a phenylalanine residue at CD16a position 158 relative to a valine. We first characterized the impact of N-glycans on antibody-binding affinity by CD16a F158. Next, we identified backbone and N-glycan atoms that were differentially affected by V158 and F158 using NMR spectroscopy. These data provide insight into the unique structural and functional characteristics of the predominant CD16a F158 allotype with atomic-level resolution.ResultsStructural similarity of V158 and F158Multiple examples of the CD16a V158 structure from X-ray crystallography are reported and are highly similar (24Ferrara C.

Biol. 2018; 13: 2179-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As of this writing, no models of the F158 variant determined by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM are reported despite the single amino acid difference and greater prevalence in the human population. AlphaFold, however, provided a computational model for comparison (27Varadi M. Anyango S. Deshpande M. Nair S. Natassia C. Yordanova G. et al.AlphaFold protein structure database: massively expanding the structural coverage of protein-sequence space with high-accuracy models.Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50: D439-D444Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As expected, the structures of the extracellular antibody-binding domains are highly similar (Fig. 1, C and D). Subtle differences in the packing around position 158 are notable, stemming from steric contacts that prevent the F158 sidechain from occupying the same position as V158. This comparison does not clearly indicate why F158 binds weaker than V158. However, relatively small changes in binding affinity, like those noted for F158 and V158, may not result from large structural rearrangements and may be instead due to differences in conformational sampling or glycosylation that are not always identifiable in models from X-ray crystallography or AlphaFold.The effect of N-glycan composition on CD16a F158 affinityWe examined whether glycosylation explained the reported differences in affinity. Our laboratory previously determined that the composition of the N162 glycan affects CD16a V158 antibody-binding affinity (22Subedi G.P. Barb A.W. CD16a with oligomannose-type N-glycans is the only “low-affinity” Fc gamma receptor that binds the IgG crystallizable fragment with high affinity in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 16842-16850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that F158 affects N-glycan processing, weakening affinity. WT HEK293F cells expressed both CD16a V158 and F158 and are capable of performing extensive N-glycan remodeling reactions and generating complex-type N-glycoforms. SDS-PAGE showed substantial processing as both proteins migrated much higher than expected based on the predicted molecular weight of the unmodified polypeptide (50.5 kDa; Fig. S1). Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that both allotypes contain similar N162-glycans, predominantly complex-type, core fucosylated glycoforms (Fig. S2 and Table S1). A small amount of oligomannose (6%) appeared in the V158 allotype. Furthermore, a recent analysis demonstrated a high degree of N-glycan occupancy for both allotypes (28Lampros E.A. Kremer P.G. Aguilar Diaz de Leon J.S. Roberts E.T. Rodriguez Benavente M.C. Amster I.J. et al.The antibody-binding Fc gamma receptor IIIa/CD16a is N-glycosylated with high occupancy at all five sites.Curr. Res. Immunol. 2022; 3: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar).The CD16a F158 allotype bound IgG1 Fc with a six-fold reduction in affinity compared to V158 (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 1), consistent with previous reports (6Bruhns P. Iannascoli B. England P. Mancardi D.A. Fernandez N.

Durocher Y. et al.Glycosylation of Fcgamma receptors influences their interaction with various IgG1 glycoforms.Mol. Immunol. 2020; 121: 144-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We next expressed both CD16a allotypes in a Gnt1-cell line that expresses glycoproteins with predominantly oligomannose (Man5GlcNAc2) N-glycans (30Reeves P.J. Callewaert N. Contreras R. Khorana H.G.

Both proteins bound IgG1 Fc with increased affinity compared to the same protein expressed in the WT cell line; however, the F158 allotype bound with a 13-fold weaker affinity than V158 (Fig. S3). While both allotypes gain increased affinity with oligomannose glycans, the gain in affinity by V158 is more substantial than F158 (3.1× versus 1.6×; Table S2). This result indicates that the factor causing weaker F158 binding is also present in the oligomannose N-glycoform.Figure 2Representative surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensorgrams of CD16a allotypes. Glycoforms are complex-types (A and E) with two variants missing the N162 glycan (C and G).

Aromatic residues form strong interactions through CH-π dispersive forces with carbohydrate residues (31Chen W. Enck S. Price J.L. Powers D.L. Powers E.T. Wong C.H. et al.Structural and energetic basis of carbohydrate-aromatic packing interactions in proteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 9877-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that F158 introduces an inhibitory intramolecular contact. We enzymatically truncated the N-glycans to a single GlcNAc residue and again found that F158 bound with six-fold weaker affinity than V158. Lastly, we prevented N162 glycosylation through the S164A mutation to disrupt the NVS glycosylation sequon. Again, the F158 allotype bound IgG1 Fc with six-fold weaker affinity than V158. When comparing to the native form of the receptor, both allotypes possess nearly identical relative affinity of the single GlcNAc and S164A forms (Table S2). These data demonstrate that the weaker F158 binding affinity is independent of N-glycan composition and the presence of the N162 glycan.CD16a F158 exhibits slower binding kineticsA detailed analysis of the binding curves revealed differences in binding rates. We fitted a two-state binding model to the sensorgrams that revealed major (ka1, kd1) and minor (ka2, kd2) events, with the major event dominating the observed data (Fig. 4, Table 2). The fitting errors were less than 2% in all instances. Dissociation constants resulting from the kinetic fits were lower than those found with fitting the equilibrium responses; however, the relative differences between forms were preserved. Fitting a 1:1 binding model revealed rates highly comparable to the major event in the two-state model, however with slightly increased residuals due to an inability of this model to accommodate slight nonlinearity at the later timepoints of the association curves. This nonlinearity may be due to reversible nonspecific interactions with the chip surface or a slow conformational rearrangement once bound.Figure 4Binding kinetics show different rates for the glycoform and allotype variants.

The V158 S164A variant bound with an eight-fold increased on rate and a seven-fold increased off rate. These data indicate that the N162 glycan slows complex formation, though the resulting complex exhibits a slower dissociation rate. Shortening the V158 N-glycan with the Man5 glycoforms increased the binding rate by 4.2-fold and also increased the dissociation rate by 2.8-fold. The F158 association proved too weak and too fast for reproducible measurements of the binding kinetics.The CD16a V158 variant with the truncated (1)GlcNAc N-glycans revealed a 15-fold faster association rate than the complex-type glycoform; however, the dissociation rates were similar (1.6-fold difference). These results support the evidence from the S164A example above that the extended N-glycan slowed the association rate. In contrast to S164A, however, the truncated (1)GlcNAc proved sufficient to stabilize the complex.The increased binding affinity for the CD16a F158 allotype with truncated (1)GlcNAc N-glycans provided the opportunity to measure binding kinetics and compare V158 and F158 directly. The CD16a F158 (1)GlcNAc protein exhibited an on rate that was 2.3-fold slower than the CD16a V158 (1)GlcNAc glycoform and a dissociation rate two-fold faster. Thus, the presence of F158 slowed the binding and increased the rate of complex dissociation. These differences are consistent with a greater conformational heterogeneity of the F158 allotype.NMR shows CD16a structural differencesWe evaluated CD16a V158 and F158 using solution NMR spectroscopy to identify possible structural differences. Glycosylated proteins represent a substantial challenge for solution NMR spectroscopy, largely because the common expression host for NMR, Escherichia coli, does not N-glycosylate. We expressed CD16a in the same human cell line used for the binding affinity measurements (HEK293F). These cells glycosylate appropriately but do not allow uniform amino acid labeling from metabolic precursors. Instead, we first supplemented the expression medium with [15N]-phenylalanine, an essential amino acid that does not scramble under the conditions used for expression.An HSQC-TROSY spectrum of [15N-phenylalanine]-CD16a V158 showed seven clear peaks corresponding to seven phenylalanine residues (Fig. 5A). A similar spectrum of [15N-F]-CD16a F158 showed nine peaks, seven of these similar to V158 peaks. The two remaining peaks are likely due to F158. It is curious to note that the F158 N-H correlation revealed two peaks, indicating the presence of two different conformations exchanging slowly on the NMR timescale. It is not known if the V158 N-H correlation likewise samples two conformations; the nitrogen atom from [15N]-valine is metabolically scrambled to other amino acids during expression and a V158 peak was not identified (data not shown). It is also notable that the F133 and F153 peaks do not perfectly overlay in spectra of the [15N-phenylalanine]-CD16a allotypes, instead showing chemical shift perturbations.Figure 5NMR spectroscopy of the CD16a allotypes.

Lysine and tyrosine likewise did not scramble. We were able to match each peak to a residue using the assignment of a related receptor by Kato et al. (32Yogo R. Yanaka S. Kato K.

In total, these spectra showed ten residues with chemical shift perturbations, notably at F133, K131, F153, and K161 (Fig. 5B).The N162 glycan is also in the general vicinity of these perturbed residues. N-glycans can be labeled by supplementing the expression medium with [13C]-glucose, which is then incorporated into each N-glycan sugar and alanine methyls (33Yamaguchi Y. Kato K. Shindo M. Aoki S.

Antioxidant compounds total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC) were assessed by using bacterial crude extracts obtained from 24-hour shake-flask culture. Phylogenetic tree analysis of those identified isolates shared sequence similarities with the members of Bacillus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas species, and after GenBank submission, accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences were found to be MW494406, MW494408, MW494401, MW494402, and MZ021340, respectively. In silico analysis was performed to identify their bioactive genes and compounds in the context of bioactive secondary metabolite production with medicinal value, where nine significant bioactive compounds according to six different types of bioactive secondary metabolites were identified, and their structures, gene associations, and protein-protein networks were analyzed by different computational tools and servers, which were reported earlier with their antimicrobial, anti-infective, antioxidant, and anti-cancer capabilities. These compounds were then docked to the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of the novel SARS-COV-2. Docking scores were then compared with 3CLpro reference inhibitor (lopinavir), and docked compounds were further subjected to ADMET and drug-likeness analyses. Ligand-protein interactions showed that two compounds (microansamycin and aureusimine) interacted favorably with coronavirus 3CLpro. Besides, in silico analysis, we also performed NMR for metabolite detection whereas three metabolites (microansamycin, aureusimine, and stenothricin) were confirmed from the 1H NMR profiles. As a consequence, the metabolites found from NMR data aligned with our in-silico analysis that carries a significant outcome of this research. Finally, Endophytic bacteria collected from medicinal plants can provide new leading bioactive compounds against target proteins of SARS-COV-2, which could be an effective approach to accelerate drug innovation and development."
https://openalex.org/W4288925980,"Global agriculture loses over $100 billion of produce annually to crop pests such as insects. Many of these crop pests either are not currently controlled by artificial means or have developed resistance against chemical pesticides. Long dsRNAs are capable of inducing RNAi in insects and are emerging as novel, highly selective alternatives for sustainable insect management strategies. However, there are significant challenges associated with RNAi efficacy in insects. In this study, we synthesized a range of chemically modified long dsRNAs in an approach to improve nuclease resistance and RNAi efficacy in insects. Our results showed that dsRNAs containing phosphorothioate modifications demonstrated increased resistance to southern green stink bug saliva nucleases. Phosphorothioate-modified and 2'-fluoro-modified dsRNA also demonstrated increased resistance to degradation by soil nucleases and increased RNAi efficacy in Drosophila melanogaster cell cultures. In live insects, we found chemically modified long dsRNAs successfully resulted in mortality in both stink bug and corn rootworm. These results provide further mechanistic insight into the dependence of RNAi efficacy on nucleotide modifications in the sense or antisense strand of the dsRNA in insects and demonstrate for the first time that RNAi can successfully be triggered by chemically modified long dsRNAs in insect cells or live insects."
https://openalex.org/W4288925590,"Secretion systems utilize ATPase activity to facilitate the translocation of proteins into and across membranes. In bacteria, the universally conserved SecA ATPase binds a large repertoire of preproteins and interacts with the SecYEG translocon. In contrast, the type 7b secretion system (T7bSS) of Staphylococcus aureus supports the secretion of a restricted subset of proteins. T7bSSs are found in several Firmicutes as gene clusters encoding secreted WXG100 proteins and FtsK/SpoIIIE-like ATPase. In S. aureus, this ATPase is called EssC and comprises two cytosolic forkhead-associated domains (FHA1–2), two membrane-spanning segments (TM1–2), and four cytosolic modules named DUF (domain of unknown function) and ATPases1-3 (D1D2D3). However, a detailed understanding of the interactions of EssC in the T7bSS is not clear. Here, we tagged EssC and performed affinity chromatography of detergent-solubilized extracts of wild type and isogenic mutants of S. aureus. We found that EssC recruits EsaA, EssA, and EssB in a complex referred to as the ESS (ESAT-6 like secretion system) translocon, and secreted substrates were not required for translocon assembly. Furthermore, deletions of FHA1 and DUF rendered EssC unstable, whereas FHA2 was required for association with EssB. This interaction was independent of EsaA, but EsaA was required to recruit EssA to the EssC–EssB complex. Finally, we show that assembly of the ESS translocon was impaired upon mutation of D2 structural motifs. Together, our data indicate that the ESS translocon is maintained fully assembled at the plasma membrane and that D2 is fundamental in sustaining the integrity of this complex. Secretion systems utilize ATPase activity to facilitate the translocation of proteins into and across membranes. In bacteria, the universally conserved SecA ATPase binds a large repertoire of preproteins and interacts with the SecYEG translocon. In contrast, the type 7b secretion system (T7bSS) of Staphylococcus aureus supports the secretion of a restricted subset of proteins. T7bSSs are found in several Firmicutes as gene clusters encoding secreted WXG100 proteins and FtsK/SpoIIIE-like ATPase. In S. aureus, this ATPase is called EssC and comprises two cytosolic forkhead-associated domains (FHA1–2), two membrane-spanning segments (TM1–2), and four cytosolic modules named DUF (domain of unknown function) and ATPases1-3 (D1D2D3). However, a detailed understanding of the interactions of EssC in the T7bSS is not clear. Here, we tagged EssC and performed affinity chromatography of detergent-solubilized extracts of wild type and isogenic mutants of S. aureus. We found that EssC recruits EsaA, EssA, and EssB in a complex referred to as the ESS (ESAT-6 like secretion system) translocon, and secreted substrates were not required for translocon assembly. Furthermore, deletions of FHA1 and DUF rendered EssC unstable, whereas FHA2 was required for association with EssB. This interaction was independent of EsaA, but EsaA was required to recruit EssA to the EssC–EssB complex. Finally, we show that assembly of the ESS translocon was impaired upon mutation of D2 structural motifs. Together, our data indicate that the ESS translocon is maintained fully assembled at the plasma membrane and that D2 is fundamental in sustaining the integrity of this complex. Protein secretion across membranes is facilitated by channel-forming proteins and often powered by ATP or the proton motive force. Dedicated secretion systems control the selective entry of proteins into cognate secretion channels as well as the exit site where substrates are released (1Lee V.T. Schneewind O. Protein secretion and the pathogenesis of bacterial infections.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1725-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Green E.R. Mecsas J. Bacterial secretion systems: an overview.Microbiol. Spectr. 2016; 4https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.VMBF-0012-2015Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The final location of secreted substrates and the number of lipid layers crossed during this process account for the diversity and complexity of secretion machinery. For example, in bacteria, preproteins recognized by the SecA ATPase are delivered to the membrane-embedded SecYEG translocon (3Troman L. Collinson I. Pushing the envelope: the mysterious journey through the bacterial secretory machinery, and beyond.Front. Microbiol. 2021; 12782900Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the absence of additional topogenic or retention sequences, SecA substrates end up in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria or the extracellular milieu of Gram-positive bacterial cultures. Although the repertoire of SecA substrates is extensive and highly variable, translocation is highly efficient and preproteins do not accumulate in the cytosol. This is unlike secretion mediated by the highly specialized type 7b secretion system (T7bSS). In Staphylococcus aureus, the T7bSS is encoded by the ESS (ESAT-6 like secretion system) gene cluster, which encompasses both transport and secreted proteins (4Burts M.L. Williams W.A. DeBord K. Missiakas D.M. EsxA and EsxB are secreted by an ESAT-6-like system that is required for the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). T7bSSs are found in several families of Firmicutes, including Bacillaceae, Listeriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae, and are defined by the presence of an ATPase that belongs to the FtsK/SpoIIIE family of proteins and at least one small protein of approximately 100 amino acids with the central Trp-X-Gly motif (WXG100 domain) (5Pallen M.J.

Further ESX clusters have expanded their secretion repertoire to the PE/PPE family of proteins, whereas ESS clusters secrete proteins of the LXG family (12Ates L.S. Houben E.N.G. Bitter W.

Unlike Sec-dependent substrates, WXG100 proteins are not processed during secretion, and folded dimers accumulate in the cytosol. WXG100 proteins are encountered in both pathogenic and environmental species of bacteria. In S. aureus, mutants unable to perform T7b secretion are less virulent in the mouse model of bloodstream infection, yet the exact role of T7b during infection remains unknown (4Burts M.L.

Bioinformatic analyses redefined this class of substrates as the LXG family of polymorphic toxins (PFAM: PF04740) (22Zhang D. de Souza R.F. Anantharaman V. Iyer L.M. Aravind L.

Furthermore, soluble domains of T7b EssC have been crystallized from various Firmicutes, including S. aureus and Geobacillus thermodenitrificans, and can be compared with partial X-ray structures of Thermomonospora curvata and Mycobacterium smegmatis EccC homologs (31Zoltner M.

After generating and purifying several variants of EssC, we report that the N-terminal FHA2 (forkhead-associated domain) and C-terminal D2 domains of EssC contribute to the assembly and stability of the ESS translocon.

Two hydrophobic segments, Ile236–Val252 and Ile255–Ile274, span the plasma membrane twice, positioning the N and C termini of EssC in the cytosol; only a very small loop faces the exterior of the cell (Fig. 1, A and B). X-ray crystallography studies revealed that the soluble N-terminal segment folds into two distinct FHA domains comprised of 9 and 12 stacked β-sheets, respectively (31Zoltner M. Ng W.M. Money J.J. Fyfe P.K. Kneuper H. Palmer T. et al.EssC: Domain structures inform on the elusive translocation channel in the type VII secretion system.Biochem. J. 2016; 473: 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cytosolic C-terminal sequence encompasses the domain of unknown function (DUF) followed by three subdomains with characteristic ATPase-like folds. Herein, EssC subdomains are designated FHA1–2, TM1–2, DUF, and D1D2D3, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). D1 and D2 share the greatest amino acid conservation amongst EssC homologs of Firmicutes (Fig. S1A). FHA domains are conspicuously missing in most strains of B. anthracis (Fig. S1A) and are absent in the five EccC proteins (EccC1–5) of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. S1B). Overall, the sequences of EccC proteins are clearly distinct from that of S. aureus EssC (Fig. S1, B and C).To gain insights into the biochemical activity of EssC, we sought to purify the protein from membrane fractions of S. aureus. To facilitate purification, the amino-acid sequence WSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGSSAWSHPQFEK or Twin-Strep (TS) tag was inserted at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). To verify that the tag did not alter the activity of EssC, a secretion assay was performed (4Burts M.L. Williams W.A. DeBord K. Missiakas D.M. EsxA and EsxB are secreted by an ESAT-6-like system that is required for the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cultures of the new strains were spun to separate bacterial cells (cell) and the extracellular medium (medium). Cells were lysed with lysostaphin and proteins in cell and medium compartments, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analyses (Fig. 1C). The presence of immune reactive species for EsxA and EssD in spent culture media indicated that EssTS complemented the loss of chromosomally encoded EssC. As controls, secretion was abolished in ΔessB and ΔessC strains; since the ribosomal protein L6 (L6) sedimented with cellular fractions exclusively, secretion was not because of nonspecific cell lysis (Fig. 1C). Next, bacterial cultures were used to extract membrane proteins using n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM), and cleared DDM extracts were applied over Strep-Tactin Sepharose. Bound proteins were eluted with desthiobiotin for LC/MS/MS (Table 1), SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D), and Western blot (Fig. 1E) analyses. LC/MS/MS revealed an enrichment of peptides for the conserved ESS proteins, EsaA, EssA, EssB, and EssC in ΔessC pessCTS samples as compared with the ΔessC pessC control (Table 1). A few peptides also mapped to EsxA, EsaB, and DUF5079 (encoded by SAUSA300_0295) (Table 1). Owing to their small sizes, EsxA and EsaB digests yielded fewer peptides. DUF5079 is encoded in ESS clusters, but its function is not known; the gene is often duplicated and could encode an orphan immunity factor. A protein encoded by SAUSA300_0274 (four genes upstream of esxA-SAUSA300_0278) was also identified by LC/MS/MS (Table 1). Subsequent analysis of a strain deleted for SAUSA300_0274 demonstrated that the gene is dispensable for T7b secretion (Fig. S2). Further investigation into SAUSA300_0274 was not pursued.Table 1Identification of proteins copurifying with EssC and EssCTS using LC/MS/MSProteinMolecular weight (kDa)Total number of peptidesEssCEssCTSEssC170.8243653EssB51.995108EsaA114.75047SAUSA300_027457.89129EssA17.38024EsaB9.1103EsxA11.0302SAUSA300_029515.6401 Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE analysis of Strep-Tactin eluates revealed discrete bands that stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for the EssCTS extract but not the untagged EssC control (Fig. 1D). Similarly, immunoblotting identified the transmembrane proteins EsaA, EssA, and EssB as well as soluble EsxA and EsaB in EssCTS but not from EssC purification, thereby validating the mass spectrometry results (Fig. 1E). Although not identified by LC/MS/MS, the secreted effector EssD, its immunity factor EssI, and putative chaperone EssE were also found in the EssCTS eluate (Fig. 1E). Of note, protease inhibitors were used during the extraction procedure, yet multiple immune reactive species were observed for several proteins, in particular EsaA and EssC (vide infra). It is not clear whether such processing is the result of nonspecific proteolytic activity or regulated proteolysis integral to the T7bSS.FHA2 recruits EssB and EssA to the transloconThe two FHA domains of EssC share 23.21% identity and are altogether missing in the EccC1–5 of M. tuberculosis as well as in B. anthracis strains that retained EssC but lack EsaA, EssB, EssA, and EsaB (Fig. S1, C and D) (21Garufi G. Butler E. Missiakas D. ESAT-6-like protein secretion in Bacillus anthracis.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs were generated to produce tagged EssC lacking each one of the FHA domains yielding EssC(ΔFHA1)TS and EssC(ΔFHA2)TS, respectively (Fig. 2A). This analysis was extended to DUF and a small predicted hydrophobic segment (HM) within DUF yielding EssC(ΔDUF)TS and EssC(ΔHM)TS, respectively (Fig. 2A). The four new plasmids were transformed in strain ΔessC for immunoblotting analyses (Fig. 2, B and C). Constructs lacking FHA1, DUF, or HM did not yield any product that could be detected with the anti-EssC polyclonal serum (Fig. 2, B and C). Only EssC(ΔFHA2)TS accumulated to the same extent as EssCTS (Fig. 2, B and C). Subcellular fractionation of bacteria demonstrated that EssC(ΔFHA2)TS retained its membrane location (Fig. 2B) but did not support the secretion of EsxA and EsxC (Fig. 2C). Immunoblotting for the membrane protein Sortase A (SrtA), ribosomal protein L6, and EssB served as controls (Fig. 2, B and C). The four plasmids were also transformed in the wildtype strain. Only EssCTS and EssC(ΔFHA2)TS accumulated to a similar extent (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, overproduced EssC(ΔFHA2) did not exert a dominant-negative function on EsxA and EsxC secretion (Fig. 2D). Together, the results suggest that the deletions of FHA1, DUF, and HM render EssC unstable. This is in agreement with a report suggesting that deletion of both FHA domains renders EssC unstable (31Zoltner M. Ng W.M. Money J.J. Fyfe P.K. Kneuper H. Palmer T. et al.EssC: Domain structures inform on the elusive translocation channel in the type VII secretion system.Biochem. J. 2016; 473: 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This instability can be attributed solely to the loss of FHA1. Stable EssC(ΔFHA2) did not interfere with the ESS translocon, either because it was not recruited to the translocon or because incorporation of these defective subunits was tolerated (Fig. 2D). To look into the role of FHA2 further, DDM solubilized extracts were prepared from cultures of strain ΔessC harboring plasmid-encoded EssC(ΔFHA2)TS as well as EssCTS and EssC for controls. All extracts were purified over Strep-Tactin Sepharose, and proteins in eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE for silver staining (Fig. 3A) and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 3, B–F). As expected, binding to the beads was only observed for tagged proteins (Fig. 3, A–F; lane 1). Both bound EssCTS and EssC(ΔFHA2)TS recruited EsaA (Fig. 3, B–D; lanes 2–3). However, in the absence of FHA2, EssC no longer interacted with EssB and EssA (Fig. 3, E and F; lane 3). Because this partial complex was still embedded in the membrane (Fig. 3G) and cells remained viable, we conclude that incomplete EssC–EsaA translocons are not leaky.Figure 2T7b secretion in mutants lacking FHA domains and DUF.

Therefore, more sensitive and specific high-throughput molecular diagnostic approaches are needed for accurate malaria diagnosis.In the present study, the performance of a novel single-tube MC004 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was assessed for the detection of infection and discrimination of Plasmodium species. Blood samples (n = 150) were collected from malaria suspected patients at Adama malaria diagnosis and treatment centre, Adama, central Ethiopia. The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), analytical sensitivity and specificity of the assay were assessed against the conventional microscopic method.Plasmodium species were detected in 59 (39.3%) of the samples by microscopy and in 62 (41.3%) by the novel MC004 RT-PCR. Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and mixed infections with Plasmodium falciparum & Plasmodium vivax accounted for 47.5%, 40.6% and 11.9% respectively as detected by microscopy. The MC004 RT-PCR assay identified 59.7% and 40.3% of the samples positive for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the MC004 RT-PCR assay were 95.8%, 97.8%, 92%, and 98.9%, respectively. No mixed infections were detected using the MC004 assay.The MC004 RT-PCR assay is a useful tool for the early detection of malaria and identification of Plasmodium species with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Due to its high sensitivity, and simplicity (being a single-tube assay), the MC004 is suitable for use in clinical settings and epidemiological studies."

The source and extent of variations among yellow pea protein profiles was assessed in 10 single seeds of two varieties with different size and weight. A new approach was developed to analyze proteins of yellow pea combining three analytical methods of size exclusion chromatography (SEC), reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and microfluidic SDS-PAGE, to achieve the highest separation resolution. A high variation of protein concentration was observed not only between varieties, but also among seeds of the same variety. Vicilin to legumin ratio was between 2.72-4.19, and 1.70-2.22 among the individual seeds of AC Agassiz and CDC Saffron varieties, respectively. V/L ratio was significantly different among the individual seeds for both varieties. The amount of some protein fractions/subunits were correlated with seeds' size and weight for AC Agassiz, while such correlations were not observed for CDC Saffron."
https://openalex.org/W4289782684,"An increasing number of marine animals are equipped with biologgers, to study their physiology, behaviour and ecology, often for conservation purposes. To minimise the impacts of biologgers on the animals’ welfare, the Refinement principle from the Three Rs framework ( Replacement , Reduction , Refinement ) urges to continuously test and evaluate new and updated biologging protocols. Here, we propose alternative and promising techniques for emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) capture and on-site logger deployment that aim to mitigate the potential negative impacts of logger deployment on these birds. We equipped adult emperor penguins for short-term (GPS, Time-Depth Recorder (TDR)) and long-term ( i . e . planned for one year) deployments (ARGOS platforms, TDR), as well as juvenile emperor penguins for long-term deployments (ARGOS platforms) in the Weddell Sea area where they had not yet been studied. We describe and qualitatively evaluate our protocols for the attachment of biologgers on-site at the colony, the capture of the animals and the recovery of the devices after deployment. We report unprecedented recaptures of long-term equipped adult emperor penguins (50% of equipped individuals recaptured after 290 days). Our data demonstrate that the traditional technique of long-term attachment by gluing the biologgers directly to the back feathers causes excessive feather breakage and the loss of the devices after a few months. We therefore propose an alternative method of attachment for back-mounted devices. This technique led to successful year-round deployments on 37.5% of the equipped juveniles. Finally, we also disclose the first deployments of leg-bracelet mounted TDRs on emperor penguins. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring potential impacts of biologger deployments on the animals and the need to continue to improve methods to minimize disturbance and enhance performance and results."
https://openalex.org/W4288926442,"The intramembrane protease PARL acts as a crucial mitochondrial safeguard by cleaving the mitophagy regulators PINK1 and PGAM5. Depending on the stress level, PGAM5 can either stimulate cell survival or cell death. In contrast to PINK1, which is constantly cleaved in healthy mitochondria and only active when the inner mitochondrial membrane is depolarized, PGAM5 processing is inversely regulated. However, determinants of PGAM5 that indicate it as a conditional substrate for PARL have not been rigorously investigated, and it is unclear how uncoupling the mitochondrial membrane potential affects its processing compared to that of PINK1. Here, we show that several polar transmembrane residues in PGAM5 distant from the cleavage site serve as determinants for its PARL-catalyzed cleavage. Our NMR analysis indicates that a short N-terminal amphipathic helix, followed by a kink and a C-terminal transmembrane helix harboring the scissile peptide bond are key for a productive interaction with PARL. Furthermore, we also show that PGAM5 is stably inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane until uncoupling the membrane potential triggers its disassembly into monomers, which are then cleaved by PARL. In conclusion, we propose a model in which PGAM5 is slowly processed by PARL-catalyzed cleavage that is influenced by multiple hierarchical substrate features, including a membrane potential-dependent oligomeric switch."
https://openalex.org/W4288969918,"Disruption of fetal growth results in severe consequences to human health, including increased fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as potential lifelong health problems. Molecular mechanisms promoting fetal growth represent potential therapeutic strategies to treat and/or prevent fetal growth restriction (FGR). Here, we identify a previously unknown role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) in promoting fetal and placental growth. We demonstrate that inactivation of MAP3K4 kinase activity causes FGR due in part to placental insufficiency. Significantly, MAP3K4 kinase-inactive mice display highly penetrant lethality prior to weaning and persistent growth reduction of surviving adults. Additionally, we elucidate molecular mechanisms by which MAP3K4 promotes growth through control of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), insulin receptor (IR), and Akt signaling pathway. Specifically, MAP3K4 kinase inactivation in trophoblast stem (TS) cells results in reduced IGF1R and IR expression and decreased Akt activation. We observe these changes in TS cells also occur in differentiated trophoblasts created through in vitro differentiation of cultured TS cells and in vivo in placental tissues formed by TS cells. Furthermore, we show that MAP3K4 controls this pathway by promoting Igf1r transcript expression in TS cells through activation of CREB-binding protein (CBP). In the MAP3K4 kinase-inactive TS cells, Igf1r transcripts are repressed because of reduced CBP activity and increased histone deacetylase 6 expression and activity. Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for MAP3K4 in promoting fetal and placental growth by controlling the activity of the IGF1R/IR and Akt signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W4289782688,"The realization of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) from laboratory to clinical applications remains slow, partly because of the lack of precise control of each condition in the preparation process and the rich selectivity of nanoparticles with diverse characteristics. Employing PLGA NPs to establish a large range of size-controlled drug delivery systems and achieve size-selective drug delivery targeting remains a challenge for therapeutic development for different diseases. In this study, we employed a microfluidic device to control the size of PLGA NPs. PLGA, poly (ethylene glycol)-methyl ether block poly (lactic-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA), and blend (PLGA + PEG-PLGA) NPs were engineered with defined sizes. Blend NPs exhibit the widest size range (40–114 nm) by simply changing the flow rate conditions without changing the precursor (polymer molecular weight, concentration, and chain segment composition). A model hydrophobic drug, paclitaxel (PTX), was encapsulated in the NPs, and the PTX-loaded NPs maintained a large range of controllable NP sizes. Furthermore, size-controlled NPs were used to investigate the effect of particle size of sub-200 nm NPs on tumor cell growth. The 52 nm NPs showed higher cell growth inhibition than 109 nm NPs. Our method allows the preparation of biodegradable NPs with a large size range without changing polymer precursors as well as the nondemanding fluid conditions. In addition, our model can be applied to elucidate the role of particle sizes of sub-200 nm particles in various biomedical applications, which may help develop suitable drugs for different diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4289847932,"Objective To date, there are no studies of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the Navajo Nation, US. The primary objective of this manuscript is to understand whether counties with a higher proportion of Navajo (Diné) population also had higher cases and deaths of COVID-19 and whether these dropped with vaccination. Method We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of county level data from March 16, 2020—May 11, 2021. Data were obtained from public repositories and the US Census for the Navajo Nation, including northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and northwestern New Mexico. The primary outcome measure is the number of individuals with confirmed cases or deaths of COVID-19. A secondary outcome was COVID-19 vaccinations. Results The 11 counties in Navajo Nation have a wide variation in the percent Navajo population, the resources available (ICU beds and occupancy), and COVID-19 outcomes. Overall, there was a substantial increase in the number of cases from March 16 –July 16, 2020 (the height of the pandemic) with a doubling time of 10.12 days on Navajo Nation. The percent Navajo population was a strong predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population. COVID-19 vaccinations were inversely associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths in these counties. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic on the Navajo Nation is a story of resilience. Navajo Nation was one of the hardest hit areas of the United States, with peak cases and deaths due to COVID-19. With an aggressive vaccination effort, these cases and deaths were strikingly curtailed, showing the resilience of the Navajo (Diné) people."
https://openalex.org/W4288925603,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) methylates a variety of histone and nonhistone protein substrates to regulate multiple cellular functions such as transcription, DNA damage response, and signal transduction. It has been reported as an emerging regulator of various metabolic pathways including glucose metabolism in the liver, atrophy in the skeletal muscle, and lipid catabolism in the adipose tissue. However, the underlying mechanisms governing how PRMT1 regulates adipogenesis remain elusive. Here, we delineate the roles of PRMT1 in mitotic clonal expansion and adipocyte differentiation. Gain and loss of functions demonstrate that PRMT1 is essential for adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 and C3H10T1/2 cells. Mechanistically, we show PRMT1 promotes the expression of transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) by catalyzing histone modification H4R3me2a and impedes the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by increasing the level of Axin to accelerate adipogenic differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate mitotic clonal expansion is suppressed by PRMT1 deficiency. PRMT1 interacts with transcription factor CCATT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and the absence of PRMT1 leads to the depressed phosphorylation of C/EBPβ. Interestingly, we discover PRMT1 acts as a positive regulator of C/EBPβ protein stability through decreasing the level of E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2, which promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of C/EBPβ, thus facilitating adipogenesis.

Collectively, these discoveries highlight a critical role of PRMT1 in adipogenesis and provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity. Obesity is an abnormal lipid metabolism and resulted from excessive expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT), closely related to multiple metabolism diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, adiposis hepatica, and hypertension (1Haslam D.W. James W.P.T. Obesity.Lancet. 2005; 366 (London, England): 1197-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar, 2Blüher M. Obesity: global epidemiology and pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). WAT plays a significant role in energy homeostasis, storing triglycerides when energy is excess and releasing free fatty acids in the demand of energy. Besides, WAT serves as a crucial regulator of whole body metabolism by synthesizing and secreting adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin (3Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. What we talk about when we talk about fat.Cell. 2014; 156: 20-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Adipose mass is dependent on adipocyte hypertrophy and adipocyte hyperplasia, defined as hypertrophic WAT and hyperplastic WAT, respectively (4Morigny P. Boucher J. Arner P. Langin D. Lipid and glucose metabolism in white adipocytes: pathways, dysfunction and therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2021; 17: 276-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Adipocyte hypertrophy is an increase in adipocyte size, while adipocyte hyperplasia is a vital process that generates new adipocytes from precursor cells to guarantee the number of adipocytes (5Jeffery E. Church C.D. Holtrup B. Colman L. Rodeheffer M.S. Rapid depot-specific activation of adipocyte precursor cells at the onset of obesity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Consequently, understanding the mechanisms regulating both the number and size of adipocytes may provide new therapies to neutralize obesity and obesity-associated metabolic diseases.Adipocytes are originated from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells, which are committed into adipocyte lineage when appropriately stimulated (6Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Adipogenesis: from stem cell to adipocyte.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 715-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Then preadipocytes undergo a complicated process including growth arrest, mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), and terminal differentiation. Growth-arrested preadipocytes enter the cell cycle again and undertake cell divisions in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, known as MCE, in which transcriptional factor CCATT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is of critical importance that activates cell cycle genes (7Tang Q.-Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Mitotic clonal expansion: a synchronous process required for adipogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 8Tang Q.-Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta is required for mitotic clonal expansion during adipogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase and GSK3β to trigger the transcription of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), which in turn coordinately induce the transcription of adipogenic genes to promote the formation of mature adipocytes (6Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Adipogenesis: from stem cell to adipocyte.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 715-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). PPARγ is indispensable for adipogenic programming, considered the master regulator of adipogenesis. In particular, the adipogenesis of precursor cells is prevented in the absence of PPARγ, that cannot be restored by C/EBPα (9Rosen E.D. Hsu C.-H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. et al.C/EBPalpha induces adipogenesis through PPARgamma: a unified pathway.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Moreover, adipose tissue-specific PPARγ deletion of mice hinders high fat diet–induced obesity (10Duan S.Z. Ivashchenko C.Y. Whitesall S.E. D'Alecy L.G. Duquaine D.C. Brosius F.C. et al.Hypotension, lipodystrophy, and insulin resistance in generalized PPARgamma-deficient mice rescued from embryonic lethality.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the regulators that affect the expression and activity of PPARγ and C/EBPβ is of great significance to delve deeper into the mechanisms orchestrating adipogenesis.Arginine methylation is perceived as a pivotal posttranslational modification controlling transcription, translation, protein stability, cell fate determination, and so forth (11Blanc R.S. Richard S. Arginine methylation: the coming of age.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 8-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Arginine methylation is mainly catalyzed by PRMT family, subdivided into three categories according to their catalytic activity: type I enzymes (PRMT1–4, 6, and 8), which carry out the formation of asymmetrically dimethylated arginine, type II (PRMT5 and 9), and type III (PRMT7) enzymes, which catalyze symmetrical dimethylation and monomethylation, respectively (12Bedford M.T. Richard S. Arginine methylation an emerging regulator of protein function.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Growing studies have shown that PRMTs function as activators or repressors in many biological processes including adipogenesis (13Kowenz-Leutz E. Pless O. Dittmar G. Knoblich M. Leutz A.

Arginine dimethylation of C/EBPβ catalyzed by PRMT4/CARM1 constrains the interaction among C/EBPβ with SWI/SNF and mediator complexes, and compromises its transactivation, that can be rescued by phosphorylation of C/EBPβ (13Kowenz-Leutz E.

Crosstalk between C/EBPbeta phosphorylation, arginine methylation, and SWI/SNF/Mediator implies an indexing transcription factor code.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Besides, PRMT5 has been found to regulate fatty acid metabolism and lipid droplet biogenesis by methylating SPT5 or SREBP1a and promote adipogenesis via activation of PPARγ and its target genes (14Jia Z. Yue F. Chen X. Narayanan N. Qiu J. Syed S.A. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 regulates fatty acid metabolism and lipid droplet biogenesis in white adipose tissues.Adv. Sci.

(Baltimore, Md. 2012; 26: 583-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, PRMT6 has been identified to suppress adipogenic differentiation by repressing the activity of PPARγ (16Hwang J.W. So Y.-S. Bae G.-U. Kim S.-N. Kim Y.K. Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 suppresses adipogenic differentiation by repressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activity.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2019; 43: 2462-2470PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, PRMT7 has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis through modulating arginine methylation of C/EBPβ (17Leem Y.-E. Bae J.-H. Jeong H.-J. Kang J.-S. PRMT7 deficiency enhances adipogenesis through modulation of C/EBP-β.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2019; 517: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the functions of other PRMTs in adipogenesis are still unclear. What is strikingly noticeable is PRMT1 regulating thermogenic fat activation (18Qiao X. Kim D.-I. Jun H. Ma Y. Knights A.J. Park M.-J. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 interacts with PGC1α and modulates thermogenic fat activation.Endocrinology. 2019; 160: 2773-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent study has reported that adipocyte-specific depletion of PRMT1 impairs glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obesity (19Choi S. Choi D. Lee Y.-K. Ahn S.H. Seong J.K. Chi S.W. et al.Depletion of in adipocytes impairs glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obesity.Diabetes. 2021; 70: 1664-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), but the regulatory mechanism of PRMT1 in adipogenesis requires further elucidation.In this research, we find PRMT1 depletion represses adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and C3H10T1/2 cells and attenuates adipogenic genes expression, whereas PRMT1 overexpression has the opposite effects. Gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals that PRMT1 participates in multifarious biological processes such as cell proliferation, fat cell differentiation, and lipid metabolic process. Furthermore, we demonstrate PRMT1 regulates adipocyte differentiation by mediating H4R3me2a at PPARγ promoter and impeding the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by regulating Axin. Meanwhile, PRMT1 is also required for MCE. PRMT1 interacts with C/EBPβ, and the absence of PRMT1 leads to the depressed phosphorylation of C/EBPβ. We further identify PRMT1 as a positive regulator of C/EBPβ protein stability through decreasing the level of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (Smurf2), which promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of C/EBPβ, thus facilitating adipogenesis. Overall, our findings elucidate that PRMT1 is a crucial and multifaceted regulatory factor that facilitates adipogenesis at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level.ResultsPRMT1 promotes adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 cellsTo explore the specific role of PRMT1 in adipogenesis, the expression of PRMT1 was knocked down in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using siRNA transfection (Fig. S1). The mRNA and protein levels of PRMT1 were detected to authenticate the efficiency of siRNA interference (Fig. 1, A and B). As a result, PRMT1 knockdown suppressed adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, as determined by oil red O staining (ORO) (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, the expression of genes related to adipogenesis was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. A significant decrease was observed in the expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4, serving as markers of adipogenesis, upon PRMT1 depletion (Fig. 1, E and F). Moreover, the effect of PRMT1 overexpression on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation was evaluated using plasmids transfection. The results of ORO indicated that overexpression of PRMT1 significantly increased lipid droplets formation (Fig. 1, G and H). Consistently, the expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 at both mRNA (Fig. 1I) and protein (Fig. 1J) levels were increased when PRMT1 was overexpressed in 3T3-L1 cells. These results prove that PRMT1 is required for the normal adipocyte differentiation.PRMT1 accelerates adipogenesis of C3H10T1/2 cellsC3H10T1/2 cells were employed to probe into the effect of PRMT1 on adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells that can commit and differentiate into multiple lineages depending upon the signaling pathways activated by different differentiation cocktails. C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with BMP4 to induce the adipogenic commitment. Then, DMI, a cocktail of differentiation agents containing dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin, was employed to induce the adipogenesis of C3H10T1/2 cells. When PRMT1 levels were reduced by siRNA in C3H10T1/2 cells, upon adipogenesis, we observed a significant decrease in both lipid accumulation (based on Bodipy staining) (Fig. 2, A and B) and adipogenic marker genes expression (Fig. 2, C and D). On the contrary, Bodipy staining data indicated that transient overexpression of PRMT1 facilitated adipogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the adipogenic marker genes C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 were significantly higher in PRMT1 overexpression cells compared with the control (Fig. 2, G and H). Collectively, our results strongly suggest that PRMT1 positively regulates the adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells.Figure 2PRMT1 is required for adipogenesis of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells.

Kim W. Kim Y.K. Hwang B.N. Park S.Y. Yoon J.W. et al.Methylation by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 increases stability of Axin, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 2379-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether PRMT1 regulates adipocyte differentiation through Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In our study, the absence of PRMT1 resulted in the lessened level of Axin in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, knockdown of PRMT1 in 3T3-L1 cells enhanced the level of active β-catenin (nonphospho β-catenin Ser33/37/Thr41) (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the level of active β-catenin was remarkably decreased in the 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes with overexpression of PRMT1 compared to control (Fig. 3C). To further verify our hypothesis, we employed the IWR-1 endo, a specific β-catenin inhibitor that stabilizes Axin to block Wnt signaling pathway, to treat 3T3-L1 cells. As expected, IWR-1 restrained the incremental protein level of active β-catenin (Fig. 3G) and partially rescued the inhibition of lipid accumulation triggered by PRMT1 knockdown (Fig. 3, D and E). Meanwhile, the expression of adipogenic genes C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 were restored in the siPRMT1 + IWR-1 treatment group compared with the siPRMT1 + dimethyl sulfoxide group (Fig. 3, F and G). In summary, PRMT1 deficiency suppresses adipocyte differentiation via reducing the level of Axin and promoting the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Figure 3PRMT1 deficiency promotes the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells. A, Western blot analysis of the Axin protein expression.

Then, 914 upregulated genes and 1056 downregulated genes were identified for 1 day (Fig. 4A), while there were 420 upregulated genes and 524 downregulated genes for 3 days (Fig. 4C). By GO analysis, the downregulated genes were found to be mostly related to cell proliferation, white fat cell differentiation, and lipid metabolic progress at day 1 (Fig. 4B) and fat cell differentiation, lipid metabolic progress, and lipid storage at day 3 (Fig. 4D), indicating that PRMT1 is involved in proper regulation of fat cell differentiation and lipid metabolism. On the other hand, the upregulated transcripts were mainly related to defense response to virus, neuron differentiation, and cell proliferation at day 1 (Fig. S2A) and cell adhesion, signaling receptor activity, angiogenesis, and lipid transport at day 3 (Fig. S2B). The expression levels of pivotal adipogenesis regulator C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PPARγ, FABP4, and adiponectin in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads were shown in Figure 4E. Particularly, we found that knockdown of PRMT1 decreased the expression of PPARγ (Fig. 4E), a master regulator of adipogenesis and insulin responsiveness. Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been demonstrated to suppress adipogenesis through reducing the expression of PPARγ (21Takada I. Kouzmenko A.P. Kato S. Wnt and PPARgamma signaling in osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis.Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2009; 5: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). On the basis of our findings that PRMT1 promotes the expression of PPARγ in 3T3-L1 or C3H10T1/2 cells (Figs. 1, E, F, 2, C and D), we further sought to determine whether PRMT1 affects adipocyte differentiation through regulating PPARγ. Considering that PRMT1 is a predominant arginine methyltransferase, by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we observed a significant decrease of PRMT1 and H4R3me2a recruitment to the PPARγ promoter in PRMT1 knockdown cells compared to control (Fig. 4F). Meanwhile, the enrichment of H3K4me3 at PPARγ promoter also diminished, while the binding of H3K27me3 to PPARγ promoter (Fig. 4F) and H4R3me2a to PPARγ enhancer-like region were unchanged (Fig. S2C). In addition, we found PRMT1 could also bind to the promoter of FABP4 (Fig. S2D). Although PRMT1 was hardly enriched to C/EBPα promoter, it cooperated with PPARγ to strength the transactivation of C/EBPα (Fig. S2, D and E). H4R3me2a, as an active histone modification mainly mediated by PRMT1, potentiates subsequent histone acetylation and contributes to establishing euchromatin structure (22Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Methylation of histone H4 by arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 is essential in vivo for many subsequent histone modifications.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, previous study reported that PRMT1 regulates macrophage differentiation via mediating H4R3me2a methylation at PPARγ promoter (24Tikhanovich I. Zhao J. Olson J. Adams A. Taylor R. Bridges B. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 modulates innate immune responses through regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-dependent macrophage differentiation.J.

To decipher whether PPARγ is a downstream-regulated gene of PRMT1 mediating the effects of adipogenic differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were cotransfected with PRMT1 siRNA and PPARγ plasmid. Notably, Figure 4, G and H showed that overexpression of PPARγ could rescue the inhibited adipocyte differentiation caused by PRMT1 knockdown. Consistent with this, the expression of adipogenic genes including PPARγ and its target genes C/EBPα and FABP4 were markedly restored in cotransfection with siPRMT1 and PPARγ plasmid group (Fig. 4I). Together, these experiments confirm that PRMT1 regulates adipocyte differentiation via modulating H4R3me2a of PPARγ promoter.Figure 4PRMT1 promotes adipogenic differentiation through mediating H4R3me2a of PPARγ promoter.

As expected, the expression of H4R3me2a was dramatically reduced, and meanwhile, the protein level of PRMT1 remained unchanged (Fig. 5A). In accordance with the inhibitory role of PRMT1 silencing in 3T3-L1 cells, striking reduction was observed in lipid accumulation especially in the 2 μM TC-E 5003 treatment group, as assessed by ORO (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, TC-E 5003 downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of the adipogenic marker genes C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, D and E). We also examined the function of TC-E5003 to C3H10T1/2 cells during adipogenesis. Similarly, the expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, and FABP4 significantly decreased in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with TC-E 5003 compared with the control at 6 days of differentiation (Fig. 5F). In addition, Bodipy staining showed that accumulated lipid droplets of C3H10T1/2 cells was restrained in the presence of PRMT1 inhibitor TC-E 5003 (Fig. 5, G and H).

Exomannosidases and endomannosidases cleave specific glycosidic bonds of mannoside linkages in glycans and can be used in enzyme-based methods for sequencing of isomeric glycan structures. α1-6-mannosidase from Xanthomonas manihotis is known as a highly specific exoglycosidase that removes unbranched α1-6 linked mannose residues from oligosaccharides.

Our docking simulation of the α1-6-mannosidase with glycan substrates reveals potential interacting residues in a relatively shallow pocket slightly differing from its homologous enzymes in the glycoside hydrolase 125 family, which may be responsible for the observed higher promiscuity in substrate binding and subsequent terminal glycan hydrolysis. This observation of novel β1-4-galactosidase activity of the α1-6-mannosidase provides unique insights into its bifunctional activity on the substrate structure-dependent processing of terminal α1-6-mannose of unbranched glycans and terminal β1-4-galactose of hybrid and complex glycans.

Exo-α-mannosidases are mannoside-degrading enzymes found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that specifically cleave α1-2, α1-3, or α1-6 glycosidic linkages of terminal mannosyl residues at the nonreducing end and comprise a wide range of glycoside hydrolase (GH) families such as GH31, GH38, GH47, GH63, GH76, GH92, GH99, and GH125, as classified by carbohydrate-active enzymes (1Lombard V.

In the eukaryotic glycan biosynthetic pathway of glycoproteins, mannosyl glycan trimming is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is crucial for glycoprotein quality control, folding, and ER-associated degradation (4Lederkremer G.Z.

Sequential processing of glycans by α-mannosidases, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, N-acetylglucosaminidases, and fucosyltransferases form hybrid and complex glycans in the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi apparatus, to impart the glycoprotein with proper protein folding, conformational stability, transport, and bioactivity of mature proteins (5Parodi A.J.

Elucidation of catalytic mechanisms and interactions of mannosidases is important for understanding various biological processes such as glycan metabolism, structure regulation, cell–cell interactions, and host–pathogen interactions and thus requires extensive knowledge of substrate specificity and cellular localization of individual glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases (7Mathew C.

Unlike the characterization of proteins and oligonucleotides, analysis of glycans and their isomeric structures can be difficult to achieve due to structural complexities, dynamic regulation, and nontemplated biosyntheses. Glycan modifications that are incorporated into glycoproteins are diverse and are dependent on the host species and their aforementioned endogenous glycosylation machinery. High mannose N-glycans comprise a class of glycans commonly found in biotherapeutic glycoproteins, and their presence has been associated with increased serum clearance (13Goetze A.M. Liu Y.D. Zhang Z. Shah B. Lee E. Bondarenko P.V. et al.High-mannose glycans on the Fc region of therapeutic IgG antibodies increase serum clearance in humans.Glycobiology. 2011; 21: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar); they are also capable of binding to endogenous mannose-binding lectin proteins/receptors and DC-SIGN receptors that are present on the surface innate immune cells (14Coelho V.

With the growing appreciation of the importance of glycosylation in protein bioactivity, novel glycoengineering techniques and varying cell expression systems such as plant and yeast are being explored in biotherapeutic production, which may produce diverse glycan structures (15Lalonde M.E.

Moreover, changes in manufacturing conditions and upregulation of specific glycosyltransferase genes in glycoengineering processes can produce unexpected glycan structures by creating an imbalance in the glycosylation machinery cascade within the ER and Golgi apparatus (19Palacpac N.Q. Yoshida S. Sakai H. Kimura Y. Fujiyama K. Yoshida T. et al.Stable expression of human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase in plant cells modifies N-linked glycosylation patterns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4692-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Given the potential impact of glycosylation on the bioactivity and stability of a glycoprotein, it is important that the glycan structures are accurately characterized in biotherapeutic drugs. To tackle this challenge, glycosidase enzymes that cleave specific glycan bonds are commonly used in glycan structure characterization (20Wang T. Voglmeir J. PNGases as valuable tools in glycoprotein analysis.Protein Pept. Lett. 2014; 21: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PNGaseF is amongst the most widely used enzyme that specifically cleaves N-glycans from asparagine residues of glycoproteins (20Wang T. Voglmeir J. PNGases as valuable tools in glycoprotein analysis.Protein Pept. Lett. 2014; 21: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), liberating intact glycans that can be directly analyzed by chromatographic techniques. Cleavage of mannose-mannose residues with specific glycosidic linkages can also be achieved using various mannosidases (21Wong-Madden S.T. Landry D. Purification and characterization of novel glycosidases from the bacterial genus Xanthomonas.Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), in particular, unbranched mannosyl-α1-6-mannosyl (Man-α1-6-Man) residues can be cleaved by α-1-6-mannosidase (21Wong-Madden S.T.

Previous literature reported that α1-6-mannosidase cloned from Xanthomonas manihotis is unable to cleave Gal-β1-4GlcNAc residues in linear oligosaccharides, as determined by TLC of linear oligosaccharide substrates labeled with a 7-amino methylcoumarin tag (21Wong-Madden S.T. Landry D. Purification and characterization of novel glycosidases from the bacterial genus Xanthomonas.Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In our efforts to map Man-α1-6-Man epitopes in N-glycan structures using α1-6-mannosidase from X. manihotis, we serendipitously observed cleavages of branched N-glycans containing a terminal β1-4-galactose residue at the nonreducing end. Herein, we report this unexpected reactivity where, in addition to its native α1-6-mannosidase activity on unbranched glycans, Gal-β1-4-GlcNAc linkages in branched N-glycans are cleaved by this enzyme. Using docking simulation studies, we highlight potential interactions that may be responsible for this unexpected reactivity. The observations provide unique insights into the dual glycosidase activity of the X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidase toward cleavages of unbranched and branched glycans, including selective recognition and degradation of terminal mannose and galactose residues in glycan substrates by the bacterial enzyme. Our findings show that careful structural elucidation needs to be considered when using glycosidase enzymes for mapping glycan structures, particularly in complex mixtures of biological samples that have a plethora of complex, hybrid, and high mannose N-glycans. However, our results do not detract from its usefulness in reacting with more defined high mannose glycan mixtures and rather suggest it may be an additional useful tool in the synthesis of monogalactosylated branched glycans.Resultsβ1-4-galactosidase activity of X. manihotis α1,6-mannosidase in the processing of branched glycansWe initially observed that treatments of pseudohybrid and hybrid glycans (compounds 1 and 2 in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) with α1-6-mannosidase from X. manihotis yielded degraded products with a shift of elution times that were observed by high pH anionic exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) analyses (Fig. 1C). The term pseudohybrid refers glycans comprising a GlcNAc residue attached to the mannose of the α6 antenna, whereas hybrid refers those comprising a GlcNAc on the α3 antenna (25Schiller B. Hykollari A. Yan S. Paschinger K. Wilson I.B. Complicated N-linked glycans in simple organisms.Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The potential cleavage of the branched Man-α1-6-Man linkage in hybrid glycan 2, that is, the Man-α1-6-Man glycosidic bond of the exposed monomannose residue on the α6-antenna, was ruled out as we also observed the simultaneous presence of a proteolytic product from pseudohybrid glycan 1, which does not contain any Man-α1-6-Man linkages. To understand where the cleavage occurred, we treated the two monogalactose-containing branched glycans 1 and 2 with LacZ β-galactosidase to selectively cleave terminal galactose-β1-4-GlcNAc residues. HPAEC-PAD analyses of these reactions revealed peaks that have the same retention times as those produced by α1-6-mannosidase for both glycans 1 and 2 (Fig. 1D). To further confirm the consistency of the glycan structures, we analyzed the α1-6-mannosidase reactions by porous graphitic carbon (PGC)–LC-MS/MS, an elegant method that is able to resolve the branch-specific linkage structures of α- and β-anomers of each glycan (26She Y.M. Tam R.Y. Li X. Rosu-Myles M. Sauve S. Resolving isomeric structures of native glycans by nanoflow porous graphitized carbon chromatography-mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2020; 92: 14038-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The β- and α-anomers of the degalactosylated products were observed at earlier retention times compared to those of the starting materials (Fig. S1, C and D). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) measurements of the glycan precursors 1 and 2 show the presence of the high abundance diagnostic ion at m/z 366.17 ([GalGlcNAc+H]+) and the complementary fragment at m/z 708.28 ([M-365+H]+) from its molecular parent ion, indicative of the glycan branch-specific fragmentations (Fig. S1, E and F) (26She Y.M. Tam R.Y. Li X. Rosu-Myles M. Sauve S. Resolving isomeric structures of native glycans by nanoflow porous graphitized carbon chromatography-mass spectrometry.Anal.

Enzymatic reactions of branched glycans 1 and 2 (i.e., the protonated molecule at m/z 1073.38 ([M+H]+)) with α1-6-mannosidase show the formation of glycan products at m/z 911.34, indicating the loss of a hexose residue (m/z 162.04). MS/MS analyses of the products at m/z 911.34 reveal the branch-specific diagnostic ion at m/z 204.19 or m/z 204.08 ([GlcNAc+H]+), as well as the complementary fragment at m/z 708.34 ([M-GlcNAc+H]+) (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating glycan structures containing a terminal GlcNAc residue at the branched side chain, that is, following the unexpected loss of a β-1-4-galactose residue at the terminal branch upon reaction with α1-6-mannosidase.To further validate that the loss of a hexose residue was not caused by the cleavage of the monomannose residue at the antennal position, we treated pseudohybrid glycan 1 with α1-2,3-mannosidase to cleave the α3-antennal monomannose residue to form the linear pentasaccharide 5 (Fig. S2). Analysis by HPAEC-PAD shows the presence of a peak at the earlier retention time of 11.5 min (Fig. S2C) compared to that of the degalactosylated pseudohybrid glycan 3 at 13.7 min (Fig. 2C). In addition, PGC-LC-MS/MS reveals a different fragmentation pattern of the demannosylated product at m/z 911.33 compared to that of the degalactosylated glycan at m/z 911.33 following treatment with α1-6-mannosidase (Fig. S2G versus Fig. 1E). High abundance peaks at m/z 546.14 ([M-GalGlcNAc+H]+) along with its diagnostic ion at m/z 366.18 ([GalGlcNAc+H]+) are observed for the unbranched glycan 5 containing a terminal GalGlcNAc (Fig. S2G).Figure 2Parallel comparison of enzymatic reactions of linear and branched monogalactosylated glycans with X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidase reveals selectivity toward branched glycans.

To rule out contamination that may have occurred during protein expression, SDS-PAGE of α1-6-mannosidase was performed, and the gel image shows merely a clear band at approximately 47 kDa and no other protein on the gel (Fig. S3). Further examination was conducted by highly sensitive Orbitrap LC-MS/MS analyses of the protein digests using trypsin and chymotrypsin separately as indicated later, followed by searches against NCBI and Uniprot databases; the only protein identified was X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidase.Confirmed mannosidase activity of X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidase on paucimannoseNext, we confirmed the known function of this enzyme by testing for its inherent α1-6-mannosidase activity by reacting it with paucimannose (Man3GlcNAc2) in combination with or without α1-2,3 mannosidase (Fig. S4). As α1-6-mannosidase only cleaves linear α1-6-mannose linkages, α1-2,3 mannosidase was introduced to remove the branched α1-3 monomannose residue of the trimannosyl core to form the linear glycan. In the absence of α1-2,3 mannosidase, HPAEC-PAD and PGC-LC-MS analyses show that no cleavage occurs on paucimannose when reacted with α1-6-mannosidase alone; the chromatogram retains the same peak as the starting Man3GlcNAc2 (red and black traces, Fig. S4A), consistent with the PGC-LC-MS β- and α-anomeric peaks at m/z 911.3343 for ([Man3GlcNAc2+H]+) (Fig. S4B). Treatment with α1-2,3 mannosidase alone results in the formation of a new peak at 7.3 min by HPAEC-PAD analysis (blue trace, Fig. S4A), which is further confirmed by the PGC-LC-MS β- and α-anomeric peaks at m/z 749.282 ([Man2GlcNAc2+H]+, Fig. S4D). Combination of both enzymes results in the expected cleavage of two mannose residues to form the ManGlcNAc2 trisaccharide at 5.5 min (purple trace, Fig. S4A) and is confirmed by the presence of the PGC-LC-MS peaks at m/z 587.229 ([ManGlcNAc2+H]+, Fig. S4C).Taken together, our initial data suggest that this unexpected β1-4-galactosidase activity of the α1-6-mannosidase may be highly correlated to the structural characteristics of branched glycans. Previous literature reported that α1-6-mannosidase from X. manihotis does not cleave linear Gal-β1-4-GlcNAc-containing substrates such as Gal-(±Fucα1-3)-β1-4-GlcNAc-β1-3-Gal-β1-4 Glc label-ed with 7-amino methylcoumarin after 4 h (for afucosylated oligosaccharide) or 20 h (for fucosylated oligosaccharide) at 37 °C, as analyzed by TLC (21Wong-Madden S.T. Landry D. Purification and characterization of novel glycosidases from the bacterial genus Xanthomonas.Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To confirm this observation, we tested the β1-4-galactosidase activity of α1-6-mannosidase on a linear pentasaccharide 5 prepared via cleavage of the α3 antenna of the pseudohybrid glycan 1 using treatment α1-2,3 mannosidase (Fig. S2A), followed by PGC-HPLC purification. Treatments of 100 μM of either the linear (Fig. 2A) or branched (Fig. 2B) glycan 1 with α1-6-mannosidase (2 U/μl) resulted in 23% cleavage of the latter branched glycan 1 but less than 3% of the linear saccharide 5 after 20 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2C), as determined by HPAEC-PAD analysis. Further extended incubation to 3 days at 37 °C resulted in slightly higher (7%) degalactosylation of the linear structure, whereas 55% cleavage was achieved in the branched pseudohybrid structure by HPAEC-PAD analysis (black trace, Fig. 2D) and is confirmed by PGC-LC-MS analysis (Fig. 2, E and F).Structure-dependent cleavages of complex glycans by X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidaseHaving demonstrated the selective β1-4-galactosidase activity of X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidase toward branched pseudohybrid glycan 1 over linear glycan 5, we next expanded the scope of the glycan structural requirements on complex biantennary glycans. We targeted the influence of the carbohydrate residues on the agalactosylated antenna (i.e., terminal monomannose-containing [(pseudo)hybrid-type] versus terminal GlcNAc-containing residue [complex-type glycans] of the agalactosylated antenna), as well as the antenna specificity of the terminal Gal-β1-4-GlcNAc residue (i.e., α3 antenna versus α6 antenna) (Fig. 3). Treatment of equimolar (100 μM) truncated (i.e., containing only one reducing end GlcNAc residue) complex or (pseudo)hybrid glycans containing a single terminal galactose residue on either the α3 or α6 antenna (compounds 1, 2, 7, 9) with α1-6-mannosidase (2 U/μl) revealed that the location of the terminal monogalactose residue has a slightly greater effect on its cleavage compared to the presence of a terminal monomannose or a GlcNAc-β1-2-mannose residue on the opposite agalactosylated antenna (Fig. 3). The terminal galactose on the α3 antenna (compounds 2 and 7, circle data points in Fig. 3G) were generally less susceptible to cleavage (9%–11% after 48 h) compared to the α6 antenna (compounds 1 and 9, 14%–20% after 48 h, triangle data points in Fig. 3G). There were minimal differences between hybrid 2 and complex glycan 7 when galactose is on the α3 antenna (red versus blue circle data points, Fig. 3G), but interestingly, a slight increase in cleavage of the pseudohybrid glycan containing the galactose on the α6 antenna 1 is observed compared to its complex glycan analog 9 (blue versus red triangle data points in Fig. 3G).Figure 3X. manihotis α1-6-mannosidase has increased β1-4-galactosidase activity toward digalactosylated complex glycans and slight selectivity toward the α6 antenna. Cleavage of Gal-β1-4-GlcNAc in glycan substrates using α1-6-mannosidase: (A and B) branched glycans containing single Gal-β1-4-GlcNAc branch at the α6 antenna 1 or α3 antenna 2; (C and D) biantennary complex glycan containing a terminal galactose at the α6 antenna 9 or α3 antenna 7; (E and F) digalactosylated complex glycan (G2) containing a mono-GlcNAc residue at the reducing end 10 or a di-GlcNAc chitobiose core at the reducing end 11. G, time-course of degalactosylation reactions of branched glycans (100 μM) with 2 U/μl of α1-6-mannosidase at 37 °C, showing an increase in degalactosylation in digalactosylated complex glycans.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Surprisingly, treatments of the same concentrations of enzyme (2 U/μl) with digalactosylated substrates (10 and 11, 100 μM) resulted in a greater cleavage of the terminal β1-4-galactose residue than any of the monogalactosylated glycans (Fig. 3E). After 24 h, degalactosylation of the truncated digalactosylated 10 glycan reached a reaction yield of 83%, compared to monogalactosylated glycans (compounds 1, 2, 7, 9) that are at a range of 8% to 14%. Cleavage of the nontruncated (i.e., bearing two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end) digalactosylated glycan 11 yielded similar results (Fig. 3F), albeit at a lower degalactosylation yield (60% at 24 h) than truncated glycan 10. Examining the cleavage products shows that the relative proportions of the two monogalactose glycoforms are formed at a similar ratio, with a slightly higher amount of the α3 glycoforms produced (7 and 12); this is consistent with our observation that the α6 analog is slightly more susceptible to β1-4-galactose cleavage by this α1-6-mannosidase compared to the α3 analog (Fig. 3E).Notably, the distribution of degalactosylated products are in contrast to β1-4-galactose cleavage with LacZ β1-4-galactosidase, in which the latter has increased reactivity toward cleaving the Gal-β1-4-GlcNAc linkage in the α3 antenna than the α6-antenna (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with literature (28van den Eijnden D.H.

https://openalex.org/W4289782248,"Exosuits have been broadly researched owing to their benefits from soft and deformable nature. However, compared to exoskeletons, the exosuits have disadvantages in that the deformation of suit and human tissue can cause dissipation, leading to low force transfer efficiency. In this study, we explore the force capability and human-suit stiffness depending on the anchor point positions of the exosuit, introducing a better understanding of exosuit design. We found the relationships between the anchor point position and the force capability, and the anchor point position and the human-suit stiffness by conducting human subject experiments. When the distance between the anchor point of the waist belt and the anchor point of the thigh brace increased, the force capability increased, whereas the human-suit stiffness decreased. Also, statistical analyses are implemented to verify significant differences according to the anchor point position with a 5% significance level. Moreover, we discuss why the capability of force transmission and the human-suit stiffness differ depending on the anchor point positions. The force capability differed with anchor point positions because of the change in the effective cable stroke. Additionally, the force capability changes nonlinearly owing to the body curve as the condition level of the anchor points changes. The human-suit stiffness is affected by the interference of the body when the assistive force is transmitted through the cable. Characteristics of the force capability and human-suit stiffness model can be used to optimize the performance of existing exosuit or to serve a valuable guide of design a new exosuit when the exosuit needs to maximize the force capability or stiffness."

https://openalex.org/W4289834221,"The investigation of jellyfish gastrovascular systems mainly focused on stain injections and dissections, negatively affected by thickness and opacity of the mesoglea. Therefore, descriptions are incomplete and data about tridimensional structures are scarce. In this work, morphological and functional anatomy of the gastrovascular system of Rhizostoma pulmo (Macri 1778) was investigated in detail with innovative techniques: resin endocasts and 3D X-ray computed microtomography. The gastrovascular system consists of a series of branching canals ending with numerous openings within the frilled margins of the oral arms. Canals presented a peculiar double hemi-canal structure with a medial adhesion area which separates centrifugal and centripetal flows. The inward flow involves only the “mouth” openings on the internal wing of the oral arm and relative hemi-canals, while the outward flow involves only the two outermost wings’ hemi-canals and relative “anal” openings on the external oral arm. The openings differentiation recalls the functional characteristics of a through-gut apparatus. We cannot define the gastrovascular system in Rhizostoma pulmo as a traditional through-gut, rather an example of adaptive convergence, that partially invalidates the paradigm of a single oral opening with both the uptake and excrete function."
https://openalex.org/W4289847661,"In this paper we examine the effect of uncertainty on readers' predictions about meaning. In particular, we were interested in how uncertainty might influence the likelihood of committing to a specific sentence meaning. We conducted two event-related potential (ERP) experiments using particle verbs such as turn down and manipulated uncertainty by constraining the context such that readers could be either highly certain about the identity of a distant verb particle, such as turn the bed […] down, or less certain due to competing particles, such as turn the music […] up/down. The study was conducted in German, where verb particles appear clause-finally and may be separated from the verb by a large amount of material. We hypothesised that this separation would encourage readers to predict the particle, and that high certainty would make prediction of a specific particle more likely than lower certainty. If a specific particle was predicted, this would reflect a strong commitment to sentence meaning that should incur a higher processing cost if the prediction is wrong. If a specific particle was less likely to be predicted, commitment should be weaker and the processing cost of a wrong prediction lower. If true, this could suggest that uncertainty discourages predictions via an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio. However, given the clear predictions made by the literature, it was surprisingly unclear whether the uncertainty manipulation affected the two ERP components studied, the N400 and the PNP. Bayes factor analyses showed that evidence for our a priori hypothesised effect sizes was inconclusive, although there was decisive evidence against a priori hypothesised effect sizes larger than 1μV for the N400 and larger than 3μV for the PNP. We attribute the inconclusive finding to the properties of verb-particle dependencies that differ from the verb-noun dependencies in which the N400 and PNP are often studied."

Thirty patients who received WBRT at our institution between October 2020 and May 2021 in the c-SP and ht-SP were investigated. The DUON head mask (60124, Orfit Industries, Wijnegem, Belgium) was used in the c-SP, and a thermoplastic U-Frame Mask (R420U, Klarity Medical & Equipment Co. Ltd., Lan Yu, China) was used in the ht-SP. Daily setup verification using planning computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT was corrected for translational (lateral, longitudinal, and vertical) and rotational (yaw) errors. In the c-SP, the means of systematic errors were -0.80, 0.79, and 0.37 mm and random errors were 0.27, 0.54, and 0.39 mm in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical translational dimensions, respectively. Whereas, for the ht-SP, the means of systematic errors were -0.07, 0.73, and -0.63 mm, and random errors were 0.75, 1.39, 1.02 mm in the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical translational dimensions, respectively. The PTV margins were calculated using Stroom et al.'s [2Σ+0.7σ] and van Herk et al.'s recipe [2.5Σ+0.7σ]. Appropriate PTV margins with van Herk et al.'s recipe in WBRT were <2 mm and 1.5° in the c-SP and <3 mm and 2° in the ht-SP in the translational and rotational directions, respectively. Although the head tilt in the supine position requires more margin, it can be applied as a sufficiently stable and effective position in radiotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W4289782323,"The western conifer seed bug (WCSB, Leptoglossus occidentalis ) is a pest of many pine species and is invasive worldwide. WCSB directly and indirectly deteriorates pine nut production by sucking seeds from cones. Currently, researchers think that WCSBs search for food by a combination of cues from visible light, infrared radiation, and chemicals such as monoterpenes. Some research revealed that WCSBs prefer larger cones, and it was thought that WCSBs suck seeds from and obtain more heat on larger cones. However, in early spring, we observed that most WCSBs gathered on male cones rather than on female cones and young cones. We hypothesized that male pine cones were warmer than female cones and needles, and WCSBs sucking male cones may receive more heat. To test these hypotheses, we measured spectral reflectance with a hyperspectral sensor and temperature of pine organs with tiny thermocouples, and the data were analyzed by a heat budget model. Our results revealed that male cones were significantly warmer and more reflective than female cones and needles, which may attract WCSBs. These results supported our hypothesis that WCSBs on male cones were warmer than those on other organs. This study will help further understanding of WCSBs and the adaptive value of pine cone colors."

Assessments will take place at 3-month intervals (T0, T3, T6, T9, and T12). The patients will be allocated to intervention and control groups by random allocation. The intervention group will receive individualized nutritional interventions with normoproteic diets (1.0 g/kg) after 60 days of KTx whereas the controls will receive the standard nutritional guidance for the post-KTx period. The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline in log proteinuria assessed with the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Secondary efficacy variables include body composition, anthropometry, quality of life assessment and physical activity, lipid profile and glycemic control. Ninety-two subjects per group will afford 70% power to detect a difference of 25% between groups in log proteinuria.

Happy House was adapted to be delivered in larger groups and in longer sessions than the RAP-A. The 11 sessions in RAP-A were restructured to 6 sessions in Happy House. Major changes were not required for any of the materials. However, some content, illustrations and videos were adapted to be more feasible for the school context and to enhance the comprehensibility, acceptability and appropriateness.Happy House has great potential to be relevant, comprehensible and acceptable for Vietnamese adolescents. Further research is warranted to examine the relevance, comprehensibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of this program on adolescents' mental health before advocating for scaling up program delivery in high schools throughout Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W4289782671,"The interaction between infant feeding and maternal lactational physiology influences female inter-birth intervals and mediates maternal reproductive trade-offs. We investigated variation in feeding development in 72 immature wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, and made inferences about maternal lactation over the course of infancy. We compared the percentage (%) of time that mothers nursed infants as a function of infant age and assessed how hourly rates and bout durations of nursing and foraging varied in association with differences in offspring age, sex, and maternal parity. Nursing % times, rates and durations were highest for infants ≤ 6 months old but did not change significantly from 6 months to 5 years old. Nursing continued at a decreasing rate for some 5- to 7-year-olds. Infants ≤ 6 months old foraged little. Foraging rates did not change after 1 year old, but foraging durations and the % time devoted to foraging increased with age. Independent foraging probably became a dietary requirement for infants at 1 year old, when their energy needs may have surpassed the available milk energy. Infants spent as much time foraging by the time they were 4 to 5 years old as adults did. No sex effect on infant nursing or foraging was apparent, but infants of primiparous females had higher foraging rates and spent more time foraging than the infants of multiparous females did. Although no data on milk composition were collected, these findings are consistent with a working hypothesis that like other hominoids, chimpanzee mothers maintained a fixed level of lactation effort over several years as infants increasingly supplemented their growing energy, micronutrient and hydration needs via independent foraging. Plateauing lactation may be a more widespread adaptation that allows hominoid infants time to attain the physiology and skills necessary for independent feeding, while also providing them with a steady dietary base on which they could rely consistently through infancy, and enabling mothers to maintain a fixed, predictable level of lactation effort."
https://openalex.org/W4289847826,"Many popular pedagogical approaches instruct children to construct their ideas into tangible and physical products. With the prospect of implementation, do children decide to go for the most creative ideas or do they shift towards ideas that are perhaps less creative but easier to construct? We conducted a field experiment to test whether expected construction affects children’s creative idea selection. In this experiment, 403 children were asked to select the most original ideas to make a toy elephant more fun to play with. We randomly assigned them to a treatment condition—in which they were informed they had to construct one of the original ideas that they selected—and a control group—in which children were informed that, after idea selection, they had to perform another task. Children who were instructed to construct the selected idea into a tangible product turned a blind eye to original ideas and preferred the more feasible ideas. Thus, pedagogical approaches that aim to stimulate creativity by instructing children to construct original ideas into tangible and physical products may unintentionally change children’s choices for creative ideas. This finding highlights the importance for educators of guiding children’s decision-making process in creative problem solving, and to be aware of children’s bias against original ideas when designing creative assignments for them."

An overall SMR was estimated along with SMRs presented for cohorts with different lookback windows (1, 2, 5, 10 years). SMRs were stratified by calendar year, length of follow-up and age group. Mortality rates in a random sample of 1 million CPRD GOLD patients were slightly lower than the national population [SMR = 0.980 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.973, 0.987)]. Cohorts with observational lookback had SMRs below one [1 year of lookback; SMR = 0.905 (0.898, 0.912), 2 years; SMR = 0.881 (0.874, 0.888), 5 years; SMR = 0.849 (0.841, 0.857), 10 years; SMR = 0.837 (0.827, 0.847)]. Mortality rates in the first two years after patient entry into CPRD were higher than the general population, while SMRs dropped below one thereafter. Mortality rates in CPRD, using simple entry requirements, are similar to rates seen in the English population. The requirement of at least a single year of lookback results in lower mortality rates compared to national estimates."
