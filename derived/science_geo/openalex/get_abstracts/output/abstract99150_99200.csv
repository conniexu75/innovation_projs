https://openalex.org/W1550007121,"Reaction of isolated mitochondria with a variety of agents that lead to oxidation or cross-linking of sulfhydryl groups leads to an increased open probability of the permeability transition pore, a cyclosporin A-sensitive channel. We have investigated the mechanism by which the pore is induced by menadione, diamide, arsenite, and tert-butylhydroperoxide. We find that these inducers increase the probability of pore opening by shifting its gating potential to higher values. Furthermore, the induced shift was prevented by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide or dithiothreitol. At moderate levels of depolarization an apparent I50 for N-ethylmaleimide of bout 5 microM can be defined, while the N-ethylmaleimide or dithiothreitol effects are overcome by maximal depolarization. We conclude that the oxidation-reduction state of vicinal thiols in cysteinyl residues plays a critical role in tuning the voltage sensor of the transition pore, with an increase of gating potential (i.e. an increase in the probability of pore opening despite a high transmembrane potential difference) as the couple is poised to a more oxidized state. These findings may have implications for the mechanism of cell damage under oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2166583656,"Structures of the 31-kilodalton catalytic domain of rat DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) and the whole 39-kilodalton enzyme were determined at 2.3 and 3.6 angstrom resolution, respectively. The 31-kilodalton domain is composed of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains arranged to form a DNA binding channel reminiscent of the polymerase domains of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The amino-terminal 8-kilodalton domain is attached to the fingers subdomain by a flexible hinge. The two invariant aspartates found in all polymerase sequences and implicated in catalytic activity have the same geometric arrangement within structurally similar but topologically distinct palms, indicating that the polymerases have maintained, or possibly re-evolved, a common nucleotidyl transfer mechanism. The location of Mn2+ and deoxyadenosine triphosphate in pol beta confirms the role of the invariant aspartates in metal ion and deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2136613244,"MOST asymptomatic individuals infected with HIV-1 have a cyto-toxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the virus Gag proteins which can be demonstrated in vitro1,2. Epitopes have been mapped in p17 Gag and p24 Gag restricted by HLA-B8 (p17-3 and p24-13) and -B27 (p24-14) 2,3. Viruses isolated from patients who make CTL responses to these peptides vary within the genetic sequences encoding these epitopes and some mutations lead to reduction in killing activity in vitro4. This was attributed to either failure of the variant epitope to bind major histocompatibility complex class I or failure of T-cell receptors to bind the presented peptide. But peptide variants of class I-restricted epitopes cause 'antagonism', that is, the presence of a variant epitope (in the form of peptide) inhibits normal lysis of targets presenting the original epitope5,6. This mirrors similar findings in class II-restricted systems7â€“10. Here we report that naturally occurring variant forms of p17-3, p24-13 and p24-14 may cause antagonism of CTL lines derived from the same individuals. The effect is present if the epitopes are derived from synthetic peptides and when they are processed from full-length proteins expressed by either recombinant vaccinia constructs or replicating HIV."

https://openalex.org/W2157856503,"Stimulation of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to rapid and transient expression of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF). When such cells are precultured for 2 days with a low dose of LPS (20 ng/ml) followed by stimulation with a high dose of LPS (1 microgram/ml), expression of the TNF gene is minimal, i.e. the cells are tolerant. In nuclear run-on analysis, such tolerant cells show only a low degree of transcription, indicating that tolerance operates at or upstream of the transcription level. The CD14 LPS receptor is, however, up-regulated (not down-regulated) in tolerant cells, and LPS can, in fact, still lead to activation of tolerant cells as evidenced by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Resolution of the NF-kappa B complex in gel shift analysis shows that the binding protein, mobilized in naive Mono Mac 6 cells, consists mainly of p50-p65 heterodimers, while in tolerant cells, the p50 homodimer is predominant. This increase in p50 homodimers coincides with an increase in p105 mRNA, suggestive of a transcriptional up-regulation of p50. Reporter gene analysis reveals that the NF-kappa B complex mobilized in tolerant cells is functionally inactive in that NF-kappa B-dependent luciferase constructs containing the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat or the TNF 5'-region show only minimal transactivation after LPS stimulation. Similar to Mono Mac 6 cells, primary blood monocytes, when precultured with a low dose of LPS, also become tolerant and produce little TNF after LPS stimulation. The tolerant blood monocytes also up-regulate CD14, and they mobilize NF-kappa B with a predominance of p50 homodimers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tolerance to LPS is determined by post-receptor mechanisms that involve an altered composition of the NF-kappa B complex."
https://openalex.org/W2128186576,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) has been proposed to mediate in concert with the LDL receptor (LDLR) the uptake of dietary lipoproteins into the hepatocytes. This hypothesis was tested by transient inactivation of LRP in vivo. Receptor-associated protein (RAP), a dominant negative regulator of LRP function, was transferred by an adenoviral vector to the livers of mice lacking LDLR (LDLR-/-). The inactivation of LRP by RAP was associated with a marked accumulation of chylomicron remnants in LDLR-/- mice and to a lesser degree in normal mice, suggesting that both LDLR and LRP are involved in remnant clearance."
https://openalex.org/W1510358641,"The 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase of Escherichia coli, also known as formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg protein), has N-glycosylase and AP-lyase activities. This enzyme repairs oxidative DNA damage by efficiently removing formamidopyrimidine lesions and 8-oxoguanine residues from DNA. Defined oligodeoxynucleotides containing various 8-oxopurines were used to examine the substrate specificity of Fpg protein and to establish the role of functional groups in DNA on damage recognition and catalysis. Binding affinities of Fpg protein were established for duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanine, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyadenine, 8-oxo-2'-deoxynebularine, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyinosine, abasic sites, and a ring-open adduct of C8-aminofluorene guanine. The C8 keto group of 8-oxodG:dC presents in the major groove and is correlated with tight binding (Kd = 8.9 nM). Binding is much weaker when the C8 keto functional group is in the minor groove, as in 8-oxodG:dA (Kd = 340 nM). Km and Vmax were determined for the cleavage reaction. Specificity constants (Kcat/Km) are consistently higher for oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing 8-oxopurines with C6 and C8 keto groups, as in 8-oxodG:dC and 8-oxodI:dC, where Kcat/Km are 9.3 and 18 min-1 nM x 10(-3), respectively. 8-oxodN:dC lacks the C6 keto group; the specificity constant is 0.024 min-1 nM x 10(-3). Taken together, our data suggest that the C8 keto group of 8-oxodeoxyguanine and the carbonyl moiety of formamidopyrimidine enable Fpg protein to recognize and bind duplex DNA containing these modified bases. An enzyme-catalyzed reaction involving the C6 keto group of the substrate leads to removal of these lesions. A mechanism involving protonation at O-6 of 8-oxoguanine is proposed to account for the N-glycosylase activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1481149004,"Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent formation of NO and citrulline from L-arginine and molecular oxygen. The localization of the heme-binding consensus sequence in the NH2-terminal half of NOS and of the binding sequences for nucleotides (FMN and FAD) in the COOH-terminal half suggests a bidomain structure. In addition, the presence of a putative calmodulin-binding sequence between the heme- and flavin-binding domains of the enzyme suggests a role for calmodulin in modulating a spatial orientation of these domains that is required for catalytic activity. First, to determine the effects of calmodulin and the functionality of the separated domains, Ca2+/calmodulin binding-induced conformational changes in NOS were measured by fluorescence quenching, from which a binding constant of approximately 1 nM for calmodulin was calculated. Second, electron transport to various artificial acceptors was measured. The addition of Ca2+/calmodulin increased cytochrome c reduction from 10-15-fold while stimulating the rate of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and ferricyanide reduction only slightly, if at all. Calmodulin stimulation of NOS results in NADPH-mediated cytochrome c reduction, which is sensitive to superoxide dismutase, and the reduction of acetylated cytochrome c, which is only weakly reducible by unstimulated NOS. Thus, this stimulated activity is presumably superoxide anion-mediated. Third, limited proteolysis of NOS in the absence of calmodulin resulted in a time-dependent increase in cytochrome c reductase activity, which was not inhibitable by superoxide dismutase, and a decrease in catalysis of NO formation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the tryptic digest demonstrated the formation of approximately 89- and approximately 79-kDa fragments. Sequence analysis of the peptides confirmed that trypsin cleaves the enzyme in the putative calmodulin-binding region beginning with Ala728. This region was protected from proteolysis by the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin. The separated NH2-terminal domain exhibited the characteristic spectrum of bound heme, while the COOH-terminal domain showed the characteristic spectrum of bound flavins. Other cleavage patterns were obtained in the presence of calmodulin. The data demonstrate that the heme- and flavin-binding domains of NOS can be isolated in functionally intact forms."
https://openalex.org/W2021938232,"MANY intracellular targets of protein-tyrosine kinases possess Src homology 2 (SH2) domains that directly recognize phosphotyrosine-containing sites on autophosphorylated growth factor receptors and cytoplasmic proteins, and thereby mediate the activation of biochemical signalling pathways1â€“7. SH2 domains possess relatively well conserved residues that form the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket8â€“11, and more variable residues that are implicated in determining binding specificity by recognition of the three amino acids carboxy-terminal to phosphotyrosine (the +1 to +3 positions) 5,7,12,13. One such residue, occupying the EF1 position of the +3-binding pocket, is a Thr in the SH2 domain of the Src tyrosine kinase12, but is predicted to be a Trp in the SH2 domain of the Sem-5/drk/Grb2 adaptor protein5. Here we report that changing this residue in the Src SH2 domain from Thr to Trp switches its selectivity to resemble that of the Sem-5/drk/Grb2 SH2 domain. Furthermore, this mutant Src SH2 domain effectively substitutes for the SH2 domain of the Sem-5 protein in activation of the Ras pathway in vivo. These results identify a residue that can modify SH2 selectivity, and indicate that the biological activity of an SH2 domain correlates with its binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2123847288,"Integrins are heterodimeric, transmembrane cell adhesion receptors that have recently been shown to function in transmembrane signal transduction. To examine the specific role of integrin intracellular domains in signal transduction, chimeric receptors containing various integrin intracellular domains coupled to a reporter consisting of the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the small, non-signaling subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor were expressed in cultured human fibroblasts and assayed for their ability to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of the 125-kDa cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, pp125FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK was induced in cultured fibroblasts that transiently expressed chimeric receptors containing either the beta 1, beta 3, or beta 5 integrin intracellular domain and were selected by magnetic bead sorting. However, expression of chimeric receptors containing either the alpha 5 or an alternatively spliced form of the beta 3 intracellular domain (beta 3B), as well as those lacking an intracellular domain, failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK. These results indicate that information contained in the beta 1, beta 3, or beta 5 integrin intracellular domain is sufficient to stimulate integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of specific intracellular proteins and that integrin extracellular and transmembrane domains are not required for inducing tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results also indicate that alternative splicing can regulate the ability of beta integrin intracellular domains to participate in signal transduction, and they further suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of specific beta integrins may play a role in the signal transduction pathway involving extracellular matrix molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1481866568,"We have investigated the effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and three cytokines on expression of antioxidative enzymes, manganese-superoxide dismutase, copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase, and catalase in cultured hepatocytes of rat. While interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 induced manganese-superoxide dismutase gene expression, they slightly suppressed catalase gene expression in rat hepatocytes. TGF-beta 1 suppressed expression of all these antioxidative enzymes in time- and cell density-dependent manners. Furthermore, we examined the effect of TGF-beta 1 on expression of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase, which exhibit glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity in rat hepatocytes. Expression of two major classes of the rat glutathione-S-transferase subunits 1 and 2 was also reduced by TGF-beta 1, although expression of glutathione peroxidase was not affected. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that production of peroxides was increased in hepatocytes treated with TGF-beta 1. These data suggest that augmented production of hydrogen peroxide and its intermediate through suppression of antioxidative enzyme expression may participate in cellular injury or growth inhibition promoted by TGF-beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W3880031,"The alpha subunits of leukocyte CD11/CD18 integrins contain an approximately 200-amino acid inserted domain (I-domain) that may be important for multivalent adhesive recognitions. A recombinant form of the I-domain of CD11b/CD18 was generated and analyzed directly for interaction with complementary integrin ligands. CD11b I-domain bound the activation-dependent monoclonal antibody 7E3, and the functionally blocking anti-CD11b monoclonal antibodies OKM9, 60.1, and LM2/1, but not OKM1 or M1/70. Fibrinogen or soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 associated with CD11b I-domain in a concentration-dependent manner. Binding of 125I-fibrinogen to recombinant CD11b I-domain was saturable, governed by a Kd of approximately 0.22 +/- 0.06 microM, and fully inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled fibrinogen, or by the P1 peptide (KY)GWTVFQKRLDGSV (IC50 approximately 2.5-5 microM), duplicating the fibrinogen gamma chain sequence Gly190-Val202. In contrast, 125I-factor X binding to CD11b I-domain was only partially inhibited (50-60%) by a molar excess of unlabeled factor X, and entirely unaffected by functionally blocking anti-CD11b monoclonal antibodies or by factor X-derived synthetic peptidyl antagonists. We conclude that the I-domain of CD11b participates in qualitative mechanisms of receptor activation and contains the binding site(s) for the CD11b/CD18 ligands fibrinogen and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, while it is only minimally implicated in the recognition of factor X."
https://openalex.org/W2103247420,"Pancreatic acinar cells, a model cell type for the study of exocytosis in non-excitable cells, were used here to test the hypothesis that molecular mechanisms regulating exocytosis from neuronal and neuroendocrine cells may also be utilized in exocrine cells. Using specific antisera raised against vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) isoforms 1 and 2, we have identified VAMP-2, but not VAMP-1, immunoreactive proteins on rat pancreatic acinar cell secretory (zymogen) granules. This 18-kDa protein co-migrated with rat brain synaptic vesicle VAMP-2. Tetanus toxin (TeTx) light chain caused complete cleavage of this protein, which was prevented by the addition of EDTA. This toxin also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner Ca(2+)-stimulated enzyme secretion by up to approximately 30% in streptolysin O-permeabilized acini. This effect of TeTx on secretion was prevented by the zinc endopeptidase inhibitor captopril or by boiling the toxin. Incomplete inhibition of secretion by TeTx may suggest that TeTx-insensitive or VAMP-2-independent mechanisms also regulate exocytosis. In support, TeTx light chain was without effect on Rab3AL (effector domain peptide of Rab3)-mediated potentiation of Ca(2+)-stimulated secretion. These results indicate that a TeTx-sensitive VAMP-2-like protein on zymogen granules participates in Ca(2+)-regulated pancreatic enzyme secretion and that undefined Rab3AL-activated mechanisms may act independently to regulate exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1794696801,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a large multifunctional receptor that is involved in the cellular uptake of a number of functionally diverse ligands including apoE-rich remnant lipoproteins, lipoprotein lipase, alpha 2-macroglobulin-protease complexes, plasminogen activator-inhibitor complexes, and the active protease tissue-type plasminogen activator. Ligand binding and competition experiments suggest that most LRP ligands bind to specific, independent sites on the large 515-kDa subunit of the receptor. In a previous study (Moestrup, S.K., Holtet, T.L., Etzerodt, M., Thogersen, H.C., Nykjaer, A., Andreasen, P.A., Rasmussen, H.H., Sottrup-Jensen, L., and Gliemann, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 13691-13696), ligand blotting was used to localize the binding sites for urokinase-type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) complexes and for alpha 1-macroglobulin to a proteolytic fragment of LRP containing the second cluster of complement-type cysteine-rich repeats. Here, we have used a recombinant DNA approach to express functionally restricted chimeric LRP-minireceptors containing two different regions of the extracellular domain of the receptor in cultured cells. Receptor-associated protein, a negative modulator of LRP activity, is bound and internalized by cells transfected with either construct. A minireceptor containing the cluster of eight complement-type cysteine-rich repeats followed by four epidermal growth factor precursor homologous domains binds and internalizes 125I-labeled plasminogen activator-PAI-1 complexes. It also mediates the cellular uptake of the uncomplexed protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), suggesting that the tPA and PAI-1 binding sites on LRP are in close vicinity and might promote cooperative binding of tPA-PAI-1 complexes. However, alpha 2-macroglobulin is not internalized by this minireceptor suggesting that this ligand requires the presence of a single epidermal growth factor-repeat which is contained in the previously studied proteolytic fragment but is absent from the minireceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1676144090,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is the rapid physiologic inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). In plasma and the extracellular matrix, PAI-1 is associated with the adhesive glycoprotein vitronectin. In order to characterize the PAI-1 structural domain responsible for binding to vitronectin, the segment of the PAI-1 cDNA encoding amino acids 13-147 (nucleotides 248-650) was randomly mutagenized and subcloned into a bacterial expression vector containing the mature PAI-1 coding sequence. Recombinant PAI-1 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and bacterial lysates assayed in duplicate for uPA inhibitory activity and vitronectin binding. Of 190 clones screened, six consistently demonstrated decreased vitronectin binding relative to uPA inhibitory activity. DNA sequence analysis of four of these clones identified 10 unique missense mutations, all located between base pairs 298 and 641, with each clone containing between one and four substitutions. Each substitution was expressed independently by site-directed mutagenesis and again analyzed for uPA inhibitory activity and vitronectin binding. Five point mutations that selectively disrupt vitronectin binding were identified. All 5 residues are located on the exterior of the PAI-1 structure. These findings appear to define a complex binding surface that bridges alpha-helices C and E to beta-strand 1A and includes amino acids 55, 109, 110, 116, and 123. These results suggest that vitronectin binding may stabilize the active conformation of PAI-1 by restricting the movement of beta-sheet A and thereby preventing insertion of the reactive center loop."
https://openalex.org/W1568852071,"Binding of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to the fibroblast growth factor receptor leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor on several tyrosine residues. Wild-type FGF receptor 1 (flg) and a mutated receptor (Y766F), in which an autophosphorylation site (Tyr-766) was mutated to phenylalanine, were expressed in rat myoblasts and in hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells. It was found that the point mutation at Tyr-766 resulted in a decrease in FGF receptor internalization, as well as a reduction in both ligand-induced FGF receptor down-regulation and degradation. It has been shown previously that phosphorylation of Tyr-766 is essential for interaction with phospholipase C gamma and that the Y766F FGF receptor mutant is unable to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and Ca2+ release from internal stores. The results presented in this report indicate that Tyr-766 is also essential for cellular trafficking of FGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1549963158,"Two monoclonal antibodies termed CT1 and CT2 define a cell surface oligosaccharide molecule expressed on restricted populations of murine lymphocytes. This oligosaccharide structure is largely associated with the extracellular domain of the CD45 family of tyrosine phosphatases, molecules required for lymphocytes to proliferate in response to antigen stimulation. Previous work has shown that the oligosaccharide structure recognized by the CT antibodies is identical, at least in part, to that of the human Sda blood group, a structure formed through enzymatic addition of N-acetylgalactosamine in beta 1,4-linkage to a sub-terminal galactose substituted with an alpha 2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid residue. We have used a mammalian transient expression cloning approach to isolate a murine cDNA that determines expression of an oligosaccharide structure recognized by the CT antibodies as well as human anti-Sda serum. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 510-amino acid type II transmembrane protein characteristic of other mammalian glycosyltransferases. Enzymatic characterization of the protein expressed by this cDNA demonstrates that it encodes a beta 1,4-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase activity that can add to the low molecular weight acceptor 3'-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, to form the nonreducing terminal tetrasaccharide Sda blood group structure. This cDNA shares 51% nucleotide sequence identity with a cDNA encoding the human GM2/GD2 synthase, particularly throughout the regions encoding their putative catalytic domains. Southern blot analysis demonstrates that these two cDNA's represent distinct loci in the murine genome. The CT-GalNAc transferase cDNA isolated here represents a tool with which to define the role(s) of lymphocyte cell surface CT determinants, and may facilitate the isolation of the human Sda blood group locus through cross-hybridization approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1596040936,"Plasma membranes isolated from dispersed gastric muscle cells exhibited calmodulin-dependent NOS activity that was stimulated by Ca2+ in the range 0.1-1 mM (maximum 10 microM). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) (in the presence of GTP), and GTP gamma S (guanosine 5â€˜-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate) stimulated NOS activity in a concentration-dependent fashion above that maximally stimulated by Ca2+. The increase in NOS activity induced by VIP, PACAP, and GTP gamma S was abolished by GDP beta S (guanosine 5â€˜-O-(beta-thio)diphosphate), which had no effect on NOS activity stimulated by Ca2+. The NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine and the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium abolished NOS activity stimulated by all agents including Ca2+. NOS activity stimulated by GTP gamma S, VIP, and PACAP was inhibited by Gi alpha 1-2 antibody but not by Gq alpha, Gs alpha, and Gi alpha 3 antibodies. NOS activity stimulated by VIP and PACAP was inhibited by 80-83% in membranes derived from pertussis toxin-treated cells. We conclude that a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS present in plasma membranes of gastric muscle cells is activated by two homologous peptide transmitters, VIP and PACAP, via a common receptor coupled to pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive Gi1-2. The study provides the first evidence of receptor-mediated G protein activation of NOS in smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1521518940,"T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation of an Lck-deficient Jurkat mutant, J.CaM1, with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR beta monoclonal antibodies failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p42MAPK. The same stimuli activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in J.CaM1 cells transfected with Lck, demonstrating that Lck plays a critical role in MAP kinase activation. Utilizing immunocomplex kinase assays, we demonstrated that TCR/CD3 ligation activated a MAP kinase kinase kinase (Raf-1) as well as a MAP kinase kinase (MEK-1) in Jurkat but not in J.CaM1 cells. It was possible, however, to activate Raf-1, MEK-1, and p42MAPK in J.CaM1 cells during treatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which activates protein kinase C (PKC). This demonstrates the presence of a PKC-dependent pathway which functions independently from Lck in MAP kinase activation. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with either anti-TCR beta or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody failed to induce substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins or their association with Grb2 which forms a complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor hSOS. However, the same stimuli induced tyrosine phosphorylation of another putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor, p95Vav, in Jurkat but not J.CaM1 cells. Moreover, Lck was reversibly co-immunoprecipitated with p95Vav, and the stoichiometry of binding increased in anti-CD3-treated Jurkat cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav. These data show that the TCR activates MAP kinase by way of a signaling cascade, which depends upon Lck, and may be mediated by downstream events involving PKC or p95Vav which act on Raf-1 and MEK-1."
https://openalex.org/W1602242875,"Abstract Inactivation of photolyzed rhodopsin requires phosphorylation of the receptor and binding of the 48-kDa regulatory protein arrestin. We recently isolated a novel form of arrestin, termed p44, that is truncated at the COOH terminus (Palczewski, K., Buczylko, J., Ohguro, H., Annan, R. S., Carr, S. A., Crabb, J. W., Kaplan, M. W., Johnson, R. S., and Walsh, K. A. (1994) Protein Sci. 3, 319-329) and strongly inhibits Gt activation by non-phosphorylated rhodopsin. p44 is identical to arrestin except at the COOH terminus, where the 35 amino acids of arrestin are replaced by a single alanine residue. p44 is identified as a splice variant of arrestin based on the identical cDNA sequence of p44 with arrestin (except the 3' non-coding regions), the presence of an exon/intron junction at the Ser369 codon, and identical Southern hybridization patterns generated by the 3' non-coding portion of arrestin and p44. Immunocytochemistry reveals that p44 is localized in the photoreceptor outer segment, whereas arrestin is present throughout the cell. This specificity of localization to the outer segment is consistent with a role of p44 in the phototransduction cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1550790333,"We have investigated the abilities of calmodulin (CaM) tryptic fragments 1-75 (TRCI) or 78-148 (TRCII) to activate gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (gMLCK), rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK), and neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activities. Our results indicate for all three enzymes that binding of CaM follows an ordered mechanism wherein the C-terminal lobe, represented by TRCII, binds specifically to a site we designated as A, followed by binding of the N-terminal lobe, represented by TRCI, to a site designated as B. With TRCII and TRCI bound to their respective sites, skMLCK and gMLCK activities are both activated to about 80% of their maximum levels. Occupancy of both sites in the MLCK enzymes by TRCI results in only low levels of enzyme activation; occupancy of both sites by TRCII also results in low levels of gMLCK activity, but activates skMLCK activity to 65% of the maximum level. With TRCI bound at site B and either TRCII or TRCI bound at site A, nNOS activity is 50% of the maximum level. Apparent dissociation constants for TRCII binding to site A and TRCI binding to site B are, respectively; 0.3 and 3 microM (skMLCK); 1.2 and 0.8 microM (gMLCK); 10 nM and 150 microM (nNOS). Our results demonstrate that the CaM lobes can make distinct contributions to binding and/or activation of different CaM-dependent enzymes and that the tethering function of the central helix can be mimicked by sufficiently high concentrations of the CaM fragments. We have modeled tethering as if it stabilizes the CaM-enzyme complex by creating a high effective concentration of the N-terminal lobe. Calculated values for this concentration term indicate essentially identical contributions by the central helix to the observed nanomolar dissociation constants of the three CaM-enzyme complexes examined."
https://openalex.org/W1596436511,"The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) was utilized as a highly specific inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, PP2B in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Treatment of cells with CsA for 20 min resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of PP2B that was maximal (> 90%) at 1 microM and exhibited an IC50 of 65 nM. CsA also inhibited cholecystokinin-, 100 pM, or carbamylcholine-, 10 microM, induced amylase release in a concentration-dependent manner. A maximal inhibition to 55% of stimulated control cells occurred at 1 microM CsA with half-maximal inhibition occurring at approximately 200 nM. Secretion in response to 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was uneffected by CsA treatment. Conversely, amylase release stimulated by the Ca2+ mobilizing agent, thapsigargin, when added alone at 2 microM or in combination with TPA, was inhibited by CsA to 66 and 61% of control cells, respectively. These data indicate that CsA-mediated inhibition occurs only when stimulation involves an increase in intracellular Ca2+. In addition, analogues of CsA, 6-methyl-alanine-CsA, and 11-methyl-leucine-CsA had no effect on PP2B activity or amylase secretion. The chemically distinct immunosuppressant, FK506, produced only partial inhibition of PP2B activity and did not significantly inhibit amylase secretion at concentrations up to 1 microM. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins from 32P-labeled acinar cells revealed that CsA specifically blocked the cholecystokinin-stimulated dephosphorylation of a 24-kDa protein in a concentration range similar to that seen for inhibition of secretion. Using 32P-labeled cytosol and purified calcineurin, a Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent dephosphorylation of the 24-kDa protein was also demonstrated in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, PP2B, plays a significant role in stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic acinar cells."

In Hanks' balanced salt solution, fibrin reduces the second-order rate constant for the inhibition of PMN-elastase by alpha 1-protease inhibitor from 8,760 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) M-1.s-1 and by alpha 2-macroglobulin from 121 x 10(4) to 1.8 x 10(4) M-1.s-1. The rate constant for miniplasmin inactivation by alpha 2-antiplasmin decreases from 99 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(4) M-1.s-1, by alpha 2-macroglobulin from 78 x 10(4) to 1.8 x 10(4) M-1.s-1, and by alpha 1-protease inhibitor from 0.11 x 10(4) M-1.s-1 to 0. Plasmin bound to fibrin is completely protected against alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-protease inhibitor, whereas the rate constant for the inactivation by its primary plasma inhibitor alpha 2-antiplasmin is reduced from 430 x 10(4) to 1.08 x 10(4) M-1.s-1. The competition of substrate and inhibitor for the enzyme was also studied, using fibrin preincubated with inhibitor. Under our pseudo-first-order experimental conditions, fibrin completely eliminates those interactions, the second-order rate constant of which is 1.1 x 10(5) M-1.s-1 or less in a system without fibrin surface."

The specific binding sites for one of these chemoattractants, ES20, in the vomeronasal organ was saturable and reversible. Binding sites for ES20 were abolished by heating or greatly reduced by Pronase digestion. ES20 chemoattractant activity and receptor binding required Ca2+. Binding of ES20 to sensory epithelium derived from animals with bipolar neurons depleted by denervation was reduced 22-43% as compared to control animals. However, there was an upregulation of the ES20 receptor population in the nonsensory cells following nerve cuts. Three G-proteins (Gs, Gi, and G(o)) were tentatively identified using immunoreactivity and ADP-ribosylation techniques. Gi and G(o) proteins were shown to be coupled with ES20-receptor and effectors as evidenced by: 1) the affinity of ES20-receptor was decreased by GTP gamma S; 2) ES20-receptor binding caused a reduction in ADP-ribosylation of pertussis toxin-susceptible G-proteins, and the inhibitory effect of ES20-receptor on ADP-ribosylation was attenuated by GDP beta S; 3) the effect of ES20-receptor on ADP-ribosylation of the pertussis toxin-susceptible G-proteins could be mimicked by G-protein activators, such as GTP gamma S or AlF3; 4) ES20-receptor binding resulted in a decrease of the basal level of cAMP; 5) the binding of ES20 to its receptors caused an increase in the level of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1603762978,"The phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) form of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a key component in insulin signaling. Our previous study revealed that Tyr(P) IRS-1 binds to the widely distributed tyrosine phosphatase PTP2C through the src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the latter. In the present study, we examined the activity of this enzyme and of a truncated form lacking the SH2 domains (delta PTP2C) toward IRS-1 and also toward the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor. Tyr(P) IRS-1 was prepared by phosphorylation of recombinant IRS-1 with recombinant cytoplasmic insulin receptor kinase (CIRK). PTP2C rapidly dephosphorylated Tyr(P) IRS-1; dephosphorylation by delta PTP2C was approximately one-third as fast. Other substrates, including Tyr(P) CIRK, were not dephosphorylated as rapidly by PTP2C; moreover, delta PTP2C was at least 10 times more active than PTP2C toward CIRK and other substrates. These results indicate that the binding of Tyr(P) residues on IRS-1 to the SH2 domain(s) of PTP2C enhances its activity toward IRS-1 and suggest that PTP2C is the phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of IRS-1 in vivo. In addition, with the expectation that a PTP2C-resistant form of IRS-1 will be useful in investigations of IRS-1 function, we determined that IRS-1 can be thiophosphorylated with adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and CIRK and that this form of IRS-1 is resistant to PTP2C."
https://openalex.org/W1604722617,"Aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon RI) on rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells results in protein tyrosine phosphorylations. Previously we reported that there is prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of approximately 72-kDa proteins (pp72) and that the tyrosine kinase p72syk is one component of pp72. Here we studied further the relationship of p72syk to pp72. The aggregation of Fc epsilon RI induced the activation of p72syk which was parallel to its tyrosine phosphorylation. By in vitro kinase assay of immune complexes purified with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, p72syk was the major pp72 tyrosine kinase. However, by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, p72syk was a minor component of pp72. The heterogeneous nature of pp72 was indicated by different studies. Under optimum conditions of one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pp72 consisted of a heterogeneous group of 69-, 71-, and 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. There were differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in cells activated in the absence of extracellular calcium or when stimulation was with the calcium ionophore A23187 or with phorbol myristate acetate. One of the proteins migrating at 69 kDa was p72syk. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pp72 was found to consist of multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated protens including 71-80-kDa proteins that associate with p53/56lyn. A 75-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, different from pp72, was identified as p75HS1 (SPY75). These results demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the pp72 and that p72syk is activated after Fc epsilon RI aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1533443950,"Signal transduction via the B cell antigen receptor complex is regulated by changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins. The equilibrium between tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is regulated by the combined action of protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase enzymes. In particular, the protein tyrosine phosphatase, CD45, has been shown to play an essential role in signal transduction via the B cell antigen receptor. Therefore, experiments were performed to examine the intermolecular associations between CD45 and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in the B cell to identify potential substrates for CD45. Based on coprecipitation experiments, CD45 was found to be physically associated with multiple components of the B cell antigen receptor complex including the MB-1/B29 heterodimer. Additionally, CD45 was selectively associated with the src family protein tyrosine kinase, lyn. Neither blk nor fyn were observed to interact with CD45 even though they have been implicated in antigen receptor signal transduction. This finding suggests that CD45 may preferentially regulate the phosphorylation of lyn and thus, its activity. In summary, these studies provide evidence to support the hypothesis that CD45 regulates antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction by controlling the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple components of the antigen receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1529025359,"A human oxidoreductase (H-37) that is overexpressed in ethacrynic acid-resistant HT29 colon cells (Ciaccio, P. J., Stuart, J.E., and Tew, K.D. (1993) Mol. Pharmacol. 43, 845-853) has been identified as a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. Translated protein from a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase cDNA isolated from a library prepared from ethacrynic acid-resistant HT29 cell poly(A+) RNA was recognized by anti-H-37 IgG and was identical in molecular weight with H-37. The isolated cDNA was identical in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences with the recently cloned liver dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (Stolz, A., Hammond, L., Lou, H., Takikawa, H., Ronk, M., and Shively, J.E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10448-10457). Using this cDNA as probe, we have examined its induction by Michael acceptors. The steady state dihydrodiol dehydrogenase mRNA level in the ethacrynic acid-resistant line was increased 30-fold relative to that of wild-type cells. Twenty-four hour treatment of wild-type cells with ethacrynic acid or dimethyl maleate increased mRNA 10-fold and 5-fold, respectively. These changes are accompanied by both increased protein expression and increased NADP-dependent 1-acenaphthenol oxidative activity in cell cytosol. In gel shift assays, compared to wild type controls, increased binding of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase human antioxidant response element (hARE) DNA to redox labile protein complexes present in treated and resistant cell nuclear extract was observed. Ethacrynic acid induced CAT activity 2-fold in Hepa1 cells stably transfected with NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase hARE-tk-CAT chimeric gene construct. Thus, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase protein is inducible by de novo synthesis from mRNA by structurally related monofunctional inducer Michael acceptors. Altered in vitro binding of nuclear protein to the hARE is indirect evidence for the involvement of an element similar to hARE in the regulation of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase by these agents."

These RNA binding proteins participate in the life cycle of all known lentiviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) or the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). The consensus RNA binding motifs [the trans-activation responsive element (TAR)] of HIV-1 as well as EIAV Tat proteins are well characterized. The structure of the 75-amino acid EIAV Tat protein in solution was determined by two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods and molecular dynamics calculations. The protein structure exhibits a well-defined hydrophobic core of 15 amino acids that serves as a scaffold for two flexible domains corresponding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions. The core region is a strictly conserved sequence region among the known Tat proteins. The structural data can be used to explain several of the observed features of Tat proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1882534167,"In this study, we examined the role of insulin, protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in activation of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) by using three complementary approaches. First, differentiated L6 cells were acutely exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 400 nM) to activate PKC. In these cells, TPA caused 32% stimulation of PP-1 activity. The PP-1 stimulation by TPA was comparable to stimulation by insulin (t1/2 = 1 min and EC50 = 5 nM) with a maximum effect in 5 min. The effects of insulin and TPA were not additive. Insulin and TPA also stimulated MAPK (> 2-fold increase over basal, with myelin basic protein as a substrate). ML-9, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, blocked the effects of insulin and TPA on both MAPK and PP-1 activation. In the second approach, PKC was down-regulated by chronic treatment with TPA. In these cells subsequent effects of insulin on MAPK and PP-1 activation were blocked, without an effect on basal enzyme levels. In the third approach, two selective inhibitors of PKC, calphostin and chelerythrine chloride, were used to inhibit PKC. These inhibitors completely prevented insulin and TPA stimulation of MAPK and PP-1 and blocked insulin-induced translocation of PKC to the plasma membranes. We conclude that PKC plays an important role in insulin stimulation of PP-1 via the activation of MAPK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1599101420,"Expression of the anthropoid (simian) gamma gene in fetal life contrasts with the exclusively embryonic expression pattern of the gamma-like genes of other eutherian mammals. To elucidate the factors responsible for this change in expression pattern, we utilized a strategy called differential phylogenetic footprinting (DPF). This strategy entails the following: (a) identification, within regulatory regions, of the gamma promoter, of individual nucleotides that differ between human (fetal expression), and galago (embryonic expression) gamma genes, (b) analysis of the effect of these nucleotide differences on the binding of nuclear proteins to human and galago sequences, and (c) assessment of the functional consequences of these binding changes in expression assays. The DPF analysis revealed several proteins that bind upstream from the CCAAT motif in the galago gamma promoter but do not bind to the corresponding region of the human gamma promoter. In transfection assays, binding of these proteins is associated with erythroid-specific repression of promoter strength. Binding sites for these proteins also occur near the CCAAT box of other embryonically expressed genes, including rabbit, mouse, and dwarf lemur gamma genes and the human epsilon globin gene. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that sequence changes near the proximal CCAAT box in the ancestral simian gamma gene may have facilitated a novel expression pattern by reducing the binding of repressors that act in the fetal stage."
https://openalex.org/W1494986506,"The receptor for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSFR) and chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of G-CSFR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, gp130, or c-mpl function as homodimeric complexes. These receptors mediate a similar stimulation of gene transcription via separate regulatory elements of acute phase plasma protein genes. To identify the receptor regions within the cytoplasmic domains necessary for transcriptional regulation, the receptors were transiently expressed in rat hepatoma cells. Each receptor form reconstituted G-CSF-induced expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene construct containing the cytokine response element of the rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene. This regulation required the presence of two conserved sequence motifs (referred to as box 1 and box 2) in the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor. With the exception of G-CSFR-MPL chimera, the receptors also mediated a similarly high stimulation via the IL-6 response element of the rat beta-fibrinogen and hemopexin genes. Regulation of the IL-6 response element required, however, in addition to boxes 1 and 2, a third sequence motif (box 3). This motif is absent in the cytoplasmic domain of c-mpl, possibly explaining its inability to activate the IL-6 response element. When cells which express receptor forms with prominent box 3 function were treated with suramin, a ligand-independent gene stimulation via the IL-6 response element was observed. The suramin effect probably involves a receptor dimerization mediated by the extracellular G-CSFR domain and by the intracellular regions that include box 3."
https://openalex.org/W1566585179,"It remains unclear whether polypeptide chains renaturing in vitro from strong denaturants proceed through the same folding pathway as chains released from ribosome within cells. Folding intermediates formed both in vivo and in vitro have been examined using three monoclonal antibodies shown previously to recognize different epitopes of the native P22 tailspike protein (Friguet, B., Djavadi-Ohaniance, L., Haase-Pettingell, C. A., King J., and Goldberg, M. E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10347-10351). The tailspike protein was reconstituted from polypeptide chains unfolded by urea as described by Fuchs et al. (Fuchs, A., Seiderer, C., and Seckler, R. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6598-6604), and the appearance of immunoreactive forms during the refolding was monitored. The three antibodies discriminated intermediates at different stages in the folding pathway. On the basis of the reconstitution pathway determined from spectroscopic and hydrodynamic measurements by Fuchs et al. (1991), monoclonal antibody (mAb) 236-3 recognized partially folded monomers, mAb 155-3 recognized folded protomers in a protrimer species, and mAb 33-2 recognized the native trimer. The kinetics of appearance of the immunoreactive forms during the in vitro refolding of the protein in crude extracts of phage-infected cells was similar to that observed with the pure tailspike. Thus, the antibodies provided probes for the chain folding and association pathway in vivo. The conformation of the ribosome-bound tailspike polypeptide chains of the infected cells was analyzed with the three antibodies. The antibodies recognizing native trimer and the protrimer did not bind chains associated with the ribosomes. Antibody 236-3, which recognized structured monomers in vitro, bound to the polypeptide chains still associated with ribosomes. This result suggests that steps that take place in solution during in vitro refolding may occur in a ribosome-bound state in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1520481716,"We have investigated the proposal that the receptor-associated protein (RAP) of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSP). 125I-RAP binds to two sites on the surface of fibroblasts as follows: a high affinity site with a Kd of 1.4 nM and a low affinity site (Kd = 188 nM) with a capacity of more than 1000-fold the maximum amount of lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor on the cell surface. 125I-RAP binding to the low affinity site was abolished by heparin or Suramin. However, maximal digestion of the glycosaminoglycan chains of HSP with heparinase or culturing the cells in chlorate, an inhibitor of proteoglycan sulfation, did not affect the binding of 125I-RAP or of 125I-labeled, methylamine-activated alpha 2-macroglobulin. Comparison of 125I-RAP degradation at two different concentrations suggests that the low affinity, high capacity site on the surface of human fibroblasts participates in the endocytosis of 125I-RAP. The nature of the low affinity site remains to be elucidated, but we can exclude the glycosaminoglycan chains of HSP."
https://openalex.org/W1491972957,"An intriguing mechanism in regulating transcription initiation from the gal operon in Escherichia coli is described. Initiation from galP2, one of the two promoters of the E. coli galactose operon, is shown to be subject to promoter clearance control in responding to changes in UTP concentration. In vitro, RNA polymerase (RNAP) makes a large amount of nonproductive initiation products at the galP2 promoter at high concentrations of UTP and less of the stuttered products at low concentrations of UTP. Conversely, RNAP makes more productive initiation products at low UTP concentration than at high UTP concentration. The transcription factor cAMP.CRP complex which normally inhibits transcription from galP2 also represses the stuttering synthesis from galP2. When galactose is used as a sole carbon source and the internal UTP pools are adjusted externally, a cya mutant (in which galP2 is mainly responsible for the expression of the gal operon and galP1 activity is minimal) has a slower growth rate and lower expression of the gal operon at high UTP pools than at low UTP pools. Such an apparent correlation between the in vitro and in vivo results allows one to speculate that changes in UTP concentration can modulate the expression of the gal operon. The implication of a gal promoter being controlled by UTP is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1495945042,"The murine interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent cell line, B6SUtA1, which expresses high IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) numbers, was found to proliferate in a greater than additive fashion when grown in the presence of IL-3 and steel factor (SF). However, pretreatment of these cells with SF had no effect on the number of IL-3Rs expressed at the cell surface nor their affinity for IL-3. Interestingly, although, SF did induce the rapid and transient serine- and threonine-specific phosphorylation of the beta IL-3 subunit of the IL-3R. This serine/threonine phosphorylation was also observed with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and both the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate- and SF-induced phosphorylation of the IL-3R could be inhibited with the highly specific protein kinase C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (Compound 3), suggesting that SF might be stimulating this phosphorylation via protein kinase C. This SF-induced phosphorylation also occurred within 10 min of incubation at 4 degrees C, indicating that this might be a relatively early event in the c-kit signaling pathway. Last, this SF-induced phosphorylation of the IL-3R occurred in the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, at levels which blocked the autophosphorylation of c-kit. This suggests that c-kit might be capable of mediating this cross-talk phenomenon in the absence of its endogenous tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1503369209,"The E89G alteration in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase has been shown to confer resistance to nucleoside analogs and a loss of magnesium cation preference (Prasad, V.R., Lowy, I., De Los Santos, T., Chiang, L., and Goff, S.P. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 11363-11367. The wild type reverse transcriptase heterodimer, chimeric reverse transcriptases that contain the E89G alteration in one of the subunits (p66wt/p51m and p66m/p51wt), and the mutant enzyme (p66m/p51m) were prepared. Analysis of steady state kinetic parameters showed that the mutant enzyme (p66m/p51m) displayed a higher Vmax, a higher Km for 2'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, and a higher Ki for 2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate than the wild type enzyme. The increased Km and Ki values were observed only when a heterodimer contained the alteration in the p66 subunit. Tests for divalent cation requirement showed that only the dimers containing the wild type p66 (p66wt/p51wt and p66wt/p51m) displayed a preference for magnesium. Our results indicate that p66 plays a dominant role in deoxynucleotide triphosphate substrate recognition (Km), nucleoside analog sensitivity (Ki), and magnesium preference. However, the increased Vmax displayed by the mutant enzyme (p66m/p51m) appeared to be determined by both of the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2345882597,"The protein tyrosine kinase expressed by the protooncogene c-fgr is phosphorylated and down-regulated in vitro by the c-Src kinase (CSK). CSK catalyzed phosphorylation affects Tyr-511 of c-Fgr, homologous to Tyr-527 of c-Src and it prevents the autophosphorylation normally occurring at c-Fgr Tyr-400, homologous to c-Src Tyr-416. Polylysine, histones H1 and H2A and other polycationic proteins on the other hand stimulate c-Fgr activity while promoting enhanced autophosphorylation of both Tyr-400 and Tyr-511. Once phosphorylated at Tyr-511 and down-regulated by CSK, c-Fgr is no more susceptible to polylysine stimulation. Previous autophosphorylation (at Tyr-400) reduces c-Fgr susceptibility to down-regulation by CSK, although Tyr-511 can be still phosphorylated by it. If a more exhaustive autophosphorylation (of both Tyr-400 and Tyr-511) is performed in the presence of polylysine, c-Fgr becomes totally insensitive to CSK down-regulation. These data support the concept that down-regulation of c-Fgr by Tyr-511 phosphorylation is prevented if Tyr-400 is also phosphorylated and they are consistent with an outcompetition of phospho-Tyr-511 from the Src homology 2 domain by phospho-Tyr-400, which, in c-Fgr, is surrounded by an amino acid sequence divergent from that of the other Src-related protein tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1503660095,"Thrombin and the thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) caused a rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the human osteoblast-like cell line Saos-2. Striking differences in the [Ca2+]i signals elicited by these agonists were revealed. In cell populations, thrombin induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i while TRAP caused a biphasic [Ca2+]i response consisting of an initial peak and a sustained plateau phase. In individual cells, thrombin mainly caused a single [Ca2+]i transient while TRAP induced repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes. Neither tyrosine phosphorylation, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, nor pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins appeared to be involved in thrombin receptor [Ca2+]i signaling in this cell line. However, the sustained [Ca2+]i response caused by TRAP was converted into a transient, thrombin-like response by pretreatment with serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors. Pretreatment with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) abrogated thrombin receptor [Ca2+]i signaling, and TRAP-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by the acute treatment with PMA. In contrast, Ca2+ entry stimulated by thapsigargin was not sensitive to agents affecting serine/threonine phosphorylation. The observation that thrombin and TRAP, despite being agonists for a common receptor, induce dissimilar [Ca2+]i responses indicates that binding of TRAP alone is insufficient to fully regulate the thrombin receptor in Saos-2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1485403581,"Rap 1b is a 22-kDa low molecular mass GTP-binding protein which is both a member of the Ras superfamily and a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Recently, evidence has been presented to show that Rap 1b is incorporated into the detergent-extracted cytoskeleton of platelets during thrombin-induced activation. The aims of this study were to compare the incorporation of Rap 1b into the detergent-extracted cytoskeleton after activation with different agonists, to examine the role of extracellular calcium on the incorporation of Rap 1b into the cytoskeleton, to investigate the relationship between the association of Rap 1b and other proteins with the cytoskeleton, and to determine the effect of phosphorylation of Rap 1b incorporation into the cytoskeleton. Platelets were activated with thrombin, A23187, phorbol myristate acetate, ADP, epinephrine, and collagen in the presence and absence of calcium. The time dependence of Rap 1b incorporation into the detergent-extracted cytoskeleton was then measured. When platelets were activated by thrombin in the presence of extracellular calcium, conditions which permit aggregation, incorporation of Rap 1b into the detergent-extracted cytoskeleton was biphasic. Approximately 20% of the total cellular Rap 1b incorporated into the cytoskeleton within seconds and was followed by a slower second phase of incorporation. In contrast, when platelets were activated by thrombin in the absence of calcium, conditions which inhibit aggregation, or by the other agents in the presence or absence of calcium, only the initial phase of Rap 1b incorporation into the cytoskeleton was measured. The incorporation of Rap 1b paralleled the incorporation of membrane glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa and PECAM-1, but not the incorporation of pp60c-src. The GTPase-activating protein for Ras (Ras-GAP) did not associate with the detergent-extracted cytoskeleton. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the total cellular and cytoskeletal Rap 1b showed that unphosphorylated as well as phosphorylated isoforms of Rap 1b were incorporated into the cytoskeleton in the same molar ratio as was present in the intact cell. Furthermore, the rates of incorporation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Rap 1b into the cytoskeleton were similar. These experiments show that Rap 1b can regulate events that take place within seconds after activation, such as the initial formation of the cytoskeleton, as well as longer term changes in the cytoskeleton that occur in response to thrombin-induced aggregation. Furthermore, phosphorylation could modulate the (unknown) functions of Rap 1b as a component of the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1491141179,"Ligand-induced tyrosine kinase activation of the scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) is thought to be essential for the biological responses of target cells. To assess the regulatory role of the major tyrosine autophosphorylation site (tyrosine 1233) of the mouse c-Met receptor in the tyrosine kinase activation of the receptor, we constructed a mutant receptor in which the tyrosine residue was replaced with phenylalanine. When the cells expressing the mutant receptor were incubated with the ligand, no biological responses were observed, and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor was very low compared with that of the wild-type receptor. The in vitro kinase activity of the mutant receptor toward an exogenous substrate and the receptor itself was also low. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular proteins by ligand stimulation was not detected in intact cells expressing the mutant receptor. The low level of kinase activity and the lack of biological activity of the mutant receptor indicate that the major autophosphorylation site positively regulates the tyrosine kinase of the c-Met receptor and phosphorylation of cellular substrates in the scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor signaling pathway."
