https://openalex.org/W1574172480,"During carcinogenesis of pancreatic islets in transgenic mice, an angiogenic switch activates the quiescent vasculature. Paradoxically, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors are expressed constitutively. Nevertheless, a synthetic inhibitor (SU5416) of VEGF signalling impairs angiogenic switching and tumour growth. Two metalloproteinases, MMP-2/gelatinase-A and MMP-9/gelatinase-B, are upregulated in angiogenic lesions. MMP-9 can render normal islets angiogenic, releasing VEGF. MMP inhibitors reduce angiogenic switching, and tumour number and growth, as does genetic ablation of MMP-9. Absence of MMP-2 does not impair induction of angiogenesis, but retards tumour growth, whereas lack of urokinase has no effect. Our results show that MMP-9 is a component of the angiogenic switch."

Tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors by Src-family tyrosine kinases such as Fyn is implicated in synaptic plasticity. To precisely address the roles of NMDA receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, we identified Fyn-mediated phosphorylation sites on the GluRε2 (NR2B) subunit of NMDA receptors. Seven out of 25 tyrosine residues in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of GluRε2 were phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro. Of these 7 residues, Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 in GluRε2 were phosphorylated in human embryonic kidney fibroblasts when co-expressed with active Fyn, and Tyr-1472 was the major phosphorylation site in this system. We then generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to Tyr-1472-phosphorylated GluRε2 and showed that Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 was indeed phosphorylated in murine brain using the antibodies. Importantly, Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was greatly reduced in fyn mutant mice. Moreover, Tyr-1472 phosphorylation became evident when hippocampal long term potentiation started to be observed, and its magnitude became larger in murine brain. Finally, Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced after induction of long term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region. These data suggest that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 is important for synaptic plasticity.

The receptors are formed by assembly of two classes of subunits, a principal subunit GluRζ1 (NR1 in rat) and modulatory subunits GluRε1-GluRε4 (NR2A-NR2D in rat) (4Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N.

The GluRζ1 subunit is essential for the function of NMDA receptor channels, whereas GluRε1-GluRε4 subunits determine the characteristics of NMDA receptor channels by forming different heteromeric configurations with the GluRζ1 subunit (4Kutsuwada T.

The physiological importance of these subunits has been demonstrated by gene targeting. Mice with a null mutation in GluRζ1 die neonatally (7Forrest D. Yuzaki M. Soares H.D. Ng L. Luk D.C. Sheng M.

In GluRε1 mutant mice, hippocampal LTP is reduced, and spatial learning is impaired (10Sakimura K. Kutsuwada T. Ito I. Manabe T. Takayama C. Kushiya E. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Inoue Y. Sugiyama H.

Several PDZ domain-containing proteins such as PSD-95 and chapsyn-110/PSD-93 interact with the NMDA receptor through the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (12Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Importance of the C-terminal tails of GluRε subunits is also demonstrated by gene targeting. Phenotypic defects in mice expressing C-terminally truncated GluRε1 or GluRε2 are similar to those in mice lacking entire GluRε1 or GluRε2 (13Mori H. Manabe T. Watanabe M. Satoh Y. Suzuki N. Toki S.

C-terminal tails of GluRε subunits are likely to participate in their synaptic localization or regulation of NMDA receptor functions. Furthermore, GluRε2 is phosphorylated at its C-terminal tails by Src-family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as Fyn, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (15Hisatsune C.

In the NMDA receptor complex, GluRε1, GluRε2, and GluRε4 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in the brain (20Dunah A.W. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. J.

A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Among these subunits, GluRε2 is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the forebrain synapse (21Moon I.-L. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation regulates NMDA channel receptor activity. NMDA receptor-mediated currents are potentiated by Src-family tyrosine kinases and suppressed by tyrosine phosphatases (23Wang Y.-T. Salter M.W.

In addition, taste-learning increases tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 in the rat insular cortex, and tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 is increased after induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized adult rats (25Rosenblum K. Berman D.E. Hazvi S. Lamprecht R. Dudai Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 445-452Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, SHP2, and brain spectrin interact with GluRε2 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (15Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Gurd J.W. Bissoon N. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Lin S.-Y.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data suggest that GluRε2 tyrosine phosphorylation may at least in part be involved in intracellular signaling in murine brain. The physiological importance of Fyn in the nervous system has been suggested by analyses of fyn mutant mice. These mice show various neural defects including defective LTP, impaired spatial memory, impaired myelination, and altered ethanol sensitivity (32Grant S.G.N. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L.

In addition, up-regulation of Src is observed after spatial maze learning, suggesting involvement of other Src-family kinases in synaptic plasticity (35Zhao W. Cavallaro S. Gusev P. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8098-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this paper, to precisely understand the roles of tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 by the Src-family kinases, we set out experiments in which Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation sites of GluRε2 were determined. By showing that Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 is phosphorylated in murine brain, we propose that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation plays important roles for synaptic plasticity. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GluRε2 were raised against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with mouse GluRε2 (amino acids 1034–1119) and affinity-purified. The anti-GluRε2 antibodies did not cross-react with rat NR2A (data not shown). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 were raised using a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide with the sequence CSNGHV(phospho-Y)EKLSSI as immunogen. The antibodies were purified from sera of the immunized rabbits by successive affinity chromatography using a column of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated to the GST-C3 protein (to subtract IgGs against non-phosphorylated GluRε2) followed by a column conjugated to the immunogen. The antibodies did not recognize NR2A (GluRε1) expressed in 293T cells together with active Fyn (data not shown). Anti-influenza hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (RC20) and anti-NR2B mAb were from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-Fyn (Fyn3) and rabbit anti-NR2B antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Chemicon, respectively. Sf9 insect cells were maintained in Sf-900 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. Adherent cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the GST-human Fyn cDNA. 72 h after infection, cells were lysed in TNE buffer (1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4 with aprotinin at 50 units/ml). GST-Fyn fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the supplier's instruction. pGEX-C1, -C2, and -C3 were described previously (15Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Purification of GST fusion proteins was described above. To prepare the in vitro phosphorylated GluRε2 proteins, the GST-GluRε2 fusion proteins (2 μg) were phosphorylated by 1 μg of baculovirally expressed and purified GST-Fyn in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2) in the presence of 100 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer and then resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 32P-Labeled GST-GluRε2 proteins were excised from the gel and then subjected to peptide-mapping analysis according to Boyle et al. (36Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, tryptic peptide samples were electrophoresed for 40 min at 1.0 kV in pH 1.9 buffer using the HTLE7000 apparatus (CBS Scientific); the plates were air-dried and then placed in tanks for ascending chromatography using phosphochromatography buffer. After ascending chromatography, the plates were air-dried and then exposed. For epitope-tagging of GluRε2, GluRε2 cDNA (4Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) was inserted with the oligonucleotides encoding an HA epitope-containing sequence, DYPYDVPDYASLV, at XmaI site that encoded amino acid residues 66 and 67. The resultant cDNA, HA-GluRε2, was subcloned to pME18S (37Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmids pME-FynY531F and PSD-95 were described previously (19Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 37Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various YF mutants of GluRε2 were generated by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (38Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with combinations of expression plasmids (5 μg each) by the standard calcium phosphate method. The amount of DNA transfected was adjusted in each experiment by using a control expression vector pME18S (37Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were collected for protein extraction. For preparation of lysates of 293T cells, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 1 ml of TNE buffer. Typically, 800 μl of lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. For preparation of whole-cell lysates of telencephalons, samples were homogenized in 0.2 volumes (ml/g of tissue) of RIPA buffer (1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmNa3VO4 with aprotinin at 50 units/ml) containing 0.5% SDS. The lysates were boiled for 5 min to dissociate the NMDA receptor complex and diluted with 4 volumes of RIPA buffer. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were cleared by centrifugation with an excess amount of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated with indicated antibodies on ice for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected on protein-G Sepharose and washed five times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates or lysates were resolved by SDS/ 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Then the membranes were blocked and probed with antibodies indicated. When necessary, the antibodies were stripped from the membranes by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, and 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C for 40 min, then the membranes were reprobed with the antibodies indicated. For quantification, the immunoreacted protein bands were analyzed with NIH image software. 100 μl of brain lysates from wild-type and fyn mutant mice, which contained about 150 μg of proteins, were immunoprecipitated with anti-GluRε2 antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed five times with lysis buffer followed by washing twice with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 mm MgCl2). Bound proteins were incubated in 100 μl of the BAP buffer with or without 5 units of BAP (Takara) at 37 °C for 6 h. After the BAP reaction, the beads were washed three times and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Extracellular field potential recordings were performed essentially as described (39Manabe T. Aiba A. Yamada A. Ichise T. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Katsuki M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) were prepared from 6–8-week-old mice and placed in an interface-type holding chamber for at least 1 h. A slice was then transferred to the recording chamber and submerged beneath continuously perfusing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mmNaH2PO4, 26.2 mmNaH2CO3, 11 mm glucose) that had been saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. All the perfusing solutions contained 100 μm picrotoxin to block GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic responses. The CA3 region was surgically separated from the CA1 region to prevent invasion of epileptiform activity. A glass recording electrode (containing 3 m NaCl) and a tungsten bipolar stimulating electrode were placed in the stratum radiatum. The test stimulation was applied to Schaffer collateral fibers at 0.1 Hz. The stimulus strength was adjusted to get the initial excitatory postsynaptic potential slope value of 0.10–0.15 mV/ms. To induce LTP, we applied 4 trains of tetanic stimulation (100 Hz for 1 s) at an interval of 10 s. Axopatch one-dimensional amplifier (Axon Instruments) was used, and the signal was filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and stored in an IBM-compatible computer equipped with a TL-1 DMA analog-to-digital board (Axon Instruments). All experiments were done at 25 °C. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. A statistical evaluation was made by use of paired t test. The GluRε2 subunit contains 25 tyrosine residues in the intracellular C-terminal region. To determine the site(s) of Fyn-mediated GluRε2 phosphorylation, we constructed GST fusion proteins containing truncated segments of the intracellular C-terminal region of the GluRε2 subunit (termed GST-C1, -C2, and -C3 proteins) (Fig. 1 A). GST-C1, -C2, and -C3 fusion proteins were bacterially expressed, purified, and then phosphorylated in vitro with baculovirally expressed GST-Fyn in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylated proteins were subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. As shown in Fig. 1, highly phosphorylated peptides P1–P4, P5 and P6, and P7–P9 were generated from GST-C1, GST-C2, and GST-C3 fusion proteins, respectively. To identify the tyrosine residues that were phosphorylated in GST-C3 protein, we constructed Y1252F (conversion of Tyr-1252 to Phe-1252)-, Y1336F-, and Y1472F-GST-C3 proteins by site-directed mutagenesis. Conversion of Tyr-1472 to Phe-1472 resulted in generation of a tryptic phosphopeptide map that lacked phosphopeptide P9 (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, phosphopeptide P7 was absent in the phosphopeptide map of Y1252F-GST-C3 protein, and phosphopeptide P8 was absent in the phosphopeptide map of Y1336F-GST-C3 protein (data not shown). The two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide map of GST-C1 fusion protein displayed highly phosphorylated peptides, P1–P4 (Fig. 1 D), and the map of GST-C2 fusion protein showed highly phosphorylated peptides P5 and P6 (Fig. 1 E). Phosphopeptides corresponding to P1–P4 were absent in two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of GST-C1 having Y932F, Y1039F, Y1070F, or Y1109F mutations, and phosphopeptides corresponding to P5 and P6 were missing in maps of GST-C2 having Y1109F or Y1252F mutations (data not shown). These results indicate that Tyr-932, Tyr-1039, Tyr-1070, Tyr-1109, Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 are Fyn-mediated phosphorylation sites in GluRε2 in vitro. In vivo phosphorylation of the seven tyrosine residues was examined using GluRε2-transfected HEK 293T cells. First, 293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild-type GluRε2 alone or together with plasmids encoding Fyn Y531F, which is a constitutively active form of Fyn (37Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27413-27419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PSD-95. PSD-95 promotes Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 (data not shown) as well as NR2A (GluRε1) (19Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, and HA-tagged GluRε2 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates and subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody. GluRε2 was prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated only when it was co-expressed with Fyn Y531F (Fig. 2 A). Next, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for either HA-tagged wild-type GluRε2 or one of the seven single YF mutants of GluRε2 described above together with FynY531F and PSD-95 expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Y1472F mutation resulted in the significant reduction of the tyrosine phosphorylation level of GluRε2. There was no reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of GluRε2 in the other mutants. Moreover, phosphorylation of GluRε2 Y1252F/Y1472F and Y1336F/Y1472F double mutants was less than that of GluRε2 Y1472F mutant (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2,3, and 4), and phosphorylation of GluRε2 Y1252F/Y1336F/Y1472F triple mutant was nearly eliminated in 293T cells (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 5). These results suggest that Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 are phosphorylated in 293T cells when active Fyn is co-expressed. Phosphorylation of four other residues, Tyr-932, Tyr-1039, Tyr- 1070, and Tyr-1109, was under detectable level. Antisera that recognize Tyr-1472-phosphorylated GluRε2 were raised by immunizing rabbits with phosphotyrosine-containing synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of GluRε2 surrounding Tyr-1472 (Fig.3 A). Antisera were extensively preabsorbed with non-phosphorylated GST-C3 fusion protein that contains Tyr-1472 and then affinity-purified. The purified antibodies, termed anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies, showed selective immunoreactivity with GST-C3 protein phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro but not to non-phosphorylated GST-C3 protein and phosphorylated GST-C3 proteins treated with BAP (Fig. 3 B). Immunoreactivity was blocked by preincubation of the antibodies with the antigen (data not shown). To examine whether the purified antibodies recognize Tyr-1472-phosphorylated GluRε2, 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding FynY531F, PSD-95, and either HA-tagged wild-type GluRε2 or GluRε2 Y1472F mutant. Western blots of HA-tagged GluRε2 immunoprecipitates with anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies showed their specific reactivity with tyrosine-phosphorylated wild-type GluRε2 but not with tyrosine-phosphorylated GluRε2 Y1472F mutant or non-phosphorylated GluRε2 (Fig. 3 C). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 Y1472F mutant was lower than that of wild-type GluRε2 but was clearly detectable using anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 2 Cand data not shown). The amount of immunoprecipitated GluRε2 and the expression levels of Fyn and PSD-95 were similar in each experiment (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Thus, the anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies specifically recognized Tyr-1472-phosphorylated GluRε2. The antibodies did not recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2A (GluRε1) expressed in 293T cells (data not shown). To examine whether Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 is phosphorylated in murine brain, GluRε2 was immunoprecipitated from telencephalons, which had been boiled to dissociate the NMDA receptor complex, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies. The antibodies reacted with a protein corresponding to Tyr-1472-phosphorylated GluRε2, but this immunoreactivity was completely abolished when immunoprecipitated GluRε2 were extensively dephosphorylated with BAP (Fig. 4 A). The amount of GluRε2 in each lane was similar. The results demonstrated that GluRε2 was phosphorylated at Tyr-1472 in murine brain. Importantly, the immunoreactivity of anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies for immunoprecipitated GluRε2 from telencephalon of fyn mutant mice was much less than that from wild-type mice (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, we concluded that Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 was phosphorylated in murine brain and that Fyn contributed significantly to the phosphorylation events. Because expression of GluRε2 is developmentally regulated (40Okabe S. Collin C. Auerbach J.M. Meiri N. Bengzon J. Kennedy M.B. Segal M. McKay D.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4177-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the profile of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation during postnatal development was examined. GluRε2 immunoprecipitates from lysates of telencephalons of mice at postnatal (P) days 3, 7, 16, 28, and 56 were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was low at P3 and P7 but gradually increased at P16, P28, and P56 (Fig.5). Overall tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 during the same developmental period, which was determined by blotting with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody, was similar to Tyr-1472 phosphorylation. A similar amount of immunoprecipitated GluRε2 was loaded in each lane. Results suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 in murine brain is developmentally regulated. LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, which is a cellular model for learning and memory, is induced by activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors (41Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.J. McLennan H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 42Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Because tyrosine phosphorylation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors is implicated in the expression of LTP at the Schaffer collateral-commissural-CA1 synapse (43Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), alteration in the level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation after induction of LTP was examined. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the hippocampal CA1 region by extracellular field potential recording techniques. Tetanic stimulation of the afferent fibers (100 Hz for 1 s, repeated 4 times at 10-s intervals) gave rise to LTP of excitatory synaptic transmission in C57BL/6 mice (184.4 ± 8.8% of base line, n = 10) (Fig.6 A). Sixty minutes after tetanic stimulation, the ratio of the Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 in the stimulated slices to that in the non-stimulated slices was 1.50 ± 0.13 (p < 0.002) (Fig. 6 C; representative data are shown in Fig. 6 B). Five minutes after tetanic stimulation, the level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 in the stimulated slices was almost the same as that in the control slices (data not shown). The data suggest that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 is involved in the expression of LTP. Here we showed that Tyr-1472 of GluRε2, the most prominently phosphorylated site in 293T cells, was phosphorylated in murine brain and that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in fyn mutant mice. We also showed that the level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was developmentally regulated and enhanced after induction of LTP. We found that 7 out of 25 tyrosine residues in the intracellular C-terminal region of GluRε2 were significantly phosphorylated by Fyn in vitro. Among these residues, Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 were phosphorylated in HEK 293T cells when active Fyn was co-expressed. Tyr-1472 was the most prominently phosphorylated site in this system. Moreover, using anti-phospho-Tyr-1472 antibodies, we showed that Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 was phosphorylated in murine brain. When examined in vitro, the level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was similar, relative to that of other major Fyn-mediated phosphorylation sites. However in 293T cells, active Fyn mainly phosphorylated Tyr-1472 in comparison with the other six tyrosine residues identified in vitro. This difference may be due in part to an excess phosphorylation reaction in vitro or the presence of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in 293T cells. To our knowledge, Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 is a residue identified first as a tyrosine phosphorylation site of NMDA receptors. There are cognate sites to Tyr-1252, Tyr-1336, and Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 in GluRε1 (4Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Mori H. Sakimura K. Kushiya E. Araki K. Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 5Meguro H. Mori H. Araki K. Kushiya E. Kutsuwada T. Yamazaki M. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Sakimura K. Mishina M.

Science. 1992; 256: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). To further understand how tyrosine phosphorylation regulates NMDA receptor function, determination of Fyn-mediated phosphorylation sites of GluRε1 is also important. The best characterized form of LTP occurs in the hippocampal CA1 region. LTP is initiated by transient activation of NMDA receptors and is expressed as a persistent increase in synaptic transmission through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (41Collingridge G.L. Kehl S.J. McLennan H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 334: 33-46Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 42Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Induction of LTP produces rapid activation of Src within 1–5 min, and prior application of Src-specific inhibitors prevents induction of LTP in this region (43Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We observed enhancement of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 after 60 min of LTP induction. This suggests that Src-family kinases may phosphorylate GluRε2 slowly, similar to the phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors by CaMKII (44Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Although CaMKII is activated within 1 min after induction of LTP (45Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the potentiation of AMPA receptor-mediated currents by CaMKII reaches a maximum 15–30 min after induction of LTP (44Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 46Lledo P.-M. Hjelmstad G.O. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Malenka R.C.

Nature. 1993; 362: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Similar changes are seen in the overall NR2B (GluRε2) tyrosine phosphorylation, which is enhanced 15 min after induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized adult rats (26Rosenblum K. Dudai Y. Richter-Levein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10457-10460Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 27Rostas J.A.P. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. P Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that the level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation as well as overall tyrosine phosphorylation of GluRε2 was low during embryonic (data not shown) and early developmental stages (P3 and P7). This may be partly due to the low expression of PSD-95, which promotes Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of GluRε2 as well as GluRε1 (NR2A) (19Tezuka T. Umemori H. Akiyama T. Nakanishi S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), during the early developmental stages (48Sans N. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.-X. Blahos J., II Hell J.W. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation in P3 and P7 mice may cause small LTP in the early developmental stages (49Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 50Liao D. Malinow R. Learn. Memory. 1996; 3: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The level of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in fyn mutant mice, which show impaired hippocampal LTP and spatial learning (32Grant S.G.N. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 may partly explain the defects in LTP and spatial learning in fynmutant mice. These observations suggest that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation may be required for the expression of LTP and is, therefore, important for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Since NMDA receptors are phosphorylated not only by Src-family kinases but also serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and CaMKII (15Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of GluRε2 by various kinases may be involved in multiple forms of synaptic plasticity as in the case of GluR1, in which Ser-831 phosphorylation of CaMKII and Ser-845 phosphorylation by protein kinase A differentially contribute to hippocampal synaptic plasticity (51Lee H.-Y. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). It is reported that Src-family kinases do not potentiate recombinant NR1-NR2B channels (GluRζ1-GluRε2 channels in mice) expressed in HEK 293 cells (28Köhr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 445-452Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, since NMDA receptor protein complexes from murine brain are composed of a variety of postsynaptic proteins (52Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G.N. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), some of which are missing in HEK 293 cells, contribution of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2 to the channel activity of NMDA receptor in vivo should be examined. Because protein tyrosine phosphorylation regulates protein-protein interactions (53Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), Tyr-1472 phosphorylation by Src-family kinases may induce intracellular signal transduction pathways by recruiting Src homology 2-containing proteins (15Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This might contribute to the biochemical changes required for modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Indeed, many signaling pathways regulated by tyrosine kinases, such as the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, are involved in modulation of synaptic transmission and long term memory (54Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In addition, clustering of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane is crucial for rapid and efficient synaptic signaling (55Froehner S.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine receptor clustering at neuromuscular junctions is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (56Wallace B.G. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Similarly, NMDA receptor clustering at synapses may be regulated by Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2. In summary, we report Fyn-mediated phosphorylation sites of GluRε2 showing that Tyr-1472 of GluRε2 is a major phosphorylation site. Our data suggest that Tyr-1472 phosphorylation may modulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. To further establish the physiological importance of Tyr-1472 phosphorylation of GluRε2, it is interesting to investigate electrophysiological and behavioral changes in GluRε2 Y1472F knock-in mice, where Y1472F mutant of GluRε2 replaces wild-type GluRε2.

The mRNA for livin was not detectable by Northern blot in most normal adult tissues with the exception of the placenta, but was present in developmental tissues and in several cancer cell lines. Highest levels were observed in two melanoma-derived cell lines, G361 and SK-Mel29. Transfection of livin in HeLa cells resulted in protection from apoptosis induced by expression of FADD, Bax, RIP, RIP3, and DR6. Similar to other IAP family members, the anti-apoptotic activity of Livin was dependent on the BIR domain. Livin was also capable of inhibiting DEVD-like caspase activity triggered by tumor necrosis factor-α. In vitro binding studies demonstrated a direct interaction between Livin and the active form of the downstream caspases, caspase-3 and -7, that was dependent on the BIR domain of Livin. In addition, the unprocessed and cleaved forms of caspase-9 co-immunoprecipitated with Livin in vivo, and recombinant Livin could inhibit the activation of caspase-9 induced by Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and dATP. The subcellular distribution of the transfected Livin was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Both Livin and Survivin were expressed in the nucleus and in a filamentous pattern throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast to the apoptotic activity, the COOH-terminal RING domain mediated its subcellular localization patterning. Further studies found that transfection of an antisense construct against livin could trigger apoptosis specifically in cell lines expressinglivin mRNA. This was associated with an increase in DNA fragmentation and in DEVD-like caspase activity. Thus, disruption of Livin may provide a strategy to induce apoptosis in certain cancer cells.

While first identified in baculovirus, the IAP family has been conserved evolutionarily from viruses to nematodes, flies, and several mammalian species. There are currently five human IAP family members, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, NAIP, and Survivin (4Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D. Nat.

All of the human IAP family members, with the exception of NAIP, have been shown to interact with specific cysteine proteases, or caspases, required for the cleavage of certain proteins involved in the disassembly of the cell during apoptosis (8Thornberry N.A.

The caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogen forms which upon apoptotic stimulation are proteolytically processed in a sequential manner into their active heterotetrameric forms. c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, and Survivin have been reported to bind to and inhibit the active forms of the terminal caspases-3 and -7, but do not interact with caspases-8, which is the most proximal caspase from the TNF-α/Fas receptor (9Deveraux Q.L.

However, in the case of Survivin, caspase inhibition may be more indirect through association with Cdk4 leading to inhibition of pro-caspase-3 by p21 (13Suzuki A. Ito T. Kawano H. Hayashida M.

Abrogation of caspase activity, a common downstream component of apoptosis, enables IAPs to have widespread anti-apoptotic potential. The BIR domain forms a novel zinc-fold that is the critical motif for their anti-apoptotic activity and interaction with caspases (15Hinds M.G. Norton R.S. Vaux D.L. Day C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). While many IAPs contain up to three tandem BIR repeats, a single BIR domain is sufficient for caspase interaction and protection from apoptosis (16Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Many of the IAP proteins (c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, as well as viral and insect IAPs) also contain a RING domain near their COOH termini. The role for the RING domain varies depending on the IAP and/or the apoptotic stimulus, but does not appear to be required for the anti-apoptotic activity of human IAPs (10Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 16Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Deletion of the RING domain in c-IAP2 has suggested a critical role in TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, thereby providing an additional mechanism for the IAPs anti-apoptotic activity (19Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also found that c-IAP1 and XIAP have ubiquitin ligase activity which leads to their degradation during apoptosis and that this activity is dependent on their RING domain (20Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if this is a general feature of the RING domain in other IAP family members. Several of the IAP family members have been reported to play a role in pathological conditions, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. For instance, the NAIP gene was originally identified based on its deletion in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron depletion through apoptosis (21Roy N. Mahadevan M.S. McLean M. Shutler G. Yarghi Z. Farahani R. Baird S. Besner-Johnston A. Lefebvre C. Kang X. Salih M. Aubry H. Tamai K. Guan X. Ioannou P. Crawford T.O. de Jong P.J. Surh L. Ikeda J.-E. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A. Cell. 1995; 80: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The correlation between NAIP, spinal muscular atrophy, and apoptosis suggests that NAIP may be required for the survival of these neurons and that mutations in theNAIP locus contribute to spinal muscular atrophy. In addition, NAIP levels are transiently elevated following ischemia and damage can be inhibited by overexpression of NAIP in vivo(22Xu D.G. Crocker S.J. Doucet J.-P. St-Jean M. Tamai K. Hakim A.M. Ikeda J.-E. Liston P. Thompson C.S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A. Robertson G.S. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Expression of other IAP family members have been correlated with cancer. For example, XIAP and c-IAP1 are found in most cancer cell lines (23Tamm I. Kornblau S.M. Segall H. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Kitada S. Scudiero D.A. Tudor G. Qui Y.H. Monks A. Andreeff M. Reed J.C. Clinical Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1796-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Survivin is overexpressed in nearly all human tumors and transformed cell lines, but is rarely present in normal adult tissues (4Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar, 11Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigna N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C.

Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 137-141PubMed Google Scholar). Survivin is induced by angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and angiopoietin-1 which may explain its elevated levels in tumors (28Papapetropoulos A. Fulton D. Mahboubi K. Kalb R.G. O'Connor D.S. Li F. Altieri D.C. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9102-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar,29Tran J. Rak J.

Depletion of Survivin using antisense or dominant negative mutants induces apoptosis implying that Survivin expression contributes to the survival of cancer cells (24Grossman D. McNiff J.M. Li F.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar). Tumors expressing Survivin, as well as other anti-apoptotic signal generally have a poorer prognosis, likely due to their resistance to classical chemotherapy (25Kawasaki H. Altieri D.C. Lu C.-D. Toyoda M. Tenjo T. Tanigawa N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5071-5074PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we attempted to identify novel members of the IAP family via homology searches. One gene was identified which we termedlivin that encodes a protein with a single BIR domain and a COOH-terminal RING domain. Expression of Livin inhibited apoptosis by a number of stimuli, whereas an antisense construct was shown to induce apoptosis. Like its other family members, Livin was capable of binding to caspases and could inhibit the proteolytic processing of caspase-9in vitro. Restricted expression of livin mRNA during development and transformed cell lines suggests a very specific role for Livin. A partial cDNA sequence oflivin was identified in the proprietary Incyte LifeSeq data base (accession number 1419118). To obtain the full-length construct we screened an adult kidney cDNA library (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with a livin-specific probe, 5′-CCTTCTATGACTGGCCGCTGA-3′, using the GeneTrapperTMcDNA positive selection system (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). The coding sequence of livin was PCR cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in both the sense and antisense orientations. Livin was subsequently subcloned by PCR into the Bam HI/Eco RI sites in pGEX-6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) for purification of a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. Deletion mutants of Livin (ΔN154, ΔC86, and 86–154) were generated by PCR and subcloned into the Kpn I/Apa I sites within pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). FADD, Bax, and DR6, were subcloned by PCR from Incyte clones 3334311, 2057308, and 2733717 and ligated into pTracer-SV40 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) atEco RI/Not I, Eco RV/Not I, andNot I/Spe I sites, respectively. Caspase-9 was prepared by PCR from Incyte clone 3590462 and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO. Apaf-1 was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO from a PCR product generated from a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The pTracer-SV40-RIP plasmid was prepared by PCR from pMH-RIP (34Kasof G.M. Prosser J.C. Liu D. Lorenzi M.V. Gomes B.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and ligated into theKpn I/Not I sites in pTracer-SV40. The constructions of pTracer-SV40-RIP3 and pZeoSV2-Bcl-xL were described previously (34Kasof G.M. Prosser J.C. Liu D. Lorenzi M.V. Gomes B.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1-myc-survivin was provided by Dr. Kevin Hudson (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK). The nucleotide sequences of all of the clones were confirmed by fluorescent terminator cycle sequencing using an automated 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). pGEX-6P-livin was inoculated overnight in Escherichia coli BL21 and subsequently stimulated with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and lysed by sonication. Lysates were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged to remove the insoluble material. Supernatants were added to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column and the bound protein was eluted with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) thereby cleaving the glutathione S-transferase fusion. HeLa, G361, SK-Mel29, HMCB, A375, WM115, HT144, and SW480 cell lines (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Poly(A) RNA was isolated from human melanoma cell lines (SK-Mel29, HMCB, A375, WM115, and HT144) using the Poly(A) Pure kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The RNA was denatured in sample buffer (2.2 m formaldehyde, 50% formamide, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA) heated at 65 °C for 10 min, electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA, and then transferred by capillary elution onto Hybond-N nylon filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In addition, we used commercially available human RNA blots, prepared from adult and fetal tissues and cancer cell lines (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The blots were hybridized to random primed radiolabeledlivin (full-length cDNA containing 5′- and 3′-untranslated region) or actin(CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) incubated in Hybrisol I (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) overnight at 42 °C. The blots were then washed with 2 × SSC + 0.05% SDS at room temperature followed by high stringency washing, 0.1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Viability was assessed using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker produced from pTracer-SV40-derived vectors. Transfected cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, counterstained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, 200 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature, and then mounted on microscope slides with Immu-mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). A laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA) was used to determine the percent of GFP-positive cells. The propidium iodide staining served as a marker required for gating the cell population. Relative fluorescence values were determined with an excitation at 488 nm using an argon laser and emission filters at 505–540 nm (GFP) and 614–639 nm (propidium iodide). The ability of antisense againstlivin to induce apoptosis was examined using TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling (TUNEL). Transiently transfected cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated dUTP according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were then counterstained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide and 200 μg/ml RNase A, and collected on microscope slides by a cytospin. The percent of TUNEL-positive cells was evaluated using the laser scanning cytometer as described above for GFP. Caspase activity was measured using the ApoAlertTM caspase-3 fluorescent assay kit (CLONTECH). Cytosolic lysates were prepared from transiently transfected cells and incubated with 50 μm of the fluorescent substrate 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC) conjugated to the caspase cleavage site Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) for 1 h at 37 °C. Hydrolyzed AFC was detected using a CytoFluorTM 4000 fluorometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with peak excitation/band width at 360/40 nm and peak emission/band width at 530/30 nm. In vitro processing of caspase-9 was performed using [35S]methionine-labeled caspase-9 and Apaf-1 prepared using the TNT T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The proteins were desalted and exchanged into buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) using a Bio-spin P-6 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Caspase-9 (2 μl) and Apaf-1 (6 μl) were combined with 10 μm cytochromec and 1 mm dATP (Sigma) and 50 μmrecombinant Livin for 1 h at 30 °C. The samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer, and resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 1 h, dried, and then visualized using a PhosphorImager. In vitro binding reactions were performed by combining recombinant active caspase-3 or -7 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) with [35S]methionine-labeled Survivin or Livin (wild-type and deletion mutants), prepared using the TNT T7 reticulocyte lysate system. Samples were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against either caspase-3 or -7 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) in 0.5 ml of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) for 1.5 h at 4 °C followed by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. All samples were then washed three times in NETN buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected using a PhosphorImager. Binding kinetics were obtained using the BiacoreTM 3000 (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant Livin was amine coupled to a CM5 sensor chip and 1–500 nm active caspases-3, -7, and -9 were passed through the chip. Binding constants were determined using the BIAevaluation software (version 3.0). Associations with caspase-9 were shown using HeLa cells transiently transfected with either pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO-livin or pcDNA3.1-myc-survivin and treated with TNF-α and cycloheximide. Cell lysates were prepared in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (0.01 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) which were spun at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble supernatants were immunoprecipitated using either a monoclonal antibody against V5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed by protein G-Sepharose or with a monoclonal antibody against Myc conjugated to agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The samples were washed three times in RIPA buffer, boilied in Laemmli buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were semi-dry blotted onto nitrocelluose and probed with a monoclonal antibody against caspase-9 (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI). Immuno-complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were performed to confirm that the antisense construct oflivin could reduce Livin expression, but not Survivin. Transfected HeLa cells were maintained in 100 μm ZVAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems, Livermore, CA) to prevent apoptosis. Cell lysates were prepared in Laemmli buffer and Western blots were performed as described above using antibodies against V5, Survivin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). The subcellular localizations of Livin and Survivin were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence from HeLa cells transfected with epitope-tagged expression constructs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were incubated with antibodies against the V5 or Myc (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) epitopes for 1 h at 37 °C. Staining was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were visualized by epifluorescence using an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with a Kodak DCS 520 digital camera (Hitech Instruments, Inc., Edgemont, PA). A homology search of a proprietary Incyte data base using BLAST, revealed an 840-nucleotide sequence present in a fetal kidney library and predicted to encode a novel protein with a BIR domain and a COOH-terminal RING finger domain (accession number 1419118). To obtain the full-length gene, we used the GeneTrapperTM cDNA positive selection system to screen an adult kidney cDNA library. A low abundant clone was found which contained an in-frame stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region, suggesting it was a full-length gene. This gene, which we termedlivin, was 1297 base pairs and predicted to encode a 280-amino acid protein (Fig.1 A; GenBank accession numberAF311388). Genomic sequence corresponding to the livin cDNA was found in the EMBL data base (accession number AL121827) and localized on chromosome 20. The overall protein identity of Livin to other IAP family members based on the GAP pairwise sequence alignment (GCGTM, Madison, WI) was 24.1% to c-IAP1, 26.1% to c-IAP2, 34.7% to XIAP, 25.5% to NAIP, and 26.3% to Survivin. At a structural level it was similar to Survivin with respect to having just a single BIR domain (Fig. 1 B). However, Livin did not have a coiled-coil domain like Survivin, but rather contained a COOH-terminal RING domain found in c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and XIAP. The tissue distribution of livin was studied by Northern blotting with mRNA prepared from human adult and developmental tissues as well as several cancer cell lines. Using the entire cDNA sequence of livin as a probe, three distinct mRNAs were detected with approximate sizes of 1.4, 2.0, and 2.8 kilobases (Fig. 2). The smaller of the transcripts was consistent with the cDNA isolated in our screen. The sizes of the three transcripts were distinct from other IAP family members, suggesting that they were specific forlivin. Despite the presence of livin in fetal and adult kidney cDNA libraries, within the normal tissues tested here,livin was found only in placenta and fetal brain. It is likely that livin is expressed transcriptionally in other tissues, but at levels too low to be detected by the Northern blot. Elevated levels of livin were seen in cancer cell lines, particularly in the melanoma cell lines G361 and SK-Mel29, and to a lesser extent, in HeLa (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the segments of the chromosome corresponding to the livin locus displays increased copy number in nearly all melanoma cell lines and primary tumors (35Barks J.H. Thompson F.H. Taetle R. Yang J.-M. Stone J.F. Wymer J.A. Khavari R. Guan X.-Y. Trent J.M. Pinkel D. Nelson M.A. Genes Chromosome Cancer. 1997; 19: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). While livin has a narrower distribution thansurvivin in cancer cells, the general patterns of expression between these genes are similar, with no detectable expression in normal adult tissues and elevated levels in placenta, developing tissues, and cancer cell lines (4Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar, 11Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigna N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar). While the BIR motif can confer an anti-apoptotic signal via caspase interactions, some BIR motifs are not as effective at suppressing apoptosis, and there are BIR-containing proteins with no apparent anti-apoptotic function (16Takahashi R.

The potential anti-apoptotic activity of Livin was investigated with respect to several pro-apoptotic signals acting at different points within the apoptotic process, including DR6, FADD, RIP, RIP3, and Bax. DR6 is a member of the TNF receptor family and thus is at the most upstream level of the apoptotic process (37Pan G. Bauer J.H. Haridas V. Wang S. Liu D., Yu, G. Vincenz C. Aggarwal B.B. Ni J.

Some of these pores should be large enough to allow cytochrome c to permeate. Dihydroceramide differs from ceramide by the reduction of one double bond, and yet both its apoptogenic and channel-forming activities are greatly reduced. A structural model provides insight into how ceramides might form pores. According to a mathematical model, both the individual conductance of the channels and the overall membrane conductance are directly related to the overall concentration of ceramide in the membrane. Slight changes in concentration have dramatic effects on the size of the channels formed, providing an easy way for rapidly altering membrane permeability by changing the activity of local synthetic and catabolic enzymes.

Ceramide is generated within the cell via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin or de novo synthesis. A net increase in ceramide levels within the cell is observed in response to several inducers of cellular stress (1Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev.

Ceramides have been reported to mix poorly with phospholipids in bilayers, form distinct ceramide-enriched microdomains, favor the stability of the gel over the lamellar phase, and facilitate the lamellar-hexagonal transition of phospholipids (26Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Di Paola et al. (16Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) recently reported that C2-ceramide, when added to liposomes, causes a collapse in the membrane potential generated by reconstituted complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Their results indicate that C2-ceramide can somehow cause an increase in the permeability of membranes.Although ceramides have been demonstrated to increase the permeability of membranes, the means by which they do so remains unclear. We therefore tested the ability of C2- and C16-ceramides to form channels in membranes lacking proteins, utilizing the planar membrane technique (27Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) as modified (28Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Here we show that both short- and long-chain ceramides can form large stable channels in membranes and have provided both structural and mathematical models to provide insight as to how they might do so. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of stable pore formation by a lipid in a membrane. The implication for a role of these ceramide channels in apoptosis is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe results of this paper provide evidence that both C2- and C16-ceramide form large stable pores in membranes, whereas the biologically inactive C2- and C18-dihydroceramides do not. The inability of other amphiphiles, including detergents, phospholipids, and products of phospholipase activity, to form stable channels may reside in their inability to form an extensive hydrogen-bonded network. In our model, hydrogen bonding stabilizes not only columns of ceramide molecules but also the polar ring that forms the wall of the aqueous pore.Channel formation by C2- and C16-ceramides explains their ability to increase the permeability of membranes. The pores formed by both short- and long-chain ceramides could be directly or indirectly related to their apoptotic activity. According to the bulk properties of water, the pores with conductances ranging from 1 to 200 nS would have estimated diameters ranging from 0.8 to 11 nm, respectively. The voltage-dependent anion channel, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is considered to be a relatively large pore. In the high conductance state, it only has a single channel conductance of 4 nS (in the equivalent solution) and cannot allow the passage of cytochrome c (30Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The larger ceramide pores, if formed in the outer mitochondrial membrane, would provide a pathway large enough for cytochrome c to pass. Alternatively, the ceramide pores could indirectly cause cytochrome c release through alterations in ion homeostasis (increased calcium levels alone are known to induce cytochrome c release) or through interactions with Bcl-2 family members. In addition, if ceramide pores formed in the inner mitochondrial membrane, they would dissipate Δψm and could accelerate electron transport, resulting in enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. Results using C2- and C16-ceramides applied to mitochondrial suspensions indicated that only C2-ceramide was able to dissipate the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (16Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the relative proportion of ceramide and phospholipids plays a large role in the formation of ceramide-enriched microdomains and the way in which ceramides perturb the structure of bilayers (26Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 31Huang H. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetzki R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the 14 extra CH2 groups of C16-ceramide would make it much more difficult for the long-chain ceramides to move between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes through the intervening aqueous phase. Using an estimated 3 kJ/mol/CH2 residue, the free energy difference between the hydrocarbon phase and water would increase by 42 kJ/mol, which translates to a change in partitioning of 3 × 107. Therefore, natural ceramides generated via de novo synthesis would exert their effects on local membrane fractions depending on the location of generation resulting in effects that would differ from those elicited by the more soluble ceramides.Ceramide channels consist of hundreds of ceramide molecules, hence their formation and size would be exceedingly sensitive to the local ceramide concentration. Garcı́a-Ruiz et al. (21Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) reported that mitochondria isolated from cells treated with tumor necrosis factor showed a 2–3-fold increase in mitochondrial ceramide concentrations as compared with control cells (21Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). They showed that this ceramide is not locally produced within mitochondria by action of sphingomyelinases acting on sphingomyelin, as incubation of isolated mitochondria with sphingomyelinases did not result in an increase in mitochondrial ceramide levels (21Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Enzymes capable of both de novo synthesis (ceramide synthase) and hydrolysis (ceramidase) have been found in mitochondria (32Shimeno H. Soeda S. Sakamoto M. Kouchi T. Kowakame T. Kihara T. Lipids. 1998; 33: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus the dynamic channel formation and breakdown seen in vitro should also occurin vivo. These could increase or decrease local levels of ceramide, and even small changes could alter mitochondrial membrane permeability by channel formation or dissolution. Overall ceramide levels are known to increase during apoptosis, and thus regulation of the enzymes in the ceramide pathway is somehow involved in the apoptotic process. Further characterization of the pores formed by ceramide is underway and will hopefully provide answers to some of these questions. Ceramide, a sphingosine-based lipid second messenger, is known to be involved in the regulation of several cellular responses to extracellular stimuli, including differentiation, growth suppression, cell senescence, and apoptosis (1Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 3Ariga T. Jarvis W.D. Yu R.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of ceramide specifically in apoptosis has attracted great attention in recent years. Ceramide is generated within the cell via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin or de novo synthesis. A net increase in ceramide levels within the cell is observed in response to several inducers of cellular stress (1Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 3Ariga T. Jarvis W.D. Yu R.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contents of ceramide in the membranes of cells undergoing apoptosis are thought to reach 10 mol % of the total phospholipid (2Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). The wide range biological effects of ceramide, which depend on cell type, receptors involved, sub-cellular location, and concentration, suggest the existence of several downstream targets for distinct intracellular pathways.

DISCUSSIONThe results of this paper provide evidence that both C2- and C16-ceramide form large stable pores in membranes, whereas the biologically inactive C2- and C18-dihydroceramides do not. The inability of other amphiphiles, including detergents, phospholipids, and products of phospholipase activity, to form stable channels may reside in their inability to form an extensive hydrogen-bonded network. In our model, hydrogen bonding stabilizes not only columns of ceramide molecules but also the polar ring that forms the wall of the aqueous pore.Channel formation by C2- and C16-ceramides explains their ability to increase the permeability of membranes. The pores formed by both short- and long-chain ceramides could be directly or indirectly related to their apoptotic activity. According to the bulk properties of water, the pores with conductances ranging from 1 to 200 nS would have estimated diameters ranging from 0.8 to 11 nm, respectively. The voltage-dependent anion channel, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is considered to be a relatively large pore. In the high conductance state, it only has a single channel conductance of 4 nS (in the equivalent solution) and cannot allow the passage of cytochrome c (30Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The larger ceramide pores, if formed in the outer mitochondrial membrane, would provide a pathway large enough for cytochrome c to pass. Alternatively, the ceramide pores could indirectly cause cytochrome c release through alterations in ion homeostasis (increased calcium levels alone are known to induce cytochrome c release) or through interactions with Bcl-2 family members. In addition, if ceramide pores formed in the inner mitochondrial membrane, they would dissipate Δψm and could accelerate electron transport, resulting in enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. Results using C2- and C16-ceramides applied to mitochondrial suspensions indicated that only C2-ceramide was able to dissipate the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (16Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the relative proportion of ceramide and phospholipids plays a large role in the formation of ceramide-enriched microdomains and the way in which ceramides perturb the structure of bilayers (26Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 31Huang H. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetzki R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the 14 extra CH2 groups of C16-ceramide would make it much more difficult for the long-chain ceramides to move between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes through the intervening aqueous phase. Using an estimated 3 kJ/mol/CH2 residue, the free energy difference between the hydrocarbon phase and water would increase by 42 kJ/mol, which translates to a change in partitioning of 3 × 107. Therefore, natural ceramides generated via de novo synthesis would exert their effects on local membrane fractions depending on the location of generation resulting in effects that would differ from those elicited by the more soluble ceramides.Ceramide channels consist of hundreds of ceramide molecules, hence their formation and size would be exceedingly sensitive to the local ceramide concentration. Garcı́a-Ruiz et al. (21Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) reported that mitochondria isolated from cells treated with tumor necrosis factor showed a 2–3-fold increase in mitochondrial ceramide concentrations as compared with control cells (21Garcı́a-Ruiz C.

They showed that this ceramide is not locally produced within mitochondria by action of sphingomyelinases acting on sphingomyelin, as incubation of isolated mitochondria with sphingomyelinases did not result in an increase in mitochondrial ceramide levels (21Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Enzymes capable of both de novo synthesis (ceramide synthase) and hydrolysis (ceramidase) have been found in mitochondria (32Shimeno H. Soeda S. Sakamoto M. Kouchi T. Kowakame T. Kihara T.

These could increase or decrease local levels of ceramide, and even small changes could alter mitochondrial membrane permeability by channel formation or dissolution. Overall ceramide levels are known to increase during apoptosis, and thus regulation of the enzymes in the ceramide pathway is somehow involved in the apoptotic process. Further characterization of the pores formed by ceramide is underway and will hopefully provide answers to some of these questions.

Mutations in the outer one-third of the IIIS6 segment all favored activation. Mutations in the inner half of IIIS6 had strong effects on the voltage dependence of inactivation from closed states without effect on open-state inactivation.

K+channel from Streptomyces lividans Voltage-gated Na+ channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in nerve, heart, and skeletal muscle (1Catterall W.A. Physiol.

Physiol. 1998; 508: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The major structural component of voltage-gated Na+ channels is a 260-kDa α subunit, which forms the voltage-gated, Na+-selective pore. In mammalian brain, the α subunit associates with auxiliary β subunits of 33–36 kDa (1Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S.

Mizuguchi K. Jackson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2308-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The α subunit contains four homologous domains (I–IV), each containing six predicted transmembrane α-helices (S1–S6) and an additional membrane-reentrant pore loop (1Catterall W.A. Physiol.

Physiol. 1998; 508: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The S6 segments of each homologous domain are arranged in a square array surrounding the inner pore, whereas the membrane-reentrant pore loops between the S5 and S6 segments line the narrower outer pore and form the ion selectivity filter (1Catterall W.A.

Clinically important drugs, including local anesthetics and some anticonvulsants and antiarrhythmics, exert their therapeutic effects by binding preferentially to the inactivated state and blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels. Local anesthetics and the related phenylalkylamine blockers of Ca2+ channels have been characterized biophysically as pore blockers (8Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 9Hondeghem L.M. Katzung B.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Toxicol. 1984; 24: 387-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and therefore provide molecular probes for identification of pore-lining amino acid residues. Photoaffinity labeling studies of phenylalkylamine binding to L-type Ca2+ channels initially implicated the IVS6 segment in forming the inner pore lining (11Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9108-9112Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis studies of Na+ channels and Ca2+ channels (12Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 13Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) identified analogous sets of amino acid residues in the IVS6 segment that form the receptors sites for these drugs and therefore line the inner pores. Mutations F1764A and Y1771A in segment IVS6 reduced affinity of inactivated Na+ channels for the local anesthetic etidocaine by up to two orders of magnitude (12Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Mutation of these homologous residues also substantially reduced block of inactivated Na+ channels by other local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and anticonvulsant drugs in brain type IIA, brain type III, and skeletal muscle Na+ channels (12Ragsdale D.S.

X-ray crystallographic analysis of a K+ channel from Streptomyces lividans(KcsA)1 shows directly that the channel pore is formed by transmembrane segments analogous to the S6 segments and S5–S6 pore loops of Na+ and Ca2+ channels (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5763) Google Scholar). A water-filled cavity on the intracellular side of the ion selectivity filter includes the amino acid residues analogous to Phe-1764 and Tyr-1771 of Na+channels and likely corresponds to the binding site of pore-blocking drugs. In this structure, the S6-like segments cross to form an apparent barrier to ion movement at the intracellular end of the pore. Therefore, in addition to their role in forming the inner pore lining, the S6 segments may also serve as the activation gate and move during activation (22Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 23del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Because local anesthetics bind in a cavity in the pore formed by a symmetrical array of all four S6 segments, it is likely that the S6 segments in domains I, II, and III of Na+ channels also contribute to the receptor sites for local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and anticonvulsant drugs. Consistent with this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis of the skeletal muscle Na+channel showed that replacement of Asn-434 and Leu-437 within transmembrane segment IS6 with lysine significantly reduced block by etidocaine, suggesting that the positive charge of the inserted lysine residue can disrupt normal drug binding (24Wang G.K. Quan C. Wang S.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to investigate the role of amino acid residues in transmembrane segment IIIS6 in channel gating and block by anticonvulsant and local anesthetic drugs. Our results further define the pore-lining residues of the inner pore of Na+ channels and identify new components of the receptor site for local anesthetics and related pore-blocking drugs. Mutations were prepared by a two-step polymerase chain reaction protocol using two mutagenic primers and two restriction site primers. The mutagenic fragment and the plasmid pCDM8rIIA were digested with BstEII and BlpI restriction endonucleases. The mutagenic fragment was then subcloned into the plasmid pCDM8rIIa via those restriction sites. The mutations were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. Plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant Na+channel α subunits and wild-type β1 subunits were linearized, and RNA was transcribed as described previously (25McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested, maintained, and injected with RNA by standard methods as described previously (25McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Na+ channel recordings were obtained from injected oocytes using a Dagan CA-1 voltage clamp (Dagan Corp.) as described previously (25McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The bath was continuously perfused with Ringer solution containing (in mm): 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH. Recording electrodes contained 3 m KCl and had resistances of <0.5 megohm. Stock solutions of lamotrigine and 619c89 (Glaxo Wellcome) were prepared in 25 mm HCl, 227c89 (Glaxo Wellcome) was prepared in water, and 4030w92 (Glaxo Wellcome) and etidocaine (Astra) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. All drugs stocks were then diluted to the desired concentration in the bath solution. To evaluate the gating perturbations caused by IIIS6 mutants, we calculated the difference in Gibb's free energy between closed and open states at 0 mV (ΔG 0) according to ΔG 0 = −RTV0.5/k, where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in degrees K,V0.5 is the half-maximal activation voltage, and k is a slope factor. V0.5 and k values were determined from fits of activation curves to single Boltzmann functions. The difference in ΔG 0 between wild-type and mutant channels was calculated according to ΔG0 = δGmut0 − δGwt0. To evaluate the periodicity of gating perturbations produced by IIIS6 mutants, we used Fourier transform methods (26Cornette J.L. Cease K.B. Margalit H. Spouge J.L. Berzofsky J.A. DeLisi C. J. Mol.

Yeates T.O. Allen J.P. Feher G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 607-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Fourier transform power spectrum (P(ω)) was calculated according to the equation,P(ω)=[X(ω)2+Y(ω)2]Equation 1 where X(ω) = ∑j=1n [(V j − 〈V〉) sin(jω)]; Y(ω) = ∑ j=1 n [(Vj −〈V〉) cos (jω)], and ω is the angular frequency, n is the number of residues in a segment, Vj is ‖ΔΔG 0‖ at a given position j, and 〈V〉 is the average value of ΔΔG 0 for the segment. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of amino acid residues in transmembrane segment IIIS6 of the α subunit of the rat brain type IIA Na+ channel (rIIA) was used to investigate their functional role in activation, inactivation, and binding of pore-blocking drugs. Conversion of hydrophobic amino acid residues to alanine has only small effects on protein secondary structure but changes the size and chemical properties of the residue significantly (30Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar, 31Blaber M. Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W. Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To identify functionally important residues in transmembrane segment IIIS6, we substituted alanine for individual native amino acid residues from Val-1454 to Ile-1473. We coexpressed the wild-type and mutant Na+ channel α subunits and wild-type β1 subunits in Xenopus oocytes and measured Na+ current using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp. Mutations throughout the IIIS6 segment caused significant negative and positive shifts in the voltage dependence of activation compared with wild-type. For example, the voltage for half-maximal activation of mutants L1467A, F1468A, and I1469A was shifted by −5, −14, and +8 mV, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Mutations V1454A, F1456A, I1458A, F1459A, T1464A, V1471A, and I1472A also caused significant negative shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, mutations G1460A, F1462A, L1465A, N1466A, G1470A, and I1473A caused significant positive shifts (Fig. 1 B). The steepness of the voltage dependence of the activation process (k = 5.4 ± 0.1 mV for wild-type) was significantly decreased by mutations L1465A (k = 6.2 ± 0.2 mV), N1466A (k = 6.5 ± 0.2 mV), and L1467A (k = 7.6 ± 0.2 mV). By analogy with the bacterial K+ channel KcsA, whose structure is known (21Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.L. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5763) Google Scholar), S6 transmembrane segments are assumed to be α-helical in structure and to line the inner aspect of the ion-conducting pore. Therefore, one surface of each S6 helix is expected to face the lumen of the pore, whereas the other sides interact with adjacent transmembrane segments. S6 transmembrane segments are proposed to change conformation via rotation during channel activation (22Perozo E. Cortes D.M. Cuello L.G. Science. 1999; 285: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 23del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 32Holmgren M.

Biol. 1998; 5: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), leading to changes in side-chain interactions with neighboring α-helices. Power spectral analysis of periodicity in the effects of mutations in successive positions along the α-helix can reveal position-dependent interactions with neighboring structural elements during activation gating (34Hong K.H. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Li-Smerin Y. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J.

Physiol. 2000; 115: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Changes in free energy of activation (ΔΔG 0) for each mutation were calculated from the results of Fig. 1 and plotted in Fig.2 A. The ΔΔG 0 values parallel the changes in the voltage for half-maximal activation from which they were derived (Fig. 1 B). Inspection of the ΔΔG 0 values reveals that they are consistently negative for the six most extracellular residues of the helix, indicating that these mutations favor activation. This pattern is interrupted at G1460A, mutation of which produces a strongly positive ΔΔG 0 value. Progressing inward through the IIIS6 segment, the ΔΔG 0 values assume a periodic pattern of positive and negative changes. These results suggest that the mutated residues make structurally or functionally important contacts with other transmembrane segments that differ depending on their location around the IIIS6 helix. If interactions of IIIS6 with different surrounding transmembrane segments have different effects on ΔΔG 0 for activation, a pattern of ΔΔG 0 values with α-helical periodicity of approximately 100° is expected. Power spectral analysis of the effects of mutations of the residues intracellular to G1460 that caused positive ΔΔG 0 values yields a peak at approximately 97° (Fig. 2 B), consistent with an α-helical structure in which the native residues on one face of the helix make interactions that favor activation. Residues intracellular to G1460 with negative ΔΔG 0values yielded a less well-defined peak of angular periodicity at 101°, suggesting that a different, broader face of the α-helix makes interactions that favor the resting state of the channel and oppose activation (data not shown). All mutations except I1458A and F1468A make relatively small (<1 kcal) perturbations in ΔΔG 0, indicating that the change in energy of interaction for any single residue is relatively small. Most mutations of amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic half of the IIIS6 segment also caused strong shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation during 100-ms prepulses to the indicated membrane potentials (Fig.3 A). For example, the voltages for half-maximal inactivation of mutations L1465A and L1467A were shifted by −11 and −14 mV, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Significant negative shifts were also caused by mutations F1463A, N1466A, F1468A, G1470A, V1471A, and I1472A (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, mutations I1473A and I1469A caused significant positive shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation (Fig. 3, Aand B). Inactivation gating was unaffected for most of the mutations in the extracellular half of IIIS6. Only I1458A caused a significant negative shift (Fig. 3 B). The two mutations giving positive shifts (I1469A and I1473A) are four residues apart, and mutations F1463A, L1467A, and V1471A, which define local peaks in the negative shifts of inactivation, are also four residues apart in the sequence. Therefore, the changes in voltage dependence of inactivation for mutations at the intracellular end of IIIS6 also conform approximately to an α-helical periodicity of 3.6 residues per 360° turn. The anticonvulsant lamotrigine, which is used for treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder, acts by blocking brain Na+ channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner (37Goa K.L. Ross S.R. Chrisp P. Drugs. 1993; 46: 152-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 38Brodie M.J. Epilepsia. 1994; 35: S41-S46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Xie X. Lancaster B. Peakman T. Garthwaite J. Pflugers Arch. 1995; 430: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Etidocaine, an effective local anesthetic that is used for regional anesthesia, also blocks brain Na+ channels with strong voltage and frequency dependence (40Butterworth J.F. Strichartz G.R. Anesthesiology. 1990; 72: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The efficacy of these drugs as anticonvulsants and antiarrhythmics stems from their ability to selectively block Na+ channels during abnormal membrane depolarizations and rapid bursts of action potentials that characterize neuronal and cardiac pathologies (8Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 9Hondeghem L.M. Katzung B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 41Catterall W.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The selectivity of these drugs for Na+ channels in depolarized cells results from the preferential binding to the open and inactivated states that predominate at depolarized membrane potentials. This state-dependent drug action can be explained by an allosteric model in which a modulated drug receptor is in a low affinity conformation when the channel is in the resting state and converts to a high affinity conformation when the channel is inactivated by depolarization (8Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 9Hondeghem L.M. Katzung B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Etidocaine, lamotrigine, and related compounds have been previously used to identify amino acid residues involved in binding of pore-blocking drugs in transmembrane segment IVS6 (12Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 42Liu G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A399Google Scholar). For primary screening of mutants in segment IIIS6 for their effect on drug binding to the inactivated state of the Na+ channel, block of inactivated Na+ channels by lamotrigine or compound 619c89, a tricyclic lamotrigine congener (43Xie X.M. Garthwaite J. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was determined during a test pulse to 0 mV following a 15-s depolarization to a holding potential at which 70–80% of the Na+ current was inactivated (Fig.4 A, control trace c). At such a depolarized holding potential (−50 mV), addition of 100 μm lamotrigine (Fig. 4 A, trace d) reduced the Na+ current by 75%. At the same concentration, no significant block of Na+ current was observed when the holding potential was −120 mV (Fig. 4 A,traces a and b). From experiments like the one illustrated in Fig. 4 A, we determined the dissociation constant for the inactivated state (KI) for wild-type and mutant Na+ channels according to Kuo and Bean (44Kuo C.C. Bean B.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 716-725PubMed Google Scholar). Apparent affinities for lamotrigine are presented in Fig.4 B and for 619c89 in Fig. 4 C. Wild-type Na+ channels were inhibited by lamotrigine and 619c89 with dissociation constants of 32 and 10 μm, respectively, in agreement with previously reported results (42Liu G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A399Google Scholar). L1465A and I1469A decreased the affinity of lamotrigine for the inactivated state of the channel, resulting in 8- and 3-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. 4 B). The same mutations increase KI of 619c89 for the inactivated state of the channel approximately 3-fold (Fig.4 C). Both L1465A and I1469A caused positive shifts in voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 1 B). To test whether these shifts in activation could account for the observed decrease in drug affinity by preventing full activation of the Na+channels, we also examined inactivated-state affinity using strong depolarizations for which both wild-type and mutant channels were fully activated. We applied pulses to +20 mV for 15 s followed by a short interpulse interval at −120 mV to allow recovery from fast inactivation but not from drug block, and then by 15-ms test pulse to +20 mV. This protocol yielded dissociation constants for the drugs in agreement with those reported in Fig. 4 B (data not shown). Because mutations L1465A and I1469A had effects on the affinity of lamotrigine, we examined the affinities of these mutants for the structurally related compounds 4030w92 and 227c89 as well as the structurally unrelated local anesthetic etidocaine. L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A decreased the affinity of 4030w92 5-, 3-, and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Block by compound 227c89 was disrupted in L1465A and I1469A mutants by about 3-fold (Fig. 5 B). Larger disruptions in block by etidocaine were observed with mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A resulting in 6-, 8-, and 7-fold increases in KI, respectively (Fig. 5 C). Thus, mutations L1465A and I1469A decreased the affinity of all compounds tested substantially. In contrast, mutation N1466A caused the largest disruption of etidocaine binding but had no effect on binding of compound 227c89 or of lamotrigine and 619c89. To determine whether IIIS6 mutants affected block of resting Na+ channels at negative membrane potentials, we applied 15-ms test pulses from holding potentials of −80 to −120 mV in the absence and the presence of 500 μm lamotrigine. Mutations L1465A, N1466A, and I1469A increased affinity of lamotrigine for resting channels approximately 2-fold (Fig.6 A). L1465A and N1466A also increased affinity of etidocaine for resting channels 3-fold (Fig.6 B). In contrast, I1469A did not affect the affinity of etidocaine for resting channels (Fig. 6 B). No IIIS6 mutants caused significant decreases in resting affinity of lamotrigine or etidocaine (data not shown). Thus, the loss of drug binding affinity of these mutant channels is specific for the high affinity inactivated state. Frequency-dependent block of Na+channels is observed for drugs that bind to the channel rapidly in the open state and then bind with high affinity to the inactivated state (8Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 69: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 9Hondeghem L.M. Katzung B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Compounds 619c89 and etidocaine produce strong frequency-dependent block of the rat brain type IIA Na+ channels (Fig. 7) (12Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar,42Liu G. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A399Google Scholar). To determine whether IIIS6 mutants alter frequency-dependent block by compound 619c89, we applied 10-Hz trains of 20-ms pulses to 0 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV and recorded Na+ currents. Only I1469A significantly reduced frequency-dependent block by 619c89 compared with the wild-type (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, mutations F1462A and N1466A substantially increased frequency-dependent block. Surprisingly, given the reduced affinity of these inactivated channels for block by 619c89, L1465A had no significant effect on frequency-dependent block. Mutations L1465A and I1469A significantly reduced use-dependent block by etidocaine during 2-Hz trains (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, mutations N1466A and F1462A had little effect on frequency-dependent block by etidocaine (Fig. 7 B). Recovery of drug-blocked inactivated Na+ channels to the resting state was studied for the IIIS6 mutants that affected voltage- and/or frequency-dependent block of Na+ channels by 619c89 and etidocaine. We measured the rate of recovery by applying a 500-ms conditioning prepulse to 0 mV to produce drug block of inactivated channels followed by a recovery interval of variable duration and a test pulse to 0 mV. In control conditions, recovery after depolarization follows a double-exponential time course (Fig.8 A). In the presence of 50 μm 619c89, the fast time constant reflects recovery from inactivation of the small fraction of channels that was not blocked during the conditioning prepulse. The slow time constant reflects slow dissociation of the drug from the channels that were blocked during the conditioning prepulse (τdrug). For drug concentrations in which a large fraction of channels was blocked during the depolarization, only a single drug-induced recovery component was observed despite the two exponential components observed in control. Slow time constants (τdrug) induced by 619c89 are presented in Fig. 8 C. For wild-type channels τdrug was 384 ± 15 ms. τdrug for F1462A was not significantly different (379 ± 27 ms) (Fig. 8,A and C). In contrast, I1469A recovered with τdrug of 187 ± 6 ms (Fig. 8, B and C), 2-fold faster than the wild-type recovery rate. Recovery from block of both L1465A and N1466A wa"

Four of the polypeptides, designated HliA–D (Dolganov, N. A. M., Bhaya, D., and Grossman, A. R. (1995)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 636–640) (corresponding to ScpC, ScpD, ScpB, and ScpE in Funk, C., and Vermaas, W. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 9397–9404) contain a single transmembrane domain. The fifth polypeptide (HemH) represents a fusion between a ferrochelatase and an Hli-like polypeptide. By using an epitope tag to identify specifically the different Hli polypeptides, the accumulation of each (excluding HemH) was examined under various environmental conditions. The levels of all of the Hli polypeptides were elevated in high light and during nitrogen limitation, whereas HliA, HliB, and HliC also accumulated to high levels following exposure to sulfur deprivation and low temperature. The temporal pattern of accumulation was significantly different among the different Hli polypeptides. HliC rapidly accumulated in high light, and its level remained high for at least 24 h. HliA and HliB also accumulated rapidly, but their levels began to decline 9–12 h following the imposition of high light. HliD was transiently expressed in high light and was not detected 24 h after the initiation of high light exposure. These results demonstrate that there is specificity to the accumulation of the Hli polypeptides under a diverse range of environmental conditions. Furthermore, mutants for the individual and combinations of the hli genes were evaluated for their fitness to grow in high light. Although all of the mutants grew as fast as wild-type cells in low light, strains inactivated for hliA or hliC/hliD were unable to compete with wild-type cells during co-cultivation in high light. A mutant lacking all four hli genes gradually lost its photosynthesis capacity and died in high light. Hence, the Hli polypeptides are critical for survival when Synechocystis PCC6803 is absorbing excess excitation energy and may allow the cells to cope more effectively with the production of reactive oxygen species.

However, when photosynthetic organisms absorb excess excitation energy (more than can be used in photosynthesis), the light energy can cause damage to the cell (3Melis A. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 4Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). There are several ways in which excess, absorbed, light energy can be harmful to photosynthetic organisms. It can accumulate in light-harvesting antenna complexes and reaction centers and promote the formation of singlet oxygen, superoxides, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which are highly reactive and potentially toxic. Reactive oxygen species could modify proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, ultimately causing a loss of cell viability (5Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1999: 1-104Google Scholar). The photosynthetic reaction center polypeptide D1, or the 32-kDa polypeptide, is particularly susceptible to damage as a consequence of absorption of excess excitation energy (3Melis A.

The 32-kDa polypeptide, together with the D2 polypeptide, forms the heterodimeric reaction center of photosystem II that binds all of the redox components involved in photosynthetic charge separation. The rapid restoration of photosystem II function following photodamage indicates the existence of a tightly regulated repair system (3Melis A. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Repair processes include the degradation of damaged D1 polypeptide, de novo synthesis of D1 on chloroplast ribosomes, processing of newly synthesized D1, association of D1 with chlorophyll and its reaction center partner (D2), and assembly of the heterodimeric complex with other photosystem II polypeptides (3Melis A.

Both algae and vascular plants have evolved mechanisms for photo-acclimation that favor survival in high light (HL)1 (4Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

These mechanisms involve changes in the composition of light-harvesting and/or reaction center pigment-protein complexes (reviewed in Ref. 12Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar), redistribution of excitation energy between the photosystems (state transitions) (13Biggins J. Bruce D. Photosynth.

Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Plants have also developed the capacity to efficiently transform excess absorbed light energy into heat, thereby dissipating the energy in a harmless manner. This thermal dissipation is measured as quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence or nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) (4Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 16Gilmore A.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-209Crossref Google Scholar,17Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). NPQ is primarily a consequence of the operation of the xanthophyll cycle, which is required for the generation of zeaxanthin in HL (4Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The PsbS polypeptide, which has four membrane-spanning helices and shows homology to Lhc polypeptides, is also needed for NPQ (21Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that quenching of singlet excited chlorophyll occurs by direct energy transfer to zeaxanthin (22Frank H.A. Cua A. Chynwat V. Young A. Gosztola D. Wasielewski M.R. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence (23Frank H.A. Bautista J.A. Josue J.S. Young A.J.

Finally, reaction centers that are rendered nonfunctional via the absorption of excess excitation energy may continue to dissipate absorbed light energy as heat and serve a photoprotective role with respect to neighboring, functional photosystem II reaction centers (32Öquist G.

Photosynth. Res. 1992; 34: 105Google Scholar). Additionally, abundant soluble antioxidants in the chloroplast such as ascorbate and glutathione can act as quenchers of triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen (39Foyer C.H. Descourvieres P. Kunert K.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 507-523Crossref Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). One group of proteins that accumulates upon exposure of plants to HL is the ELIPs, or early light-inducibleproteins. These were originally characterized as polypeptides that transiently accumulated in etiolated seedlings of pea and barley following HL treatment (40Adamska I. Kloppstech K. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24732-24737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Adamska I. Ohad I. Kloppstech K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This transient accumulation also occurred when plants were exposed to blue light, suggesting a role for the blue light photoreceptor in the induction process (45von Lintig J. Welsch R. Bonk M. Giuliano G. Batschauer A. Kleinig H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); other studies suggest that phytochrome may be involved in ELIPexpression (46Adamska I. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, ELIPs accumulate transiently under a variety of stress conditions (47Adamska I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 794-805Crossref Google Scholar, 48Montane M.H. Dreyer S. Triantaphylides C. Kloppstech K. Planta. 1997; 202: 293-302Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 49Montane M.H. Petzold B.

This raises the possibility that the ELIPs function to protect plants from photooxidative damage and that expression of ELIP genes may be controlled by the redox state of the cell and/or the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. ELIP genes from a number of different organisms have been cloned and sequenced (43Kolanus W. Scharnhorst C. Kuhne U. Herzfeld F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 51Grimm B. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 21Google Scholar, 52Yamagata H. Bowler C. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Sequence comparisons have revealed that they are members of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein or Lhc superfamily of proteins (54Kruse E. Grimm B. Kloppstech K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 925Google Scholar). The ELIPs have three transmembrane helices (TMH I–III) that correspond to the TMHs of the Lhc polypeptides (55Green B.R. Kuhlbrandt W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 39-148Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although pigment binding by ELIPs has not been directly demonstrated, all ELIPs contain conserved residues that could potentially bind chlorophyll a (55Green B.R. Kuhlbrandt W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 39-148Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Even though it has been suggested that the ELIPs function as “pigment-carrier” proteins involved in the turnover and/or redistribution of pigment molecules under conditions when photosystem II components are being rapidly degraded and repaired (47Adamska I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 794-805Crossref Google Scholar), the exact role of ELIPs under light stress conditions is not clear. Recently, the Cbr protein of Dunaliella was shown to be associated with light-harvesting antenna complexes II and preferentially associated with specific pigment-protein subcomplexes that contain high levels of lutein and other xanthophylls (56Banet G. Pick U. Zamir A. Planta. 2000; 210: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Members of the Lhc gene family have also been identified that encode proteins with one and two TMHs. In Arabidopsis, two ELIP-like genes that encode thylakoid membrane polypeptides with two TMHs (the proteins are called Seps, stressenhanced proteins) were isolated (57Heddad M. Adamska I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Expression of Sep genes increased in HL but not during other stress conditions. An ELIP-like protein with a single TMH has also been isolated from Arabidopsis (58Jansson S. Andersson J. Jung-Kim S. Jackowski G. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These single TMH polypeptides, designated Hli or Scp (1Dolganov N.A.M. Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), were first discovered in cyanobacteria. The single TMH in these polypeptides resembles TMH I or III of the Lhc polypeptides. Expression of the genes is strikingly similar to that of ELIP genes, suggesting that they have similar functions. There are five monocistronic hli genes on the Synechocystis PCC6803 genome (59Kaneko T. Tabata S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 60Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima M. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar) that compose an hli multigene family (Ref. 2Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, CyanoBase); one of these represents a fusion with the ferrochelatase gene. We have examined accumulation of the four Hli proteins (the ferrochelatase was excluded) of Synechocystis PCC6803 under several conditions that would result in the absorption of excess excitation energy by the photosynthetic apparatus, and we have investigated the phenotypes of hli deletion mutants. Our results indicate that Hli polypeptides accumulate when cyanobacteria are exposed to HL or other stress conditions and that they may form distinct protein complexes in the thylakoid membranes. Furthermore, mutants that cannot synthesize Hli polypeptides show growth characteristics similar to that of wild-type cells in low light (LL) but are unable to compete with wild-type cells during exposure to HL. A strain deleted for all four of the hli genes gradually loses photosynthetic function and dies following exposure to HL. Synechocystis PCC6803 was cultivated in BG-11 medium (61Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) buffered with 10 mm TES, pH 8.2, at 30 °C. Cultures were bubbled with 3% CO2 in air and illuminated with 40 μmol photon m−2s−1 from incandescent bulbs. BG-11 medium lacking nitrogen (−N) or sulfur (−S) was prepared by replacing the NaNO3 for −N medium and MgSO4, ZnSO4, and CuSO4 for −S medium with equimolar amounts of the corresponding chloride salts (NaCl, MgCl2, ZnCl2, and CuCl2, respectively). For nutrient starvation experiments, cells grown in BG-11 medium were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 5 min) and re-suspended in −N or −S medium. This step was repeated prior to allowing cells to grow in −N or −S medium. Procedures for initiating nutrient deprivation have been described previously (62Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For HL treatments, cells in mid-logarithmic growth phase (OD730 ∼0.8) were diluted with fresh medium to an OD730 of ∼0.3. The cells (in 50-ml culture tubes) were then placed in a temperature-controlled glass chamber (maintained at 30 °C) and exposed to 500 μmol photon m−2s−1 white light for various lengths of time, as indicated in the text. For cold treatment, cultures were diluted with BG-11 medium chilled to 4 °C and then allowed to incubate at 4 °C with constant shaking for 6 h. To construct cell lines in which each of the Hli polypeptides was tagged with the His6epitope, coding regions of individual hli genes were cloned in frame into the pQE expression vectors (Qiagen) (pQE-60 for ssl1633 (hliC); pQE-70 for ssr2595 (hliB), ssr1789 (hliD), ssl2542 (hliA)). Each hlipromoter plus coding region (with the C-terminal His6 tag) was ligated sequentially to the 5 S t1t2prokaryotic terminator, a drug-resistant cartridge, and the DNA sequences downstream of each of the corresponding hli genes. Fig. 1 shows a linear drawing of each plasmid containing an epitope-tagged chimeric hli gene, and the legend of the figure provides the sequences of the primers that were used to make the constructs. Each of the chimeric genes was sequenced to ensure that no errors were generated during gene construction. The constructs were transformed into Synechocystis PCC6803; the wild-type hli sequence was replaced by the chimeric hli-His6sequence. Plasmids containing the hliA and hliB genes interrupted by erythromycin and spectinomycin resistance cassettes, respectively, were gifts from Wim Vermaas (Arizona State University). The hliA gene was interrupted at a SalI site located 72 base pairs downstream of the translation start site. The hliB gene was interrupted at a SacII site located 12 base pairs downstream of its translation start site. These constructs were generated by Funk and Vermaas 2C. Funk and W. Vermaas, unpublished data. and generously given to us. The gene disruptions were confirmed by PCR. 3Q. He, N. Dolganov, O. Björkman, and A. R. Grossman, unpublished data. The plasmids in which hliC and hliD were deleted (ΔhliC and ΔhliD) were generated by ligating a PCR fragment upstream of each gene (0.3 kb for hliC; 0.4 kb for hliD), a drug-resistant cartridge (kanamycin for hliC; chloramphenicol for hliD), and a PCR fragment generated to sequences downstream of each gene (0.4 kb for hliC; 0.5 kb for hliD), all in the proper orientation. Primers used for PCR amplifications, given in the legend of Fig. 1, incorporated different restriction endonuclease sites to facilitate cloning. A detailed representation of the constructs is depicted in Fig. 1. The plasmids containing the interruptions/deletions were transformed into Synechocystis PCC6803, and transformants were selected on appropriate antibiotics. Single, double, and quadruple mutants (all of the hli genes were either disrupted or deleted) were constructed. Transformants were continuously subcultured until each mutant line contained homoplasmic interruptions of hligenes. Segregation of the altered gene(s) in each of the mutants was monitored by PCR of isolated genomic DNA using specific primers as follows: hliA, GATGGCTTGGGGAGCTTTAC at position 701,108–701,127 and GTGTTACAATAGTTAACATAG at position 701,375–701,395; hliB, CTCTTTTGGTCAACAGACTTGAC at position 982,862–982,884 and GCCCTGGTTCAGTAGATTGCTTG at position 983,198–983,220; hliC, ACTACAGGTACCCCAGGCCAG at position 1,141,750–1,141,770 and TGAAACCTGATGAATGACGACG at position 1,142,194–1,142,215; hliD, TTGGTGTGGCAATGGCTGGATG at position 398,000–398,021 and ATTGTACGCAAGCAGCAATAAGC at position 398,369–398,391. Preparation of Synechocystis PCC6803 genomic DNA was as described previously (63He Q.F. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5830-5835Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial cell pellets derived from cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase were resuspended in thylakoid buffer (1/100 of the original culture volume) which contained 20 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 20% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm freshly made phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine HCl. The cell suspensions (0.4–0.6 ml) were transferred to a chilled microcentrifuge tube with approximately 0.5 ml of glass beads pre-wetted by thylakoid buffer and broken in a MiniBeadBeater by six breakage cycles at full speed (30 s for each cycle, followed by 3–5 min of chilling in ice water). After centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and cellular debris, the supernatant was diluted 30–50-fold in thylakoid buffer, and thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes were pelleted at 4 °C by centrifugation (20 min, 40,000 rpm in a Ti 50.2 rotor). The membranes were washed once and resuspended in thylakoid buffer (1 ml of buffer to 200 ml of the original culture volume). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation (64Wolfe G.R. Cunningham F.X. Grabowski B. Gantt E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 357-366Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used to purify thylakoid membranes. Purified membranes were resuspended in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3m sodium chloride. Solubilization of thylakoid membranes and SDS-PAGE were performed as described by Peter and Thornber (65Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 30 μg/lane membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 10–16% polyacrylamide gel. Polypeptides were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (66Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and immunodetection of polypeptides containing the His6 epitope tag was performed using commercial antibodies, as recommended by the suppliers of the antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Qiagen). Concentrations of soluble polypeptides and thylakoid membrane polypeptides solubilized by incubation in 2% SDS at 37 °C for 15 min were determined. Protein extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min to remove insoluble debris; the supernatants were diluted 10-fold with water, and the protein content was measured using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A thylakoid membrane suspension at a concentration of 0.6 mg of chlorophyll/ml was solubilized with a surfactant mixture composed of 0.6% octyl glucoside and 0.6% decyl maltoside, at 4 °C for 30 min. The material that remained insoluble was removed by centrifugation at 26,000 rpm (Beckman TL 100 rotor, ∼30,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μl) was loaded onto a Superose column (type 6 HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was connected to an FPLC system (Millipore Waters, model 650E). The column was pre-equilibrated with elution buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.3 msodium chloride, 0.1% octyl glucoside, 0.1% decyl maltoside) and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected, and the polypeptides in the fractions were concentrated by precipitation by making the samples 10% trichloroacetic acid. Growth of the cultures was monitored as a change in optical density at 730 nm. Competition experiments were performed at 30 °C under LL (40 μmol photon m−2 s−1) or HL (500 μmol photon m−2s−1). Wild-type SynechocystisPCC6803 cells and mutant strains were mixed at approximately equal densities (OD730 ∼0.6) and diluted to an OD730 of approximately 0.05. An aliquot (5 μl) of the culture was diluted in 0.5 ml, and 50 μl (about 400 cells) was spread onto each BG-11 agar plate, both with and without antibiotics, to determine the initial proportion of wild-type and mutant cells. The mixed cultures were diluted ∼10-fold with fresh medium containing appropriate antibiotics when the OD730 of the culture approached 0.8. Aliquots from the culture were sampled at various times following the initiation of the experiment and diluted, and approximately 400 cells were spread on each plate either containing or lacking the appropriate antibiotic. The yield of chlorophyll fluorescence was continuously monitored using a pulse-amplitude-modulation chlorophyll fluorometer (Walz) with a pulse-amplitude-modulation 103 accessory, a water-jacketed cuvette, and a Schott KL 1500 lamp, which provided the actinic light. The cells were diluted to a chlorophyll concentration of 2 μg ml−1 prior to analysis. The minimal fluorescence level (F0) was monitored with red-modulated light (1.6 kHz) at 0.030 μmol photon m−2 s−1. The maximum fluorescence level of dark adapted (Fm) or light-adapted (Fm ′) cells was assessed by a 600 ms high intensity white pulse at 3400 μmol photon m−2 s−1. This light pulse transiently closes all of the photosystem II reaction centers (67El Bissati K. Delphin E. Murat"

The crystal structure of N2ORs from Pseudomonas nautica(Pn) and Paracoccus denitrificans (Pd) were solved at resolutions of 2.4 and 1.6 Å, respectively. The Pn N2OR structure revealed that the catalytic CuZ center belongs to a new type of metal cluster in which four copper ions are liganded by seven histidine residues. A bridging oxygen moiety and two other hydroxide ligands were proposed to complete the ligation scheme (Brown, K., Tegoni, M., Prudencio, M., Pereira, A. S., Besson, S., Moura, J. J.

However, in the CuZ cluster, inorganic sulfur chemical determination and the high resolution structure of Pd N2OR identified a bridging inorganic sulfur instead of an oxygen.

This result reconciles the novel CuZ cluster with the hitherto puzzling spectroscopic data. nitrous oxide nitrous-oxide reductase Pseudomonas nautica Paracoccus denitrificans non-crystallographic symmetry Nitrous oxide (N2O)1 is converted to N2 by N2O reductase (N2OR) from denitrifying bacteria that use nitrogen oxides instead of oxygen as terminal electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration. N2OR is the last of the four enzymes converting NO3− to N2 (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). It is a homodimeric (2 × 65 kDa) multi-copper enzyme, in which the copper ions are organized in two centers (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar): a di-copper cluster (CuA), resembling that of cytochrome oxidase; and a second copper cluster, named CuZ, the nature of which remained obscure for several years. CuZ was thought to be dinuclear, with a coordination sphere involving cysteinyl ligands (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar, 2Farrar J.A. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9891-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This center was assigned as the catalytic site (3Farrar J.A. Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), an attribution later confirmed by analysis of an inactive mutant carrying approximately one-half the number of the copper atoms and showing only the EPR signal typical of a CuA center (4Riester J. Zumft W.G. Kroneck P.M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The exact structure of the CuZ center remained unknown, however, and its binuclear nature has been questioned because twice the number of electrons expected are needed for complete reduction (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar).The first structure of N2OR shed light on the elusive CuZ center (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Tavares P. Besson S. Cabrito I.

The structure of Pn N2OR was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the copper anomalous signal and was refined to 2.4 Å resolution (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is a dimer in the crystal, as in solution, in which each N2OR monomer is composed of two domains formed by contiguous segments in the amino acid sequence: the N-terminal domain, a β-propeller, and the C-terminal domain with a cupredoxin fold (Fig. 1). The CuZ center of N2OR comprises four copper ions arranged in a distorted tetrahedron and seven histidine residues. CuI, II, and III are ligated by two histidines, whereas CuIV is ligated by only one, thereby forming a putative substrate binding site (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Tavares P. Besson S. Cabrito I. Brown K. Samyn B.

Residual electron densities were ascribed to oxygen species; a first oxygen was proposed as bridging CuIII and CuIV, whereas two others were placed on CuI and on the catalytic CuIV, probably occupying the substrate position (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The presence and exact nature of these oxygen species could not be established for certain, however, at this medium resolution structure.The bridging ligand has recently been proposed to be an inorganic sulfur ion (7Rasmussen T. Berks B.C. Sanders-Loehr J. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12753-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which would reconcile the previous spectroscopic interpretations with the novel CuZ cluster structure. We have reinvestigated this question by three means: (i)direct observation of a sulfur atom in the 1.6 Å electron density map of the recently solved N2OR from Pd; (ii) introduction of a bridging sulfur in the Pn N2OR electron density map, followed by refinement; and (iii) direct chemical determination of the inorganic sulfur content in Pn and Pd N2ORs. These studies, reported here, confirm the presence of a bridging sulfur in the CuZ cluster.ConclusionBased on spectroscopic data (mainly magnetic circular dichroism), Farrar et al. (3Farrar J.A. Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have concluded that the properties attributed to CuZ chromophore are due to a thiolate bridged dinuclear copper center. These authors also conclude that N2OR contains three forms of copper thiolate center, CuA, CuZ, and CuZ*, each able to perform a single redox cycle (3Farrar J.A. Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman studies indicated that there is a highly covalent (Cu(II)-S-Cu(I)-S(Cys)) thiolate site on the reduced form of N2OR (17Dooley D.M. Moog R.S. Zumft W.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6730-6735Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Dooley D.M. McGuirl M.A. Rosenzweig A.C. Landin J.A. Scott R.A. Zumft W.G. Devlin F. Stephens P.J Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 3006-3011Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Pn N2OR showed there to be no cysteine thiolate ligation in the CuZ cluster, the only ligating residues being histidines (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S.

However, the high resolution Pd N2OR structure revealed that the CuZ cluster has an inorganic bridging sulfur atom instead of an oxygen as has been proposed for Pn N2OR (5Brown K. Tegoni M.

The results of inorganic sulfur titration performed on Pd and Pn N2OR were consistent with this observation. The coordinates of the revised CuZ center, issued from the Pd N2OR structure, could be successfully transplanted in the Pn enzyme model and refined, which further confirms the presence of a bridging sulfur in Pn N2OR. These observations appear to be consistent with recent results obtained with Pseudomonas stutzeri N2OR (7Rasmussen T. Berks B.C. Sanders-Loehr J. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12753-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), indicating that the presence of a bridging sulfur in the CuZ cluster might be a general feature of N2ORs. However, the consequences of the presence of an inorganic sulfur ion for the reduction mechanism of N2O remain unclear. Nitrous oxide (N2O)1 is converted to N2 by N2O reductase (N2OR) from denitrifying bacteria that use nitrogen oxides instead of oxygen as terminal electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration. N2OR is the last of the four enzymes converting NO3− to N2 (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). It is a homodimeric (2 × 65 kDa) multi-copper enzyme, in which the copper ions are organized in two centers (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar): a di-copper cluster (CuA), resembling that of cytochrome oxidase; and a second copper cluster, named CuZ, the nature of which remained obscure for several years. CuZ was thought to be dinuclear, with a coordination sphere involving cysteinyl ligands (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar, 2Farrar J.A. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9891-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This center was assigned as the catalytic site (3Farrar J.A. Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), an attribution later confirmed by analysis of an inactive mutant carrying approximately one-half the number of the copper atoms and showing only the EPR signal typical of a CuA center (4Riester J. Zumft W.G. Kroneck P.M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The exact structure of the CuZ center remained unknown, however, and its binuclear nature has been questioned because twice the number of electrons expected are needed for complete reduction (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). The first structure of N2OR shed light on the elusive CuZ center (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Tavares P. Besson S. Cabrito I.

The structure of Pn N2OR was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the copper anomalous signal and was refined to 2.4 Å resolution (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is a dimer in the crystal, as in solution, in which each N2OR monomer is composed of two domains formed by contiguous segments in the amino acid sequence: the N-terminal domain, a β-propeller, and the C-terminal domain with a cupredoxin fold (Fig. 1). The CuZ center of N2OR comprises four copper ions arranged in a distorted tetrahedron and seven histidine residues. CuI, II, and III are ligated by two histidines, whereas CuIV is ligated by only one, thereby forming a putative substrate binding site (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Tavares P. Besson S. Cabrito I. Brown K. Samyn B.

Residual electron densities were ascribed to oxygen species; a first oxygen was proposed as bridging CuIII and CuIV, whereas two others were placed on CuI and on the catalytic CuIV, probably occupying the substrate position (5Brown K. Tegoni M. Prudencio M. Pereira A.S. Besson S. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The presence and exact nature of these oxygen species could not be established for certain, however, at this medium resolution structure. The bridging ligand has recently been proposed to be an inorganic sulfur ion (7Rasmussen T. Berks B.C. Sanders-Loehr J. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12753-12756Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which would reconcile the previous spectroscopic interpretations with the novel CuZ cluster structure. We have reinvestigated this question by three means: (i)direct observation of a sulfur atom in the 1.6 Å electron density map of the recently solved N2OR from Pd; (ii) introduction of a bridging sulfur in the Pn N2OR electron density map, followed by refinement; and (iii) direct chemical determination of the inorganic sulfur content in Pn and Pd N2ORs. These studies, reported here, confirm the presence of a bridging sulfur in the CuZ cluster. ConclusionBased on spectroscopic data (mainly magnetic circular dichroism), Farrar et al. (3Farrar J.A. Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have concluded that the properties attributed to CuZ chromophore are due to a thiolate bridged dinuclear copper center. These authors also conclude that N2OR contains three forms of copper thiolate center, CuA, CuZ, and CuZ*, each able to perform a single redox cycle (3Farrar J.A. Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. Dooley D.M. Zumft W.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman studies indicated that there is a highly covalent (Cu(II)-S-Cu(I)-S(Cys)) thiolate site on the reduced form of N2OR (17Dooley D.M. Moog R.S. Zumft W.G. J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2167211051,"Here we show that exposure of aphidicolin-arrested Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to the protein-kinase inhibitors 2-aminopurine or caffeine results in initiation of replication at successively later-replicating chromosomal domains, loss of the capacity to synthesize DNA at earlier-replicating sites, release of Mcm2 proteins from chromatin, and redistribution of PCNA and RPA from early- to late-replicating domains in the absence of detectable elongation of replication forks. These results provide evidence that, under conditions of replicational stress, checkpoint controls not only prevent further initiation but may also be required to actively maintain the integrity of stalled replication complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2162725033,"In yeast, the transition between the fermentative and the oxidative metabolism, called the diauxic shift, is associated with major changes in gene expression and protein synthesis. The zinc cluster protein Cat8p is required for the derepression of nine genes under nonfermentative growth conditions (ACS1,FBP1, ICL1, IDP2, JEN1,MLS1, PCK1, SFC1, and SIP4). To investigate whether the transcriptional control mediated by Cat8p can be extended to other genes and whether this control is the main control for the changes in the synthesis of the respective proteins during the adaptation to growth on ethanol, we analyzed the transcriptome and the proteome of a cat8Δ strain during the diauxic shift. In this report, we demonstrate that, in addition to the nine genes known as Cat8p-dependent, there are 25 other genes or open reading frames whose expression at the diauxic shift is altered in the absence of Cat8p. For all of the genes characterized here, the Cat8p-dependent control results in a parallel alteration in mRNA and protein synthesis. It appears that the biochemical functions of the proteins encoded by Cat8p-dependent genes are essentially related to the first steps of ethanol utilization, the glyoxylate cycle, and gluconeogenesis.

When glucose is exhausted, a temporary arrest of growth occurs. During this phase, called the diauxic transition, cells switch from fermentative to oxidative metabolism, and major changes in gene expression are observed. Some of these alterations are due to the release of glucose repression allowing the synthesis of a set of new proteins. Numerous metabolic functions are affected by this derepression, such as gluconeogenesis, the glyoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and respiration (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Entian K.D. Schüller H.J. Zimmermann F.K. Entian K.D. Yeast Sugar Metabolism.

The changes in gene expression during growth on glucose and beyond were characterized at the level of transcriptome using DNA microarrays (5DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar). The transcript levels for more than 1700 genes were altered by a factor of at least 2. The changes in protein synthesis during the diauxic shift were also investigated. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that many proteins are affected (6Bataillé N. Régnacq M. Boucherie H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Boy-Marcotte E. Tadi D. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 1996; 141: 459-467Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These large scale analyses showed the complexity of the regulations occurring at the diauxic shift. To understand how this reprogramming takes place in the cell, the role of different transcriptional activators in the adjustment of the pattern of gene expression was investigated. The induction of several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in the respiratory chain requires the HAP activator complex (see Ref. 8De Winde J.H. Grivell L.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 51-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar for a compilation of genes). Also, among all of the proteins induced at the diauxic transition, 39 exhibited a reduced synthesis rate in a strain msn2 msn4, both genes coding for homologous transcriptional factors involved in the general stress response (9Boy-Marcotte E. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But there are still many genes whose induced expression during this shift is not controlled by the HAP complex or Msn2/4p. We have focused on the function of the transcriptional activator Cat8p. The Cat8p zinc cluster protein is essential for growth of yeast on nonfermentable carbon sources (10Hedges D. Proft M. Entian K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1915-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Both expression of CAT8gene and transcriptional activation by Cat8p are regulated by glucose and require a functional Snf1p protein kinase (11Randez-Gil F. Bojunga N. Proft M. Entian K.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At least one upstream activation sequence element, named carbon source-responsive element (CSRE)1 was found in the promoter of all the genes identified as Cat8p targets. The binding of Cat8p on a CSRE motif has been recently shown (12Rahner A. Hiesinger M. Schüller H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The requirement of Cat8p for the expression of nine genes in the absence of glucose and in the presence of nonfermentable carbon sources was demonstrated. The proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the production of acetyl-CoA from acetate (Acs1p), in gluconeogenesis and glyoxylate cycle (Pck1p, Fbp1p, Icl1p, and Mls1p), and in the import of succinate into mitochondria (Sfc1p) (10Hedges D.

Entian K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently,IDP2 and JEN1 were identified as Cat8p targets (16Bojunga N. Entian K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The protein Jen1p is required for import of lactate into the cell (17Casal M. Paiva S. Andrade R.P. Gancedo C. Leao C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2620-2623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the product of the gene IDP2 is a NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Last,SIP4 is the only gene identified as target of Cat8p whose product is a transcriptional activator that binds to the CSRE of the genes FBP1 and ICL1 (18Vincent O. Gancedo J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no phenotype was detected in a sip4Δ mutant, but overexpression of Sip4p compensates for the lack of Cat8p and restores growth on ethanol. Although Sip4p and Cat8p seem to be closely related in functions, transcription of SIP4 requires Cat8p (18Vincent O. Gancedo J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All of the Cat8p-dependent genes are highly induced in response to glucose exhaustion at the diauxic shift (5DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the importance of Cat8p in the regulation of gene expression at the diauxic shift and in the establishment of aerobic metabolism. To determine its role during this shift, we used high density DNA filters (miniarrays) to identify genes whose expression at the diauxic transition is affected by the deletion of CAT8. As a complementary approach, we undertook an analysis at the level of proteome by two-dimensional electrophoresis, which allowed us to visualize the effects of the cat8 null mutation on the expression of the final gene products. With the identification of the Cat8p-dependent genes, these two analyses provide information concerning the consequences of the transcriptional regulation by Cat8p (i.e. its repercussions on the physiological state of the cell). Here we show that Cat8p has an essential role during the adaptation of yeast on ethanol by controlling the induction of many genes in response to the glucose depletion. Knowing the functions of the proteins encoded by these genes and their relationships in a biological pathway, it appears that these controls take part essentially in the reprogramming of carbon metabolism required for growth on ethanol. The wild-type strain S. cerevisiae FY5 (MATα, mal), derived from S288C, was provided by F. Winston (Harvard Medical School). The cat8Δ deletion was constructed in the wild-type strain FY5 by replacing base pairs 36–4284 of the CAT8 gene with the kanMX4 cassette (19Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The single chromosomal integration of kanMX4 at the CAT8 locus was controlled by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analyses. The transformed strains selected were named YP1, YP2, and YP3. Cultures were performed at 22 °C in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of supplemented minimal medium YNBS (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, 25 μg/ml inositol, 85 mmsuccinate/NaOH, pH 5.8) supplemented with 24 μg/ml of tyrosine to stimulate [35S]methionine incorporation (20Miller M.J. Xuong N.H. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5222-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cultures were shaken at 360 rpm, and growth was monitored by measuring their absorbance at 600 nm (an A600 of 1 corresponds to 107 cells/ml). Glucose measurements were performed with a Sigma Diagnostic kit (catalog no. 510-A). Total RNA was extracted as described previously (21Lindquist S. Nature. 1981; 293: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). 2 μg of total RNA were added to 2 μg of oligo(dT), heat-denatured for 10 min at 70 °C, chilled on ice, and then used as template to synthesize33P-labeled cDNA. The labeling conditions were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dTTP, 1 mm dGTP, 100 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 10 mCi/ml, >2500 Ci/mmol), and 300 units of reverse transcriptase (SuperScript Rnase H− RT; Life Technologies, Inc.) in a reaction volume of 30 μl. The reaction was incubated for 3 h at 42 °C. The probe was purified by a passage through Micro Bio-Spin 30 Chromatography Column (Bio-Rad). The miniarray genomic filters (Research Genetics) used in this work were hybridized with labeled cDNA as recommended by the supplier. The filters were exposed to a phosphor screen, which was scanned with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Detection and quantification of spots were performed with ImageMaster software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two independent experiments of comparison were performed with a single set of membranes. Between hybridizations, the efficiency of stripping (95%) was checked by scanning the filters. To allow comparison between separate filter hybridizations, the intensity of each spot was normalized to the intensity of the actin spot. Normalization to the total hybridization signal gave similar results. A gene was considered as potentially Cat8p-dependent when the spot displayed at least a 2-fold difference between the mutant and the wild-type strains. 15 μg of each RNA preparation were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions (22Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nylon membranes (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization probes used were the full-length ORFs from Research Genetics or were polymerase chain reaction-amplified with appropriate primers (sequences available upon request). Hybridization signals were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and quantification was achieved with the ImageQuant software. 200 μl of culture were harvested about 15 min after total glucose depletion in the medium, and proteins were labeled in vivo during 10 min with 120 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl; ICN). Protein sample preparation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (24Boucherie H. Dujardin G. Kermorgant M. Monribot C. Slonimsky P. Perrot M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After drying, gels were exposed to phosphor screens, which were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Quantification of spots and comparative analyses were performed with the BioImage software. The intensity of each spot was normalized to the actin spot. Normalization to the global ratio of all matched spots on the gel gave similar results. Three independent two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns realized with different 35S-labeled protein extracts were analyzed for each strain. A protein was considered as potentially Cat8p-dependent when the spot displayed at least a 2-fold difference between the mutant and the wild-type strains. Significant differences were selected by using a statistical t test. Protein identification was performed by mass spectrometry. The method used was described previously (25Perrot M. Sagliocco F. Mini T. Monribot C. Schneider U. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Jenö P. Boucherie H. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 2280-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As a preliminary to our studies on the involvement of CAT8 in the adaptation of cells during the diauxic transition, it was necessary to determine accurately at which stage of the culture these investigations could be carried out. We therefore investigated the kinetic of expression of CAT8 during the diauxic growth of a wild-type strain. For this study, cells were grown in a synthetic medium containing 2% glucose as carbon source, and samples were harvested at different times of the culture for mRNA extraction. Under this culture condition, a first growth phase is observed corresponding to glucose consumption (Fig.1). Once glucose is exhausted, a transient arrest occurs, during which cells become capable of using the ethanol produced by glucose fermentation. A second growth phase is then observed corresponding to the use of ethanol. In a cat8Δ strain, this second growth phase does not occur. As shown in Fig. 1, CAT8 is not expressed during the growth phase on glucose. This is consistent with our observation that the growth rate, glucose consumption, and pattern of synthesized proteins of a cat8Δ strain are not affected before the onset of the diauxic transition (data not shown). CAT8 starts to be expressed less than 1 h before glucose is exhausted and is fully induced 15 min after glucose exhaustion. To minimize the risk of secondary effects due to the inability of the cat8Δ strain to use ethanol, we decided to carry out our investigations 25 min after glucose exhaustion. To identify all of the genes controlled by the transcriptional activator Cat8p during the diauxic transition, we compared the transcriptional patterns of a wild-type strain and of the isogenic cat8Δ strain. DNA miniarrays containing 6144 ORFs of the yeast genome were used for this study. These miniarray filters were successively hybridized with 33P-labeled cDNA probes synthesized from mRNA of the wild-type strain and of the cat8Δ strain (Fig. 2). Messenger RNA was obtained from cells grown on a synthetic medium containing 2% glucose and harvested 25 min after glucose depletion. About 3000 ORFs of the S. cerevisiae genome were expressed at a level high enough to have their transcripts detectable by this approach. All of the genes already known to be controlled by Cat8p were identified in this analysis (i.e. ACS1, FBP1, ICL1, IDP2, JEN1, MLS1, PCK1, SFC1, and SIP4) (Table I). Their transcription levels were markedly decreased in the mutant strain. Often the transcripts were barely detectable, and in no case was the decrease less than 9-fold. The fact that all of the known Cat8p-dependent genes were characterized confirms the efficiency of the approach to discover new genes controlled by Cat8p.Table ICat8p-dependent genes identified by miniarray hybridizationORFwt/cat8Δ ratio1-aThe ratios are the average of two independent experiments.

See “Results.” Open table in a new tab As expected, CAT8 mRNA was detected in wild-type cells by miniarray hybridization and was absent from cat8Δ mutant cells. In addition, 22 other genes or ORFs were observed to have reduced transcription levels in the cat8Δ strain and thus can be considered as new Cat8p-dependent genes. Nine encode proteins with unknown function. In most cases, the decrease in transcription levels of the new Cat8p-dependent genes is rather limited. The decrease factors range between 8 and 2. There are two marked exceptions with YCR010C and YPL156C. The transcription levels of these ORFs were drastically affected by the cat8 inactivation such that their transcripts were not detectable in the cat8Δ strain. Within the group of genes of unknown function, we found YAR037W and YAR040C. These ORFs were spotted on the filters but are no longer considered as true yeast ORFs. They were mapped to positions 190,417–190,998 and 191,529–191,173, respectively, on chromosome 1. These sequences are overlapping YAT1 (190,183–192,243). This gene is a good candidate for being regulated by Cat8p. A CSRE motif is present in its upstream region, and its product, a carnitine acetyltransferase, may be involved in the metabolism of acetate and ethanol (26Schmalix W. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27428-27439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation is thus that the reduced hybridization level observed for YAR037W and YAR040C was a consequence of a decrease in the level of the YAT1 transcripts in the cat8Δ strain. Although YAT1 was not identified as Cat8p target here, Northern analysis revealed a lower abundance of YAT1 transcripts in the cat8Δ cells in comparison with wild-type cells (see below and Fig. 4). Concerning this special case, the result of miniarray hybridization remains unclear. Surprisingly, one ORF, YNR002C, was found to be more expressed in the cat8Δ strain than in the wild-type strain. To analyze the incidence of the deletion of CAT8 at the proteome level, we compared the two-dimensional pattern of proteins synthesized during the diauxic transition in cat8Δ cells and in wild-type cells (Fig. 3). Cells grown on 2% glucose medium were labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine 15 min after glucose exhaustion. Thus, the cells were harvested 25 min after glucose exhaustion as for the mRNA preparations. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. After exposure to phosphor screen, individual spots were quantified and analyzed for significant changes in the rate of protein synthesis. 42 spots were observed to have a significantly reduced intensity or were not detected on the two-dimensional pattern of the cat8Δ strain. These spots are listed in TableII. 26 of them were identified spots of the yeast protein map (Ref. 25Perrot M. Sagliocco F. Mini T. Monribot C. Schneider U. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Jenö P. Boucherie H. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 2280-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and this study). They correspond to 12 different proteins. The discrepancy between the number of spots and the number of corresponding proteins results from the fact that several spots are isoforms of the same protein. Among the identified proteins, six are the products of genes already known to be controlled by Cat8p (Acs1p, Fbp1p, Icl1p, Idp2p, Mls1p, and Pck1p). The six other identified proteins are Ach1p, Adh2p, Ald6p, Cit2p, Dld1p, and Sdh1p. The demonstration that the synthesis of these proteins is Cat8p-dependent suggests that their encoding genes could be also controlled by Cat8p.Table IICat8p-dependent proteins characterized by proteome analysisSpot no.2-aSpot numbers correspond to the numbers of the unidentified proteins indicated in Fig. 3.Genewt/cat8Δ ratioProteinProtein2-bThe protein ratios were obtained from the comparison of the patterns of the wild-type (wt) strain (FY5) and of three cat8Δ strains (YP1, YP2, and YP3).

Open table in a new tab Two spots more abundant on the protein map of the cat8Δ mutant strain were also retained. One of these spots was only detectable on the map of the mutant strain (spot named Kan R). Given its apparent p I and Mr (5.1 and 27,700, respectively), it probably corresponds to the product of the Kan R gene used for the CAT8 gene replacement (calculated p I and Mr, 5.05 and 30,716, respectively). The other spot, spot 17, has a relative intensity 3-fold higher in the mutant strain. The migration of this spot on two-dimensional gel led us to think that it could be the product of YNR002C, the only gene found to be more expressed in the cat8Δ strain by our transcriptome analysis. The apparent p I and Mr of spot 17 were 4.62 and 26,700, respectively, whereas the calculated p I and Mr of Ynr002cp were 4.98 and 30,700, respectively. However, identification of this protein will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Nine genes were characterized as Cat8p-dependent genes by both the transcriptome and the proteome analyses: ACH1, ACS1, ALD6,DLD1, FBP1, ICL1, IDP2,MLS1, and PCK1. To determine whether the changes observed at the protein level in the cat8Δ strain are only a consequence of a control of Cat8p at the transcriptional level, the alterations in the levels of mRNA and in protein synthesis were compared for each of these genes (Table II). A good correlation was observed between these values. Hence, it appears that at the diauxic transition, the alteration in synthesis of these Cat8p-dependent proteins mainly reflects a change in mRNA level. In contrast, there was no correlation between mRNA levels and protein synthesis for ADH2, CIT2, and SDH1. ADH2 seemed to be Cat8p-dependent only with the proteome analysis. But ADH2 has 88% nucleotide identity with ADH1. Therefore, cross-hybridization between the radiolabeled cDNAs representing these two genes could have obscure changes in their respective expression levels in the DNA filter analysis. Using a probe specific to ADH2 in a Northern blot analysis, the transcript level of ADH2 was observed to be reduced in the cat8Δ strain (see below and Fig.4). The protein identified as Sdh1p was 3-fold less synthesized in the absence of Cat8p, but the abundance of SDH1 transcripts did not appear affected. This result led us to search for genes with sequence highly related to SDH1. YJL045W and SDH1share 76% nucleotide identity. A comparative analysis of the expression of these two homologous genes in the cat8Δ strain and in the wild-type strain was performed by Northern blot. Divergent sequences were used as probes for each of them to avoid cross-hybridization. Surprisingly, the expression of SDH1was not affected in the mutant strain, while the expression of the homologous gene, YJL045W, was reduced in absence of Cat8p (see below and Fig. 4). YJL045W may thus be considered as a new Cat8p-dependent gene. According to the predicted p I and Mr of Yjl045wp , its comigration with Sdh1p cannot be ruled out. This could explain the difference between the wild-type and the mutant strains concerning the intensity of the spot identified as Sdh1p. The gene CIT2 was not selected in the transcriptome analysis, whereas there is a 2.1-fold reduction in the synthesis of its corresponding protein in the cat8Δ strain. When the kinetic of expression of CIT2 was followed at the diauxic transition using Northern blot experiment (see below and Fig. 4), the gene was more expressed in the wild-type strain but only during a short lapse of time, in the first 30 min after glucose exhaustion. Since the samplings for the proteome and the transcriptome analyses were realized 25 min after the glucose exhaustion, a 5-min difference between the samples could explain the discrepancy in the results. Several genes have been identified as Cat8p targets by the transcriptome analysis but not by the proteome analysis. The proteins encoded by these genes are hydrophobic, or have a p I higher than 7, or are synthesized at a very low level. Protein with one of these characteristics cannot be separated or detected using standard two-dimensional electrophoresis conditions. Conversely, 17 spots corresponding to unidentified proteins were found to be Cat8p-dependent by proteome analysis. For at least half of these spots, the apparent p I and Mr of ORFs are in good agreement with the calculated p I and Mr of ORFs retained by the transcriptome analysis. A fu"

We have investigated dNTP binding to pol β-DNA complexes employing steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics. Although pol β has a kinetic scheme similar to other DNA polymerases, polymerization by pol β is limited by at least two partially rate-limiting steps: a conformational change after dNTP ground-state binding and product release. The equilibrium binding constant,K d(dNTP), decreased and the insertion efficiency increased with a one-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate, as compared with non-gapped DNA. Valine substitution for Asp276, which interacts with the base of the incoming nucleotide, increased the binding affinity for the incoming nucleotide indicating that the negative charge contributed by Asp276 weakens binding and that an interaction between residue 276 with the incoming nucleotide occurs during ground-state binding. Since the interaction between Asp276 and the nascent base pair is observed only in the “closed” conformation of pol β, the increased free energy in ground-state binding for the mutant suggests that the subsequent rate-limiting conformational change is not the “open” to “closed” structural transition, but instead is triggered in the closed pol conformation.

Many forms of endogenous base damage, including alkylation, oxidation, and deamination, result in the formation of abasic sites. In particular, normal and damaged DNA bases are lost spontaneously or removed by lesion-specific DNA glycosylases. The resulting abasic sites are repaired by the base excision repair (BER)1 pathway to prevent the accumulation of this miscoding lesion. Following base removal, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease incises the damaged strand 5′ to the abasic site, leaving a single-nucleotide gap with a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) flap. The gap is then processed by DNA polymerase (pol) β to create nicked DNA that will be ligated by DNA ligase I or III. DNA polymerase β possesses both the nucleotidyltransferase activity to fill the one-nucleotide gap and lyase activity required to remove the dRP flap. The central role of pol β in BER has been established (1Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H.

DNA polymerase β is an attractive model to study polymerase mechanisms employed to assure efficient and faithful DNA synthesis. Its small size and lack of accessory proteins has facilitated its biochemical, kinetic, and structural characterization. Although pol β appears to have evolved separately from other classes of DNA/RNA polymerases of known structure (5Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it shares many general structural and mechanistic features. Each of the polymerases possesses a groove along a broad face of the enzyme where nucleic acid binds. The polymerase domain of these enzymes has been likened to a right hand and is composed of finger, palm, and thumb subdomains (6Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Polymerases have at least two acidic residues in the palm subdomain that bind catalytically essential metals.

Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) indicate that the reactive groups (i.e. metals, dNTP, and template-primer) have a similar three-dimensional arrangement. These structures are consistent with a “two metal ion” mechanism for nucleotidyl transfer (12Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Joyce C.M. Science. 1994; 266: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In general, pol β also utilizes a similar kinetic mechanism as most other DNA polymerases. Steady-state kinetic analyses indicate that pol β follows an ordered addition of substrates (13Tanabe K. Bohn E.W. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Employing pre-steady-state kinetics, it has been shown that Escherichia coli Klenow fragment (14Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) utilize a two-step nucleotide binding mechanism. Initial dNTP binding to a pol-DNA complex places the nucleotide within the active site. A subsequent conformational change results in the alignment of the catalytic atoms and rapid chemistry. Binding of the correct nucleotide facilitates this conformational change, whereas binding of the incorrect nucleotide does not. This “induced-fit” mechanism is consistent with the numerous structural differences that are observed upon binding of a correct nucleotide (8Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In particular, the carboxyl-terminal subdomain (residues 262–335) is observed to reposition itself after binding a correct dNTP by rotation about an axis, α-helix M, that positions α-helix N so that several side chains can interact with the nascent base pair in this “closed” conformation. Replicative DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases often have an intrinsically associated exonuclease or endonuclease activity that complements their fundamental nucleotidyltransferase function. DNA polymerase β also has an associated accessory activity that complements its DNA synthesis step in BER. Mild proteolysis of pol β separates a 31-kDa fragment, which possesses the nucleotidyltransferase activity, from an amino-terminal 8-kDa fragment (20Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This smaller domain binds strongly to 5′-phosphate groups in gapped DNA (21Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and possesses the dRP lyase activity that is needed for removal of the dRP flap remaining after AP endonuclease cleavage of the abasic site intermediate in BER (22Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the absence of a downstream DNA strand (i.e. no DNA gap), a crystal structure of a pol β-DNA-ddNTP complex revealed that the 8-kDa domain does not interact with the DNA or the 31-kDa domain, but instead is positioned some distance from the 31-kDa domain (Fig.1 A). The crystal structure of pol β bound to one-nucleotide gapped DNA demonstrates that the 8-kDa domain binds to the 5′-phosphate in the DNA gap and interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the 31-kDa domain (Fig. 1 A) (8Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). This results in a more compact, doughnut-shaped structure forming a channel with dimensions appropriate for dNTP diffusion (Fig. 1 B) (24Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this conformation of the 8-kDa domain is potentially significant due to its proximity to the nucleotide binding pocket of pol β. The experiments described here were performed to examine nucleotide binding to pol β and to ascertain the influence of a gapped DNA structure. Additionally, the role of Asp276 and α-helix N in dNTP binding was investigated by comparing the effect of valine substitution for Asp276 on nucleotide binding with alternate DNA substrates. Asp276 is observed to form van der Waals contact with the base of the incoming nucleotide triphosphate in the closed pol β ternary substrate complex. Employing steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics, we examine nucleotide binding to pol β. The results indicate that residue 276 interactions with the incoming nucleotide influence ground-state nucleotide binding during template base recognition. The implication is that α-helix N and Asp276 influence ground-state binding in the closed conformation that occurs prior to the rate-limiting conformational change and that subdomain closure is very rapid and not rate-limiting. Ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-thio]dCTP, and MicroSpin G-25 columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DE-81 filters were from Whatman. A 34-mer oligonucleotide substrate containing a single nucleotide gap was prepared by annealing three gel-purified oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) to create a gap at position 16. Each oligonucleotide was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA, and the concentration determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. The annealing reactions were carried out by incubating a solution of 10 μm primer with 11 μm each of downstream and template oligonucleotides at 90 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The sequence of the gapped DNA substrate was as follows: primer, 5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGC-3′; downstream oligonucleotide, 5′-GTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′; template, 3′-GACGTCGACTACGCGGCATGCCTAGGGGCCCATG-5′. The upstream primer in each case was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity = 6.6 × 106 dpm/pmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and contaminating radioactive ATP was removed with a MicroSpin G-25 column. The downstream primer was synthesized with a 5′-phosphate. A non-gapped DNA substrate was prepared by omitting the downstream oligonucleotide. A nicked substrate was prepared by annealing a 16-mer primer, where the 15-mer primer had a dCMP added to the 3′-end, and downstream oligonucleotide with template as described above. Human recombinant pol β (wild type and D276V) was overexpressed inEscherichia coli cells and purified as described (25Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21,200 cm−1m−1 (26Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Rapid-quench assays were performed at 37 °C using a KinTek Model RQF-3 rapid-quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Unless noted otherwise, all concentrations refer to the final concentration after mixing. The final reaction mixture typically consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm MgCl2. The final concentration of enzyme and substrates are given in the text or figure legends. Enzyme and substrate DNA were preincubated for 1 min and rapidly mixed with dCTP and MgCl2 to initiate each reaction. After various time periods, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.25m EDTA. The quenched samples were mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye and the products separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to quantify product formation. Steady-state time courses were measured by manual mixing and quenching at 37 °C to determine steady-state constants (i.e. apparent k cat and K m). Following the appropriate incubation period, individual reactions were quenched with EDTA and the quenched reaction mixtures were applied to DEAE cellulose filters (DE-81). The unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP was removed, and radioactive nucleotide incorporation was quantified as described previously (27Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A nicked DNA substrate (300 nm) was preincubated with 1 nm pol β in reaction buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 mm pyrophosphate and 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was quenched at various time periods with EDTA. Time courses were fitted to appropriate equations by nonlinear least squares methods. These equations are described under “Results.” Progress curves were also fitted to kinetic models with KinTekSim, which is based on the programs KINSIM (28Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and FITSIM (29Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The efficiency of correct nucleotide (i.e. dCTP) incorporation by pol β was dependent on the nature of the template-primer (Table I). DNA polymerase β catalyzed single-nucleotide gap filling at a steady-state rate of 0.8 s−1. A similar rate of polymerization was observed when pol β was bound to non-gapped DNA (i.e. the downstream oligonucleotide was omitted from the annealing reaction). In contrast, the dCTP concentration dependence of DNA synthesis indicated that K m(dCTP)with a single nucleotide gap DNA substrate was 12-fold lower than for a substrate without a gap (Table I), suggesting that the enzyme might possibly have a higher affinity for nucleotide when bound to gapped DNA. As a result of the lower K m, catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m(dCTP)) was over an order of magnitude greater for the gapped DNA substrate assayed under steady-state conditions than for the non-gapped DNA substrate.Table ISteady-state kinetic constants for wild-type pol β-DNA complexesDNA1-aThe gapped DNA substrate contains a one-nucleotide gap and was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.”k catK m(dCTP)k cat/K ms−1μm(s · μm)−1Non-gapped0.7 ± 0.12.36 ± 0.750.30 ± 0.11Gapped0.8 ± 0.10.18 ± 0.024.44 ± 0.75Gapped and non-gapped DNAs (300 nm) were preincubated with 1 nm pol β prior to addition of dCTP.

Initial velocity data were fitted to the Michaelis equation by nonlinear least squares methods. Since steady-state kinetic parameters are often the composite of several rate constants, we sought to determine the equilibrium constant (K d) for nucleotide binding to pol β-DNA. Using rapid-mixing and quenching techniques, we measured pre-steady-state product formation. When a high concentration of pol β is preincubated with excess single-nucleotide gapped DNA (DNA/enzyme = 3) and rapidly mixed with a high concentration of the complementary nucleoside triphosphate (i.e. dCTP) and Mg2+, product formation is biphasic. A rapid burst of product formation precedes a slower apparent linear rate (Fig. 2, dashed line). The biphasic nature of the time course indicates that a step following chemistry is rate-limiting during steady-state catalysis. The slow step has been attributed to dissociation of the extended pol-DNA complex (19Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The rates of product formation observed in Fig. 2 indicate that in contrast to processive replicative polymerases, k pol is not considerably greater than k off(DNA+1) for pol β. Scheme I describes the basic kinetic mechanism for single-nucleotide incorporation utilized by all DNA polymerases that have been examined. Following an ordered binding of substrate DNA and dNTP, a conformational change (k pol) precedes rapid chemistry (see below). Pyrophosphate release is rapid, but dissociation of the extended product DNA is usually slow and at least partially rate-limiting.Pol+DNA⇄koff(DNA)konPolDNA+dNTP⇄KdPolDNAdNTP→kpolPPi+PolDNA+1⇄konkoff(DNA+1)Pol+DNA+1SCHEMEISince dNTP binding is in rapid equilibrium,k pol is dependent on dNTP concentration and is given by Equation 1.kobs=kpol[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])Equation 1 Fitting the time course in Fig. 2 to an equation with rising exponential and linear terms, as shown by Equation 2,Product=A{1−e−kobst}+vsst,Equation 2 results in a burst rate constant (k obs) of 12.3 s−1 and an apparent linear rate (v ss) of 120 nm/s (dashed line). With this analysis, the burst amplitude (A) represents the “apparent” active concentration of enzyme (A = 40 nm) so thatk ss(v ss/polactive) would be 3.0 s−1. Yet, since k obs is similar to k ss for pol β, this analysis is not satisfactory and inappropriate. According to Scheme I, pol β will cycle quickly (k pol is similar tok off(DNA+1)), so that the burst amplitude is an underestimate of the active enzyme concentration. The amplitude is given by Equation 3 (30Wharton C.W. Eisenthal R. Molecular Enzymology. Blackie, London1981: 204-219Crossref Google Scholar).[pol­DNA][kpol/(kpol+koff(DNA+1))]2Equation 3 Thus, even when k pol is 1 order of magnitude greater than k off(DNA+1), the burst amplitude is still only 83% of the true active fraction of enzyme. The apparently linear portion of the time course also suffers from the high concentration of free product DNA (DNA+1) that is accumulating after the first turnover, therefore competing with extendable substrate DNA (i.e. product inhibition). Correct analysis of the time course in Fig. 2 requires a model that takes into account product competition. Assuming rapid ligand binding and an “active” enzyme concentration of 70%, the data in Fig. 2 were fitted to the model outlined in Scheme I to estimatek pol and k off(DNA+1)(solid line). The fitted values fork pol (7.7 ± 0.5 s−1) and k off(DNA+1)(2.8 ± 0.2 s−1) are similar to the values determined independently below. To eliminate interference of enzyme cycling in determining the equilibrium nucleotide dissociation constant, an excess of enzyme was preincubated with DNA (enzyme/DNA = 5). Under this condition, nearly all of the substrate DNA is bound to enzyme so that, upon addition of dCTP/Mg2+, dNTP binding and incorporation limit catalysis. Under these single-turnover conditions, the first-order time courses were dependent on the concentration of dCTP (Fig. 3). A secondary plot indicated that the apparent first-order rate constants can be fitted to Equation 1with a K d and k pol of 5.6 μm and 10.0 s−1, respectively (Fig. 3 B and Table II). Interestingly, however, the amplitude of the fast exponential phase was only 50% (i.e. 50 nm) of that expected. Extended incubation of the pol with substrates demonstrated that greater than 90% of the primer could be extended (data not shown). This result suggested that pol β can bind to the template-primer in a catalytically nonproductive mode. This nonproductive binding form competes with the excess free enzyme for productive DNA binding resulting in a biphasic time course. To determine whether enzyme that bound DNA nonproductively can isomerize to form productive enzyme-bound DNA or must dissociate from DNA to allow enzyme the opportunity to bind productively, we added excess unlabeled DNA (5 μm) with 50 μm dCTP to pol β (300 nm) preincubated with 100 nm 5′-labeled DNA. The unlabeled DNA binds free enzyme and enzyme that dissociates from the radioactively labeled DNA to eliminate enzyme cycling. The excess non-radioactively labeled DNA trap had no effect on the amplitude or rate of the rapid or slow phases (data not shown), indicating that for the wild-type enzyme that the nonproductive DNA binding form can isomerize to the productive form without dissociating from the DNA.Table IIEquilibrium nucleotide binding affinities for wild-type and D276V pol βEnzymeDNA2-aThe gapped DNA substrate has a one-nucleotide gap and was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.”k polK d(dCTP)k pol/K ds−1μm(s · μm)−1Wild-typeNon-gapped5.1 ± 0.222.0 ± 3.60.23 ± 0.04Wild-typeGapped10.0 ± 0.85.6 ± 2.01.79 ± 0.65D276VNon-gapped3.2 ± 0.26.1 ± 1.30.52 ± 0.11D276VGapped6.3 ± 0.90.6 ± 0.310.5 ± 5.5The equilibrium binding affinity (K d) of pol β-DNA complexes with dCTP was measured by single-turnover analysis as described under “Results.”2-a The gapped DNA substrate has a one-nucleotide gap and was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The equilibrium binding affinity (K d) of pol β-DNA complexes with dCTP was measured by single-turnover analysis as described under “Results.” To ascertain whether dNTP incorporation during these single-turnover conditions is limited by chemistry, the rate constant for the incorporation of the α-thio-substituted analogue of dCTP was determined. Due to the lower electronegativity of sulfur relative to oxygen, a significant decrease in rate upon sulfur substitution would suggest that chemistry is rate-limiting. Model studies with phosphate triesters indicate a large elemental effect upon substitution of sulfur at a nonesterified position, whereas studies with phosphate diesters indicate smaller decreases in rate upon sulfur substitution (see Ref.31Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for discussion). From the dCTPαS concentration dependence of the rate of incorporation, the affinity (K d) and rate constant for incorporation of the analogue were 9.8 μmand 4.7 s−1, respectively (data not shown). Thus, the thioelemental effect observed for pol β is only 2.1, suggesting that a step other than chemistry is rate-limiting. Steady-state kinetic characterization of mouse pol β failed to demonstrate a reversal of the polymerization reaction (i.e. pyrophosphorolysis) in the presence of PPi with activated DNA. Nonetheless, PPi was inhibitory for DNA synthesis (13Tanabe K. Bohn E.W. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To ascertain the possible significance of pyrophosphorolysis on single-nucleotide gap filling DNA synthesis, nicked DNA was used as a substrate to measure the magnitude of the reverse reaction. The substrate was identical to that used in the one-nucleotide gap filling reaction except that the primer was one nucleotide longer (i.e. +dCMP). Pyrophosphorolysis was initiated by the addition of excess PPi (3 mm) and MgCl2 to pol β preincubated with DNA. The steady-state removal of dCMP to create a one-nucleotide gap occurred with an apparent rate constant of 0.01 s−1 (data not shown). The biphasic time course observed when DNA/pol > 1 (Fig. 2) indicates formation of a “stable” pol-DNA complex. Whenk pol ≫ k off(DNA+1), the amplitude of the rapid (burst) phase is equal to the active-enzyme concentration, but in the case of pol β is only proportional to the concentration of pol-DNA complex, as discussed above (see Equation 3). To determine the equilibrium binding affinity of pol β for the gapped DNA substrate, a fixed concentration of pol β (polt= 100 nm) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of substrate DNA (DNAt = 25–200 nm). The concentration of pol-DNA complex was estimated by rapidly mixing an excess of dCTP (50 μm) and measuring the time course of single-nucleotide incorporation. The time courses were biphasic and the amplitude of the burst phase increased as a function of increasing DNA concentration. The DNA concentration dependence of the burst amplitude is illustrated in Fig. 4and fitted to the quadratic equation (Equation 4). [pol­DNA]=0.5(Kd+polt+DNAt)−[0.25(Kd+polt+DNAt)2Equation 4 −(poltDNAt)]0.5The K d and maximum burst amplitude were 22 and 70 nm, respectively. From Equation 3 andk pol (Fig. 3 B and Table II), the maximum burst amplitude can be used to calculatek off(DNA+1). This results in a dissociation rate constant of 1.9 s−1 and in turn can be used to estimate an association rate constant of 8.6 × 107m−1 s−1(K d =k off/k on). As shown in TableI, pol β fills single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrates nearly 15 times more efficiently than non-gapped substrates under steady-state conditions. To determine if the binding affinity of the incoming nucleotide (i.e. K d(dCTP)) is influenced by the single-nucleotide gap, single-turnover analysis (pol/DNA = 5) was employed to quantify nucleotide binding to a non-gapped DNA substrate (the downstream primer was omitted). Using this non-gapped DNA substrate, pol β was found to bind and incorporate dCTP with K d of 22 μm andk pol of 5 s−1 (TableII). This represents a 4-fold decrease in binding affinity as compared with a gapped DNA complex and an 8-fold decrease in insertion efficiency. The structure of the pol β-DNA-ddCTP complex reveals that there are van der Waals interactions between the base moiety of the incoming nucleotide and the Cβ of Asp276, Fig. 5 (7Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 8Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analysis and cross-linking studies previously suggested that removal of the electronegative side chain by valine or glycine substitution resulted in an apparent increase in binding affinity (32Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Beard W.A. Safronov I.V. Dobrikov M.I. Srivastava D.K. Shishkin G.V. Wood T.G. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

To determine whether the binding affinity for the incoming nucleotide is altered by removing the negative charge, but retaining van der Waals interactions, the K d(dCTP) was determined for the D276V mutant. Single-turnover analysis employing both non-gapped and gapped DNA substrates indicated that the K d for the incoming nucleoside triphosphate decreased 3.6- and 9-fold, respectively, as compared with wild-type enzyme (Table II). Thus, the binding affinity for the incoming nucleotide is increased near"

The three major subgroups based on sequence similarity are the TGF-βs, activins and inhibins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; Ref. 1Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Signaling by TGF-β and related ligands uses two types of receptors, type I and type II transmembrane serine-threonine kinases. Ligand binding results in the formation of heteromeric receptor complexes, in which type II receptors phosphorylate type I receptors (1Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Downstream signal transduction events are mediated by the intracellular Smad proteins. One class, the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), are directly phosphorylated by activated type I receptors on a C-terminal SS XS motif. Upon phosphorylation, R-Smads form complexes with the co-Smad, Smad4 and then translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. Biochemical and biological studies have established that the R-Smads used by TGF-β and activin signaling, Smad2 and Smad3, are distinct from those used by BMP signaling, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (1Massagué J.

One difference between nodal and activin signaling has been described in zebrafish. There is genetic evidence that the extracellular epidermal growth factor-Cripto, FRL1, Cryptic (EGF-CFC) protein one-eyed pinhead is required for signaling by zebrafish nodal-related factors but not for activin signaling (18Gritsman K.

Earlier studies on nodal function relied on overexpression from transfected or injected expression vectors. Here we describe the production of recombinant nodal protein. The availability of purified nodal protein allows functional characterization of this developmentally important pathway not previously possible. We describe a quantitative assessment of nodal signaling activity in P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, a model system for the early mouse embryo (25McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar). We have determined that P19 cells are competent to respond to nodal signaling and have exploited this capacity and the availability of recombinant nodal protein to investigate the intracellular pathway by which the nodal signal is transduced. In this study we provide direct evidence that nodal signals through activin-TGF-β pathway-specific Smads but not BMP pathway-specific Smads. In addition, we show that nodal activity depends on the expression of cripto, suggesting a general requirement for EGF-CFC function in vertebrate nodal signaling. The mature region of human nodal protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded essentially as described (26Schlunegger M.P. Cerletti N. Cox D.A. McMaster G.K. Schmitz A. Grutter M.G.

Serum was pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal as described (29Germain P. Harbrioux G. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1581-1585PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were passaged at confluency (approximately every third day) at a ratio of 1:4. HepG2 human hepatoma cells were grown as monolayer cultures in low-glucose Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS. Cultures were passaged at confluency (approximately twice weekly) at a ratio of 1:10 using trypsin-EDTA. The luciferase reporter plasmids p(SBE)4 and p(CAGA)12 were described earlier (30Jonk L.J.

Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1887PubMed Google Scholar). The pGL3 basic and pGL3 promoter vectors were obtained from Promega. The pCDNA3 expression vector was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The β-galactosidase reporter pRSV-β-galactosidase was provided by P. Yen (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health). A HindIII-NotI fragment containing the full-length cripto cDNA (a gift from M. Shen) was subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector for expression. The day before transfection, P19 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 50,000 cells/well in 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 7.5% FBS and were typically 50–60% confluent at the time of transfection. Plasmid DNA (typically 0.5 μg of total including 0.25 μg of luciferase reporter and 5 ng of pRSV-β-galactosidase) was mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies) in 25 μl of DMEM and incubated at room temperature. After 15 min, 25 μl of media containing 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE was added and incubated for another 30 min. Cells were washed once with DMEM (without FBS), and 200 μl of DMEM was added to each well. 50 μl of the transfection mixture was added to each well, and after 2 h, another 250 μl of DMEM containing 15% FBS was added to each well and incubated overnight (14–18 h). The next day, cells were washed once with DMEM, and fresh media were added. After overnight incubation, media were replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without factors (activin, BMPs, TGF-β, or nodal) as indicated. The cells were harvested for luciferase assay after 16–20 h of incubation. Similar starting cell numbers and transfection conditions were used for HepG2 cells. Transfections were carried out with 0.5 μg of total DNA (0.25 μg of reporter and 0.25 μg of cripto expression vector). In control reactions, 0.25 μg of pCDNA3.0 was used instead of cripto. HepG2 cells were treated with the same concentrations of ligands as described for P19 cells. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured using the Dual light chemiluminescent reporter gene assay kit (Tropix; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as specified by the manufacturer, in an EG&G Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. Briefly, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. After addition of 120 μl of lysis buffer, cells were scraped and centrifuged (4 °C, 12,000 ×g, 5 min). 10 μl of the supernatant was added to 25 μl of buffer A, followed by 100 μl of buffer B. After a delay of 2 s, the luciferase signal was measured for 5 s. β-Galactosidase activity was measured 60 min after measuring luciferase activity. All assays were performed in duplicate. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. P19 cells were plated in six-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) in 2 ml of media on day 0. On day 2, media were removed and replaced with DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h. Nodal, activin, or BMP was then added in 0.1% bovine serum albumin for varying times. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of 1× gel-loading dye was added to each well. Cell lysates were collected, sonicated for 15 s, and heated for 3 min at 95 °C. Samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10–20% gradient acrylamide gel. Transfer to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and processing were as described previously (34Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15742-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2240-2248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were incubated in TNT 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) with 5% w/v nonfat dried milk for 1 h, washed in TNT 20 (3–5 min), and incubated with primary antibody (1:1000) in TNT 20 containing 1% milk. This was done for 1 h at room temperature for non-phospho-specific antibodies and overnight at 4 °C for phospho-specific antibodies. After further washing in TNT 20, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG secondary antibody (Pierce; 1:5000), and immunoreactive proteins were detected using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Unpublished work from our laboratory has shown that P19 embryonal carcinoma cells stably transfected with a nodal expression vector can differentiate into mesoderm without chemical induction. 2V. Novoselov and M. R. Kuehn, unpublished data. These results suggested that P19 cells are responsive to nodal and may provide an appropriate model system to study nodal function in the early mouse embryo. To confirm these results and establish a reporter assay to dissect the nodal signaling pathway, we carried out transient transfection of undifferentiated P19 cells using the p(SBE)4 luciferase reporter. p(SBE)4 has been shown to be a general reporter for the TGF-β superfamily in HepG2 cells, responding to TGF-β itself, activin, and BMP2 (30Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was a good candidate reporter to confirm nodal signaling in P19 cells without knowing any details of the pathway. We first determined that p(SBE)4 is induced by TGF-β, activin, and BMP2 in P19 cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, activin (20 ng/ml), BMP4 (40 ng/ml), and TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) increased p(SBE)4reporter activity by 9 ± 1.8-, 4 ± 2.3-, and 3 ± 0.4-fold (mean ± S.D.), respectively. These results established that p(SBE)4 is a general reporter for both TGF-β-activin and BMP pathway-specific R-Smad activation in P19 cells, as in HepG2 cells. To analyze nodal signaling, we used recombinant human nodal protein, produced in bacteria and refolded in vitro. Nodal protein activity was assayed using Xenopus embryo explants. Animal caps treated with nodal protein (at 5 μg/ml) or activin (at 2.5 or 25 ng/ml) underwent elongations characteristic of mesoderm formation (data not shown), confirming the bioactivity of the recombinant protein preparation. We then evaluated p(SBE)4 activation by recombinant nodal treatment of P19 cells. As shown in Fig.1 B, nodal induced p(SBE)4 reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner with a 14-fold increase at 4 μg/ml. These studies confirmed that P19 cells are competent to respond to nodal and provide an experimental system for defining the intracellular signaling pathway. In further studies, we used 2 μg/ml nodal, because this amount still gave a significant level of induction within the range of activation induced by the other ligands. The specific activity of recombinant nodal protein was low compared with the other ligands tested, perhaps because of a significant amount of inactive protein in the high-performance liquid chromatography-purified fraction. The requirement of using such large amounts of nodal protein raised the question of specificity: is the signaling truly representative of endogenous nodal signaling, or is it caused by low-affinity binding to nonphysiological receptors? To address this question, we analyzed nodal signaling in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, activin, BMP4, and TGF-β induced p(SBE)4 activity in transfected HepG2 cells by 8.5 ± 1.4-, 8.8 ± 1.4-, and 5.8 ± 0.1-fold, respectively. However, we saw no activation of p(SBE)4 by nodal at 2 μg/ml, the same amount that gave a significant level of induction in P19 cells. This result indicated that our preparation of recombinant nodal protein, even at this concentration, does not cross-react with the TGF-β, activin, and BMP receptors clearly present on HepG2 cells. The nonresponsiveness of HepG2 cells to nodal treatment indicates these cells lack a component specific to the nodal signaling pathway. Based on results in zebrafish suggesting that nodal signaling requires EGF-CFC function (18Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and unpublished data showing that HepG2 cells lack expression of full-length cripto, 3D. Salomon, personal communication. we asked whether transfection of a cripto expression vector could rescue nodal signaling in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, nodal treatment of HepG2 cells expressing cripto led to a significant increase in p(SBE)4 reporter activity (4.92 ± 0.95-fold) compared with controls. This result provides further support that the recombinant protein is acting physiologically and suggests that EGF-CFC activity is a general requirement for vertebrate nodal signaling. To determine whether intracellular nodal signals are mediated through the TGF-β-activin or BMP pathway, or both, we used two reporters that differentiate between these pathways. pAR3-lux contains an activin response element from the Xenopus Mix.2 gene and is activin and TGF-β inducible in Xenopus embryos (36Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and in HepG2 cells (32Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The pTlx2-lux reporter contains a BMP-responsive element and is BMP2, BMP7, and Smad1 inducible in P19 cells (33Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. McInnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M. Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1887PubMed Google Scholar, 37Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). pTlx2-lux has also been shown to be induced by constitutively active forms of the BMP-specific type I receptors activin receptor-like kinase 2 and activin receptor-like kinase 6 but not by a constitutively active activin receptor-like kinase 4 receptor, an activin-specific type I receptor (37Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected P19 cells with pAR3-lux and pTlx2-lux reporters and treated them with nodal (2 μg/ml), activin (20 ng/ml), BMP4 (40 ng/ml), and BMP6 (40 ng/ml). As shown in Fig.3 A, activin treatment of cells transiently transfected with pAR3-lux resulted in a 4.8 ± 0.9-fold induction of luciferase activity, consistent with previous reports (37Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with nodal, pAR3-lux activation increased by 3 ± 0.4-fold. Neither BMP4 nor BMP6 had any significant effect on the activity of pAR3-lux. As shown in Fig.3 B, BMP4 and BMP6 induced pTlx2-lux by 1.8 ± 0.12- and 2.2 ± 0.26-fold, respectively. As expected, we did not see any induction by activin. Nodal also had no detectable effect on the Tlx2 promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that nodal uses only the TGF-β-activin signaling pathway in P19 cells. The response of the activin response element to activin and TGF-β treatment was previously shown to be mediated by either Smad2 or Smad3 (38Weisberg E. Winnier G.E. Chen X. Farnsworth C.L. Hogan B.L. Whitman M. Mech. Dev. 1998; 79: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 40Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether nodal signals through Smad2 or Smad3, or both, in P19 cells, we first used the p(CAGA)12 luciferase reporter. This reporter is activated only in response to activin and TGF-β signaling and only through Smad3 and not Smad2 in HepG2 and Mv1Lu cells (31Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, activin and TGF-β induced p(CAGA)12 by 9.4 ± 3.1- and 6.5 ± 3.1-fold respectively in P19 cells, whereas BMP4 had no significant effect. Treatment with nodal led to a 6.2 ± 1.5-fold increase in p(CAGA)12 activity. These results indicate that Smad3 can mediate nodal signaling in P19 cells. To determine the involvement of Smad2 in nodal signaling, we first used a dominant negative approach. Previous work has shown that C-terminal serines in Smad2 are phosphorylated by the TGF-β receptor, and mutating these serines to alanines prevents Smad2 phosphorylation and its nuclear accumulation (41Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These mutant forms of Smad2 can still associate with the receptor, however, and can act as dominant negatives. We used the dominant negative Smad2 (3S-A) to test whether it affected nodal-mediated p(SBE)4 activation. P19 cells were transfected with p(SBE)4 either alone or together with Smad2 (3S-A), and luciferase activity was measured after treatment with nodal or activin. The results are shown in Fig.5 A. In the absence of Smad2 (3S-A), p(SBE)4 activity was increased 6- and 9-fold by nodal and activin, respectively, which was taken as 100% activity. In the presence of Smad2 (3S-A), we observed only 3.96- and 6.75-fold induction by nodal and activin, respectively, a 34 and 25% reduction. We repeated these experiments using the activin- and TGF-β-specific reporter pAR3-lux. As shown in Fig. 5 B, expression of the dominant negative Smad2 led to a 40% reduction of nodal-induced pAR3-lux activity. These results indicate that nodal also can use Smad2 for intracellular signaling in P19 cells. As a second approach to determine Smad2 involvement in nodal signaling, we examined Smad2 phosphorylation after nodal treatment of P19 cells. These studies used antisera specific for the C-terminal phosphorylated form of Smad2. These antibodies do not recognize the unphosphorylated (nonactivated) forms of these Smads. P19 cells were treated with nodal (2 μg/ml), activin (20 ng/ml), or BMP4 (40 ng/ml) for various times, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.6 A, nodal activated Smad2 within 15 min, and phosphorylation was found for at least 4 h before returning to basal levels by 24 h. Activin treatment also led to Smad2 phosphorylation in P19 cells. However, peak levels for activin stimulation were seen at 1 h with a return to basal level by 4 h. To confirm that nodal signaling does not go through BMP R-Smads, we used antisera specific for the C-terminal phosphorylated forms of Smads 1, 5, and 8. As shown in Fig. 6 B, BMP4 treatment led to rapid phosphorylation of these BMP R-Smads, which returned to basal levels by 24 h. However, treatment with nodal had no effect. These results provide direct evidence that nodal signals through Smad2 and conclusively show that BMP R-Smads are not used. We have obtained several lines of evidence indicating that nodal activity in P19 cells is regulated through the activin-TGF-β pathway mediated by Smad2 and Smad3 and not through BMP-regulated Smads. First, nodal induces pAR3-lux, which was previously shown to be specifically responsive to TGF-β and activin (37Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Nodal does not activate pTlx2-lux, which has been shown to be strictly BMP inducible (33Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. McInnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M. Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1887PubMed Google Scholar, 37Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Second, nodal activates the p(CAGA)12 reporter, which was previously shown to be activated specifically by Smad3 (31Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Third, nodal activation of either p(SBE)4 or pAR3-lux is reduced significantly by expression of a dominant negative form of Smad2. Fourth, nodal treatment of P19 cells rapidly induces the phosphorylation of Smad2 but not BMP R-Smads. The involvement of Smad2 in nodal signaling in P19 cells suggests that a similar pathway exists in the intact embryo. Several different targeted mutations of Smad2 in the mouse germ line have been reported (5Waldrip W.R. Bikoff E.K. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Robertson E.J.

A. 1998; 95: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) have described gastrulation defects similar to those of the nodal null mutant, which lacks mesoderm formation (11Iannaccone P.M. Zhou X. Khokha M. Boucher D. Kuehn M.R. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Conlon F.L. Lyons K.M. Takaesu N. Barth K.S. Kispert A. Herrmann B. Robertson E.J.

The similarity of these phenotypes is consistent with nodal signaling using Smad2 in the gastrulating embryo. Nomura and Li (7Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) also reported that embryos heterozygous for both the Smad2 and nodal mutations have phenotypic defects in left-right axis development and anterior patterning. Heyer et al. (8Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Lia M. Boettinger E. Edelmann W. Stewart C.L. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported similar phenotypes in Smad2 mutant embryos rescued through gastrulation. These latter phenotypes are similar to that produced by a hypomorphic nodal mutation, 4L. A. Lowe, S. Yamada, and M. R. Kuehn, submitted for publication. indicating that nodal signaling uses Smad2 in developmental processes other than mesoderm formation. However, the Smad2 knockouts reported by Waldrip et al. (5Waldrip W.R. Bikoff E.K. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Robertson E.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and Heyer et al. (8Heyer J.

A. 1999; 96: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) showed transient mesoderm formation, complicating the conclusion that nodal uses Smad2 in the induction of mesoderm in the embryo. Our conclusive demonstration that nodal signals through Smad2 in P19 cells will aid in the interpretation of these different Smad2 knockout phenotypes. We have shown that nodal signaling also can use Smad3 in P19 cells. However, targeted mutation of Smad3 in the mouse does not lead to early developmental defects (43Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 44Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Smad3 is not involved in nodal signaling in the embryo or that Smad2 can compensate for the loss of Smad3. Interestingly, embryos heterozygous for both Smad2 and Smad3 can display left-right abnormalities. 5M. Weinstein and C. X. Deng, personal communication. This finding suggests that nodal signaling may indeed involve both Smad2 and Smad3 in the embryo. Although we show here that nodal uses an activin-like intracellular signaling pathway, we have also found some major differences between nodal and activin signaling. We have found that human HepG2 cells are not responsive to human nodal protein unless transfected with an expression vector encoding the extracellular EGF-CFC protein cripto. Previous genetic studies demonstrated a requirement for the zebrafish EGF-CFC protein one-eyed pinhead in nodal-related signaling in the zebrafish but not for activin signaling (18Gritsman K. Zhang J. Cheng S. Heckscher E. Talbot W.S. Schier A.F. Cell. 1999; 97: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that injection of a mouse nodal expression vector into Xenopus embryos resulted in induction of a luciferase reporter carrying an enhancer element from the nodal gene, but at a significantly lower level than that obtained with an activin expression vector. However, co-injection of nodal and cripto expression vectors led to similarly high levels as with the activin expression vector (46Saijoh Y. Adachi H. Sakuma R. Yeo C.Y. Yashiro K. Watanabe M. Hashiguchi H. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Whitman M. Hamada H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that there is a general requirement for EGF-CFC protein function in vertebrate nodal signaling. Another difference between activin and nodal signaling is in the persistence of Smad2 phosphorylation occurring in response to these two factors. We found that during continuous activin treatment of P19 cells the levels of activated Smad2 peaked at 1 h and then declined. This is similar to what was found for Smad2 activated by continuous TGF-β treatment of HaCaT cells (47Lo R.S. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, Smad2 phosphorylation induced by continuous nodal treatment of P19 cells was sustained for much longer. This difference may be attributable to differences at the level of receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 or at the level of Smad2 turnover. Lo and Massagué (47Lo R.S. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) showed that TGF-β activation of Smad2 and translocation to the nucleus leads to multiubiquitination of Smad2 and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Smad2 activated by nodal may persist longer, because it may be ubiquitinated with different kinetics than Smad2 activated by TGF-β or activin. Alternatively, the receptor complex brought together by nodal may be more stable than that formed by TGF-β or activin receptor binding, perhaps through the action of extracellular EGF-CFC proteins. Increased receptor complex stability might result in more sustained activation of Smad2. In conclusion, we have shown that nodal signaling in P19 cells is mediated intracellularly through the TGF-β-activin pathway, providing important biochemical evidence that nodal signaling in the embryo uses Smad2 and Smad3. We thank Mark deCaestecar for the Smad2 dominant negative construct, Jeff Wrana for the pAR3-lux and pTlx2-lux reporters, Michael Shen for the cripto cDNA, Ester Piek for many useful suggestions, and Anita Roberts and Linda A.

https://openalex.org/W2065372271,"Apolipoprotein E is a multifunctional protein synthesized by hepatocytes and macrophages. Plasma apoE is largely liver-derived and known to regulate lipoprotein metabolism. Macrophage-derived apoE has been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in mice. We tested the hypothesis that liver-derived apoE could directly induce regression of pre-existing advanced atherosclerotic lesions without reducing plasma cholesterol levels. Aged low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice were fed a western-type diet for 14 weeks to induce advanced atherosclerotic lesions. One group of mice was sacrificed for evaluation of atherosclerosis at base line, and two other groups were injected with a second generation adenoviruses encoding human apoE3 or a control empty virus. Hepatic apoE gene transfer increased plasma apoE levels by 4-fold at 1 week, and apoE levels remained at least 2-fold higher than controls at 6 weeks. There were no significant changes in plasma total cholesterol levels or lipoprotein composition induced by expression of apoE. The liver-derived human apoE gained access to and was retained in arterial wall. Compared with base-line mice, the control group demonstrated progression of atherosclerosis; in contrast, hepatic apoE expression induced highly significant regression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Regression of lesions was accompanied by the loss of macrophage-derived foam cells and a trend toward increase in extracellular matrix of lesions. As an index of in vivooxidant stress, we quantitated the isoprostane iPF2α-VI and found that expression of apoE markedly reduced urinary, LDL-associated, and arterial wall iPF2α-VI levels. In summary, these results demonstrate that liver-derived apoE directly induced regression of advanced atherosclerosis and has anti-oxidant properties in vivo that may contribute to its anti-atherogenic effects. Apolipoprotein E is a multifunctional protein synthesized by hepatocytes and macrophages. Plasma apoE is largely liver-derived and known to regulate lipoprotein metabolism. Macrophage-derived apoE has been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in mice. We tested the hypothesis that liver-derived apoE could directly induce regression of pre-existing advanced atherosclerotic lesions without reducing plasma cholesterol levels. Aged low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice were fed a western-type diet for 14 weeks to induce advanced atherosclerotic lesions. One group of mice was sacrificed for evaluation of atherosclerosis at base line, and two other groups were injected with a second generation adenoviruses encoding human apoE3 or a control empty virus. Hepatic apoE gene transfer increased plasma apoE levels by 4-fold at 1 week, and apoE levels remained at least 2-fold higher than controls at 6 weeks. There were no significant changes in plasma total cholesterol levels or lipoprotein composition induced by expression of apoE. The liver-derived human apoE gained access to and was retained in arterial wall. Compared with base-line mice, the control group demonstrated progression of atherosclerosis; in contrast, hepatic apoE expression induced highly significant regression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Regression of lesions was accompanied by the loss of macrophage-derived foam cells and a trend toward increase in extracellular matrix of lesions. As an index of in vivooxidant stress, we quantitated the isoprostane iPF2α-VI and found that expression of apoE markedly reduced urinary, LDL-associated, and arterial wall iPF2α-VI levels. In summary, these results demonstrate that liver-derived apoE directly induced regression of advanced atherosclerosis and has anti-oxidant properties in vivo that may contribute to its anti-atherogenic effects. low density lipoprotein LDL receptor fast protein liquid chromatography very low density lipoprotein phosphate-buffered saline high density lipoprotein Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a multifunctional protein produced largely by the liver and mononuclear phagocytes (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). Although its physiologic role is uncertain, macrophage-derived apoE can inhibit progression of atherogenesis. Expression of macrophage apoE in apoE-deficient mice using bone marrow transplantation reduced plasma cholesterol levels and slowed progression of atherosclerosis (2Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 3Boisvert W. Spangenberg J. Curtiss L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific transgenic expression reduced atherosclerosis independent of plasma cholesterol levels (4Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M. Pitas R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Transplantation of apoE-deficient bone marrow in wild-type mice increased atherosclerosis (5Fazio S. Babaev V. Murray A. Hasty A. Carter K. Gleaves L. Atkinson J. Linton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), consistent with a role of macrophage-derived apoE in inhibiting progression of atherosclerosis. Liver-derived apoE is the major source of plasma apoE and has an important physiologic role in regulating lipoprotein metabolism (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of liver-derived apoE in atherogenesis independent of its role in lipoprotein metabolism is uncertain. Expression of apoE in the liver of apoE-deficient mice using an adenoviral vector slowed the progression of atherosclerosis (6Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that adenoviral-mediated hepatic expression of apoE in apoE-deficient mice resulted in marked regression of both early and advanced atherosclerotic lesions (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), an observation confirmed subsequently by another group (8Desurmont C. Caillaud J.M. Emmanuel F. Benoit P. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Branellec D. Heard J.M. Duverger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, in all of these experiments, hepatic expression of apoE in apoE-deficient mice markedly reduced plasma cholesterol levels, making it impossible to assess the direct effect of liver-derived apoE on atherosclerosis. A previous study showed that repeated injection of purified apoE to Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbits lacking functional LDL receptors resulted in reduced progression of atherosclerosis without lowering plasma cholesterol levels (9Yamada N. Inoue I. Kawamura M. Harada K. Watanabe Y. Shimano H. Gotoda T. Shimada M. Kohzaki K. Tsukada T. Shiomi M. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that hepatic expression of apoE in LDL1 receptor-deficient mice fed a western-type diet did not reduce plasma cholesterol levels but nevertheless slowed the progression of early fatty streak atherosclerotic lesions (10Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S. Usher D. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 189-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression of apoE by the adrenals at plasma levels below the threshold for reducing plasma cholesterol levels reduced atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice (11Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, regression of atherosclerosis by apoE derived from any source in the absence of cholesterol reduction has never been demonstrated. In the current study, we extended previous observations by testing the hypothesis that apoE expression would induce regression of pre-existing advanced atherosclerotic lesions in the absence of significant reduction in plasma cholesterol. The mechanisms by which apoE directly inhibits atherosclerosis are poorly understood. One of the key factors that plays a causative role in development and progression of atherosclerosis is oxidative stress (12Witztum J.L. Lancet. 1994; 344: 793-795Abstract PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress in the artery wall contributes to the inflammatory nature of atherosclerotic lesions (12Witztum J.L. Lancet. 1994; 344: 793-795Abstract PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 13Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2488-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) and could potentially contribute to plaque rupture (14Rajagopalan S. Meng X.P. Ramasamy S. Harrison D.G. Galis Z.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Products of lipoprotein oxidation are present in vessel wall and have proinflammatory effects that could promote atherogenesis (15Palinski W. Ord V.A. Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 605-616Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar). ApoE-deficient mice exhibit evidence of markedly increased lipoprotein oxidation as assessed by autoantibodies to oxidized lipoproteins (15Palinski W. Ord V.A. Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 605-616Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar). ApoE has been shown in vitro to have antioxidant (16Miyata M. Smith J.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and anti-inflammatory (17Kelly M.E. Clay M.A. Mistry M.J. Hsieh-Li H.M. Harmony J.A. Cell. Immunnol. 1994; 159: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) properties. In this study, we investigated effects of apoE expression on in vivo oxidative stress by quantitating isoprostanes in multiple tissues. Isoprostanes are stable prostaglandin isomers generated during free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation and have been shown to be reliable markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress generation in vivo (18Patrono C. FitzGerald G.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We previously reported that urine, plasma, and arterial iPF2α-VI levels are markedly increased in apoE-deficient mice and are suppressed by the administration of vitamin E accompanied by reduction in atherosclerosis (19Praticó D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested the hypothesis that hepatic expression of apoE would reduce oxidant stress in LDLR-deficient mice as assessed by quantitation of isoprostanes in urine, plasma, and aorta. Recombinant second generation adenovirus encoding the human apoE3 and the control empty adenovirus (Adnull) were constructed as described previously (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Tsukamoto K. Smith P. Glick J.M. Rader D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A total of 27 LDLR−/− mice (back-crossed 10 times to C57BL/6 mice) obtained from Jackson Laboratory were fed a western-type diet (normal chow supplemented with 0.15% cholesterol and 20% butter fat) for a total of 14 weeks prior to base-line analysis or administration of vector. Blood was drawn 1 week prior to vector administration, plasma cholesterol was quantified, and mice were divided into three groups with mean cholesterol levels that were not significantly different. One day prior to vector administration, one group of mice (n = 9) were killed for analysis of atherosclerosis (base-line group). Remaining mice were injected intravenously with either AdhapoE3 (n = 9) or control Adnull virus (n = 9) at a dose of 1.0 × 1011particles (∼6.0 × 109 plaque-forming uints/g of body weight). The western-type diet was continued after vector administration. Blood samples from mice were obtained by retro-orbital plexus prior to injection and 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after injection. Blood samples were collected into tubes containing 2 nm EDTA, 0.2% NaN3, 0.77% gentamycin and were centrifuged to obtained plasma, which was stored at −20 °C for lipid analyses and at 4 °C for FPLC. Urine samples were collected by placing mice in metabolic cages (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) for a 24-h urine collection at various time points. The samples were stored at −80 °C. Mice were killed 6 weeks after vector administration for analysis of atherosclerosis. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured enzymatically on a Cobas Fara II (Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc.) using Sigma reagents. Plasma apoE levels were measured using an immunoturbidometric assay (Sigma). Plasma samples (200 μl pooled from nine mice each of Adnulll and AdhapoE3 group) were analyzed by FPLC gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) on two Superose 6 columns as described previously (20Tsukamoto K. Smith P. Glick J.M. Rader D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cholesterol concentrations in the FPLC fractions were determined using an enzymatic assay (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Lipoproteins were isolated from plasma samples by sequential ultracentrifugation. The plasma samples obtained at various time points during the experiment were pooled from nine mice each (250 μl) of Adnull and AdhapoE3 group. The samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation in 1-ml polycarbonate tubes at 90,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor for 3 h at 10 °C (TL-100 centrifuge, Beckman Instruments Inc.). The VLDL (d<1.006), LDL (1.006 < d < 1.063) and HDL (1.063 < density < 1.21) were isolated by tube slicing in a volume of 250 μl. The lipoprotein fractions were analyzed for the lipid and protein content. Western blotting analysis for the detection of human apoE in aortas was performed using extracts prepared from the lower abdominal abdominal portion of the aortas from base-line, Adnull, and AdhapoE3 mice. The aortas were minced on ice and homogenized in 250 μl of PBS containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (complete mini™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Aliquots of the aortic extracts (10 and 15 μg of protein) were resuspended in 40 μl of Laemli buffer (Bio-Rad) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 10–20% linear gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The presence of human apoE was detected using anti-human apoE3 monoclonal antibody as primary and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The extent of atherosclerosis in the aorta and in aortic cross-sections was analyzed as described previously (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Praticó D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat.

Mice were killed by carbon dioxide inhalation, and the aorta was immediately perfused in situwith ice-cold PBS for 10 min via the left ventricle. The heart and aorta were removed en bloc, and the heart was severed from the aorta just above the aortic root. The apical half of the heart was cut off in a plane perpendicular to the aortic root. The upper half of the heart containing the aortic root was immediately embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound and frozen at −80 °C. The remainder of the aorta was cleaned free of adventitial fat and tissue, opened longitudinally, stained with Sudan IV, and pinned out as described (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E.

The extent of atherosclerosis in aortas was quantified by capturing images of aorta with a Dage-MTI 3CCD three-chip color camera (Dage-MTI Inc., Michigan City, IN) connected to a Leica MZ 12 dissection microscope. The captured 24-bit digitized color images were analyzed, and the lesion areas covering aortas were determined using Image Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The acquisition of aortic images and the analysis of lesion areas were both performed in a blinded fashion. Atherosclerosis was also quantified in the aortic root cross-sections from the fresh-frozen OCT-embedded hearts (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Tangirala R.K. Tsukamoto K. Chun S.H. Usher D. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1816-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Serial 8-μm sections of the aortic root were cut and mounted on slides, then fixed in acetone, rehydrated in PBS containing 0.02% NaN3, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS/NaN3. For detection of macrophages, sections were immunostained with monoclonal rat anti-murine MAC-1 antibody, monoclonal hamster anti-CD18, and monoclonal hamster anti-CD11c. For detection of an extracellular matrix protein, monoclonal hamster laminin antibody was used as a primary antibody, followed by incubation with mouse anti-rat or goat anti-hamster IgG in the presence of 200 μg/ml normal mouse IgG. Antibody reactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated biotin-streptavidin complexes and developed with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as substrate. Images of immunostained aortic root sections, captured digitally with a video camera connected to a Leica microscope, were analyzed using computerized image analysis (Image Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Total lesion area in aortic root sections was measured by manually tracing entire lesions in eight equally spaced aortic root sections per mouse. Both macrophage and fibrous areas were quantified in sections by determination of area that stained positively for macrophage markers and laminin, respectively. The acquisition of images and analysis of lesions were performed in a blinded fashion. For isoprostane measurement total lipids from urine, LDL, and aortic homogenate samples were extracted with ice-cold Folch solution, chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) as described previously (19Praticó D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). After removing aliquots for phospholipid measurement, the organic phase was dried under nitrogen. The samples were hydrolyzed by the addition of aqueous KOH (15%), and total iPF2α-VI was measured as described previously (19Praticó D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Mice that received Adnull had no significant change in plasma apoE levels during the course of the experiment, whereas mice that received AdhapoE3 had significantly increased plasma apoE levels, with the peak expression at day 7 (Fig.1 A). The plasma apoE levels in AdhapoE3-injected mice remained about 2-fold higher than in Adnull mice 6 weeks after administration at the termination of the experiment. Despite the increase in plasma apoE levels, no significant changes in the plasma cholesterol levels from base line were observed (Fig.1 B). On day 7 after injection, the mean plasma cholesterol level in mice injected with AdhapoE3 (573 ± 48 mg/dl) were modestly lower than mice injected with Adnull (696 ± 61 mg/dl, p = not significant), but there were no significant differences in cholesterol levels during the 6 weeks of the study. The mean post-injection cholesterol levels were not different between the two groups (AdhapoE3, 594 ± 18 versus Adnull, 663 ± 23 mg/dl,p = NS). Thus, hepatic expression of apoE had no significant effect on plasma cholesterol levels in LDLR−/− mice fed a western-type diet. Plasma triglyceride levels in mice injected with AdhapoE3 were transiently elevated at day 7 compared with control mice (data not shown) and did not differ at the remaining time points. To evaluate the effect of hepatic apoE expression on plasma lipoproteins, pooled plasma samples drawn on day 7 were analyzed by FPLC gel filtration. This analysis showed no significant differences in the plasma lipoprotein profiles between Adnull control and AdhapoE3 mice (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that gene transfer and hepatic expression of apoE3 in LDLR−/− mice did not significantly alter the distribution of cholesterol among lipoprotein fractions. The distribution of human apoE3 was determined in the lipoprotein fractions, and apoE was found to be primarily associated with VLDL and large HDL particles, with a smaller amount of apoE present on intermediate density lipoprotein and LDL fractions (data not shown). To determine whether lipoprotein composition was influenced, we isolated VLDL, LDL, and HDL by sequential ultracentrifugation from pooled plasma samples. Analysis of the lipoprotein cholesterol (free and esterified), phospholipid and protein composition revealed no significant differences in lipoprotein composition between Adnull and AdhapoE3 groups at days 7, 14, 28, or 42. The extent of atherosclerosis was assessed by two independent methods: 1) en face quantitation of atherosclerosis in the aorta from just above the root to the renal arteries and 2) cross-sectional analysis of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root. The Sudan IV stained en facepreparations of the LDLR−/− mouse aortas showed extensive atherosclerotic lesions throughout the entire aorta at base line. The aortas from Adnull-injected control mice demonstrated further progression of atherosclerosis. In contrast, the lesions in AdhapoE3 mice were markedly reduced. Quantitation of atherosclerosis using morphometric image analysis of the aortas demonstrated a marked 61% regression of atherosclerosis in mice injected with AdhapoE3 compared with base-line mice (Fig. 2 A). In LDLR−/− mice fed a western-type diet, atherosclerotic lesions develop initially in the proximal portions of the aorta, the aortic root and arch, and with progression of atherosclerosis, extend distally into thoracic and abdominal portions of the aorta. To assess the pattern of apoE-induced regression in different portions of the aorta, the lesion areas in the arch, thoracic, and abdominal portions of the aorta were analyzed. The results show that hepatic apoE expression not only induced marked regression of advanced lesions in the thoracic and abdominal portions of the aorta but also effectively regressed relatively more abundant lesions in the aortic arch (Fig.2 B). Atherosclerosis was also quantified in aortic root cross-sections by manually tracing the entire lesions in five equally spaced sections from each mouse. Consistent with the en face data of the aorta, Adnull-injected mice showed progression of aortic root atherosclerotic lesions, whereas AdhapoE3-injected mice demonstrated significant 34% regression of lesion compared with base-line mice (Fig. 2 C). Thus, by two independent assays, hepatic expression of apoE induced significant regression of advanced atherosclerosis over a 6-week period. To evaluate the effects of liver-derived apoE on the morphology of lesions, we used immunocytochemistry to characterize their composition. Aortic root cross-sections from base-line, Adnull, and AdhapoE3 mice were immunostained for macrophages with antibodies to β2-integrin (Mac-1, CD18, and CD11c) and for extracellular matrix-rich regions with an antibody to laminin. Lesions contained a large amount of non-macrophage foam cell components and laminin, consistent with advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Collagen staining was similar to laminin staining (data not shown). Quantitative computer-assisted image analysis of immunostained aortic root serial cross-sections revealed significant reduction of macrophage-derived foam cells in atheroscleroic lesions of AdhapoE3 mice compared with base-line and Adnull mice (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the distribution of laminin-rich areas showed no change (data not shown), and therefore the ratio of macrophage foam cells to laminin was significantly reduced in mice injected with AdhapoE3 (Fig.3 B). These results show that liver-derived apoE induced regression of pre-existing advanced lesions primarily by reducing the macrophage-derived components of lesions but not the extracellular matrix components. In previous studies, we have shown that liver-derived apoE after gene transfer gained access to the artery wall and was specifically retained in areas of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE−/− mice (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the retention of liver-derived human apoE in the artery wall in this study, aortic extracts prepared from base-line mice, as well as Adnull and AdhapoE3 mice at the end of the experiment, were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody specific for human apoE. The presence of liver-derived human apoE in the artery wall was detected in AdhapoE3-injected mice but not in Adnull and base-line mice (Fig. 4). No human apoE mRNA was detected (data not shown), indicating that the human apoE present in the aorta was not synthesized within the vessel wall. Thus, liver-derived apoE gained access to the artery wall from the plasma compartment and was retained in substantial amounts within the artery wall several weeks after vector injection. To examine whether hepatic apoE expression affected in vivo oxidant stress, we measured iPF2α-VI levels in urine and plasma LDL before and at several time points after vector administration and in aorta at the termination of the experiment. Injection of Adnull had no effect on urinary iPF2α-VI levels; in contrast, hepatic expression of apoE significantly reduced urinary iPF2α-VI levels by 7 days, and they remained at 60% of base-line values at 6 weeks (Fig.5 A). Analysis of the LDL-associated iPF2α-VI levels showed no change in control mice, but a rapid reduction in the AdhapoE3-injected mice, with levels by 14 days only 6.3% of base-line values and remaining in that range through the 6 weeks of the experiment (Fig. 5 B). Finally, aortic iPF2α-VI levels in AdhapoE mice were significantly reduced compared with both base-line and Adnull mice (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that hepatic apoE expression reduced oxidant stress in vivo. The apoE-mediated inhibition of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress may contribute to its anti-atherogenic mechanisms in the regression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In this study, we demonstrated that hepatic overexpression of human apoE3 for 6 weeks induced regression of pre-existing advanced atherosclerosis in LDLR-deficient mice without reducing plasma cholesterol levels. This substantially extends our previous finding that apoE expression reduced the progression of early fatty streak lesions in LDLR-deficient mice (10Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S. Usher D. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 189-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and indicates that liver-derived apoE has the potential to induce loss of foam cell mass from pre-existing advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that apoE overexpression in aged LDLR-deficient mice markedly reduced levels of isoprostanes in urine, plasma, and aorta compared with base-line and control treated mice. These results strongly suggest that hepatic apoE expression resulted in anti-oxidant effects in vivo. Whether these effects were directly responsible for the induction of atherosclerosis regression remains to be determined. It is not surprising that hepatic overexpression of human apoE3 on the background of endogenous mouse apoE and in the absence of the LDLR did not significantly reduce plasma cholesterol levels. The LDLR is the major physiologic receptor for apoE in the liver (23Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and although there are backup mechanisms for clearance of lipoprotein remnants, such as LDL receptor-related protein and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, they are much less efficient. Furthermore, the majority of plasma cholesterol in western diet-fed LDLR mouse is in LDL, which are generally not cleared from the plasma through an apoE-mediated mechanism. In fact, apoE-containing remnant lipoproteins can compete with LDL for uptake, resulting in delayed catabolism of LDL (24Woollett L.A. Osono Y. Herz J. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12500-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoE has been shown to inhibit lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (25van Dijk K.W. van Vlijmen B.J.M. van't Hof H.B. van der Zee A. Fojo S.S. Van Berkel T.J. Havekes L.M.

Therefore any modest effect of apoE in promoting clearance of VLDL in the absence of the LDLR may be offset by its effect in competing with LDL for clearance, inhibiting VLDL lipolysis, and promoting VLDL production. Our data demonstrate that apoE overexpression had a very modest effect in reducing VLDL cholesterol on day 7, but that this effect was no longer seen at subsequent time points. These data are consistent with studies that expressed apoE using bone marrow transplant (30Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Babaev V.R. Fazio S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1726-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or by liver-directed gene transfer (25van Dijk K.W. van Vlijmen B.J.M. van't Hof H.B. van der Zee A. Fojo S.S. Van Berkel T.J. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 336-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence of both apoE and the LDLR and found little effect on plasma cholesterol levels. Transgenic overexpression of apoE in the absence of the LDL receptor in mice demonstrated reduction in VLDL cholesterol and increased VLDL turnover, but no reduction in LDL cholesterol or change in turnover (31Osuga J. Yonemoto M. Yamada N. Shimano H. Yagyu H. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kamei T. Yazaki Y. Ishibashi S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and transgenic overexpression of apoE in rabbits resulted in a 70% increase in plasma cholesterol due largely to increased LDL cholesterol (32Fan J. Ji S.J. Huang Y. De Silva H. Sanan D. Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Taylor J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2151-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, apoE expression has relatively little ability to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in the absence of the LDLR, making it a good animal model for assessing the direct effects of apoE expression on atherosclerosis and other markers without the confounding effects of a reduction in plasma cholesterol. Macrophage-specific transgenic expression of apoE in apoE-deficient mice reduced progression of atherosclerosis even after controlling for changes in plasma cholesterol levels (4Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M. Pitas R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when apoE-deficient bone marrow was transplanted into wild-type mice, atherosclerotic lesion formation was increased despite a lack of effect on plasma cholesterol levels (5Fazio S. Babaev V. Murray A. Hasty A. Carter K. Gleaves L. Atkinson J. Linton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, macrophage-derived apoE appears sufficient to inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic lesions independent of its effects on plasma lipoproteins. In a previous study, we demonstrated that liver-derived apoE gained access to and accumulated within atherosclerotic lesions (7Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure' E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that in these studies liver-derived apoE gained access to the vessel wall and had direct effects that promoted regression of lesions. Plasma apoE may gain access to the vessel wall in the context of small lipoprotein particles such as γ-LpE (33Huang Y. von Eckardstein A. Wu S. Maeda N. Assmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once within the intima, apoE could associate with components of the extracellular matrix, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (35Ji Z.S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L.

There are a number of potential mechanisms by which hepatic apoE may have induced regression of atherosclerosis. ApoE promotes cellular cholesterol efflux (38Mazzone T. Curr. Opin.

However, apoE has been demonstrated in vitro to have other cellular effects such as inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation (17Kelly M.E. Clay M.A. Mistry M.J. Hsieh-Li H.M. Harmony J.A. Cell. Immunnol. 1994; 159: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (45Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N.A. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and anti-oxidant effects (16Miyata M. Smith J.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo relevance of these observations has been uncertain. In these studies, we used quantitation of iPF2α-VI, a major isoprostane that is not influenced by cyclo-oxygenase activity and therefore felt to be a specific marker for lipid peroxidation and oxidant stress (18Patrono C. FitzGerald G.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 46Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 24441-24444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (350) Google Scholar), to test the hypothesis that expression of apoE reduced oxidant stress in vivo. We found a dramatic effect of hepatic apoE expression in reducing urine and LDL-associated and aortic levels of iPF2α-VI. This is the first in vivoevidence that apoE has direct anti-oxidant effects. Combined with our previous study in which vitamin E administration in apoE-deficient mice reduced isoprostane generation accompanied by reduction in atherosclerosis (19Praticó D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), this finding further supports the concept that isoprostanes may be a surrogate marker for anti-oxidant effects of interventions, which are likely to beneficially influence atherosclerosis. The findings in our studies advance the concept of apoE as an anti-atherogenic molecule in several important ways. First, we expressed apoE in the liver instead of macrophages, demonstrating that apoE is anti-atherogenic regardless of whether it is presented to the vessel wall via macrophages or via the plasma compartment. This suggests that interventions to raise hepatic production and plasma levels of apoE could be anti-atherogenic, even if macrophage production of apoE is not increased. Second, we demonstrated that apoE induced regression of pre-existing advanced atherosclerotic lesions, which has not been previously demonstrated for apoE derived from any source. Inhibition of progression and induction of regression involve very different cellular and molecular processes (47Dansky H.M. Fisher E.A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1762-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the difference between these two processes is of potential clinical significance. Third, we demonstrated that apoE changed the morphology of advanced lesions, reduced foam cells and increased matrix, in a way that could be interpreted as consistent with “stabilization” of lesions (48Lee R.T. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Finally, we showed that hepatic apoE expression markedly reduced isoprostanes, an accepted index of in vivo oxidant stress, providing important evidence that the in vitroanti-oxidant properties of apoE that were described previously are also functional in vivo and suggesting another mechanism by which apoE may be anti-atherogenic. In summary, we demonstrate that liver-directed gene transfer and hepatic expression of apoE in LDLR−/− mice induced significant regression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions without substantial alteration in plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels. In addition, apoE expression markedly reduced isoprostane levels in urine, plasma LDL, and aortic tissue. These results demonstrate that liver-derived apoE has direct anti-atherogenic and antioxidant properties in vivo that are independent of cholesterol and lipoprotein modulation. We are indebted to Dawn Marchadier, Robert Hughes, Anna Lillethun, and Linda Morrell for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Jane Glick for helpful discussions."

The results of luciferase assays showed that transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter was largely mediated by SP1 sites and a cAMP-responsive element (CRE). DNA binding activity at the SP1 sites, which was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, was significantly increased in the early to mid G1 phase, whereas DNA binding activity at CRE did not change significantly. Furthermore, Induction of the cyclin D1 promoter activity in the early to mid G1phase depended largely on the promoter fragment containing the SP1 sites, whereas the proximal fragment containing CRE but not the SP1 sites was constitutively active. Finally, the increase in DNA binding and promoter activities via the SP1 sites was mediated by the Ras-dependent pathway. The results suggested that the activation of the cyclin D1 gene in vascular ECs was regulated by a dual system; one was inducible in the G1phase, and the other was constitutively active.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9990) Google Scholar). When ECs are injured, ECs adjacent to the injured site start to replicate until they come into contact with each other. Prompt and complete repair of defects in the EC monolayer is therefore important to prevent the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. Although a variety of mitogens, including endothelin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are known to stimulate replication of ECs (2Vigne P. Marsault R. Breittmayer J.P. Frelin C. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Plouet J. Schilling J. Gospodarowicz D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3801-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), little is known as to how ECs coordinate signals from multiple mitogens through multiple receptors and re-enter the cell cycle. Progression of the early to mid G1 phase is largely regulated by D-type cyclins, which associate with the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) cdk4/6 (4Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 5Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). It is well known that expression of cyclin D is regulated, at least partly, at the transcription level and that the p21 ras (Ras)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway is implicated in the expression of the cyclin D1 gene. Several studies have indicated, using a dominant negative Ras mutant, that the Ras signaling pathway is involved in the induction of cyclin D1 (6Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 7Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the ERK pathway is implicated in VEGF-induced EC proliferation by stimulating cyclin D1 synthesis and cdk4 kinase activity (8Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms by which the Ras-dependent pathway induces expression of the cyclin D1 gene. In other words, it is not clear which cis-elements in the cyclin D1 promoter are involved in the Ras-dependent activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. The promoter region of the cyclin D1 gene contains multiple cis-elements, including binding sites for AP1, for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), for nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), for activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and for SP1. These cis-elements are potentially important for transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 gene. In fact, it was reported that the AP1 site was implicated in angiotensin II-induced activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (9Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E. Batlle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22570-22577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 gene was mediated by STAT-binding sites in hematopoietic cells (10Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It was also reported that NFκB-binding sites in the cyclin D1 promoter were implicated in transcriptional activation of the gene (11Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25245-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The ATF/CREB-binding site was also reportedly implicated in the activation of the cyclin D1 gene. pp60 v-src -induced transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 gene was mediated by the ATF/CREB site (14Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines 3rd., G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7341-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was found that estrogen-induced activation of the cyclin D1 gene depended on the ATF/CREB site in which ATF-2 and c-Jun formed heterodimers (15Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the role of the SP1-binding sites. These results suggest that the transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 gene may occur in a cell type- and mitogen-specific manner. We therefore sought to determine the cis-elements in the cyclin D1 promoter that are required for the transcriptional activation of the gene in vascular ECs. In the present study, we show that, in vascular ECs, activation of the cyclin D1 promoter is largely mediated by the SP1 and ATF/CREB sites and that DNA binding activity and promoter activity via the SP1 sites increase in the early to mid period of the G1 phase. We also show that the induction of DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity via the SP1 sites is mediated by the Ras-dependent pathway. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-SP1, -SP2, -SP3, -SP4, -ATF/CREB, -NFκBp50, -NFκBp65, -c-Fos, and -c-Jun antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). HUVECs were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 17 ng/ml acidic fibroblast growth factor, and 50 units/ml heparin. To induce cell cycle re-entry, confluent HUVECs were split at a ratio of 1:3. BAECs were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. BAECs were kept in low serum medium (DMEM containing 0.2% FBS) for 48 h to induce quiescence and stimulated with growth medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS) to induce cell cycle reentry. A 1719-bp fragment of the human cyclin D1 promoter was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 1 μg of human genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) as the template. The PCR primers used were as follows: cycD1sense primer, 5′-GCTGATGCTCTGAGGCTTGGCTAT-3′; cycD1antisense primer, 5′-CTCCAGGACTTTGCAACTTCAACAAAACT-3′. The PCR conditions were 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 68 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles, with a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. To amplify a long fragment of the human cyclin D1 gene accurately, we used an LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzou, Osaka, Japan). The PCR-amplified product was digested with SacI and HindIII and subcloned in pGL2-basic vector (pGL2/−1719/wt). The nucleotide sequence of the construct was confirmed by cycle sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The nucleotide sequence of the PCR-amplified product was basically identical with the sequence, which was previously reported (GenBank™ accession number Z29078), except that one extra cytosine was inserted in five consecutive cytosines, which were located at −129 to −125 nucleotides from the transcription start site. To prepare deletion mutants that lacked AP1-, NFκB-, STAT-, SP1-, or ATF/CREB-binding sites, PCR was performed. Constructed plasmids and the sense primers used were as follows: pGL2/−998/AP1: sense primer (5′-GCAGAGGGGACTAATATTTCCAGCA-3′); pGL2/−934/ΔAP1, sense primer (5′-GGAGATCACTGTTTCTCAGCTTTCCA-3′); pGL2/−836/ΔNFκB1, sense primer (5′-GGACCGACTGGTCAAGGTAGGAA-3′); pGL2/−707/ΔNFκB2, sense primer (5′-GAGCGAGCGCATGCTAAGCTGAA-3′); pGL2/−461/ΔSTAT1, sense primer (5′-GCGCCCATTCTGCCGGCTTGGAT-3′); pGL2/−229/ΔSTAT2, sense primer (5′-TTCTATGAAAACCGGACTACAGGGGCAACTC-3′); pGL2/−161/SP1, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTT-3′); pGL2/−95/ΔSP1, sense primer (5′-CGCTCCCATTCTCTGCCGGGCT-3′). The cycD1antisense primer was used as the antisense primer for each PCR reaction. To make a deletion mutant that contained the minimal promoter region (pGL2/−23/ΔNFκB3), a double-stranded oligonucleotide was ligated to the pGL2-basic vector. The sequence of the sense strand was 5′-GTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCTGGAG-3′. A double-stranded oligonucleotide, which corresponded to four consecutive SP1 sites of the cyclin D1 promoter, was ligated to the pGL2-basic vector (pGL2/−161/−96). The sense strand was as follows: 5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTTGGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTCCCCCTGCGCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCCTCCCGCTC-3′. To insert point mutations in the four putative SP1 sites, the ATF/CREB site, or the NFκB site, PCR was performed. The four SP1 sites were designated SP1-1 through -4 in the 5′ to 3′ order. Constructs and primer pairs were as follows: pGL2/−161/SP1-1mut, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTTGGCGCaatttCCCCCCTCCCCCTGCGCCCG-3′, antisense primer (cycD1antisense primer); pGL2/−161/SP1-2mut, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTTGGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTaattaTGCGCCCGCCCCCG-3′), antisense primer (cycD1antisense primer); pGL2/−161/SP1-3mut, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTTGGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTCCCCCTGCaatttCCCCCGCCCCCCTCCCGCT-3′), antisense primer (cycD1antisense primer); pGL2/−161/SP1-4mut, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTTGGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTCCCCCTGCGCCCGCCCCCGaattaCTCCCGCTCCCATTCT-3′), antisense primer (cycD1antisense primer); pGL2/−161/ATF/CREBmut, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTT-3′), antisense primer (5′-CTCCAGGACTTTGCAACTTCAACAAAACTCCCCTGTAGTCCGTGTGggGgTACTGTTGTTAAGCAAAGA-3′); pGL2/−161/NFκBmut, sense primer (5′-CCCCTCGCTGCTCCCGGCGTTT-3′), antisense primer (5′-CTCCAGGACTTTGCAACTTCAACAAAACTtaCtTGTAGTCCGTGTGACGTTACTGTTGTTAAGCAAAGA-3′. The lowercase, underlined letters indicate the nucleotide substitutions to insert mutations. The nucleotide sequence of each construct was confirmed by cycle sequencing as described above. pRL-TK, which encodes the SeaPansy luciferase gene, was purchased from Toyo Ink (Tokyo, Japan) and used as the internal control for the luciferase assays. BAECs were transiently cotransfected with reporter plasmids encoding the mutants of the cyclin D1 promoter and pRL-TK using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). To examine the effects of a dominant negative mutant of Ras, the reporter plasmids were transfected in BAECs along with pRL-TK and pcDNA3-HA-mouse RasS17N, which was designed to express an amino-terminally hemagglutinin-epitope tagged RasS17N (16Suzuki E. Nagata D. Kakoki M. Hayakawa H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After serum starvation for 48 h, cells were restimulated with the growth medium for 8 h and harvested. Dual luciferase assay was performed using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Construction of the dominant negative Ras mutant RasS17N has already been described elsewhere (16Suzuki E. Nagata D. Kakoki M. Hayakawa H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The replication-defective adenovirus, which expresses HA-tagged murine RasS17N was constructed according to the COS-TPC method (17Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). RasS17N was excised from the pcDNA3 vector by restriction digestion with BamHI and XhoI. After end-filling, the fragment was ligated to the cosmid vector pAxCAwt at the SwaI site. The cosmid vector, which encoded HA-tagged murine RasS17N, was cotransfected in 293 cells along with DNA-TPC. Recombinant viruses, which expressed HA-tagged murine RasS17N (Ad RasS17N), were generated through homologous recombination. Ad RasS17N was isolated and propagated in HEK293 cells and finally purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. A recombinant adenovirus, which expresses green fluorescence protein (Ad GFP), was obtained from Quantum Biotechnologies (Montreal, Canada). Subconfluent HUVECs were infected with Ad RasS17N or Ad GFP at a multiplicity of infection varying from 0 to 50. Cells were incubated in the growth medium until they reached complete confluence and then split at a ratio of 1:3 to induce cell cycle re-entry. Proteins were extracted 4 or 8 h after splitting. Whole-cell extracts were prepared from HUVECs and BAECs as described previously (18Suzuki E. Guo K. Kolman M., Yu, Y.-T. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in an equal amount of 2× extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 0.6 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the protein extract was used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Protein extraction for Western blot analyses was performed as described previously (19Suzuki E. Nagata D. Yoshizumi M. Kakoki M. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3637-3644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, we used Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then lysed in Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford's method (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY). Probes and competitor DNAs were double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides that were prepared according to the sequence of the cyclin D1 promoter. Two consecutive SP1 sites located upstream (SP1-1/2) and those located downstream (SP1-3/4) were analyzed separately. Nucleotide sequences of the sense strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows: SP1/1wt2wt, 5′-GGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTCCCCCTGC-3′; SP1/1mut2wt, 5′-GGCGCaatttCCCCCCTCCCCCTGC-3′; SP1/1wt2mut, 5′-GGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTaattaTGC-3′; SP1/1mut2mut, 5′-GGCGCaatttCCCCCTaattaTGC-3′; SP1/3wt4wt, 5′-TGCGCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCCTCC-3′; SP1/3mut4wt, 5′-TGCaatttCCCCCGCCCCCCTCC-3′; SP1/3wt4mut, 5′-TGCGCCCGCCCCCGaattaCTCC-3′; SP1/3mut4mut, 5′-TGCaatttCCCCCGaattaCTCC-3′; ATF/CREBwt, 5′-CTTAACAACAGTAACGTCACACGGACT-3′; ATF/CREBmut, 5′-CTTAACAACAGTAcCccCACACGGACT-3′; NFκBwt, 5′-CGGACTACAGGGGAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCT-3′; NFκBmut, 5′-CGGACTACAaGtaAGTTTTGTTGAAGTTGCAAAGTCCT-3′. To confirm the specificity of protein binding, double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding a canonical SP1 binding site or NFκB binding site were used in some experiments. Nucleotide sequences of the sense strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotide were as follows: canonical SP1wt, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; canonical SP1mut, 5′-ATTCGATCaattCGGGGCGAGC-3′; canonical NFκBwt, 5′-AACTGAAAACGGGAAAGTCCCTCTCTCTAACCTG-3′; canonical NFκBmut, 5′-AACTGAAAACGGGAAAGTgggTCTCTCTAACCTG-3′. The lowercase, underlined letters depict nucleotide substitutions to induce point mutations. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed in reaction mixtures containing 20 μg of the protein extract, 20 fmol of the probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 200 ng of a single-stranded oligonucleotide. Electrophoresis was carried out on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× TBE (0.045 mTris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0.045 m boric acid, 0.001m EDTA) in a cooled gel box. Protein extracts were separated on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). After blocking in 1× PBS/5% nonfat dry milk/0.2% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking buffer (1× PBS/2% nonfat dry milk/0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200. The membranes were washed three times with the blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies, which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) at a final dilution of 1:7000. After final washes with 1× PBS/0.2% Tween 20, the signals were detected using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The values are the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keul test. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. To map cis-elements that were required for transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter, we transfected a variety of luciferase reporter constructs, which contained various lengths of the human cyclin D1 promoter in BAECs (Fig.1). Surprisingly, deletion of the putative AP1 site did not reduce the promoter activity. Further deletion of two putative NFκB binding sites and two putative STAT binding sites did not reduce the luciferase activity, either. pGL2/−161/SP1, which encoded four consecutive SP1 sites, an ATF/CREB site, and an NFκB binding site, had almost the same promoter activity as pGL2/−1719/wt, which encoded the full-length cyclin D1 promoter. However, when the SP1 sites were deleted (pGL2/−95/ΔSP1), the promoter activity decreased to 30% of that of the full-length cyclin D1 promoter. Further deletion of the putative ATF/CREB site and the NFκB binding site (pGL2/−23/ΔNFκB3) resulted in reduction of the promoter activity almost to the same level as that of the pGL2-basic vector. The results suggested that the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter depended largely on the SP1 sites, the ATF/CREB site, and the NFκB binding site in vascular ECs. To examine the function of each putative DNA-binding site more specifically, a point mutation to each DNA-binding site was introduced in pGL2/−161/SP1, and the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmids was measured (Fig.2). When the SP1 site located at −134 to −126 was mutated (pGL2/−161/SP1-1mut), the promoter activity was rather increased to 147% compared with the wild type construct. However, when the three downstream SP1 sites located at −128 to −120, −115 to −107, or −109 to −101 were mutated (pGL2/−161/SP1-2mut, pGL2/−161/SP1-3mut, and pGL2/−161/SP1-4mut, respectively), the promoter activity was significantly decreased to 47, 65, and 66%, respectively. Insertion of a point mutation in the ATF/CREB site (pGL2/−161/CREB mut) and the NFκB binding site (pGL2/−161/NFκB mut) also significantly reduced the promoter activity to 50 and 52%, respectively, suggesting that these putative DNA-binding sites were functional in these assays. We also tried to transfect the reporter constructs into HUVECs. However, transfection efficiency was too low to map the cis-elements.Figure 2Mutational analysis of the functions of the SP1, ATF/CREB, and NFκB sites in the cyclin D1 promoter. Diagrams show mutant reporter constructs in which each SP1 site, ATF/CREB site, or NFκB site was mutated. The asterisks indicate the positions at which the point mutation was introduced. 2 μg of each luciferase reporter construct was transfected in BAECs along with 0.25 μg of pRL-TK and serum-starved for 48 h. Cells were then restimulated with the growth medium for 8 h and harvested for luciferase assays.

To analyze the role of four SP1 sites, we designed two double-stranded oligonucleotides. One encoded two consecutive SP1 sites located at −134 to −126 and −128 to −120 (SP1-1/2), and the other encoded another two consecutive SP1 sites located at −115 to −107 and −109 to −101 (SP1-3/4). Two bands were detected in protein extracts prepared from HUVECs when a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the SP1-1/2 was used as the probe (A′ and B′ in Fig.3 A, left panel). The DNA binding activity in protein extracts prepared 8 h after splitting of confluent HUVECs was significantly increased compared with that in protein extracts prepared from quiescent HUVECs (SSin Fig. 3 A, 5.3- ± 0.8-fold increase compared with quiescent HUVECs (Q), n = 3,p < 0.05). The DNA-protein complexes were competed away by a 100× molar excess of cold oligonucleotide encoding wild type SP1 sites (SP1-1wt2wt) but not by a 100× molar excess of cold oligonucleotide encoding mutant SP1 sites (SP1-1mut2mut). We also performed a cold competition experiment using a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a canonical SP1 site. In this case, the upper band (band A′) was abolished when a molar excess of the oligonucleotide encoding the wild SP1 site was included in the reaction (canon. SP1wt), whereas the band remained when a molar excess of the oligonucleotide encoding the mutant SP1 site was used (canon. SP1mut), suggesting that the upper band represented specific binding of the SP1 family of transcription factors. We next used a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding SP1-3/4 as the probe (Fig. 3 A, right panel). The DNA binding activity was also induced 8 h after splitting confluent HUVECs (2.5- ± 0.3-fold increase compared with quiescent cells,n = 3, p < 0.01). Two complexes were also detected, both of which were competed away by a molar excess of wild type cold probe (SP1-3wt4wt) but not by a molar excess of mutant cold probe (SP1-3mut4mut). The DNA-protein complex corresponding to the upper band (band X in Fig. 3 A, right panel) was specifically competed away by a molar excess of oligonucleotide encoding the wild type canonical SP1 site but not by that encoding the mutant SP1 site. To examine the role of each SP1 site more precisely and to examine whether the SP1 family of transcription factors specifically bound to the SP1 sites, we performed further competition experiments. The DNA-protein complexes formed at the SP1-1/2 site were competed away by a molar excess of cold double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding one wild type and the other mutant SP1 sites (SP1-1mut2wt and SP1-1wt2mut; Fig. 3 B), suggesting that both SP1 sites were involved in protein binding. The density of the upper band (band A′ in Fig. 3 B) was reduced when anti-SP1 antibody was included in the reaction mixture. The density of the upper band was also reduced when anti-SP2 antibody was included in the reaction mixture, and some of the DNA-protein complex was supershifted. Preincubation with anti-SP3 and -SP4 antibody also reduced the density of the upper band, although the effect appeared to be weaker than that of anti-SP1 and -SP2 antibodies. Preincubation with preimmune serum had no remarkable effect on the DNA-protein complex formation. The DNA-protein complexes formed at the SP1-3/4 site were competed away by a molar excess of cold oligonucleotide encoding one wild type and the other mutant SP1 sites (SP1-3mut4wt and SP1-3wt4mut; Fig. 3 C). However, the complexes were only partially competed away by SP1-3mut4wt, suggesting that the SP1-3 site had higher affinity for the SP1 family of transcription factors in this assay system. Preincubation with anti-SP1 through -SP4 antibodies reduced the density of the upper band (band X in Fig. 3 C), and some of the complex was supershifted with anti-SP2 antibody. Anti-SP3 and -SP4 antibodies tended to have weaker effects for the competition than anti-SP1 and -SP2 antibodies. In contrast, preincubation with preimmune serum had no remarkable effect on the DNA-protein complex formation. We next examined DNA binding activity at the ATF/CREB site. Two bands were detected by EMSAs when a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the ATF/CREB was used as the probe (bands X and Y in Fig.4 A). Although the DNA binding activity at the ATF/CREB site tended to increase 8 h after splitting confluent HUVECs, the difference was not statistically significant (0.99- ± 0.04-fold increase compared with quiescent cells,n = 3, not significant). Both bands were abolished by preincubation with a molar excess of cold wild type probe but not by a mutant probe. The lower band (band Y in Fig. 4 A) was supershifted when anti-ATF/CREB antibody was included in the reaction, whereas anti-c-Fos and -c-Jun antibodies did not have remarkable effects on the complex formation. The DNA binding activity at the NFκB site was also examined. When a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the cyclin D1 NFκB site located at −33 to −24 was used as the probe, no specific bands were detected (Fig. 4 B, left panel). We therefore used a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a canonical NFκB site as the probe. We did observe DNA binding activity in this case. Three bands (bands X, Y, and Zin Fig. 4 B, right panel) were detected. The DNA binding activity at the canonical NFκB site was not increased 8 h after splitting confluent HUVECs, and the DNA-protein complexes were competed away by a molar excess of cold wild type probe but not by a molar excess of cold mutant probe. Bands X and Ywere supershifted by preincubation with anti-p50 antibody. The density of band X was reduced by preincubation with anti-p65 antibody, whereas preimmune serum did not have a remarkable effect on the DNA binding activity. The results suggested that, although HUVECs expressed NFκB proteins, their binding activity at the cyclin D1 NFκB site was under detectable levels in this assay. We also used protein extracts prepared from BAECs. The results obtained were basically the same as those described above (data not shown). The DNA binding activity at the SP1 sites was increased 8 h after quiescent BAECs were stimulated with serum mitogen. ATF/CREB was detected in the DNA-protein complex formed at the ATF/CREB site. No DNA binding activity was detected at the NFκB site. However, preincuba"

In addition, sds3mutants have phenotypes very similar to those seen in sin3and rpd3 mutants, suggesting that it functions in the same genetic pathway. In this manuscript we demonstrate that Sds3p is an integral subunit of a previously identified high molecular weight Rpd3p·Sin3p containing yeast histone deacetylase complex. By analyzing an sds3Δ strain we show that, in the absence of Sds3p, Sin3p can be chromatographically separated from Rpd3p, indicating that Sds3p promotes the integrity of the complex. Moreover, the remaining Rpd3p complex in the sds3Δ strain had little or no histone deacetylase activity. Thus, Sds3p plays important roles in the integrity and catalytic activity of the Rpd3p·Sin3p complex.

To counteract the effect of HAT complexes, it is necessary to reverse acetylation by efficiently deacetylating nucleosomal histones. Histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) perform this reaction.

Moreover, yeast HDAC complexes containing Hda1p and Hos3p as catalytic subunits have been identified (26Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4215-4221Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Sin3p is thought to mediate interactions of the Sin3·Rpd3 complex with sequence-specific DNA binding repressors such as Ume6p, which leads to a localized deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 and repression of transcription in vivo (19Kadosh D.

Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).RPD3 and SIN3 were both originally identified in genetic screens as regulators of gene expression (30Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Nasmyth K. Stillman D. Kipling D. Cell. 1987; 48: 579-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutations inRPD3 and SIN3 affect transcription of the same set of genes (32Stillman D.J. Dorland S. Yu Y. Genetics. 1994; 136: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SIN3 and RPD3 were identified among at least 19 other genes in a screen for extragenic suppressors of a silencing defective RAP1 allele (rap 1-12) (33Vannier D. Balderes D. Shore D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sussel L. Vannier D. Shore D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 873-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another gene identified in this screen is SDS3(suppressor of defective silencing 3). Although mutations inSDS3 were shown to cause several phenotypes in common withsin3 and rpd3 mutants, they did not appear to derepress a plasmid-borne TRK2 gene, raising the possibility that SDS3 might function independently ofSIN3 and RPD3 (33Vannier D. Balderes D. Shore D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study found that a mutation in SDS3 reduced Sin3p-mediated repression and that Sds3p and Sin3p could be co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (35Dorland S. Deegenaars M.L. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 573-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results illustrated that SDS3 functions in the same genetic pathway as SIN3 and that Sds3p and Sin3p can interact in some way. In this manuscript we demonstrate that Sds3p is an integral subunit of a Rpd3p·Sin3p-containing yeast HDAC complex with an apparent molecular mass of 1.2 MDa. By analyzing asds3Δ strain we show that, in the absence of Sds3p, Sin3p can be chromatographically separated from Rpd3p, indicating that Sds3p promotes the integrity of this complex. In addition, the remaining Rpd3p complex in the sds3Δ strain had little or no histone deacetylase activity. Thus, Sds3p plays important roles in the integrity and catalytic activity of the Rpd3p·Sin3p complex. The sds3Δ strain in the W303 background (36Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) was generated as described previously (33Vannier D. Balderes D. Shore D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sds3-HAp construct was made by inserting three copies of the HA epitope in the 3′-end of the SDS3 open reading frame. A uniqueNotI site was engineered into +978 of the 984-bpSDS3 open reading frame. A NotI cassette containing three copies of the HA epitope (YPYDPDYA) was inserted and cloned into the 2-μm plasmid pRS423. The resulting clone, DV-246, complements the sds3Δ mutation in a manner identical to the untagged SDS3 gene. Strains were grown to an optical density of 1.5 as described previously (37Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 14: 312-315Google Scholar), and cells of a 12-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were washed, resuspended, and lysed by using a glass bead-beater (Biospec), and the resulting extracts were loaded onto Ni2+-agarose as described (37Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 14: 312-315Google Scholar). After Ni2+-agarose chromatography, the imidazole eluate was loaded directly onto a Mono-Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to separate HDAC complexes. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear 25-ml gradient of 100 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for HDAC activity as described previously (38Kölle D. Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A. Loidl P.

Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A. Loidl P. Methods. 1998; 15: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and the released radioactivity was measured as described (38Kölle D. Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A. Loidl P. Methods. 1998; 15: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fractions containing HDAC activity were pooled separately, concentrated to 500 μl using Centriprep 10 (Millipore) concentrators, and then loaded onto a Superose 6 HR10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to determine the native molecular weight. The column was run in 350 mm NaCl in 40 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5-ml volume were collected and assayed for HDAC activity. Aliquots of fractions containing HDAC activity were applied to SDS-PAGE and subject to Western blotting as described (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). In addition, 50 μl of Mono-Q concentrate was applied to a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was run in 500 mm NaCl in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.02 ml/min. 50-μl fractions were collected and tested for HDAC activity, and Western blot analysis was performed as described. The flow-through fraction of Ni2+-agarose chromatography was dialyzed three times against 10 volumes of buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT) and processed over a Mono-Q column and a Superose 6 size exclusion column. Western blot analyses described in this study were performed using antibodies against Rpd3p (Upstate Biotechnology), Hda1p (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), HA (Covance), and Sin3p (28Kasten M.M. Dorland S. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4215-4221Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Antibodies for HA (Covance) and Rpd3p (Upstate Biotechnology) were coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. 40 μl of 50% bead slurry was washed twice with 200 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). Beads were recovered by centrifugation at 110 × g for 1 min in a table-top centrifuge after each wash step. 20 μl of antibody solution (20 μg) was added to the beads, and the antibodies were bound to the beads by rotation on a wheel for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were cross-linked to beads as described previously (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). Superose 6 chromatography peak fractions were diluted to the appropriate salt concentration of 150 mm NaCl with binding buffer, reconcentrated with Microcon 10 concentrators (Amicon) to the original volume, and 20 μl of sample was added to 20 μl of antibody beads. The binding reaction was performed for 4 h or overnight with a rotation wheel at 4 °C. After the binding reaction, beads were recollected by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and saved, and beads were washed twice with binding buffer. HDAC assays were performed with beads and supernatant. 20 μl of 1 μg/μl radiolabeled chicken erythrocyte core histones were added to samples and were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C with rotation. HDAC activity was measured as described previously (38Kölle D. Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A. Loidl P. Methods. 1998; 15: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whole cell extract for immunoprecipitation was prepared from 100 ml of the Sds3-HAp expression strain by glass bead disruption into extraction buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). For immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of whole cell extract total protein, as determined by Bradford assay, was diluted to 150 mm NaCl in extraction buffer lacking NaCl. The diluted extract was mixed for several hours at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 4 μg of antibody directed against Rpd3 or 1 μl of antibody directed against Sin3. Immune complexes were collected by mixing antibody- or mock-treated extracts with protein A-Sepharose for several hours at 4 °C. After several washes in binding buffer (see above), input extract, unbound supernatants, and bound bead material were subjected to Western analysis using antibody against the HA epitope tag. For Western blot analysis, beads and supernatant were boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer for 10 min and applied to 10% SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western blotting as described (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). Several yeast HAT complexes bind to Ni2+-agarose, which concentrates these activities from yeast whole cell extract for further purification (37Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 14: 312-315Google Scholar). We tested if HDAC activities might also be found in the Ni2+-agarose eluant to determine if this material might also serve as a starting point for purifying HDAC multiprotein complexes. Whole yeast cell extract of a Sds3-HAp strain was prepared and bound to Ni2+-agarose. The flow-through and eluates from Ni2+-agarose were then subjected to Mono-Q chromatography followed by Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). We detected three HDAC activities by this procedure. These included an Rpd3-containing complex of approximately 0.6 MDa (data not shown), which was found in the Ni2+-agarose flow-through and is presumably related to that described by Rundlett and co-workers (26Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We did not observe co-fractionation of Sds3-HAp with this Rpd3 complex (data not shown). Two additional HDAC complexes eluted together from the Ni2+-agarose but were separated on the subsequent Mono-Q column (Fig. 2 A). Using Western blot analysis we found that Rpd3p, Sin3p, and Sds3-HAp co-fractionated with the HDAC complex eluting at approximately 0.35m NaCl (Fig. 2 A). A second HDAC activity eluted at approximately 0.25 m NaCl, and subsequent Western blot analysis indicated that it co-elutes with Hda1p (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2HDAC activity profile of a Sds3-HAp expressing strain. A, the HDAC elution profile from a Mono-Q column shows two major HDAC activities. Subsequent Western blotting revealed that the complex eluting at 0.25 m NaCl co-eluted with Hda1p, whereas the complex eluting at 0.35 mNaCl co-eluted with Rpd3p, Sin3p, and Sds3-HAp. B, the HDAC activity profile of the 0.35 m Mono-Q complex when subsequently run on a Superose 6 gel-filtration column is shown. The HDAC activity, Sin3p, Rpd3p, and Sds3-HAp all co-eluted at a molecular weight of approximately 1.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 1Fractionation scheme for HDAC complexes used in this study. Shown is the fractionation of 0.6- and 1.2-MDa Rpd3p complexes, a 0.6-MDa Hda1p complex, and a 0.9-MDa breakdown Rpd3p complex found in an sds3 deletion strain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test if Sds3p is an actual component of the Rpd3p·HDAC complex, we tested for co-elution of Sds3-HAp with Rpd3p, Sin3p, and HDAC activity by gel filtration chromatography. Mono-Q fractions containing the Rpd3p complex from the Sds3-HA strain (fractions 28–34) were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Superose 6 size exclusion column. The HDAC activity eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 1.2 MDa (Fig. 2 B). This was consistent with our earlier findings showing the same molecular weight for this particular HDAC complex from a wild type strain (data not shown). Aliquots of fractions 16–24 of Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography were applied to SDS-PAGE. Subsequent Western blotting with antibodies for Rpd3p, Sin3p, and HA (Sds3p) demonstrated co-elution of all three of these proteins with the deacetylase activity peak (Fig. 2 B). The high molecular weight of this complex and the fact that it contains Sin3p and Rpd3p suggest that it is related to or identical to the complex described by Kasten and colleagues (28Kasten M.M. Dorland S. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4215-4221Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To confirm that Sds3p is a bona fide subunit of the 1.2-MDa Rpd3p complex, we tested for co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins and HDAC activity from the Superose fractions. We used fraction 19 of the Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography of the Sds3-HA strain, which corresponds to the HDAC activity peak (Fig. 2 B) and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Samples were incubated with HA antibodies coupled to beads, the beads were pelleted, and the HDAC activity of supernatant and beads was tested. Fig. 3 A shows that the HDAC activity was clearly immunoprecipitated with the HA antibodies, illustrating that Sds3p is part of the HDAC complex. As a control we incubated samples of a HDAC peak fraction of a Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography of a SDS3 + (WT) strain with HA antibodies coupled to beads. Fig. 3 B (group 1) shows that HDAC activity was not immunoprecipitated with the HA antibodies from this strain, ruling out any nonspecific interaction of HA antibodies with the Rpd3p complex. Moreover, the HDAC activity of the Rpd3p complex from both the Sds3-HA and wild type strains immunoprecipitated with Rpd3p antibodies coupled to beads (Fig. 3 B, groups 2 and 3). To further confirm the co-immunoprecipitation of Sds3p and Rpd3p, Western blots of the immunoprecipitations with anti-HA were performed. In Fig. 3 C (upper panel), Rpd3p and HA-Sds3p can be detected in the bead fraction using fraction 19 of the Superose 6 column of the Sds3p-expressing strain, whereas no signal is detectable in the supernatant. Lanes 2 and 3 of Fig. 3 C (lower panel) show co-immunoprecipitation of Rpd3p with antibody against Rpd3 using Superose 6 peak fraction of the WT, untagged strain. By contrast, no Rpd3p protein was immunoprecipitated with antibodies for HA from this strain (Fig. 3 C, lower panel, lanes 4 and5). Further confirmation that Sds3 associates with the Rpd3·Sin3 complex came from immunoprecipitation experiments performed in crude extracts. Antibodies directed against either Rpd3 or Sin3 immunoprecipitated Sds3 from whole cell extract (Fig. 3 D) (35Dorland S. Deegenaars M.L. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 573-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, antibody directed against Rpd3 was also able to immunoprecipitate Sin3 from the same extract (data not shown). These results indicate that, in addition to highly fractionated preparations, Rpd3, Sin3, and Sds3 associate within cell extracts. To investigate if the integrity of the 1.2-MDa HDAC complex was dependent on SDS3, we prepared whole cell extracts from a sds3Δ strain and applied it to Ni2+-agarose followed by Mono-Q chromatography. The HDAC activity in the fractions normally containing the WT 1.2-MDa Rpd3p complex (28Kasten M.M. Dorland S. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4215-4221Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M.

Genetics. 1994; 136: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was decreased (Fig. 4 A, HDAC activity ofsds3Δ) compared with that of wild type (compare with Fig. 2 A, HDAC activity of the Sds3-HAp-expressing strain). Subsequent Western blotting of fractions 19–32 of this Mono-Q column showed a different elution profile of Sin3p and Rpd3p. Both proteins eluted at a lower salt concentration from the column compared with wild type (0.2–0.3 m NaCl instead of 0.35 m NaCl). Rpd3p and Sin3p eluted in the range of Hda1p. Hda1p peaked with the main HDAC activity at fractions 22–24, which was comparable to the wild type elution pattern for Hda1p. To determine if the deletion of SDS3 affects not only the elution profile of Sin3p and Rpd3p, but also the integrity and activity of the complex, we pooled fractions 20–32 of the Sds3Δ Mono-Q chromatography, concentrated the material, and applied it to Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography. The HDAC activity was examined as described, and corresponding aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. Fig. 4 B shows that the main HDAC activity eluted at approximately 0.6 MDa and corresponds to Hda1p, indicating that the deletion of SDS3 does not affect a 0.6-MDa Hda1p complex. However, the remaining Rpd3 complex had a smaller molecular weight compared with wild type complex (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis revealed a signal for Rpd3 at fractions 20 and 21, which corresponds to an approximate molecular mass of 0.9 MDa. Importantly, this 0.9-MDa Rpd3 breakdown did not have HDAC activity. The elution of Sin3p from the Superose 6 column (Fig. 4 B) overlapped with that of Rpd3p. However, these proteins did not co-elute to the extent that they did from the wild type strain (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the association of Sin3p and Rpd3p was weakened in the absence of Sds3p. To confirm that Sin3p and Rpd3p could be chromatographically separated in the sds3Δ strain, we applied the concentrated Mono-Q pool (fractions 20–32, see Fig. 4 A) to an additional Superose 6 size exclusion column, using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART (Sensitive Methods And Recovery Technology) system, at 0.5 m NaCl. HDAC activity was measured, and Western blot analysis was performed (Fig. 5 A). The remaining HDAC activity eluted at 0.6 MDa and corresponded to Hda1p. Rpd3p was detected in fractions 24 and 25, which correspond to a molecular mass of approximately 0.9 MDa. Sin3p was now detected in the molecular range of 0.7–0.5 MDa. Thus, under these chromatographic conditions, Rpd3p and Sin3p were separated into distinct subcomplexes in the absence of Sds3p (Fig. 5 A). As a control, the concentrated Mono-Q pool of the Sds3-HA strain (fractions 20–32, see Fig. 2 A) was applied to Superose 6 on the SMART system under the same conditions. Fig. 5 B shows that two HDAC activities were separated. One activity corresponded to a 1.2-MDa complex, containing Sin3p, Rpd3p, and Sds3p, whereas the second activity, eluting at 0.6 MDa, corresponded to the Hda1p complex. This confirmed that the higher salt concentration used on this column did not cause a disruption of the WT Rpd3p·Sin3p·Sds3p complex. To understanding the detailed roles of Rpd3p·HDAC complexes, it will be necessary to identify the functions of other subunits of these multiprotein complexes. It was shown previously that Sin3p targets Rpd3p-dependent HDAC activity through interaction with the repressor protein Ume6 to certain promoters (19Kadosh D. Struhl K. Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 29Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that other subunits are required for the regulation of the enzymatic activity of HDAC complexes. Sap 30, for example, was identified as part of Sin3p·HDAC and Rpd3p·HDAC complexes in mammals and yeast (20Laherty C.D. Billin A.N. Lavinsky R.M. Yochum G.S. Bush A.C. Sun J.-M. Mullen T.M.

Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Michael H. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It appears to be required for the normal function of these complexes. Furthermore, Sap30 is capable of repressing transcription when tethered to DNA. This might indicate that Sap30 facilitates interactions of Sin3p·HDAC and Rpd3p·HDAC and might even recruit HDAC activity in the absence of Sin3p (20Laherty C.D. Billin A.N. Lavinsky R.M. Yochum G.S. Bush A.C. Sun J.-M. Mullen T.M. Davie J.R. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Molecular Cell. 1998; 2: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Disruption of SAP30 in yeast shows phenotypes comparable to disruption of SIN3 andRPD3, suggesting that it works in the same genetic pathway. Moreover, Sap30p and Rpd3p have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with antibodies against Rpd3p (40Zhang Y. Sun Z.-W. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Michael H. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Deletion of another yeast gene, SDS3, also showed similar phenotypes to deletions of SIN3 and RPD3. The yeast SDS3 gene was originally identified in a screen for mutations that cause increased silencing of a crippled HMRsilencer in a rap1 mutant background (33Vannier D. Balderes D. Shore D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 65: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). This screen identified more than 20 other genes, including SIN3 andRPD3. Subsequent analysis showed that SDS3 shares several transcription regulation properties with SIN3/RPD3, although epistasis tests of the silencing effect suggested thatSDS3 might differ in function, at least subtly, fromRPD3/SIN3 (33Vannier D. Balderes D. Shore D. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1343-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recent work has shown that sds3 mutants have phenotypes very similar to those seen in sin3 and rpd3 mutants, with transcriptional regulation of the same set of genes affected in all three mutants (35Dorland S. Deegenaars M.L. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 573-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The changes in transcriptional regulation seen inrpd3/sds3 and sin3/rpd3double mutants are no more severe than the single mutants. This genetic analysis indicates that SDS3 is in the same functional pathway as RPD3 and SIN3, and this idea is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments showing that Sds3p can associate with Sin3p (35Dorland S. Deegenaars M.L. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 573-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Sds3p is part of the Rpd3p·Sin3p complex, we reintroduced an HA-tagged SDS3 gene into thesds3Δ strain. The reintroduced gene rescued the complex. We used this strain to partially purify the complex and used Western blot analysis to illustrate co-elution of Sin3p, Rpd3p, and Sds3p. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using material obtained from the Sds3-HAp strain demonstrated that Sds3p is an integral part of the 1.2-MDa Rpd3p·Sin3p complex. We were able to immunoprecipitate Rpd3p and HDAC activity with antibodies against HA-tagged Sds3p. Deletion ofSDS3 had a significant effect on the Rpd3p·Sin3p complex. First, the size of the Rpd3p portion of the complex was reduced from approximately 1.2 to 0.9 MDa. Second, the association of Sin3p with the Rpd3p complex was weakened. Sin3p was chromatographically separable from Rpd3p in the absence of Sds3p. This result suggests that Sds3p promotes the interactions of Sin3p with Rpd3p or other components of the complex. Sds3p may not, however, be absolutely required for the interaction of Sin3p with the Rpd3p complex. At low salt concentration some Sin3p and Rpd3p co-elute in the absence of Sds3p and they can be co-immunoprecipitated from extract made from anSDS3 deletion strain. 2D. Stillman, personal communication. Finally, in the absence of Sds3p the Rpd3p complex lacked HDAC activity. Thus, the association of Sds3p, Sin3p, or another subunit that might dissociate in the absence of Sds3p is required for the ability of Rpd3p to act as a histone deacetylase. It is important to note, however, that the second Rpd3p-containing complex (0.6 MDa) identified in this study, which does not contain Sds3p, is fully active on histone substrates. Thus, in a different context, the HDAC activity of Rpd3 apparently functions in the absence of Sds3p. Alternatively, a different protein in the smaller complex may replace the function of Sds3p. In conclusion, our observations indicate that Sds3p is necessary to maintain the function of a yeast Sin3p·Rpd3p complex. Sds3p facilitates protein-protein interactions within the complex to maintain its structure and enzymatic activity. Sds3p might provide part of the linkage between the co-repressor region of the complex (Sin3p) and the deacetylase function (Rpd3p). Furthermore, disruption ofSDS3 abrogates the ability of the 1.2-MDa Rpd3·Sin3 complex to function as a histone deacetylase.

J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GnT-III catalyzes the attachment of a GlcNAc residue to a β1–4 mannose residue in the core region of N-glycans, as shown in Fig. 1. In an earlier study, we demonstrated that the bisecting GlcNAc on E-cadherin suppressed lung metastasis of melanoma cells (12Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism has not been fully investigated. The function of E-cadherin is also controlled via molecules from the cytoplasm, namely α-, β-, and γ-catenins (13Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 14Ozawa M. Baribabault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). The deletion or the mutational inactivation of β-catenin leads to the abolition of E-cadherin activity and tumor invasion (15Oyama T. Kanai Y. Ochiai A. Akimoto S. Oda T. Yanagihara K. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Shibamoto S. Ito F. Takeichi M. Matsuda H. Hirohashi S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6282-6287PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kawanishi J. Kato J. Sasaki K. Fujii S. Watanabe N. Niitsu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the biological significance of the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin has been examined by several groups (17Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Roy F.V. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 18Sommers C.L. Gelmann E.P. Kemler R. Cowin P. Byers S.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3544-3552PubMed Google Scholar, 19Müller T. Choidas A. Reichmann E. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10173-10183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Tsukatani Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is possible that this phosphorylation could disturb E-cadherin/cytoskeleton interactions (17Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Roy F.V. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). During cell migration, β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol in a free, uncomplexed, and tyrosine-phosphorylated form (19Müller T. Choidas A. Reichmann E. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10173-10183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, this type of β-catenin is not observed during the quiescent phase, suggesting that the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is linked to cell migration (20Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Tsukatani Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, increases in tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin are thought to contribute to the malignant progression and metastasis of tumor cells. It has been reported that EGF or v-src phosphorylates β-catenin in the case of breast cancer and MDCK cells (21Hamaguchi M. Matsuyoshi N. Ohnishi Y. Gotoh B. Takeichi M. Nagai Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 22Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 23Hazan R.B. Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). EGF receptor (EGF-R) is also a glycoprotein, and its sugar chain represents a potential substrate for GnT-III as well as E-cadherin. Therefore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin could be influenced by both aberrantly glycosylated EGF-R and E-cadherin. In this study, we report on an investigation of the effects of oligosaccharide modification by GnT-III on the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and cell mobility using three types of cancer cell lines. Our findings show that the pattern of β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation as the result of stimulation by EGF or transfection of constitutively active c-src was dramatically changed in the case of GnT-III transfectants.

Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A human colon cancer cell line, WiDr, was provided by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). A human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, was provided by the Japanese Health Science Foundation (Tokyo, Japan). B16-hm cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Huh7 and WiDr cells were cultured in RPMI. Each medium contained 100 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cell lines stably expressing GnT-lll were generated as described previously (12Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and vectors that were used were constructed as follows. A human GnT-lll cDNA (24Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Tohma T. Soejima M. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pCXN, which is regulated by the β-actin promoter and has a neo (G418)-resistant gene (25Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of this vector was transfected into Huh7 and WiDr cells with LipofectoAMINE reagent. Selection was performed via the addition of 600 μg/ml G418. One positive clone (Huh7-GIII) and one negative clone of Huh7 cells (Huh7-M) and two positive clones of WiDr cells (WiDr-GT1 and WiDr-GT2) and two negative clones of WiDr cells (WiDr-M1 and WiDr-M2) were randomly selected. The GnT-lll transfectants of B16-hm cells had previously been established by Yoshimura et al. (12Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). GnT-lll activity of various cells was assayed with high performance liquid chromatography using a fluorescence-labeled sugar chain as a substrate (26Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the expression of GnT-III mRNA was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was prepared from various cell lines according to the method reported previously (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 μg of RNAs were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde and transferred onto a Zeta-probe membrane by capillary action. Northern blot analysis of GnT-lll was performed as reported previously (28Miyoshi E. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Gu J. Sugiyama T. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3899-3902PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of proteins that had been extracted from mock and GnT-lll transfectants of B16-hm, Huh7, and WiDr cells were electrophoresed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C, the membrane filter was incubated with anti-human E-cadherin and anti-EGF-R and diluted with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T, 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. Each filter was washed 3 times with TBS-T for 10 min each and then incubated with TBS-T containing peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody to mouse lgG for anti-E-cadherin and rabbit antibody to sheep IgG for anti-EGF-R diluted to 1: 2500 with TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After the membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T for 10 min each, it was developed by an ECL according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Mock and GnT-lll transfectants of WiDr cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and incubated for 72 h. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min on ice and precleared by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads were added to the above supernatant and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotations. Protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads were precleared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. After incubation with 1 μg of anti-E-cadherin antibody for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotations, immune complexes were collected with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 FF beads. After washing with a lysis buffer 5 times, the complexes were released by boiling in Laemmli sampling buffer, separated by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h with E4-PHA lectin (10 μg/ml). E4-PHA lectin binds preferentially to bisecting GlcNAc residues, and the binding of E4-PHA is enhanced by the presence of bisecting GlcNAc structures (29Yamashita K. Hitoi A Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14753-14755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing 3 times with TBS-T for 10 min each, the membrane was incubated with TBS-T containing ABC kit for 1 h. After the membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T for 10 min each, it was developed by ECL according to the manufacturer's protocol. After submerging in stripping buffer (62.5 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 50 °C for 1 h, the membrane was blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, and then it was subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-E-cadherin monoclonal antibody as described above. Mock and GnT-III transfectants of WiDr cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on 6-cm dishes. The mobility of mock and GnT-III transfectants of WiDr cells after EGF treatment were continuously observed with an optical microscope Diaphoto 300 (Nikon, Japan). The intracellular distribution of β-catenin in mock and GnT-III transfectants of WiDr cells was investigated by photofluorescent immunochemical methods. Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on 8-well chamber slides, cultured for 48 h, and incubated for 24 h in RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. After treatment with EGF at the indicated time intervals, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, blocked, and permeabilized with 1% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with 1/50-diluted anti-β-catenin antibody at room temperature for 2 h with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% saponin. Primary antibody binding was detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibody to mouse lgG for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted under a Permafluor aqueous mounting medium. Stained cells were viewed with a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM410 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and subsequently handled using Adobe Photoshop. Mock and GnT-III transfectants of WiDr, B16-hm, and Huh7 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 on 10-cm dishes and incubated in normal conditions for 72 h. Those cells, in a subconfluent state, were further cultured for 24 h in RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nikken, Kyoto, Japan) containing 2% fetal calf serum and were then treated with 50 ng/ml EGF. After washing with an ice-cold solution of PBS for the indicated time intervals, the cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer (5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice and precleared to remove pellets (insoluble fraction) by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-β-catenin or anti-EGF-R antibody. Bound proteins were subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and directed by immunoblotting with anti-PY20. After reprobing and blocking the membrane, it was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-β-catenin or EGF-R as described above. To further investigate the importance of oligosaccharides on β-catenin phosphorylation, cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 24 h before EGF stimulation. The src expression vector, c-srcY527F, which is regulated by SV40 promoter and constitutively activated by mutation from 527 tyrosine to phenylalanine, was kindly provided by Dr. Fukuda (Ikeda City Hospital, Osaka, Japan) (30Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This vector was transfected into mock and GnT-III transfectants of WiDr cells with Effectene according to the standard protocol. After 48 h, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in these cells was investigated as described above. Although the GnT-lll activity of WiDr and Huh7 cells was quite low, WiDr-GT1, -GT2, and Huh7-GIII showed >100 times higher levels of GnT-lll activity than their mock transfectants (Fig.2). Northern blot analysis showed a high level of expression of GnT-lll mRNA in GnT-III-transfected WiDr and Huh7 cells, which is consistent with the observed enzyme activity (Fig.2 A) and suggests that the high levels of GnT-lll activity in WiDr-GT1, -GT2, and Huh7-Glll were due to the high transcriptional levels. Western blot analysis showed a high level of GnT-lll protein in GnT-lll transfectants (Fig. 2 B). Similar results of GnT-lll expression were observed in GnT-lll-transfected B16-hm cells (12Yoshimura M. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Taniguchi S. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The expression of E-cadherin and EGF-R was investigated by Western blot analysis. Whereas the expression of E-cadherin in B16-hm cells was increased in the case of GnT-lll transfectants compared with mock transfectants (3Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13811-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the level in the GnT-lll transfectants of WiDr and Huh7 cells was nearly the same compared with each mock transfectant. However, the molecular size of E-cadherin in GnT-lll-transfected WiDr and Huh7 cells was smaller than that in the mock transfectants, suggesting that an extension of N-oligosaccharide in E-cadherin had been suppressed by the action of GnT-lll (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). The level of EGF-R expression was very low in both mock and GnT-lll transfectants of B16-hm cells. In contrast, a high level of expression of EGF-R was observed in WiDr and Huh7 cells, and this level was nearly equal in both the mock and the GnT-lll transfectants. The molecular size of EGF-R in GnT-lll-transfected WiDr and Huh7 cells was smaller than that of the mock transfectants as well as in the case of E-cadherin (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). To further investigate the source of the differences in the molecular size of E-cadherin in mock and GnT-lll transfectants, lectin blot analysis on immunoprecipitated E-cadherin was performed using biotinylated E4-PHA. E-cadherin, which had been immunoprecipitated from WiDr-GT1, -GT2, and Huh7-Glll cells exhibited an increase in E4-PHA binding compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 3 B,a). An increase in E4-PHA binding to EGF-R immunoprecipitated from GnT-lll transfectants was also observed (Fig.3 B, b). These results indicate that GnT-lll transfection led to an increase in the number of bisecting GlcNAc residues on the N-glycans of E-cadherin and EGF-R in WiDr and Huh7 cells. When the cells were treated with EGF, the degree of cell-cell contacts became less strong in the mock cells. A typical pattern of changes in cell morphology was observed in WiDr cells (Fig.4 A). After 60 min, the morphology of the mock cells returned to the original shape. This change, however, was negligible in the case of GnT-lll transfectants. It is interesting to note that the intracellular localization of β-catenin was altered along with the morphological alteration of mock transfectants (Fig. 4 B). The localization of β-catenin was changed from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm after EGF treatment. In the GnT-lll transfectants, most of the β-catenin continued to remain distributed along the entire cell membrane after EGF treatment. Since EGF treatment is a well known method for stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, GnT-lll-transfected WiDr, B16-hm, and Huh7 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF. As shown in Fig. 5, a dramatic difference in tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was observed between GnT-lll and mock transfectants. When EGF was added to mock-transfected WiDr cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin increased within 15 min of EGF stimulation and persisted for at least 60 min. In contrast, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin were very low and increased only slightly at 15 min after EGF stimulation and then decreased in the GnT-III transfectants (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). In the case of B16-hm cells, the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin before EGF treatment was somewhat higher than that in the WiDr cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was slightly increased in mock cells after EGF treatment but was dramatically decreased in GnT-lll transfectants (Fig. 5 B,upper panel). In the case of Huh7 cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was much weaker than the B16-hm and WiDr cells. However, the difference of β-catenin phosphorylation between mock and GnT-lll transfectants of Huh7 cells was also observed. The degree of β-catenin phosphorylation at 30 min in GnT-lll transfectants was ∼70% that of mock transfectant levels (the mean of 3 experiments; Fig. 5 C, upper panel). Collectively, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin increased in mock transfectants of WiDr, B16-hm, and Huh7 cells, whereas it was suppressed or decreased in GnT-lll transfectants after EGF treatment. To verify whether or not GnT-lll transfection led to an alteration in EGF-R function, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of EGF-R after EGF treatment were investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, the levels of EGF-R phosphorylation were dramatically enhanced at 5 min after EGF treatment in both mock and GnT-lll transfectants of WiDr cells. The time course pattern of EGF-R phosphorylation in GnT-lll transfectants was quite similar to that of mock transfectants, suggesting that a similar signaling via EGF-R was transduced. Tunicamycin inhibits the N-glycosylation of glycoproteins in higher organisms by blocking the first step in biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. To determine the extent of involvement of oligosaccharides in β-catenin phosphorylation, mock and GnT-lll transfectants were treated with tunicamycin before the addition of EGF. As shown in Fig. 7, the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin for mock and GnT-lll transfectants became nearly identical after tunicamycin treatment. This result suggests a direct involvement of the bisecting GlcNAc residue in terms of variations in the phosphorylation of β-catenin for mock vis à vis GnT-lll transfectants. Thus, the inhibition of N-glycosylation in glycoproteins led to an alteration of the tyrosine phosphorylation in β-catenin after EGF treatment. To investigate the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin by other well known alternative pathways, a constitutively active form of src was transfected into GnT-lll and mock-transfected WiDr cells. In mock cells, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin by src transfection was elevated by more than five times the levels detected before transfection but was blocked by treatment with tunicamycin. In contrast, in the case of GnT-III transfectants, this elevation of β-catenin phosphorylation by this active form of src did not occur (Fig. 8,A and B). In many glycoproteins, particularly adhesion molecules and growth factor receptors on cell surfaces, N-linked oligosaccharides contribute to the folding, stability, and biological functions of the molecules (31Hakomori S-I. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 32Dwek R.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1234-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H. Willis K.J. Arulanandam A.R.N. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Science. 1995; 269: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the overexpression of GnT-III could lead to the modification of the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of β-catenin after EGF stimulation. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the amount of E-cadherin expression was increased in GnT-III-transfected mouse melanoma B16-hm cells, due to delayed turn-over, compared with mock transfectants (3Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13811-13815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Increases in E-cadherin levels on the cell surface enhanced cell-cell contacts and aggregations. However, in human cancer cells such as WiDr and Huh7, the expression of E-cadherin in GnT-III transfectants was equivalent to that of mock transfectants, although the oligosaccharide structures of E-cadherin were altered. Although morphological alteration such as compact organization was observed in GnT-III-transfected B16-hm cells, it was not observed in the cases of WiDr and Huh7 cells. These results suggest that proteases, which contribute to the cleavage of E-cadherin, are different between humans and mice. In contrast, both E4-PHA binding and the molecular size of EGF-R in these transfectants were changed, but the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R on GnT-III transfectants was observed to occur normally both in WiDr and Huh7 cells. Therefore, changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin are not due to EGF-R dysfunction but, rather, its induction by other factors such as downstream signals of EGF-R. We next examined changes in the integrity of cell-cell contacts between mock and GnT-III-transfected WiDr cells that had been treated with EGF. The GnT-III transfectants of WiDr cells barely changed in terms of cell morphology and cell-cell contact after EGF stimulation. Interestingly, changes in the cell-cell contacts of mock cells were consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of β-catenin. To further explore the relationship between cell-cell adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, the localization of β-catenin in mock and GnT-III transfectants of WiDr cells was investigated via an immunofluorescence method. The localization of β-catenin in mock transfectants was redistributed from the lineage of cell membrane to cytoplasm after EGF treatment. In contrast, the localization of β-catenin in GnT-III transfectants remained along the cell-cell contact region of adjacent-adhering cells after EGF treatment. Thus, the nature of cell-cell contacts for the GnT-III-transfected WiDr cells remained unchanged after EGF stimulation. An alteration in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is frequently associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. This phosphorylation is thought to be caused by the Src family of tyrosine kinases and receptors with tyrosine kinase activity such as growth factors like EGF, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and colony stimulating factor-1. In this study, EGF stimulation and src transfection were used to phosphorylate β-catenin. The tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin after EGF treatment was suppressed in GnT-III transfectants of three types of cancer cells. Changes in the phosphorylation pattern were a little different in B16-hm cells. A basal level of β-catenin phosphorylation was higher in B16-hm cells than WiDr cell and Huh7 cells. It might be due to metastatic potential of melanoma cells in terms of migration. In the case of Huh7 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin after EGF treatment was quite low and suppressed in GnT-III transfectants at 70% levels. This might be due to low potentials of cell migration in Huh7 cells. Since the modification of EGF-R oligosaccharide by GnT-III does not involve changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, another possibility for the suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin involves complex formation between β-catenin and aberrantly glycosylated E-cadherin. Conformational changes of this complex might inhibit the action of kinases for β-catenin. To further investigate this, we examined the effect of transfection of activated src into GnT-III transfectants. As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin by the src transfectant was dramatically suppressed in GnT-III transfectants as well as in the case of EGF stimulation (Fig.8). In addition, to ensure the involvement of changes in the N-linked oligosaccharides structure, cells were treated with tunicamycin, which inhibits the N-glycosylation of glycoproteins by blocking the first step in the biosynthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor. The tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in tunicamycin-treated mock transfectants was nearly identical to that of GnT-III transfectants, suggesting that changes in N-glycosylation directly affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. Levels of E-cadherin were increased in GnT-III transfectants of B16-hm cells but remained unchanged in GnT-III transfectants of WiDr and Huh7 cells. Nevertheless, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was suppressed in all GnT-III transfectants, suggesting that aberrant glycosylated E-cadherin is not involved in cell-cell contacts. In fact, it has been reported that E-cadherin oligosaccharides are not important for their function as an adhesion molecule (34Shirahashi Y. Nose A. Iwasaki K. Takeichi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1986; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the present study indicates that bisecting GlcNAc residues on E-cadherin affect intracellular signaling, such as β-catenin phosphorylation, which might be due to an alteration in the E-cadherin-catenin complex. The up-regulation of src or EGF signaling occurs during the progression of cancer (35Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the action of src or EGF to phosphorylate β-catenin is inhibited by GnT-III in vivo, GnT-III contributes to the progression of cancer in multi-steps. In summary, the addition of bisecting GlcNAc residues of E-cadherin-β-catenin by GnT-III down-regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, which might lead to the suppression of tumor progression such as invasion or metastasis."

In this study we further characterize the metabolism of C/EBPβ−/− mice during the perinatal period. Our goal is to identify the metabolic defect(s) responsible for the death of C/EBPβ−/− mice (B phenotype) and to determine the metabolic alterations that contribute to the hypoglycemia noted in mice of the A phenotype that survive until adulthood.

C/EBPβ−/− mice were obtained for this study by breeding female heterozygous animals with a targeted deletion in the gene for C/EBPβ with heterozygous male mice. The generation of the C/EBPβ−/− mice and their genetic background have been described by Screpanti et al. (9Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Briefly, ES cell clones from the CCE cell line (derived from the 129/Sv/Ev strain) carrying the mutation were injected into C57Bl6 blastocysts and were transplanted into the uteri of F1 (CBA×C57Bl6) foster mothers. Male chimeras were mated to MF1 females, and offspring heterozygous for the mutant allele were intercrossed to obtain homozygous mice. Adult male and female mice were 8–12 weeks old at the time of their use. Screening for C/EBPβ−/− mice was carried out by Southern analysis as described previously (9Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The animals were given free access to water and standard chow (Tekland F6 8664 containing 24% protein, 6% fat, and 4.5% crude fiber and the remainder carbohydrate). The composition of the high carbohydrate diet used in this study was described previously (11McGrane M.M. deVente J. Yun J. Bloom J. Park E.A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Wagner T. Rottman F.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11443-11451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were killed between 9 and 11 a.m., and where indicated, they were injected with Bt2cAMP (35 mg/kg of body weight) and theophylline (30 mg/kg of body weight). Mice were delivered at day 19 of gestation by cesarean section, and where indicated, they were injected with 125 mg of Bt2cAMP/kg of body weight (12Loose D. Shaw P. Krauter K.S. Robinson C. Englard S. Hanson R.W. Gluechsohn-Waelsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5184-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All pups were maintained in a humidicrib at 37 °C from birth to the completion of the experiment (up to 4 h). When the pups of phenotype B became lethargic due to a low blood glucose concentration, they were killed together with their littermates. Blood was collected by decapitation, blood glucose was measured using a Glucometer (Ames Products, Indianapolis, IN), and insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The liver was freeze-clamped, and total RNA was isolated as described below, glycogen was measured (13Lo S. Russell J.C. Taylor A.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1970; 28: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), and cAMP was determined using an enzyme immunoassay procedure. Glycogen was extracted from frozen livers by homogenization in 6% KOH, precipitated in ethanol, and hydrolyzed by boiling in 1 n HCl, and glucose was measured using a Beckman glucose analyzer. Statistical comparison between groups were performed using Student's ttest. Adult C/EBPβ−/−mice (A phenotype) were given 5 mg of glucose/kg of body weight orally by gavage and then fasted for 16 and 30 h. Blood was taken from the tails of mice at 30 min, and after 16 and 30 h of fasting, and plasma was separated and frozen. Blood glucose was measured using glucose oxidase method (Glucose Trender Kit, Sigma), whereas the concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate was determined using an enzymatic kit (Sigma). The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured on a Beckman automated analyzer at MetroHealth, Schwartz Nutrition Center, Cleveland, Ohio. Ammonia levels were measured on blood plasma after an overnight fast by an enzymatic kit (Sigma) based on reductive amination using l-glutamate dehydrogenase (14Kun E. Kearney E.B. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 1801-1806Google Scholar). Insulin was determined using a radioimmunoassay. Mice were fasted overnight before injecting into the tail vein 100 μl of 5 μCi ofd-[3-3H]glucose in 0.9% NaCl. Blood samples (25 μl) were obtained via the tail vein at 5, 15, and 30 min, and serum was used for the determination of glucose (glucose oxidase method). For the determination of radioactivity, 10 μl of blood was deproteinized with 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were evaporated to dryness overnight at 65 °C. The residues were reconstituted in 200 μl of water, 5 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and the samples were counted in a β-scintillation spectrometer. The rate of systemic glucose production was calculated using steady-state equations. (15Hetenyi Jr., G. Norwich K.H. Fed. Proc. 1974; 33: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar) Statistical comparison between groups was made using Student's ttest. Total RNA was extracted from the liver and kidney of mice using a Quick Prep total RNA kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by a modified acid-phenol guanidine thiocyanate procedure that has been described in detail previously (16Yoo-Warren H. Cimbala M.A. Felz K. Monahan J.E. Leis J.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10224-10229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (17Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 20 μg of total RNA. After electrophoresis of the RNA, RNA in the gels was transferred to Gene Screen Plus® membrane and hybridized with a probe. The probe for PEPCK was a 1.1-kilobase PstI fragment from the 3′-end of the PEPCK cDNA that was isolated as described previously (16Yoo-Warren H. Cimbala M.A. Felz K. Monahan J.E. Leis J.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10224-10229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe for glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-P) mRNA was a fragment (XbaI-PstI) from Glc-6-P cDNA (18Massillon D. Chen W. Barzilai N. Prus-Wertheimer D. Hawkins M. Liu R. Taub R. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ cDNA probe was a 0.7-kilobase BamHI fragment of the mouse cDNA (9Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The concentration of 18 S rRNA was determined by Northern blotting using a 752-nucleotide SacI fragment of a cDNA made from mouse 18 S rRNA. The signal from this hybridization was used to standardize the concentration of RNA on the Northern blots. All probes were labeled by using [α32P]dATP and the Strip-EZ RNA & DNA probe synthesis and removal kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). DNA was isolated from the tail of mice by lysis overnight at 55 °C in a buffer containing 50 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, and 24 μg of proteinase K. The DNA was digested with EcoRI, and the resulting fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, transferred to Gene Screen Plus®, and hybridized to a cDNA probe for C/EBPβ. Fed C/EBP β−/− mice and control littermates (WT) (8–12 weeks of age) were anesthetized with avertin, the liver was clamped, and a biopsy was taken for the measurement of basal cAMP. The mice were then injected with glucagon (50 μg/kg of body weight) via the portal vein, and the liver was biopsied 1 min later for the assay of glucagon-induced cAMP. C/EBPβ−/− and wild type mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of either theophylline (30 mg/kg of body weight) or RO 20-1724 (15 mg/kg of body weight). Thirty min later, the mice were anesthetized with avertin, the liver was clamped to prevent bleeding, and a liver biopsy was obtained. This was used for the basal concentration of cAMP. Glucagon (50 μg/kg of body weight) was injected into the portal vein, and one min later, another piece of liver was removed for the quantitation of cAMP. The liver samples were quickly frozen and assayed for cAMP using an enzyme immunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative competitive reverse transcription-PCR was used to measure the relative concentrations of phosphodiesterase mRNA in the livers of C/EBPβ−/− and control littermates. This procedure involves four steps: first, total RNA was isolated from the liver; second, reverse transcription was performed to create cDNAs; third, competitive PCR was preformed; and fourth, the DNA bands were quantitated. The RNA was isolated from the livers of mice using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech QuickPrep® total RNA extraction kit. Trace amount of genomic DNA was removed from the sample by treatment with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I, and the RNA was further purified by using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit®. Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 2 h using an Ambion RETROscript kit®. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mmdNTP, 5 μm random primer, 1× buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, and 50 mmdithiothreitol), 10 units of RNase inhibitor, and 100 units of reverse transcriptase. The competitive PCR reaction was carried out in a volume of 25 μl that contained 2 μl of the solution from the reverse-transcribed reaction with varied concentrations of an internal DNA control fragment as well as 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 50 mm KCl), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.8 μm mixed primer, and 0.5 units of SuperTaq DNA polymerase. The competitive PCR reaction was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. For each RNA sample, one reverse transcriptase reaction and eight PCR reactions were performed. The internal DNA control fragments were constructed as follows. The internal control for PDE3A was obtained from a 482-bp segment of the mouse PDE3A by deleting a 178-bp StyI fragment. The internal control for PDE3B was generated by deleting a 124-bp SacII segment of the 682-bp XhoI-StuI cDNA fragment, and for the PDE4B internal control, the fragment was obtained by deleting a 152-bp NsiI fragment from the 1968-bp EcoRI cDNA. After the PCR reaction, 8 μl of the reaction solution was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.6% agarose gel. The DNA bands were recorded using an IS-500 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp. San Leandro, CA), and the bands were quantitated with ImageQuant® software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The concentration of mRNA was determined as the point where the internal control band is equal in intensity to that of the test sample. To find that point, the ratios of the intensities of test cDNA and internal control bands were calculated and fitted to a regression curve using GraphPad Prism® software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Partially purified liver plasma membranes were prepared from the livers of C/EBPβ and control mice as described previously (19Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, the livers were homogenized (Dounce homogenizer) in 5 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mmbenzamidine, and 1 μm leupeptin) containing 0.25m sucrose. The homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended in 4 ml of the homogenization buffer. This suspension was layered onto 42.3% (w/w) sucrose in Buffer A and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 90 min in a SW40 rotor. The interfacial material was collected and washed twice with Buffer A by centrifuging at 86,000 × g for 45 min. The final pellet was re-suspended in Buffer A and stored at −80 °C until used. The yield of membrane protein, as determined by the method of Lowry (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was about 15 mg of protein/g of liver; there was no difference in the yield of liver membranes of C/EBPβ and control mice. Adenylyl cyclase activity in the membrane preparations was assayed for 10 min at 30 °C using 300 μm[α-32P]ATP as a substrate, as described previously (19Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 90: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Proteins were isolated from the livers of C/EBPβ−/− and wild type mice that were fasted overnight. A piece of frozen liver was homogenized in 15 ml/g of tissue of ice-cold homogenizing buffer consisting of 20 mmTris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton-X, 250 mm sucrose, and 50 μl/5 ml protease inhibitor mixture. Homogenates were centrifuged at 19,500 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate cellular debris, mitochondria, nuclei, and plasma membranes. This pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of homogenizing buffer (N fraction). The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (the cytosolic fraction) was removed, and the remaining pellet (particulate fraction) was re-suspended in 4 ml of homogenizing buffer. The particulate fraction contained membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. The concentration of protein was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The N fraction as well as the cytosolic and particulate fractions were sonicated for 20 s, and 20 μg of protein was diluted in 2× loading buffer containing 100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% β-mercaptomethanol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P® polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Coomassie stain (45% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 2.5% Coomassie Blue R250) to ensure even loading. For detection of the subunits of protein kinase A, RIα, RIIα, and Cα, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk in 10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, and Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h as follows: RIα (1:250), RIIα (1:1000), Cα (1:250), washed 3 times for 5 min each in TBS-T. The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h as follows: rabbit anti-chicken IgG peroxidase (1:1000) for RIα and anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase (1:1000) for RIIα and Cα. Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min each in TBS-T. All incubations were at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate® kit, and the density of the immunoreactive bands was measured by scanning densitometry. Western blots were first reacted with RIα, washed as described by Pierce, and reacted again with RIIα and then with Cα. The activity of protein kinase A (PKA) was measured using the Kemptide assay (21Kemp B.E. Cheng H.C. Walsh D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using cytosol and particulate fractions from the livers of fasted C/EBPβ−/− and wild type mice. Livers were homogenized in ice-cold Kemptide homogenizing buffer (1 g of liver/9 ml of buffer). The buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton-X, and 250 mmsucrose and 50 μl/5 ml protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenate was centrifuged at 19,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction was used for the measurement of PKA activity. Samples were diluted 1:1 with the Kemptide homogenization buffer, and the phosphorylation of the Kemptide substrate was measured using the PKA assay kit with [γ-32P]-ATP. Duplicate samples were assayed at 30 °C at 30 s intervals for 5 min for three C/EBPβ−/− and three wild type mice. The amount of labeled Kemptide was determined using a Beckman LS scintillation spectrometer. Activity in the presence of protein kinase A inhibitor peptide was subtracted from total activity to account for nonspecific activity. Phosphodiesterase activity in homogenates of livers from C/EBPβ−/− and control mice was determined by the procedure of Shahid and Nicholson (22Shahid M. Nicholson C.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 41: 129-150PubMed Google Scholar). About 0.2 g of liver was homogenized in 2 ml of Buffer A containing 0.25m sucrose using a glass homogenizer fitted with a motor-driven Teflon pestle. The homogenates were filtered though two layers of cheese cloth and used immediately for the assay of phosphodiesterase activity. Approximately 25 μg of protein equivalent of the homogenate was incubated with 1 μm[3H]cAMP for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by placing the samples into boiling water; the unhydrolyzed [3H]cAMP was separated by using alumina columns. In other assays in which the rate of cAMP degradation was also measured in the homogenate, 50 μg of protein was incubated with 1 μm[3H]cAMP at 30 °C, and the labeled cyclic nucleotide that was not hydrolyzed was measured at various time intervals up to 6 min by separation on alumina columns as described above. Mice heterozygous for a deletion in the gene for C/EBPβ were mated, and the pups were delivered by cesarean section on days 19 to 20 of gestation. The newborn mice were stimulated by touch after birth and maintained at 37 °C in a humidicrib. C/EBPβ−/− mice identified as being of the B phenotype were typically lethargic, had difficulty breathing, and remained cyanotic until they died within 2 h after delivery. The C/EBPβ−/− pups that were viable and breathing well were classified as the phenotype A. The plasma glucose levels of the B phenotype were about 50% that of control pups (wild type) (p < 0.01) (Fig.1). The C/EBPβ−/− mice (B phenotype) also had difficulty in mobilizing hepatic glycogen compared with wild type littermates, as was evident from the higher level (p < 0.03) of hepatic glycogen in these animals (70 mg/g of liver glycogen in C/EBPβ−/− versus 40 mg/g of liver glycogen in the wild type mice). Because maintenance of normal blood glucose in the neonate depends on the capacity to mobilize hepatic glycogen as well as to initiate hepatic gluconeogenesis, we measured the ability of these animals to initiate gluconeogenesis by measuring the level of mRNA for PEPCK, the last of the gluconeogenic enzymes to develop in newborn mammals (23Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the level of PEPCK mRNA in C/EBPβ−/− mice (B phenotype) was only 30% that of either the A phenotype or the wild type control animals. PEPCK gene expression is down-regulated by insulin (24Granner D.K. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the concentration of insulin in the plasma of C/EBPβ−/− mice and control mice; the insulin levels were found to be the same (data not shown).

Truncated polymerase chain reaction products of hsp70 generated N-terminal fragments of 43, 35, 29, and 22 kDa. The C terminus substrate-binding domain (28 kDa) was also expressed. The N-terminal ATPase domain (rP43) shared the binding specificity of hsp70, because only sulfogalactosyl ceramide and sulfogalactosyl glycerolipid were recognized by both TLC overlay and RELISA. The C-terminal domain showed no binding. SGL binding of rP29 and rP22 was severely reduced. The loss of SGL binding for rP35 by RELISA but not TLC overlay was considered as a function of receptor presentation. The truncation of rP43 to rP35 demonstrates that residues 318–387 (the base of the ATP binding cleft) are critical for high affinity SGL binding. Mutagenesis showed that Arg342 and Phe198 are crucial for this process. SGL binding, mediated by these conserved residues within the ATPase domain of hsp70, implies that this binding specificity is evolutionarily conserved.

The absence of extracellular ATP, however, likely renders the hsp70 chaperone function inoperative. Exogenous hsp70 has recently been shown to elicit a cytokine response after binding to the plasma membrane of monocytes (13Asea A. Kraeft S.-K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W.

We have previously described a novel function of hsp70 family members as cell surface-associated, SGL-specific adhesins. Anti-hsp70 antibodies prevent the attachment of mycoplasma (15Boulanger J.

We further found that heterogeneity within the lipid moiety of SGC can differentially modulate binding by prokaryote, as compared with eukaryote, hsp70s, which may reflect their different in vivo adhesin functions. Sulfogalactolipids are found in a variety of tissues and blood cells. SGC is the major sulfoglycolipid of the kidney (23Lingwood C. Hay G. Schachter H. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), brain, gastrointestinal tract (24Natomi H. Saitoh T. Sugano K. Iwamori M. Fukayama M. Nagai Y.

J. 1997; 14: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), been implicated in sperm/egg binding (31Tanphaichitr N. Tayabali A. Gradil C. Juneja S. Leveille M.C. Lingwood C.A. Mol. Reprod.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in red and white blood cells (34Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Low levels of SGG are found in the mammalian brain (35Ishizuka I. Inomata M. Ueno K. Yamakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 898-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where SGC and SGG synthesis are associated with myelination (36Burkart T. Hofmann K. Siegrist H.P. Herschkowitz N.N. Wiesmann U.N. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The correlation between SGL localization throughout the body, the tissue tropism of the bacterial pathogens, and the data suggesting that surface-associated hsp70 family members function as SGL-specific adhesins, indicate that hsp70-mediated SGL binding plays a physiological role in, at least, bacterial-host and germ cell binding. To investigate the molecular basis of SGL recognition by hsp70, we have used the recombinant murine testes-specific hsp70.2 gene product, rP70, as our model system (18Mamelak D. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The generation of recombinant truncated products of rP70 and site-directed mutagenesis identified a minimal region within the highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domain, critical for SGL binding. The localization of the SGL-binding site is considered within the context of both the chaperone and adhesin functions of hsp70s. The murine hsp70.2 gene was cloned, and its recombinant gene product, rP70, was expressed and purified as described previously (18Mamelak D. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cloning and purification of the hsp70 family member from C. trachomatis was recently described.2 Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells, Dpn1, and Pfu were purchased from Stratagene (Aurora, Ontario, Canada). Taq polymerase, all restriction enzymes, ligases, and respective buffers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA and protein standards were from Life Technologies, Inc. and Bio-Rad, respectively. TA cloning and pTrc expression vectors were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA). QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. A cobalt affinity column was purchased fromCLONTECH. The MinicyclerTM was purchased from Fisher. Mutagenic oligonucleotides encoding alanine substitutions for phenylalanine 198 and arginine 342 and a proline substitution for asparagine 171 were synthesized at the DNA Synthesis laboratories of the Hospital for Sick Children. Sequencing of R342A and F198A mutants was performed using the ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, whereas the N171P mutant was sequenced using the fmol® DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega, Madison, WI). NIH Image 1.61 (Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health) was used to quantitate TLC overlays. Secondary anti-sera (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin/goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase) were purchased from Bio-Rad. All antisera were used at dilutions optimized for each assay. EvergreenTM 96-well microtitre plates were purchased from Diamed (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The MRX microplate reader was from Dynatech Laboratories (Chantilly, VA). SGG was isolated from bovine testes (37Lingwood C.A. Murray R.K. Schachter H. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 769-774PubMed Google Scholar). Gangliosides were isolated from bovine brain, and neutral glycolipids were isolated from human kidney (38Pellizzari A. Pang H. Lingwood C.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). SGC, cholesterol sulfate, ampicillin, isopropylthiolglucoside, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside, and chloro-1-naphthol were purchased from Sigma. Micro BCA protein assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. One hundred micrograms of purified rP70 was excised from a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant, and subcutaneously injected into a New Zealand White rabbit. A secondary (booster) inoculation, using 100 μg of rP70 emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, was administered 10 days after the primary inoculation and repeated 1 month later. The following week the rabbit was bled from the marginal ear vein, and sera were collected and tested for optimal anti-P70 titer. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to amplify the coding region of the hsp70.2 ATPase domain and further C-terminally truncated products. In addition, the C-terminal segment corresponding to the substrate-binding domain of hsp70.2 (amino acids 381–633) was also amplified. The N terminus of this segment was designed to overlap with the C terminus of the ATPase domain. Oligonucleotide primers with restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI and HindIII synthetically engineered into the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, were employed in the amplification reaction. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the recombinant expression vector pDMX1.9 harboring the hsp70.2 gene as the template (18Mamelak D. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The MinicyclerTM (Fisher) was programmed with the following cycling parameters: a hot start at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by an initial cycle of denaturing for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by annealing for 2 min at 58 °C, and then extending for 2 min at 72 °C. The 2nd to 29th cycles involved denaturing for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by annealing for 1 min at 58 °C, and then extending for 2 min at 72 °C. The 30th and final cycle is similar to the middle cycles except that the final extension time at 72 °C was 10 min. Pfu was employed as the polymerase for these reactions. Taq polymerase was added to the amplified reaction after polymerase chain reaction for 10 min at 72 °C with no cycling. Amplified products corresponding to fragments of 1160, 950, 788, 593, and 750 base pairs encoding amino acids 1–387, 1–317, 1–263, 1–198, and 381–633, respectively, were ligated into pCRTMII (Invitrogen). Derivatives of E. coli strain DH5α, transformed with 50 ng μl−1 of DNA from each ligation reaction, were selected on LB agar containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 40 μg ml−15-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Plasmid DNA was isolated and digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the released inserts were ligated into complementary sites of the pTrcHisB expression vector, yielding recombinant vectors pTrc-43, pTrc-35, pTrc-29, pTrc-22, and pTrc-Cterm. Derivatives of E. coli DH5α harboring these vectors were selected on LB agar containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. Restriction analysis of recovered plasmid DNA confirmed the presence of recombinant vectors with appropriate size inserts. Aliquots of overnight cultures of E. coli strain DH5α harboring the recombinant expression vectors were diluted 1:1000 into LB supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and grown (37 °C, 250 rpm) to an A600of 0.6. Expression of the truncated hsp70.2 gene products was induced upon the addition of isopropylthiolglucoside (1 mm). After a 5-h induction growth period, cultures were harvested (10,000 rpm, 5 min), and pellets were lysed with Buffer A (8m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8). The supernatant was applied to a cobalt affinity column (CLONTECH) and washed three times with Buffer A prior to eluting the recombinant proteins with Buffer B (8m urea, 20 mm MES, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6). All protein samples were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The rP70 mutants F198A and R342A were generated by the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using mutagenic oligonucleotides encoding alanine substitutions for phenylalanine 198 and arginine 342. The steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, a mutagenic oligonucleotide encoding a proline substitution for asparagine 171 was designed complementary to the template DNA, and mutagenesis was performed by the method described by Kunkel et al. (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Isolated plasmid DNA harboring the F198A and R342A mutations was confirmed by sequencing with oligonucleotide primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the N-terminal ATPase domain. The N171P mutation was confirmed by sequencing plasmid DNA with a primer designed 90 base pairs upstream from the proline substitution using the fmol® DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega). Expression and purification of site-specific mutants was performed as described above. Protein samples were separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. For Western blotting, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked with 5% milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 in 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, for 0.5–1 h at room temperature. Western blots were probed with the primary antibody anti-rP70 (1:1000 in blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (diluted 1:2000 in 50 mm TBS), was incubated with the nitrocellulose for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was visualized with chloro-1-naphthol (28Lingwood C.A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Glycolipids (5 μg) were separated on thin layer chromatography plates using a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:KCl (65:25:4) (v/v). For dose-response assays 1–10 μg of SGC/SGG was used. The plates were dried, and the reference plate was treated with orcinol to reveal the positions of the (glyco)lipids. All other plates were soaked in a solution of 0.5% PIBM and hexane for 5 min with gentle agitation, dried, and then immersed again for 3 min (41Fredman P. Mattsson L. Andersson K. Davidsson P. Ishizuka I. Jeansson S. Mansson J.-E. Svennerholm L. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After drying, the plates were sprayed with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm TBS) and incubated facedown for 1 h. The blocking buffer was removed, and protein (5 μg/ml in blocking buffer) was added to the plates. After a 2-h incubation, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline four times prior to adding anti-rP70 (1:1000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h. The plates were washed as above and incubated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary anti-sera (1: 2000 in 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm TBS) for 1 h. After a final wash, plates were turned faceup, and bound protein was visualized by developing with chloro-1-naphthol. All steps were performed at room temperature. Developed plates were scanned, and the density of the signal resulting from protein-SGL binding was quantified using NIH Image. Stock solutions of all lipids were prepared in ethanol. Lipids at specified concentrations were applied, in 50-μl aliquots, to the wells of microtitre plates and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature. The wells were blocked with blocking reagent (200 μl/well 2% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm TBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 mmhistidine) for 1 h. (Histidine was included in the blocking and washing buffers as a means of preventing any nonspecific interactions between the His6-tagged proteins and the wells of the microtitre plate. It has been our experience that His6-tagged proteins can bind certain plastics, 3D. Mamelak, unpublished observations. which is dramatically reduced by the addition of histidine.) After washing the plates with Buffer C (200 μl/well blocking reagent diluted 10-fold), recombinant protein (50 ng/100 μl) with or without heparin (1 mm) was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. Following washing with Buffer D (0.2% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm TBS, pH 7.4), anti-rP70 anti-sera (1:1000 in Buffer D) was added in 100-μl/well aliquots and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed with Buffer D, and 100 μl/well goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary anti-sera (1:2000 in Buffer D) was added for 1 h. After a final wash, the plates were rinsed once with 50 mm TBS, pH 7.4. Freshly prepared 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) solution (0.5 mg/ml 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), 3 μl/ml hydrogen peroxide in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4) was added to the wells in 100-μl aliquots. The plates were covered with tin foil and allowed to develop for 30 min in the dark. Protein-glycolipid binding was determined by measuring the absorbance of each well at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer. Plotted values represent a mean of triplicates adjusted for the plate background. Plate background values were taken as the absorbance readings of protein bound to uncoated wells. For each incubation step, the plates were sealed with Parafilm to prevent evaporation. All steps were performed at room temperature. Although the RELISA is an excellent comparative tool, because of the indirect nature of this immunoassay, direct kinetic parameters cannot be calculated. However, regression analysis was performed to compare the relative binding affinities where applicable. The polymerase chain reaction was successfully employed to amplify the N-terminal ATPase coding region of hsp70.2 and C-terminal truncated segments using specifically designed oligonucleotide primers listed in TableI. All amplified products were cloned, expressed, and purified (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis confirmed the base pair substitutions TTT→GCT, CGC→GCC, and AAT→CCT, yielding the rP70 site-specific mutants F198A, R342A, and N171P, respectively. The apparent molecular weights of each truncated and site-directed mutant protein were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transfer of the purified protein products to nitrocellulose and probing with anti-rP70 anti-sera demonstrated equal reactivity with all products, showing a single major immunoreactive species in each case (Fig. 1).Table IOligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction productsUpstream and downstream polymerase chain reaction primersAmplified regionAmino acidsSize of expressed product1-aThe histidine tag adds 3000 kDa to the molecular mass.kDa1-bBold nucleotides highlight the position of the synthetically engineered restriction enzyme site EcoRI in the 5′ strand and HindIII in the 3′ strand.5′(5′-TCAGGAATTCATGTCTGCCCGCGGCCC-3′)1–11601–38743 3′(5′-CAAAGCTTCTTGTCGCCGATGAGGATAGC-3′) 5′(5′-TCAGGAATTCATGTCTGCCCGCGGCCC-3′)1–9501–31735 3′(5′-CAAAGCTTCAGGGTCCCTCGGAAGAGATC-3′) 5′(5′-TCAGGAATTCATGTCTGCCCGCGGCCC-3′)1–7881–26329 3′(5′-CAAAGCTTCACAGCGCGCTTGTTGGGCCC-3′) 5′(5′-TCAGGAATTCATGTCTGCCCGCGGCCC-3′)1–5931–19822 3′(5′-GAAAGCTTGAGCACGTTCTTCTCGCCGCC-3′) 5′(5′-CAGAATTCGCTATCCTCATCGGCGACAAG-3′)1150–1899381–63328 3′(5′-TGCAAAGCTTCTAGTCCACTTCCTCGAT-3′)Mutagenic primersAmino acid mutation1-cNucleotide substitutions are highlighted in bold.5′ACAACGCGTAGTAGGGACTCGGGTGTCGTC3′N171P5′GGCGAGAAGAACGTGCTCATCGCTGACCTGGGCGGCACC3′F198A5′GCTGGTGGGCGGCTCAACCGCCATCCCTAAGATCCAGAAG3′R342A1-a The histidine tag adds 3000 kDa to the molecular mass.1-b Bold nucleotides highlight the position of the synthetically engineered restriction enzyme site EcoRI in the 5′ strand and HindIII in the 3′ strand.1-c Nucleotide substitutions are highlighted in bold. Open table in a new tab The highly conserved N-terminal 43-kDa fragment of the hsp70.2 gene product bound the sulfogalactolipids, SGC, and SGG by either TLC overlay (Fig. 2) or RELISA (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the recombinant N-terminal domain product, rP43, maintained the SGL binding specificity of rP70 (18Mamelak D. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), because no binding was detected to other negatively charged glycolipids (GM1), sulfated lipids (cholesterol sulfate), the desulfated derivative of SGC (GC), or ganglioseries (Gg3) or globoseries (Gb4) neutral glycolipids (Figs. 2 and 3). Coincubation with heparin did not affect the ability of rP70 to bind SGC/SGG (Fig. 3). The C-terminal 28-kDa fragment (substrate-binding domain) of rP70 showed no binding to SGC, SGG, or any other glycolipid tested (Figs. 2 and 3). These results demonstrate that the SGL binding epitope of rP70 is distinct from the heparin-binding domain (42Hansen L.K. O'Leary J.J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and is localized only within the highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domain of hsp70.Figure 3Glycolipid binding specificity of rP70 and the N- and C-terminal domains. Both rP70 (A) and rP43 (C) specifically bound SGC and SGG but not the other glycolipids tested.

The binding of rP35 to SGC was similar, even enhanced, compared with rP70 and rP43. rP70, rP43, and rP35 bound SGG in preference to SGC. Binding of SGG by rP29 and the smallest recombinant product, rP22, was severely reduced (Fig. 2). SGC binding was greatly diminished for the rP29 and eliminated for the 22-kDa recombinant fragment. The truncated derivatives rP35, rP29, and rP22 were found to bind very weakly to GC but not to any other lipid tested. The ability of rP70 and its truncated derivatives to bind increasing concentrations of SGC and SGG was also compared by RELISA (Fig. 4). Dose-dependent binding to SGC (Fig. 4 A) or SGG (Fig. 4 B) was seen for rP70 and rP43. Similar binding was observed for rP70 and rP43 to both SGC/SGG. The binding of rP35, rP29, and rP22 to both SGC and SGG was not above background over the entire lipid concentration range (Fig. 4, A and B). The site-specific mutants of rP70 retained reactivity with the anti-hsp70 antiserum (Fig. 1). The SGL binding of N171P was not reduced relative to wild type (Fig.5 A). However, N171P bound SGC and SGG in a manner similar to the hsp70 from C. trachomatis, for which (unlike rP70) binding was dependent on PIBM pretreatment (Fig. 5 A). The binding of F198A and R342A was significantly reduced (Fig. 5 B), particularly for SGC. SGC/SGG binding relative to wild type was quantitated by digital image analysis as indicated. At 10 μg of SGL, F198A SGC binding was reduced 90%, and SGG binding was reduced 70%; R342A SGC binding was decreased by 85%, and SGG binding was decreased by 55%. Binding of rP70 to 1 μg of SGG and 2.5 μg of SGC could be detected. F198A binding was detectable only above 5 μg of SGC/SGG. Binding of R342A to SGC was only observed above 7.5 μg, whereas SGG binding was detectable only above 2.5 μg. rP70 showed a similar dose response for binding SGC and SGG by RELISA (Fig. 6). No binding was detected to GC. The recombinant C-terminal substrate-binding domain showed no binding to increasing concentrations of SGC/SGG or GC. Whereas the N171P mutant showed efficacy of SGL binding equivalent to wild type, the F198A and R342A mutants showed defective SGL binding by RELISA. At 200 ng of SGC/SGG, binding was reduced by 62 and 56%, respectively, for R342A and 37 and 28%, respectively, for F198A relative to rP70. The SGC/SGG binding affinity, as reflected by the initial slope of the binding curve, was reduced by 25 and 46%, respectively, for F198A and 53 and 81%, respectively, for R342A.

Circular dichroism revealed large tertiary structural alterations in the subunits upon subunit exchange and packing into heteroaggregates, indicating specific homologous and heterologous interactions between the subunits. Subunit exchange also resulted in quaternary structural changes as demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. Interestingly, we found time-dependent changes in chaperone-like activity against the dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of insulin, which correlated with subunit exchange and the resulting tertiary and quaternary structural changes. Heteroaggregates of varying subunit composition, as observed during eye lens epithelial cell differentiation, generated by subunit exchange displayed differential chaperone-like activity. It was possible to alter chaperone-like activity of preexisting oligomeric sHSPs by alteration of subunit composition by subunit exchange.

In the lens, αA- and αB-crystallins are expressed differentially, with αB-crystallin being expressed earlier in the lens epithelial cells; the ratio of αA- to αB-crystallin increases during differentiation to fiber cells (26Delcour T.

The significance of this differential expression is not clearly understood. It is not clear as to how the two subunits interchange after expression, leading to the formation of the heteroaggregate. The arrangement of αA- and αB-crystallin subunits in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate is also speculative. α-Crystallin is normally isolated as an oligomeric complex with an average of 40 subunits and a molecular mass of 8 × 105 Da (6Bloemendal, B., and Bloemendal, H.

Exchange of subunits between the native and phosphorylated forms of α-crystallin has also been detected (43van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J.

These findings suggest that the subunits of α-crystallin are freely exchangeable, indicating a dynamic structure for α-crystallin and therefore its polydisperse character. Moreover, the demonstration of mixed aggregates of αB-crystallin and HSP27 in human heart and in vitro(48Zantema A. de Jong E. Lardenoije R. van der EB A.J. J.

The relevance of subunit exchange with regard to the functionality of small HSPs has not been investigated. Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin is temperature-dependent (52Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 54Rao C.M.

The enhanced chaperone-like activity at elevated temperatures is due to a temperature-induced structural perturbation that leads to the concomitant exposure of appropriately placed hydrophobic surface(s), which sequester aggregation-prone proteins (52Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exchange of subunits between α-crystallin molecules is also temperature-dependent (43van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 44Bova M.P. Ding L.-L. Horwitz J. Fung K.-K. J. Biol.

This result indicates that the structurally perturbed form of α-crystallin, which displays higher chaperone-like activity, exchanges subunits. Earlier studies on the subunit exchange of α-crystallin have investigated the dependence of subunit exchange on experimental parameters such as temperature, pH, salt concentration, and the presence of calcium ions (43van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The functional significance of subunit exchange is, however, not known. In this study, we have investigated the subunit exchange between αA- and αB-crystallin homoaggregates and studied the consequent time-dependent structural and functional changes. Our results indicate that the packing of subunits in α-crystallin involves specific interactions between αA- and αB-crystallins that alter the structure of the individual subunits. We found that packing-induced structural changes in the subunits affect the chaperone-like activity of the proteins. We also demonstrate in vitro that altering the composition of heteroaggregates by the incorporation of αB-crystallin subunits by subunit exchange can modulate chaperone-like activity. We feel that this is of significance, as it is known that αB-crystallin expression increases under a variety of stress conditions. αB-Crystallin expressed under stress conditions can incorporate into preexisting oligomeric small HSPs to increase/modulate its chaperone-like activity. Although the modulation of the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin in vitro by temperature (52Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Our results demonstrate that the rearrangement of subunits in α-crystallin, due to its dynamic quaternary structure, may provide a possible mechanism to regulate its chaperone-like activity in vivo. Calf lens α-crystallin was isolated and purified as described earlier (57Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The fractions corresponding to α-crystallin were pooled and concentrated at 4 °C using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit with Mr30,000 cutoff. The concentrated solution of α-crystallin was stored in Tris-HCl buffer at 4 °C. α-Crystallin was used as the heteroaggregate of αA-and αB-crystallins. The ratio of αA- to αB-crystallin was ∼3:1 (w/w) in this heteroaggregate as determined by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The subunits of α-crystallin, αA- and αB-crystallins, were separated and purified on a C4 reverse-phase column using a water/acetonitrile gradient containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. The peaks corresponding to αA- and αB-crystallins were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Homoaggregates of αA- and αB-crystallins were generated as described earlier (9Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Homoaggregates of αA- and αB-crystallins, filtered separately through 0.45-μm Millipore filters, were mixed at various ratios (5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 (w/w) αA/αB-crystallin) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl. The exchange of subunits was initiated by incubation at 37 °C and stopped by cooling to 4 °C. To monitor the rate of subunit exchange, the homoaggregates were mixed at a ratio of 3:1 (w/w) αA/αB-crystallin and incubated at 37 °C. Samples were taken at various intervals of time (20, 40, and 60 min and 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h) and transferred to 4 °C to stop further exchange of subunits. As a control, a sample was kept at 4 °C for 24 h without exposure to a temperature of 37 °C. This was done to check if any residual exchange occurred at 4 °C. These samples were used for CD, gel filtration, and protection assays to measure chaperone-like activity. The extent of exchange was monitored by native isoelectric focusing in the pH range of 3–10. Incubation at 37 °C for 24 h was sufficient to ensure complete exchange. Homoaggregates and heteroaggregates resulting from subunit exchange experiments were analyzed on acrylamide gels (3% T, 3% C) containing 13% (v/v) glycerol and an ampholyte mixture of the following composition: 1.81% (v/v) Pharmalytes 6–8, 2.26% (v/v) Pharmalytes 3.5–10, and 1.81% (v/v) Pharmalytes 2.5–5. Gels (10 × 20 cm with a thickness of 1 mm) were cast between GelBond film (supported on a glass plate) and a glass plate treated with dimethyldichlorosilane. Flat bed electrophoresis was carried out in an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech electrophoresis unit using strips soaked in 1 m phosphoric acid and 1 m sodium hydroxide and an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech constant power supply unit. Limit settings were 2500 V and 70 mA. Prefocusing was carried out for 45 min at a 30-watt constant power supply. Subsequently, the samples were focused for 30 min at 15 watts and then for 120 min at 30 watts. A Julabo thermostatted water bath was used to maintain a constant temperature of the gel bed at 4 °C. The pH gradients were determined by simultaneously running pI markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These were further confirmed by cutting the gel to 0.5-cm pieces and extracting the ampholytes with 2 ml of water for 48 h. The pH of the resulting solution was measured. After the gels were fixed for 1 h in an aqueous solution of 30% (v/v) ethanol and 11.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and rinsed with 2% (v/v) acetic acid, they were stained for 45 min in a solution of 1.15% (w/v) Coomassie Blue dye (BDH, page blue 83) in 25% (v/v) ethanol and 8% (v/v) acetic acid until a clear background was obtained. Insulin at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl) in the presence or absence of a 0.1 mg/ml concentration of the various reconstituted proteins was equilibrated at the required temperature for 10 min with constant stirring in the cuvette using a Julabo thermostatted water bath. The actual temperature in the cuvette was monitored with a Physitemp Microthermocouple thermometer system. The reduction of insulin was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of 1 m DTT to 1.5 ml of sample, and the extent of aggregation was monitored by measuring the scattering at 90° with the excitation and emission monochromators in a Hitachi-4000 fluorescence spectrometer set at 465 nm and excitation and emission band passes at 1.5 nm. Results are expressed as percentage protection. Percentage protection is calculated as follows: (It −It+α)/It, whereIt is the intensity of scattered light for target protein insulin and It+α is the intensity of scattered light in the presence of homoaggregates or heteroaggregates of αA- and αB-crystallins. The CD measurements were carried out in 10 mm phosphate buffer using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. αA- and αB-crystallin concentrations were 1.0 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). Water-jacketed 1- and 0.01-cm path length cells were used for recording near- and far-UV CD spectra, respectively. αA- and αB-crystallins at a ratio of 3:1 (w/w) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml were used for the temperature-dependent subunit exchange and the associated CD measurements. Spectra of the mixture of homoaggregates (3:1 αA/αB-crystallin) were recorded prior to and after subunit exchange (by incubating at 37 °C). Sample temperature was maintained at 15 °C in water-jacketed sample cells of 1 and 0.01 cm using a Julabo thermostatted water bath. In another experiment, subunit exchange was carried out in the water-jacketed sample cell by maintaining the sample temperature at 37 °C. Spectra were acquired at 15-min intervals initially and later at 0.5- and 1-h intervals. The shutter was kept closed during incubation intervals to prevent possible photodamage to the protein. The sample temperature was monitored using a Physitemp Microthermocouple thermometer. αB-Crystallin and, to a much lesser extent, αA-crystallin are found as homoaggregates in a variety of tissues, including the brain, spleen, and heart (10Bhat S.P.

In the lens, however, the two proteins are found to exist only as a heteroaggregate, α-crystallin, although there has been a report showing that αB-crystallin may exist in minute amounts as an independent homoaggregate in the lens (59Bhat S.P. Horwitz J. Srinivasan A. Ding L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 102: 775-781Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin from the mammalian lens is a heteroaggregate of αA- and αB-crystallins present at a molar ratio of 3:1. The significance of this ratio, if any, is not clear. Sun and Liang (45Sun T.-X. Liang J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) found that αA-crystallin at a ratio of 3:1 αA/αB-crystallin is most efficient in prevention of thermal aggregation of αB-crystallin. The composition of the α-crystallin heteroaggregate varies with age and during the differentiation of the lens epithelial cells to fiber cells (26Delcour T. Papaconstantinou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is known that homoaggregates of αA- and αB-crystallins can exchange subunits among themselves as well as with the α-crystallin heteroaggregate (43van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This observation led to the proposal of a “dynamic quaternary structure” model of α-crystallin that can freely exchange subunits (43van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 3488-3493Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is possible to produce heteroaggregates of varying subunit composition by co-refolding αA- and αB-crystallins in various ratios (64Thomson J.A. Augusteyn R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 65Van Kamp G.J. Van Kleef F.S.M. Hoenders H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 342: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The presence of two types of subunits in the α-crystallin heteroaggregate and the dynamic and variable nature of this aggregate raise questions about the packing of subunits in it. Are the interactions between the subunits nonspecific, dictated mainly by hydrophobic interactions, or are there any specific and preferential interactions? Are the subunits packaged in the heteroaggregate more like rigid spheres, or do the subunits show a degree of structural flexibility during packaging in the heteroaggregate? These questions gain relevance in the light of the observations that α-crystallin as well as both homoaggregates of its individual subunits differ in their stability and the efficiency of their chaperone-like function (9Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The exchange of subunits occurs efficiently only at temperatures close to 37 °C, but not below 15 °C (43van den Oetelaar P.J.M. van Someren P.F.H.M. Thomson J.A. Siezen R.J. Hoenders H.J.

We have used this temperature dependence of subunit exchange to control the extent of subunit exchange between homoaggregates of αA- and αB-crystallins by allowing exchange at 37 °C and stopping it at 4 °C. We hypothesized earlier that αB-crystallin, due to the higher chaperone-like activity and propensity for structural change, may modulate the chaperone-like ac"

We demonstrate that the retinoblastoma protein RB plays a major role in suppressing pol III transcription in growth-arrested fibroblasts. RB knockout cells are compromised in their ability to down-regulate pol III following serum withdrawal. RB binds and represses the pol III-specific transcription factor TFIIIB during G0 and early G1, but this interaction decreases as cells approach S phase. Full induction of pol III coincides with mid- to late G1 phase, when RB becomes phosphorylated by cyclin D- and E-dependent kinases. TFIIIB only associates with the underphosphorylated form of RB, and overexpression of cyclins D and E stimulates pol III transcription in vivo. The RB-related protein p130 also contributes to the repression of TFIIIB in growth-arrested fibroblasts.

One example that has been added recently to the growing list of RB-binding proteins is the RNA polymerase (pol)1III-specific factor TFIIIB (5Chu W.-M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Schmid C.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation and cofractionation experiments demonstrated a stable association between endogenous cellular RB and TFIIIB (6Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this interaction was shown in studies of RB knockout mice, since primary fibroblasts from Rb−/− mice display elevated TFIIIB activity relative to fibroblasts derived from their wild-type siblings (6Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results establish TFIIIB as a bona fide target for repression by RB. Similar approaches have shown that TFIIIB is also bound and repressed by the RB-related proteins p107 and p130 (7Sutcliffe J.E. Cairns C.A. McLees A. Allison S.J. Tosh K. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4255-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). TFIIIB is required for the expression of all pol III templates (reviewed in Refs. 8Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). It serves to recruit the polymerase to a promoter and position it over the transcription start site (10Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). By interacting with this general factor, RB appears able to regulate the expression of all pol III-transcribed genes, including tRNA, 5 S rRNA, U6 small nuclear RNA, VA1, and Alu genes (5Chu W.-M.

Since a high rate of tRNA and rRNA synthesis is required to sustain rapid growth, it has been speculated that the inhibition of pol III transcription may contribute to the growth suppression capacity of RB (12Nasmyth K.

Alzuherri H.M. Cairns C.A. McLees A. White R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RB function is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (reviewed in Refs. 2Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 3Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar and Ref. 15Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate RB partially and the process is completed by cyclin E-CDK2 (16Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The action of cyclin E-CDK2 appears to depend on prior phosphorylation by the cyclin D-dependent kinases (17Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). At least 10 serine and threonine residues can become phosphorylated in RB (2Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Once hyperphosphorylated, RB loses its ability to bind to many of its targets and function as a growth suppressor (2Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This occurs at the G1/S phase transition, in parallel with the synthesis of cyclins D and E (2Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The cyclin D-dependent kinases become active in mid- to late G1, at a stage called the restriction, or R, point when cells lose their serum dependence (18Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). Cyclin E-CDK2 is activated shortly afterward, as cells leave G1 phase (18Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). RB is then maintained in the hyperphosphorylated state throughout S, G2, and M phases, until it is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 at the end of mitosis (15Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In cycling cells, therefore, the underphosphorylated form of RB is only present during the early period of G1. However, it is also found in resting G0 cells, which do not express significant levels of cyclins D and E (3Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The level of pol III transcription decreases significantly when growing fibroblasts are deprived of serum (19Johnson L.F. Abelson H.T. Green H. Penman S. Cell. 1974; 1: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Mauck J.C. Green H. Cell. 1974; 3: 171-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is likely to reflect a diminished requirement for protein production. Although the switch between G0 and G1 phases is the principle determinant of proliferation rate in mammalian cells, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for regulating pol III activity during this transition are largely uncharacterized. This constitutes an important gap in our current understanding, since the rate of pol III transcription will undoubtedly have a major influence on the growth and proliferation of cells. One study concluded that a specific reduction in TFIIIB activity was responsible for down-regulating pol III transcription in growth-arrested cells, although the molecular details were not determined (21Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, another laboratory demonstrated that HeLa cells down-regulate pol III transcription when grown in low serum due to a decrease in the activity of TFIIIC2 (22Hoeffler W.K. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is associated with a specific reduction in the levels of an essential subunit called TFIIICβ (23Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, HeLa cells continue to grow actively under the low serum conditions used in these studies (22Hoeffler W.K. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and may not provide a clear indication of how pol III is regulated during exit from the cell cycle. We have therefore investigated the regulation of pol III transcription during the transition between resting and growing states in untransformed fibroblasts. When such cells are stimulated to resume cycling, the major increase in tRNA synthesis occurs during the G1/S transition (19Johnson L.F. Abelson H.T. Green H. Penman S. Cell. 1974; 1: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Mauck J.C. Green H. Cell. 1974; 3: 171-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since this coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of RB by cyclin-dependent kinases, we examined the possibility that the increase in pol III transcription that accompanies cell cycle reentry involves a release of TFIIIB from interaction with RB. Immunoprecipitation analyses provide evidence that this is the case; RB associates with TFIIIB during G0 and early G1phases, but this interaction is substantially diminished after cells have passed the R point. The dissociation of RB from TFIIIB coincides with an increase in pol III activity. Only the underphosphorylated form of RB associates with TFIIIB. This suggests that TFIIIB is released from repression by RB at the G1/S transition due to hyperphosphorylation of the latter by the cyclin-dependent kinases. Indeed, overexpression of cyclins D and E activates pol III transcription. We also demonstrate that RB knockout cells are compromised in their ability to down-regulate pol III following serum deprivation. In addition, the RB-related pocket protein p130 is shown to interact with TFIIIB during G0 and early G1phase and contributes to the repression of pol III in serum-starved cells. We conclude that RB, p130, and the cyclin-dependent kinases play a major role in controlling pol III transcription during the switch between growth and quiescence. Balb/c 3T3 (A31), SV3T3 (Cl38), and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were all grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were harvested when subconfluent. An insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement (Life Technologies) was added to the medium used to grow mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Unless otherwise specified, cell growth was arrested by reducing the serum concentration to 0.5%; mitogenic stimulation was then induced with 20% serum. Cells to be analyzed by flow cytometry were harvested in dissociation buffer (Sigma) and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline/ethanol (1:1, v/v). Propidium iodide (40 μg/ml) was added, and the DNA content of cell samples was measured using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (10,000 events/sample). Data were analyzed using Cell Quest software. [3H]Thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml) was added to serum-stimulated or quiescent cells 3 h prior to harvesting. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, three times in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and twice in ethanol. Samples were solubilized in 0.3 m NaOH, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Subconfluent Balb/c 3T3 cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS. They were then incubated for 15 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate either in the absence of FCS, to give G0 phase cells, or the presence of 10% FCS, to give S phase cells; early G1 phase cells were generated by adding 10% FCS for the final 3 h of the incubation. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer (64 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1.2% Triton X-100, 0.64% sodium deoxycholate, 0.128% SDS, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml bestatin), solubilized by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C.

RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Reverse transcription reactions were performed for 1 h at 42 °C using 3 μg of RNA, 200 ng of Random Hexamers (Promega), and 400 units of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) in a total volume of 40 μl of 1× First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and a 0.5 mmconcentration of each dNTP. PCRs were carried out using a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc). 2 μl of cDNA was amplified with 20 pmol of either TFIIICβ primers (5′-CCAGAAGGGGTCTCAAAAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCTTCAGAGATGTCAAAGG-3′) to give a 303-base pair product, or ARPP P0 primers (5′-GACCTGGAAGTCCAACTACTTC-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTCCTCCTTGGTGAACAC-3′) to give a 268-base pair product.

PCR was performed under the following cycling parameters: 1) TFIIICβ, 94 °C for 3 min, six cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 66 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s; 22 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s; 72 °C for 5 min; 2) ARPP P0, 95 °C for 2 min, 25 cycles of 95 °C 1 min, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 3 min. Reaction products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Actively growing Balb/c 3T3 cells were made quiescent by serum withdrawal. The majority of cells had arrested in a G0/G1 phase state after 1 day of culture under serum-free conditions, as indicated by flow cytometric analyses of their DNA content (Fig. 1 A, 0 h serum stimulation). This conclusion was supported by measurements of thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA (Fig. 1 B). The abundance of pol III transcripts derived from the B2 middle repetitive gene family was substantially reduced in the growth-arrested cells, as revealed by Northern blotting (Fig.1 C, upper panel, compare lanes 9 and 10). This effect was specific, since levels of a pol II transcript encoding ARPP P0 did not diminish following serum deprivation (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). The growth-arrested fibroblasts were stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by the addition of medium containing 20% serum. Flow cytometric analysis and thymidine incorporation measurements demonstrated that S phase was reached between 12 and 15 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Northern blotting with a B2 gene probe revealed a slight increase in pol III transcript levels by mid-G1 phase, 6–9 h after the addition of serum, and revealed that near maximal expression was reached by 12 h after mitogenic stimulation, shortly before S phase entry (Fig.1 C). We conclude that Balb/c 3T3 cells undergo growth arrest within 24 h of serum withdrawal and that this is accompanied by a significant reduction in pol III activity; when these fibroblasts resume cycling, pol III activity is restored during late G1phase. These observations are consistent with previous studies of 3T6 and BHK cells (19Johnson L.F. Abelson H.T. Green H. Penman S. Cell. 1974; 1: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Mauck J.C. Green H. Cell. 1974; 3: 171-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Lania L. Pannuti A. La Mantia G. Basilico C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To begin to investigate the mechanism responsible for the growth control of pol III transcription in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, we prepared whole cell extracts after various periods of culture in 10% serum or serum-free medium. Although little or no apoptosis was detected after 24 or 48 h without serum, flow cytometry suggested that a fraction of the cells undergo apoptosis after 72 h in serum-free medium. 2P. H. Scott, unpublished data. Extracts of fibroblasts maintained without serum for 24 h or more were found to transcribe the adenovirus VA1 gene significantly less actively than extracts prepared from proliferating cells that had been cultured in 10% serum (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained with other pol III templates, including tRNA, 5 S rRNA, and U6 small nuclear RNA genes (Fig. 2 A). The extracts therefore mimic the serum-responsiveness of pol III transcription that is observed in vivo. Sinn et al. (23Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported previously that growth of HeLa cells in 0.5% serum results in a specific decrease in the abundance of the β subunit of TFIIIC2. If this is true in untransformed 3T3 cells, then it may account for the down-regulation of pol III transcription under quiescent conditions. To address this possibility, we carried out Western blots with extracts to test whether the decrease in pol III transcription correlated with a down-regulation of TFIIICβ. However, little or no change was detected in the level of TFIIICβ when growing and arrested 3T3 cells were compared (Fig. 2 B). Indeed, TFIIICβ levels were maintained even after culture for 72 h without serum. This result was confirmed using two additional antisera raised against different regions of TFIIICβ. 3H. M. Alzuherri, unpublished data. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was employed to compare the levels of the mRNA encoding TFIIICβ, as an independent method to investigate the expression of this essential component of TFIIIC2. This approach also provided no evidence that TFIIICβ is sensitive to serum availability (Fig. 2 C). We conclude that changes in the abundance of TFIIICβ are unlikely to be responsible for regulating pol III transcription in growth-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells. Add-back experiments were carried out to determine which factor is limiting for pol III transcription in extracts of 3T3 cells. A fraction containing partially purified TFIIIB was found to stimulate transcription when titrated into extracts of either growing or serum-starved cells (Fig. 3 A). This effect was highly specific, since little or no stimulation was observed in response to a fraction containing TFIIIC and pol III. The activity of all fractions was confirmed using complementation assays. 4R. J. White, unpublished data. The data suggest that under the conditions used, TFIIIB is limiting, while TFIIIC and pol III are in relative excess. This implies that the rate of pol III transcription in 3T3 cells may be dictated by the availability of active TFIIIB. We therefore carried out complementation assays to compare directly the activity of TFIIIB in extracts prepared from cells harvested either before or after serum withdrawal. In these assays, the extracts are subjected to mild heat treatment, which selectively inactivates endogenous TFIIIC; they are then tested for their ability to support transcription when mixed with a complementing system containing excess TFIIIC, TBP, and pol III (31White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Extracts of growing 3T3 cells were found to contain sufficient TFIIIB activity to allow robust transcription in this assay. In contrast, equal amounts of extract from serum-starved cells gave little or no expression above background (Fig. 3 B). We conclude that TFIIIB activity is low and limiting in extracts of serum-deprived 3T3 cells. We investigated whether the abundance of TFIIIB changes in response to serum. Western blotting showed that 72 h of serum deprivation resulted in little or no change in the level of the BRF subunit of TFIIIB (Fig. 4 A). Levels of the TFIIIB subunit TBP are also maintained after extended periods without serum (Fig. 4 B). As an internal control, we also monitored the pol II-specific factor TFIIB in these extracts and found that this too remained unchanged (Fig. 4 C). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that unidentified"

In this study we have used several approaches to investigate the GPIbα-thrombin interaction in more detail and to study its effect on the thrombin-induced elaboration of fibrin. We found that both glycocalicin and the amino-terminal fragment of GPIbα reduced the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen by about 50% by a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism. Similarly, GPIbα caused in thrombin an allosteric reduction in the rate of turnover of the small peptide substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. TheKd for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction was 1 μm at physiological ionic strength but was highly salt-dependent, decreasing to 0.19 μm at 100 mm NaCl (Γsalt = −4.2). The salt dependence was characteristic of other thrombin ligands that bind to exosite II of this enzyme, and we confirmed this as the GPIbα-binding site on thrombin by using thrombin mutants and by competition binding studies. R68E or R70E mutations in exosite I of thrombin had little effect on its interaction with GPIbα. Both the allosteric inhibition of fibrinogen turnover caused by GPIbα binding to these mutants, and theKd values for their interactions with GPIbα were similar to those of wild-type thrombin. In contrast, R89E and K248E mutations in exosite II of thrombin markedly increased theKd values for the interactions of these thrombin mutants with GPIbα by 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (which binds to thrombin exosite II) but not hirugen (residues 54–65 of hirudin, which binds to exosite I of thrombin) inhibited thrombin binding to GPIbα. These data demonstrate that GPIbα binds to thrombin exosite II and in so doing causes a conformational change in the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the accessibility of both its natural substrate, fibrinogen, and the small peptidyl substrated-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA.

Therefore, attention has again turned to the GPIb-IX complex to understand, for example, why the platelets from patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which lack or have dysfunctional GPIb-IX complexes on their surfaces fail to respond to low doses of thrombin (12Berndt M.C.

Glycoprotein Ib-IX consists of three polypeptides (GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX) that are each transmembrane proteins that span the platelet membrane once. They are also each members of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily (14López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein Ibα and GPIbβ are linked together via a disulfide bond that is situated in the extracellular space very close to the platelet membrane, and GPIX is noncovalently associated with these two. On the platelet surface, a fourth leucine-rich repeat protein, GPV, appears to link two GPIb-IX trimers together and may be responsible for even more complex aggregation states (14López J.A.

Glycocalicin can be released from the surface of platelets by proteolysis near the platelet membrane and consists of two subregions known as the macroglycopeptide and the amino-terminal domain (14López J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is the amino-terminal domain, which consists of about 300 amino acids, that provides the sites within glycocalicin for ligand interaction (3Okumura T. Hasitz M. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3435-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and within this the thrombin-binding site has been localized between residues 269 and 287 (17Gralnick H.R. Williams S.

The site on thrombin, however, where GPIbα binds is more controversial. Within the structure of thrombin four prominent regions have been identified: its active site, a sodium ion-binding site (18Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A.

Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) that have both been implicated in thrombin binding. Although some studies have indicated that GPIbα binds to anion-binding exosite I (also known as the fibrinogen recognition site) of thrombin (21De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A.

J. 1998; 332: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have implicated anion-binding exosite II (also known as the heparin binding site) of thrombin as the site of GPIbα interaction. Thrombin is an allosteric serine protease (28Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with changes in the conformation of its active site being induced by the binding of ligands at the other sites of the enzyme. For example, the binding of ligands at exosite I changes the rate of turnover of small synthetic peptidyl and natural substrates (29Hopfner K.P. Ayala Y.M. Szewczuk Z. Konishi Y. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2947-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Hortin G.L. Trimpe B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6866-6871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the binding of heparin at exosite II alters the kinetics of the inhibition of thrombin by hirudin (31Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) consistent with allosteric linkage between exosites I and II of thrombin (32Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the binding of GPIbα to thrombin also produced an allosteric response in the enzyme. Furthermore, we sought to clarify which of the exosites of thrombin was the GPIbα-binding site in the expectation that such knowledge would lead to the formulation of new hypotheses about the biological role of GPIbα-thrombin interaction, because the exosite involved should be directly related to the consequence of this binding. In this study, we have used four approaches to investigate the binding interaction of GPIbα with thrombin: 1) an HPLC method measuring the effect of ligands on thrombin-induced fibrinogen turnover that has been well characterized in the study of thrombin-fibrinogen and thrombin-thrombomodulin interactions (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), 2) mutant thrombins with single amino acid substitutions in either exosite I or II (35Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1301-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 37Wu Q. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), 3) a resin-based assay for studying the direct binding of thrombin to GPIbα, and 4) competition binding assays using small ligands of known exosite interaction as competitors of the GPIbα-thrombin interaction. Our results clearly indicated that the binding site for GPIbα is located in thrombin anion-binding exosite II and that the binding of GPIbα to thrombin induces conformational changes at the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the activity of thrombin toward both physiological and small substrates. Glycocalicin was isolated from outdated human platelets using a modification of methods previously reported (38Hess D. Schaller J. Rickli E.E. Clemetson K.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Wicki A.N. Clemetson K.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, after glycocalicin was cleaved from the surface of platelets by calpain released as a result of their sonication, it was isolated by wheat germ agglutinin Sepharose 4B and Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography. Purified glycocalicin was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated to 1 mg/ml, and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. The amino-terminal fragment of GPIbα was generated from purified glycocalicin by cleavage with porcine pancreatic elastase at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:250 (w/w). Porcine pancreatic elastase cleaves glycocalicin after residue Val289 yielding the amino-terminal fragment and a macroglycopeptide, which are well separated by Q-Sepharose. Both fragments were concentrated, dialyzed, and stored as described for glycocalicin above. The amino-terminal region of GPIbα was expressed from baculovirus-infected insect cells (40Li C.Q. Garner S.F. Davies J. Smethurst P.A. Wardell M.R. Ouwehand W.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (41Miura S. Li C.Q. Cao Z. Wang H. Wardell M.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7539-7546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA coding for the signal peptide and amino-terminal domain of GPIbα (residues −16 to 289) followed by the calmodulin (CaM) gene was inserted into the baculovirus expression vector pAcSG2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The resultant plasmid, pWIbαwt, was then recombined with BacVector-3000 triple cut virus DNA (Novagen, Madison, WI) to produce infective virus. A high titer baculovirus stock was obtained from a single plaque by repeated infection of Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant virus was then used to infect High Five insect cells for expression of the GPIbα-CaM fusion protein. The calmodulin moiety of the fusion protein was then exploited in the first stage of recombinant protein isolation since it binds to N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7)-agarose (prepared as described previously (42Endo T. Tanaka T. Isobe T. Kasai H. Okuyama T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12485-12489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Calmodulin could be released from the GPIbα () fragment by digestion with porcine pancretaic elastase (1:100 w/w E:S ratio), and the GPIbα () could be retrieved in pure form after passage over Q-Sepharose anion exchange resin. Recombinant mutant prothrombins R68E, R70E (exosite I mutants), R89E, and K248E (exosite II mutants) were expressed and characterized as described previously (36Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 37Wu Q. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues are numbered from the first residue of the human thrombin B chain. Purified prothrombins were activated with Echis carinatus snake venom, and the thrombin products were further purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography on Amberlite CG-50. The purity of each thrombin was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The activities of recombinant mutant and wild-type thrombins were tested as described (43Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 44Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The binding of glycocalicin to thrombin was determined by modifying an HPLC-based assay that has been well characterized for the study of fibrinogen binding to thrombin (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). First, thrombin was incubated with fibrinogen under the desired solution conditions (5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 8.0 at 25 °C) and the progress curves for fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release were measured to determine the values of the specificity constantkcat/Km. The fibrinogen concentration was 0.2 μm, thrombin concentrations varied according to their specific activities in the range from 0.08–2 nm, and the ionic strength was kept constant with NaCl. The reaction was initiated by addition of thrombin to the fibrinogen solution (or to the fibrinogen and glycocalicin solution) and quenched at different time intervals with 3 m perchloric acid. The sample was then centrifuged, and the amount of FpA in the supernatant was determined by HPLC, as described previously (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Next, glycocalicin at varying concentrations was added to the assay system, and the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for glycocalicin binding to thrombin were determined by analysis of the inhibition of FpA release as a function of glycocalicin concentration according to the following equation. [FpA]=[FpA]∞{1−exp(−se⊤tc)}Equation 1 where s=kcatKm0+kcatKm1xKd1+xKdEquation 1a and x is the GPIbα concentration,eT is the active thrombin concentration, (kcat/Km)0 and (kcat/Km)1 are the specificity constants for FpA release in the absence of and at saturating concentration of GPIbα, respectively, andtc =Km/eT kcatcorresponds to the point in the progress curve that gives the greatest change in the amount of FpA released as a function of the inhibitor concentration. The exosite mutant thrombins were substituted for wild-type thrombin in this assay to investigate the effect that GPIbα had on their cleavage reactions of fibrinogen. Before each assay the concentration of thrombin was adjusted to ensure the same thrombin activity was present in each reaction. The same assay was used for investigating the salt dependence of the thrombin-glycocalicin interaction in the range of 100–150 mm NaCl. The data plotted as log Kd versus log [salt] were fitted to a straight line according to the following expression (34Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). −lnKd=A0+Γsaltln[salt]Equation 2 Kd is a dissociation constant. The slope of this line yields Γsalt, which represents a thermodynamic measure of the effect of salt concentration on binding equilibria (28Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,34Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The direct binding of thrombin to GPIbα was investigated using the recombinant GPIbα-CaM fusion protein expressed in insect cells. 50 μl of W-7-agarose solution containing 25 μl of packed resin was first added to a 500-μl Eppendorf tube. The resin beads were then washed with washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) three times. 1 nmol of recombinant GPIbα-CaM fusion protein in 100 μl of binding solution (100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm CaCl2) was added to the 25 μl of washed W-7-agarose beads and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. The beads were then washed once with binding solution and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% PEG-8000 in binding solution for another 2 h. After blocking, duplicates of increasing quantities (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10, or 12.5 pmol) of thrombin (wild type or mutants) were added to separate tubes in binding solution in a total volume of 70 μl and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. The total volume of each reaction, including W-7-agarose, was therefore 95 μl containing final concentrations of thrombin of 26, 52, 79, 105, and 131 nm, respectively. As a negative control, W-7 beads were incubated for the indicated time in the absence of GPIbα-CaM. The beads were kept suspended during each incubation step by inverting the tubes every 10 min. At the end of the incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 1 min. 50 μl of each supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated with 50 μl of 2.5 mm thrombin substrated-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The release ofp-nitroaniline was monitored by spectrophotometry at 405 nm using a THERMOmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Sunnyvale, CA) at 5-min intervals from 5 to 60 min. These assays were performed essentially as for the direct thrombin binding assay described above but with the addition of either hirugen (residues 54–65 of hirudin with Tyr63 sulfated; Sigma) or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals Inc., Collegeville, PA) added as inhibitors of exosites I and II, respectively. 50-μl aliquots of W-7-agarose solution containing 25 μl of packed beads were added to tubes and washed as above. 1 nmol of recombinant GPIbα-CaM fusion protein in binding solution was added to the beads and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C in constant suspension. After blocking for 2 h as above, 12.5 pmol of thrombin and various quantities (0, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, and 2000 pmol) of hirugen or LMW heparin were added to duplicate tubes in a volume of 70 μl making final concentrations of 0, 0.53, 1.05, 2.63, 5.26, 7.89, 10.53, 15.79, and 21.05 μm, respectively, each in a total volume of 95 μl. After 2 h incubation at 25 °C, 50 μl of each supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated with 50 μl of 2.5 mm thrombin substrated-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The release ofp-nitroaniline was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm using a THERMOmax microplate reader, as above. 12.5 pmol of human α-thrombin was preincubated for 10 min in a total volume of 70 μl as above with various concentrations (between 0 and 14.29 μm) of glycocalicin, hirugen (Sigma), or LMW heparin (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals Inc., Collegeville, PA). After incubation, 50 μl of each solution was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated with 50 μl of 2.5 mm thrombin substrated-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm by a THERMOmax microplate reader as above. We began our studies by a detailed examination of the influence that glycocalicin had on the fibrinogen-thrombin interaction. Fibrinogen interacts with thrombin exosite I and is thereafter cleaved in its Aα chain at Arg16 and in its Bβ chain at Arg14, releasing FpA and FpB, respectively. We utilized a well characterized HPLC-based assay that quantitatively measures the release of FpA after thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of fibrinogen (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of glycocalicin were added to solutions containing both thrombin and fibrinogen to determine whether the glycocalicin could inhibit the thrombin-mediated cleavage of fibrinogen. As shown in Fig.1, the addition of glycocalicin decreased the amount of FpA released from the fibrinogen. The FpA release could not be totally inhibited, even by a large glycocalicin excess, however, indicating that glycocalicin was not acting in a competitive manner and was not binding to thrombin exosite I. The curve in Fig. 1 was best fit by Equation 1, which describes a noncompetitive mode of inhibition, and because thrombin is an allosteric enzyme (28Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we concluded that the inhibitory effect of glycocalicin occurred by an allosteric mechanism. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the thrombin-glycocalicin interaction derived from this equation was 1.04 ± 0.008 μm at 150 mm NaCl. Identical results were obtained when the amino-terminal domain of GPIbα (residues 1–289), whether derived from human platelets or recombinantly expressed, was substituted for glycocalicin (data not shown). The binding affinities of two other ligands that interact with thrombin exosite II, heparin (45Olson S.T. Halvorson H.R. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6342-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin (34Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have been shown to be very sensitive to salt concentration, whereas the affinities of ligands binding to thrombin exosite I are not (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E.

Fig.2 shows that the influence of glycocalicin on the thrombin-induced FpA release from fibrinogen was salt-dependent, with the derived equilibrium dissociation constants for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction varying nearly an order of magnitude between the NaCl concentrations of 100 and 150 mm (K 100 mMNaCl = 0.187 ± 0.009 μm;Kd 125 mMNaCl = 0.41 ± 0.03 μm;Kd 150 mMNaCl = 1.04 ± 0.008 μm). The thrombin-fibrinogen interaction is minimally affected within this range of salt concentration (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At higher salt concentrations than reported here, the affinity of glycocalicin for thrombin dropped considerably, whereas at lower concentrations the Kd could not be determined accurately because of changes in the kinetic mechanism for the release of fibrinopeptides. The effect of salt on the interaction of glycocalicin with thrombin can be further quantified by plotting the data as log Kdverses log [salt] on a straight line according to Equation 2 (33Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,34Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When the log of the equilibrium dissociation constants derived for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction at different concentrations of NaCl was plotted against the log of their respective [Na+], the straight line in Fig.3 was obtained. The value of Γsalt for this interaction was calculated from the slope of the line as −4.2. For comparison, the equivalent plots reported by other investigators for the thrombin-heparin (45Olson S.T. Halvorson H.R. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6342-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thrombin-hirugen (34Vindigni A. White C.E"
https://openalex.org/W2093625599,"Membrane fusion is the key step in the entry of enveloped animal viruses into their host cells. Fusion of vesicular stomatitis virus with membranes occurs at acidic pH and is mediated by its envelope glycoprotein, the G protein. To study the structural transitions induced by acidic pH on G protein, we have extracted the protein from purified virus by incubation with nonionic detergent. At pH 6.0, purified G protein was able to mediate fusion of either phospholipid vesicles or Vero cells in culture. Intrinsic fluorescence studies revealed that changes in the environment of Trp residues occurred as pH decreases. In the absence of lipidic membranes, acidification led to G protein aggregation, whereas protein-protein interactions were substituted by protein-lipid interactions in the presence of liposomes. 1,1′-Bis(4-aniline-5-naphthalene sulfonate) (bis-ANS) binding was utilized to probe the degree of exposure of hydrophobic regions of G protein during acidification. Bis-ANS binding was maximal at pH 6.2, suggesting that a hydrophobic segment is exposed to the medium at this pH. At pH 6.0, a dramatic decrease in bis-ANS binding was observed, probably due to loss of tridimensional structure during the conformational rearrangement. This hypothesis was confirmed by circular dichroism analysis at different pH values, which showed a great decrease in α-helix content at pH values close to 6.0, suggesting that a reorganization of G protein secondary structure occurs during the fusion reaction. Our results indicate that G protein undergoes dramatic structural changes at acidic pH and acquires a conformational state able to interact with the target membrane."

Here, we examine the effect of the loss of exon 2-encoded β-domain function on VHL biochemical properties. Exon 2-encoded residues are required for VHL-mediated NEDD8 conjugation on cullin-2 and assembly with hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFα) and fibronectin. These residues are not essential for VHL ability to assemble with elongin BC/cullin-2, to display E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and to confer energy-dependent nuclear import properties to a reporter protein. Localization studies in HIF-1α-null embryonic cells suggest that exon 2-encoded β-domain mediates transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of VHL independently of assembly with HIF-1α and oxygen concentration.

These results demonstrate that exon 2-encoded residues are involved in two independent functions: substrate protein recognition and transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking.

VHL protein assembles with at least four other associated proteins: elongin B, elongin C, cullin-2, and Rbx (the complex will be hereafter referred to as VBC/Cul-2) (7Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H.

HIFα are stable in VHL−/− RCC cells bringing about a constitutive “hypoxia-like” response, regardless of oxygen concentration. The exact mechanism by which VHL can mediate the degradation of HIFα is still unknown but might be related to its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (6Iliopoulos O. Kibel A.

Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2881-2885PubMed Google Scholar). Another key functional characteristic of VHL is that it binds to fibronectin and is involved in the assembly of an extracellular fibronectin matrix (28Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov O.D. Louis A.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of VHL has been reported. VHL mainly consists of two independent domains: a large β-domain that spans residues 64–154 and an α-helical domain (α-domain) that encompasses most of the C-terminal part of the protein (residues 157–189) (29Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Tumor-derived inactivating mutations (279 entries; Ref. 30Beroud C. Joly D. Gallou C. Staroz F. Orfanelli M.T. Junien C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 256-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) are found across the VHL protein, indicating that both domains play a critical role in VHL tumor suppressor function (29Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). There is, however, an interesting correlation between the nature and localization of inactivating mutations and the clinical consequences in patients afflicted with inherited VHL syndrome. Individuals with type II VHL syndrome develop pheochromocytoma and have generally inherited a mutation in the exon 3-encoded α-domain. Type I VHL syndrome differs from type II in that patients do not develop pheochromocytoma and are likely to have inherited a mutation in the hydrophobic core of the β-domain (31Chen F. Kishida T. Yao M. Hustad T. Glavac D. Dean M. Gnarra J.R. Orcutt M.L. Duh F.M. Glenn G. Green J. Hsia Y.E. Lamiell J. Li H. Wei M.H. Schmidt L. Tory K. Kuzmin I. Stackhouse T. Latif F. Linehan W.M. Lerman M.I. Zbar B. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). There is also an intriguing disparity in the distribution of tumor-derived missense mutations between the inherited and sporadic form of RCC. Mutations in the α-domain of VHL are much more frequent in the inherited form of RCC (5Gnarra J.R. Tory K. Weng Y. Schmidt L. Wei M.H. Li H. Latif F. Liu F.S. Chen F. Duh F.M. Lubensky I. Duan D.R. Florence C. Pozzatti R. Walther M.M. Bander N.H. Grossman H.B. Brauch H. Pomer S. Brooks J.D. Isaacs W.B. Lerman M.I. Zbar B. Linehan W.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). The role of a few of these residues is well understood, since they correspond to the ones required for VHL binding to elongin C and formation of the VBC/Cul-2 complex (7Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 8Lonergan K.M.

In contrast to inherited RCC, sporadic RCC frequently harbor inactivating point mutations in exon 2. This includes point mutations at the exon 2 boundary that cause a splice defect producing a mRNA that lacks exon 2 sequences altogether (5Gnarra J.R. Tory K. Weng Y. Schmidt L. Wei M.H. Li H. Latif F. Liu F.S. Chen F. Duh F.M. Lubensky I. Duan D.R. Florence C. Pozzatti R. Walther M.M. Bander N.H. Grossman H.B. Brauch H. Pomer S. Brooks J.D. Isaacs W.B. Lerman M.I. Zbar B. Linehan W.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Exon 2 mutations are rare in VHL patients, and it has been suggested that such mutations might not be easily tolerated and thus not transmitted in the germ line (1Gnarra J.R. Duan D.R. Weng Y. Humphrey J.S. Chen D.Y. Lee S. Pause A. Dudley C.F. Latif F. Kuzmin I. Schmidt L. Duh F.M. Stackhouse T. Chen F. Kishida T. Wei M.H. Lerman M.I. Zbar B. Klausner R.D. Linehan W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1242: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy in the distribution of mutations between sporadic and inherited RCC suggests that exon 2-associated mutations might inactivate VHL function in a different way than exon 3-associated mutations. Exon 2-encoded residues 114–154 are mostly hydrophobic and form three of the seven β-strands of the β-domain (29Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These residues are hypothesized to play a role in substrate protein recognition, although recent in vitro experiments have revealed that they might not be required for VHL binding to HIFα (33Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the role that exon 2-encoded sequences play in VHL-mediated tumor suppression is still poorly understood. Here, we further examine the role of these sequences in cells by comparing a tumor-derived VHL mutant that lacks residues 114–154 with the known biochemical properties of wild-type VHL and mutant VHL lacking the exon 3-encoded α-domain. We show that the exon 2-encoded β-domain plays two independent roles in binding to HIFα and fibronectin and mediating transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking of the VBC/Cul-2 complex. The use of a novel method to examine the energy requirement for nuclear import of proteins will also be discussed in this report. The results presented here support the model that the β-domain of VHL is involved in substrate recognition and nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking. The VHL−/− 786-0 RCC cells and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The VHL-GFP cell line corresponds to 786-0 cells stably transfected with the VHL-GFP fusion protein as described elsewhere (25Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 117-4 (VHL−/−; referred to as 117) cells were a kind gift from Dr. James R. Gnarra (LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA). The mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) nullizygous for HIF-1α were a kind gift from Dr. Randy Johnson (Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego) (34Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 37 °C, humidified, 5% CO2-containing atmosphere incubator. Transient transfections were performed overnight using a standard calcium phosphate method. Viruses were used as freeze/thaw lysates, and all infections were also performed overnight. The human VHL cDNA, which codes for a 213-amino acid VHL protein, was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) vector. A FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) was added to the N terminus of the VHL cDNA open reading frame. A cDNA coding for an enhanced fluorescence version of GFP (Fred 25; Ref. 35Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was subcloned at the C terminus VHL to produce the VHL-GFP fusion protein. A deletion mutant of the last 56 amino acids was fused to GFP to produce the ΔE3-GFP fusion protein. Another deletion mutant of VHL lacking amino acids 114–154 was fused to GFP to produce the ΔE2-GFP fusion protein. Two GFPs in tandem were cloned into pcDNA 3.1(−) to produce the GFP-GFP fusion protein. VHL-GFP-NES, ΔE2-GFP-NES, and GFP-GFP-NES were produced by fusion of VHL-GFP, ΔE2-GFP, and GFP-GFP at their C terminus to the strong nuclear export signal (NES) of human immunodeficiency virus REV, LPPLERLTL (NES) (36Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by standard DNA sequencing. CRE8 and 293 cells were obtained from Dr. David Park (University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The construction and properties of CRE8 cells are described elsewhere (37Chen L. Anton M. Graham F.L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 6: 477-488Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The pAdlox vector and the ψ5 viral DNA were also obtained from Dr. Park. The three different VHL constructions (VHL-GFP, ΔE2-GFP, and ΔE3-GFP) were previously subcloned in the pAdlox vector. Transfections were done according to Graham and van der Eb (38Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Typically, a confluent 10-cm diameter dish of CRE8 cells (1.6 × 107) was split into 5–6-cm diameter dishes for transfection 2–4 h later. Each dish received 3 μg of pAdlox vector (containing the foreign VHL construction) and 3 μg of ψ5 viral DNA in a final volume of 0.5 ml of CaPO4, which was applied to the cells for 16 h. The 10% fetal calf serum DMEM was changed for 2% fetal calf serum DMEM 16 h following the transfection. Cells were fed with fresh 2% DMEM after 64 h. Between day 8 and 10, we had a sizable infection in each dish; almost all of the cells were rounded up or floating. Cells were harvested and subjected to freeze/thaw three times with an alternating liquid N2/37 °C water bath. The virus was then passed sequentially through CRE8 cells twice. Finally, a plaque purification assay was performed in order to isolate the recombinant virus expressing adVHL-GFP, adΔE2-GFP, or adΔE3-GFP. The recombinant viruses were then amplified in CRE8 cells to high titer. HeLa cells were plated on a 35-mm dish with a hole at the bottom replaced by a glass coverslip and transfected overnight with VHL-GFP-NES, ΔE2-GFP-NES, and GFP-GFP-NES. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h in DMEM at 37 °C with or without metabolic poisons (6 mm 6-deoxyglucose and 0.02% sodium azide), at 4 °C, or at 37 °C with 10 μm leptomycin B (39Nishi K.

VHL−/− 786-0 RCC cells infected with the three different adenoviruses and 786-0 cells stably expressing VHL-GFP were lysed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl with protease mixture for 30 min. at 4 °C. Whole cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. Precipitates were washed five times with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The total volume of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 20 μl. E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (100 ng), E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (200 ng), 0.5 μg of ubiquitin aldehyde, 0.5 μg of ubiquitin, and an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, and 10 μg of creatine phosphokinase) were added to the reaction mixture (complete mixture). The reaction was stopped after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C by adding 4× SDS loading buffer. Samples were boiled 10 min and separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Blots were blocked and incubated in the presence of a mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (Berkeley Antibody Company). The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme were a kind gift from Dr. Kazuhiro Iwai (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). VHL−/− 786-0 cells expressing endogenous HIF-2α or 117-4 cells expressing endogenous HIF-1α were exposed for 4 h to hypoxia (0.1% O2) 16 h after infection. Proteasomal inhibition was performed with 100 μm calpain inhibitor I (CI) for 2 h. When still in the hypoxic chamber, cells were washed several times with PBS and scraped from the Petri dishes in lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA630, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate with 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride. Tubes were put back in normoxia and kept at 4 °C for 30 min. with rocking. After clearance by centrifugation, 1-mg aliquots of lysate were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak Co.). Beads were washed, boiled, and loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes using standard methods. Blots were blocked with 3% milk powder in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and were then incubated in the presence of anti-HIF-1α (Transduction Laboratories), anti-HIF-2α antibody (Novus Biologicals), or an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). VHL-GFP cells and infected 786-0 cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA630, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate with 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After clearance by centrifugation, 1-mg aliquots of lysate were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 beads. Beads were washed, boiled, and loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes using standard methods. Blots were blocked with 3% milk powder in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and were then incubated in the presence of anti-cullin-2 (Ref. 41Liakopoulos D. Büsgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc.

For total cell lysates, cells were washed several times in PBS, scraped from the Petri dishes, centrifuged, and resuspended in 4% SDS in PBS (24Lee S. Chen D.Y.T. Humphrey J.S. Gnarra J.R. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled for 5 min, and the DNA was sheared by passage of lysates through 19-gauge needles. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) and was used to normalize protein loading in a whole-cell immunoblot assay. VHL−/− RCC 786-0 cells or VHL-GFP cells were infected and were grown on coverslips for 6 days, washed three times with PBS, and fixed/permeabilized in prechilled 95% ethanol at −20 °C for 30 min. Ethanol was then aspirated, and the residual ethanol was allowed to air dry at 4 °C. Cells were stained with polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody (5 μg/ml) (Dako Diagnostic) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed with PBS three times and incubated with CyTM3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA) diluted 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS, incubated for 2 min with Hoechst 33342, and mounted with fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) on slides. 117 cells or transiently transfected 786-0 with HIF-1α were grown on coverslip and infected with the three different adenoviruses overnight. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed/permeabilized in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed again three times with PBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-HIF-1α antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% FCS. The cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 60 min in the presence of a CyTM3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:1000. The cells were washed in PBS, incubated for 2 min in Hoechst 33342, and mounted with fluoromount-G on slides. GFP fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope with a C-Apochromat 40 × water immersion objective, equipped with an Empix digital charge-coupled device camera using Northern Eclipse software. Images were manipulated with Northern Eclipse and Adobe Photoshop software as described elsewhere (25Lee S. Neumann M. Stearman R. Stauber R. Pause A. Pavlakis G.N. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1486-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP images were always taken before Hoechst images to minimize any possible bleaching effect. The VHL protein, encoded by the VHL gene that contains three exons, can be divided into three independent domains: an acidic domain, a β-domain, and an α-domain (Fig.1 A). Sporadic RCC frequently harbor inactivating mutations in the exon 2-encoded part of the β-domain, whereas these mutations are relatively rare in individuals afflicted with inherited VHL syndrome (5Gnarra J.R.

To study the role of exon 2-encoded β-domain in VHL tumor suppressor function, a cDNA encoding a tumor-derived truncation of residues 114–154 was fused to GFP to produce the ΔE2-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). This truncation mutant is the consequence of point mutations that cause a splice defect producing a mRNA that lacks exon 2 sequences altogether (5Gnarra J.R. Tory K. Weng Y. Schmidt L. Wei M.H. Li H. Latif F. Liu F.S. Chen F. Duh F.M. Lubensky I. Duan D.R. Florence C. Pozzatti R. Walther M.M. Bander N.H. Grossman H.B. Brauch H. Pomer S. Brooks J.D. Isaacs W.B. Lerman M.I. Zbar B. Linehan W.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). ΔE2-GFP is predicted to have a partial, if not total, loss of β-domain function while retaining an intact, exon 3-encoded α-helical domain. A tumor-derived truncation of the exon 3-encoded α-helical domain (last 56 C-terminal residues), which retained intact the sequences of the β-domain, was also fused to GFP (ΔE3-GFP) (Fig. 1 B). ΔE2-GFP, ΔE3-GFP, and wild-type VHL-GFP were cloned in pAdlox vector, and adenoviruses (adΔE2-GFP, adΔE3-GFP, and adVHL-GFP) were produced to high titers (Fig. 1 B) (42Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1996; 71: 1842-1849Crossref Google Scholar). Adenovirus was chosen as a method to reintroduce VHL, since it eliminates the necessity to produce stable clones of different VHL−/− RCC cell lines. VHL−/− RCC cells were infected with very high efficiency, with essentially 100% of cells displaying GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1 C). In adenovirus-infected cells, adVHL-GFP was mostly localized to the cytoplasm with some nuclear signal, consistent with data obtained with stable transfectants. In contrast to VHL alone (without GFP; Ref. 43Kim M. Katayose Y. Li Q. Rakkar A.N. Li Z. Hwang S.G. Katayose D. Trepel J. Cowan K.H. Seth P. Biochem. Cell Biol.

The binding of hnRNP A2 to A2RE has been shown, by mutational and antisense approaches, to be essential for cytoplasmic RNA trafficking in oligodendrocytes (29Munro T.P. Magee R.J. Kidd G.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the number of binding sites, their affinities, and location are unknown. We have used a resonant mirror biosensor and UV cross-linking gel mobility shift assays to investigate the binding of the A2RE and other oligoribonucleotides to recombinant human hnRNPs A1 and A2 and rat hnRNP A2. These proteins are shown to possess a single site that can associate with oligonucleotides with widely different base sequences. Both also possess a second site that is specific for A2RE, with considerably stronger binding to hnRNP A2 than hnRNP A1. Heparin inhibits the nonspecific interaction but not the binding of the A2RE to its specific site. We also show that an oligonucleotide consisting of the 5′ 11 nucleotides of A2RE binds as strongly as the 21-mer, thereby defining more precisely the dimensions of the segment of the A2RE that is recognized by hnRNP A2 and identifying one of the smallest single-element RNA-localization motifs. Finally, experiments with expressed and purified modules of hnRNP A2 indicate that the specific A2RE-binding site is formed by the two RRMs acting in concert, whereas single RRMs are capable of interacting only weakly or nonspecifically with RNA.DISCUSSIONWe have established that expressed human hnRNP A2 possesses at least two sites for binding oligonucleotides. One recognizes RNA molecules with widely differing sequences, but with similar dissociation constants, the second is specific for A2RE. The dissociation constants for both sites are typical of RRM-containing proteins (20Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 39Abdul-Manan N. O'Malley S.M. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3545-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Williams D.J. Hall K.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and are within an order of magnitude, but the discrimination between A2RE and other sequences for the specific binding site on hnRNP A2 is effectively absolute (Fig. 5). No binding of NS1 or NS2 to the specific site was detected even at the highest oligonucleotide concentrations used in the absence of heparin. On the other hand, the A2RE retained its affinity for the specific site in the presence of heparin concentrations (10 g/liter), which eliminated binding at the nonspecific site. The ability of heparin to block just one site, and the clear discrimination between oligonucleotides possessing and lacking an A2RE-like sequence observed for the other site, signify a fundamental difference in the nature of the two binding regions on hnRNP A2.Most RRMs have been assumed to have a basal level of nonspecific affinity for RNA, although only in a few instances has this been proven (41Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Williams K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As constituents of core particles, hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2, in particular, have been proposed to have roles in intramolecular RNA packaging, which would presumably be independent of RNA sequence. This hypothesis is partly supported by our data. Both isolated RRMs of hnRNP A2 manifest nonspecific binding of comparable strength, although the intact protein appears to have a single site for nonspecific interaction with even the relatively short A2RE. However, in contrast to the recombinant proteins, hnRNP A2 isolated from rat brain protein extracts shows little nonspecific binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays performed in the absence of heparin (29Munro T.P. Magee R.J. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H. Barbarese L. Smith L.M. Smith R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34389-34395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This difference between the human and rat proteins does not necessarily exclude the existence of nonspecific binding sites on the rat hnRNPs; the nonspecific RNA-binding sites on these proteins may, for example, already be occupied in the tissue extracts, thus precluding the binding of added radiolabeled, nonspecific oligonucleotide. Alternatively, there may be conformational differences between the rat brain protein isolated using only the magnetic particles and the proteins isolated by reverse-phase HPLC that generate the nonspecific site. But the physiological significance and detailed analysis of this nonspecific binding is beyond the scope of this communication.Although some hnRNPs have high affinity for oligonucleotides regardless of sequence, they may also have additional, more specific functions (23Schenkel J. Sekeris C.E. Alonso A. Bautz E.K.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 42Mayeda A. Munroe S.H. Cáceres J.F. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5483-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). hnRNP A2 binds the telomeric sequence TTAGGG (24McKay S.J. Cooke H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which bears no relationship to the A2RE sequence and is therefore unlikely to mimic the A2RE binding detected in this study. Because heparin was not used in the studies with telomeric DNA, it is possible that the TTAGGG sequence binds with an atypically high affinity to the nonspecific site; alternatively, it may interact with a specific site on hnRNP A2 other than the one described here.The size of the A2RE-binding site on hnRNP A2 was earlier suggested to be around 11 nucleotides, based on an analysis of the effects of mutations within the A2RE11 (29Munro T.P. Magee R.J. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H. Barbarese L. Smith L.M. Smith R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34389-34395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This conclusion is reinforced by the data presented here: several single base mutations within A2RE11 increased the dissociation constant by more than 50-fold. Examination of the A2RE sequence reveals an interesting near-repetition of the A2RE11 sequence that results in significant binding of the 3′ 11 nucleotides and the middle 11 nucleotides of A2RE to hnRNP A2 (29Munro T.P. Magee R.J. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H. Barbarese L. Smith L.M. Smith R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34389-34395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A loose analogy may be drawn with the parallel and antiparallel tandem repeats found in the DNA segments recognized by transcription factors, but the repeats in A2RE are single-stranded, imperfect, and overlapped. Furthermore, although the A2RE has, as a result of this repetition, potentially more than one binding site, only one molecule of hnRNP A2 is bound.Unless the interaction with hnRNP A2 has a pronounced effect on its secondary structure, the protein-bound A2RE is likely to be single-stranded. Calculations using the program mfold (44Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) indicate that neither A2RE nor A2RE11 and its mutants forms stable secondary structure, with the exception of A8G, which can form 3 base pairs. Therefore, although these calculations are more reliable for larger oligonucleotides, perhaps the closest parallels can be drawn between A2RE-hnRNP A2 and the RNA complexes formed by Sex-lethal protein and the N-terminal tandem RRMs of poly(A) binding (PABP) protein. Nine nucleotides of a 12-nucleotide segment of single-strandedtransformer mRNA bind in a V-shaped cleft formed by the tandem RRMs of Sex-lethal protein (45Handa N. Nureki O. Kurimoto K. Kim I. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Muto Y. Yokoyama S. Nature. 1999; 398: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 46Antson A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Seven consecutive nucleotides of poly(A) are bound in a narrow trough formed by the β-strands of the RRMs of PABP (46Antson A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 47Kanaar R. Lee A.L. Rudner D.Z. Wemmer D.E. Rio D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4530-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The stretches of RNA bound to these proteins, 7–9 nucleotides, are comparable in length with A2RE11. In both of these complexes, however, some of the 2′-OH groups interact with the proteins, whereas the similar affinity displayed for A2RE and its 2′-deoxy counterpart by hnRNP A2 suggests that the 2′-OH groups of A2RE do not play such a role.The small number of structural studies of RNA binding to RRM-containing proteins has uncovered considerable diversity in the modes of interaction, including the binding of single (48Casas-Finet J.R.

Biol. 1993; 229: 873-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). UP1 can also form antiparallel dimers in which two single-stranded DNA segments straddle both protein molecules, binding RRM1 of one molecule and RRM2 of the other (49Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.-M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The RRMs lie side-by-side in the crystal structure of UP1 (13Xu R.-M. Jokhan L. Cheng X. Mayeda A. Krainer A.M. Structure ( Lond. ). 1997; 5: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is possible that UP1 is not dimeric in solution and has an altered mode of oligonucleotide binding (49Ding J. Hayashi M.K. Zhang Y. Manche L. Krainer A.R. Xu R.-M.

As the protein in these experiments was immobilized from a solution in which it was shown by sedimentation equilibrium experiments to be monomeric, it is unlikely that the observed A2RE binding is to a dimer of the protein. In addition, hnRNP A2 (or A1) added to a biosensor bearing immobilized hnRNP A2 resulted in no increase in response, again indicating that, under the conditions used, hnRNP A2 does not self-associate or bind hnRNP A1.Although the glycine-rich region of hnRNP A1 has been implicated in other RNA-hnRNP interactions (11Kumar A. Williams K.R. Szer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11266-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Abdul-Manan N. O'Malley S.M. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3545-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this region of hnRNP A2 does not appear to be involved in the interaction with A2RE. The expressed segment of hnRNP A2, including both RRMs and the short region C-terminal to the second RRM that has been shown previously to markedly enhance RNA binding to hnRNP A1 (38Shamoo Y. Abdul-Manan N. Patten A.M. Crawford J.K. Pellegrini M.C. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), bound A2RE almost as strongly as the full protein. Binding to the individual RRMs was weak or undetectable. Thus, the specific association appears to involve a 1:1 interaction of monomeric hnRNP A2 with a short single-stranded RNA, the binding site being formed by the two RRMs. Verification of this model will await more detailed structural studies, such as three-dimensional structure determination of the RNA-protein complex.In summary, we have demonstrated that: (i) recombinant hnRNPs A1 and A2 possess a site capable of binding RNAs with diverse sequences; (ii) in addition, both possess a site that binds the 21-nucleotide A2RE but not equivalent oligonucleotides with scrambled sequences; (iii) A2RE binding to the specific site on hnRNP A2 is considerably stronger than to hnRNP A1; (iv) the 5′ 11 nucleotides of A2RE bind to hnRNP A2 with an affinity equal to that of the 21-mer, thus the sequence-specific binding involves at most 11 nucleotides; (v) several single base mutations within the A2RE abrogate specific binding to hnRNP A2; and (vi) the specific binding site is formed by the two tandem RRMs and the proximal C-terminal flanking region. It is hoped that the present demonstration of the existence on hnRNP A2 of a site exhibiting specificity for A2RE may prompt further investigations to identify more closely the oligoribonucleotide-binding sites on the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins involved in mRNA transport. The family of more than 20 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)1appears to play diverse roles in the post-transcriptional processing of hnRNA and subsequent packaging, transport, and translation of mRNA (1Burd C.G.

Deletion of the domain led to complete retention of the kinetic properties but resulted in the cell surface localization of the enzyme as well as its efficient secretion into the medium. The lack of this domain concomitantly abolished the disulfide-mediated oligomerization of GnT-V, which appears to confer the Golgi retention.

This homophilic interaction appears to involve a hydrophobic cluster of residues in the α-helix of the domain, as indicated by secondary structure predictions.

The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc to an α1,6-linked mannose moiety of Asn-linked oligosaccharides via a β1,6-linkage (1Schachter H. Biochem.

It is known that the levels of products of GnT-V, which are β1,6-branched N-glycans, are frequently increased in many malignant tumors and that this is closely correlated with tumor progression (3Dennis J.W.

Several studies have suggested that the β1,6-branched N-glycans directly contribute to the tumor growth and metastasis (6Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Coppolino M. Dedhar S. Dennis J.W. J.

The GnT-V protein appears to consist of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, a stem region, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain, as suggested by the primary structure (9Shoreibah M. Perng G.S. Adler B. Weinstein J. Basu R. Cupples R. Wen D. Browne J.K. Buckhaults P. Fregien N. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15381-15385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Saito H.

Commun. 1994; 198: 318-327Google Scholar), and thus shares a domain structure that is common to many glycosyltransferases (11Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).Oligosaccharides of glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids are synthesized and processed via catalysis by a variety of glycosyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Such enzymes, which are involved in oligosaccharide biosyntheses, must be localized to the appropriate intracellular destination to permit a properly ordered processing of the oligosaccharides. It is generally thought that many glycosyltransferases contain a structural region that is responsible for localization in the Golgi. Such a portion is often referred to as a Golgi retention signal. However, a common motif for serving as such a retention signal has not been found to date, probably because of the lack of homologous sequences among the Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases (11Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is believed that GnT-V is localized to the Golgi apparatus and participates in N-linked oligosaccharide processing therein. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the retention of the enzyme in the Golgi apparatus has not been explored, and a structural region responsible for this localization has not been identified.Two models, the bilayer thickness model and the kin recognition model, have been proposed to date for the mechanism of the Golgi retention of glycosyltransferases (11Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The bilayer thickness model, also known as the lipid sorting model, postulates that the length of the transmembrane domain of glycosyltransferases mediates Golgi retention (12Masibay A.S. Balaji P.V. Boeggeman E.E. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9908-9916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Munro S. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in the case of the kin recognition model, it is proposed that a homo-/hetero-oligomerization of glycosyltransferases prevents the delivery of the enzymes to secretary vesicles and ongoing transport to the plasma membrane, and, as a result, this process functions as a Golgi retention signal (14Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Nilsson T. Rabouille C. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1975-1989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, except for a few exceptions, a clear and discrete structural factor that plays a primary role in the Golgi retention has not yet been defined in glycosyltransferases.To better understand the mechanism of Golgi retention, additional experimental data will be required and further studies on a variety of Golgi resident proteins, including many glycosyltransferases, will be highly desirable. The mechanism that allows proteins to be localized in the Golgi have been substantially established by many studies using glycosyltransferases, and in fact it appears that glycosyltransferases provide a typical model for the Golgi retention of type II membrane proteins. In the present study, we expressed various deletion mutants of GnT-V and its chimeric proteins in COS cells and analyzed their intracellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. As a result, a region in the stem of GnT-V was identified as a functional domain that is specifically responsible for intracellular localization and that is not associated with the activity of the enzyme. Functional characterization of the domain and related studies suggests that homo-oligomer formation of GnT-V takes place and that this process is mediated by the domain that is responsible for intracellular localization. These conclusions were further confirmed by conversion of a cell surface-localized protein into an intracellularly localized form by insertion of the domain.RESULTSIt is known that the GnT-V molecule contains a larger number of amino acids than many other glycosyltransferases, and, as a result, it is a reasonable assumption that the protein contains several functionally separable domains, each of which contributes to the overall function of the glycosyltransferase, but in a different manner (for example, catalytic activity versus the Golgi retention). The present study was initiated to identify a functional domain that is different from the catalytic domain and to investigate its specific role. Such a study would potentially lead to elucidation of the “functional domain architecture” in GnT-V and possibly in other glycosyltransferases, and the detailed functional characterization of the specific domain might provide a clue for the issue of, for example, the mechanism of Golgi retention.To identify the structural region that is not associated with enzyme activity, chimeric GnT-V proteins, which contain the GnT-V sequences truncated using several restriction enzyme sites, were expressed in COS cells, and the enzyme activities of these products were examined. These chimeric proteins were prepared by fusion of the GnT-V regions of Ala-74–Leu-741, Tyr-188–Leu-741, and Arg-243–Leu-741 to the GnT-III N-terminal 62 residues for Ala-74–Leu-741 or 149 residues for the others, and were designated as GnVd73, GnVd187, and GnVd242, respectively (Fig. 1 A). An assay of GnT-V activity using the homogenates of the transfected COS-1 cells indicated that GnVd73 and GnVd187 were enzymatically active, whereas GnVd242 exhibited no detectable activity, even though its protein expression level was comparable with other chimeric enzymes, as shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). Thus, it can be concluded that the N-terminal 187 amino acid residues are not required for GnT-V activity but that the loss of additional 55 residues abolishes all activity.To further confirm that the region corresponding to residues 45–187 is not associated with enzyme activity, deletion mutants of the GnT-V, in which residues 45–187 and residues 136–435 were deleted, were also prepared and designated as GnVΔ1 and GnVΔ2, respectively (Fig.2 A). Consistent with the results obtained for the chimeric proteins, the GnVΔ1 mutant was found to be active, whereas the mutation made in GnVΔ2 led to a complete loss of activity (Fig. 2, B and C). The kinetic properties of the GnVΔ1 mutant was nearly indistinguishable from those of the wild type, as revealed by kinetic analysis using cell homogenates; the apparent Km for the donor and acceptor were 13 mm and 77 μm, respectively, in the wild type, and the respective values for the mutant were 9.1 mm and 67 μm. These results clearly indicate that the region corresponding to residues 45–187 is not involved in enzyme activity.Figure 2GnT-V activity of the deletion mutants.

Furthermore, even in the cell-associated activity of the mutant, a major fraction (≈ 50%) was found in the soluble fraction, as evidenced by subcellular fractionation by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3 B). In the case of the wild type, on the other hand, the enzyme was nearly exclusively located in the membrane fraction, which is consistent with the fact that many glycosyltransferases are generally anchored to the Golgi membrane. This distribution profile for the wild type is nearly the same as that of another glycosyltransferase, GnT-III, which is also known to be localized in the Golgi apparatus (26Nagai K. Ihara Y. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results show that the loss of the region corresponding to residues 45–187 causes a dramatic alteration in the cellular distribution of GnT-V.Figure 3Characterization of GnVΔ1 mutant.

In this experiment, CHO-K1 cells were used instead of COS-1 cells because the reactivity of the lectin is not substantially increased, even by the overexpression of the wild type GnT-V in COS-1 cells, probably the result of relatively high background signals. The deletion of region 45–187 resulted in the inability of the protein to modify cellular oligosaccharides even though this deletion mutant is sufficiently enzymatically active. It thus appears that the mutant is not properly localized within the cells. This suggests that the region that had been deleted could serve as a functional domain that could play a role in appropriate intracellular localization.To investigate the intracellular localization of the wild type and GnVΔ1 mutant of GnT-V in more detail, the cellular distribution of these proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Because the anti-GnT-V antibody used in the immunoblot analyses did not appear to react with the nondenatured proteins, N-terminally FLAG-tagged forms of the wild type and the mutants were constructed (Fig.4 A) and probed with an anti-FLAG epitope antibody. An FN235 mutant, an N-terminal 235-amino acid fragment that contains the stem region but lacks the majority of the large catalytic domain was also prepared to explore the requirement of this domain in the intracellular localization of GnT-V. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the wild type displayed a typical Golgi-staining pattern, as reported (27Chen L. Zhang N. Adler B. Browne J Freigen N. Pierce M. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas the FΔ1 mutant was not localized in the Golgi apparatus but, rather, was diffusely distributed throughout the cells, probably the result of being expressed on the cell surface. These results indicate that the absence of the region corresponding to residues 45–187 (which is tentatively referred to as the “stem domain” to discriminate from “stem region”) perturbs the normal Golgi localization of the GnT-V, suggesting that this domain is involved in the retention of the enzyme in Golgi. Because other mutants, FΔ2 and FN235, are also localized in the Golgi apparatus, as was the full-length wild type protein (Fig. 4 B), the localization of GnT-V in Golgi apparatus appears to be primarily conferred by the stem domain, particularly the region encompassed by residues 45–135. As shown by the analysis of an additional mutant (Fig. 4 A, FCStem), however, relocation of the stem domain to the C terminus led to different intracellular localization (Fig.4 B). This result suggests that the position of the domain is important, possibly because of collaboration with the transmembrane domain in the vicinity.Figure 4Subcellular localization of the wild type GnT-V and its deletion mutants.

Tate S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4942-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nash B. Tate S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 585-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, this protein was used as a model protein to examine the effect of the domain on the localization of such a type II membrane protein. An amino acid sequence nearly identical to the domain comprised by residues 41–184 was inserted into almost the equivalent position in GGT (Fig.5 A), and the resulting chimeric protein was expressed in COS cells. As revealed by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis using anti-GGT antibody (30Taniguchi N. Iizuka S. Zhe Z.N. House S. Yokosawa N. Ono M. Kinoshita K. Makita A. Sekiya C. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5835-5839PubMed Google Scholar), the insertion of the domain had a dramatic effect on the localization of the protein: the chimeric protein was localized in the intracellular organelles, predominantly the Golgi apparatus, in contrast to the cell surface expression of the nonchimeric GGT (Fig. 5 B). This altered intracellular distribution did not appear to be precisely identical to that of GnT-V, and thus this slight difference could be due to the subtle interference of the GGT transmembrane region, the length and amino acid composition of which are distinct from those of glycosyltransferases. However, such a dramatic conversion into an intracellularly localized form clearly indicates that the stem domain from GnT-V is fully capable of altering the localization of the cell surface-localized type II membrane protein. It thus appears likely that the mechanism of the intracellular localization of GnT-V is dependent, almost exclusively, on the nature of the stem domain but does not necessarily involve its intrinsic transmembrane domain nor any other structural regions. It also appears that the intracellular localization of GnT-V does not essentially depend on lipid sorting, a process for which the transmembrane domain plays a critical role.Figure 5Subcellular localization of GGT and its chimeric protein.

This feature appears to be frequently observed in the glycosyltransferases whose intracellular localization is determined by the oligomerization-based or kin recognition mechanisms (14Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 31Opat A.S. Houghton F. Gleeson P.A. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13819-13826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The FΔ2 mutant, which was found to be localized in the Golgi (Fig. 4 B), was also significantly oligomerized via disulfide linkages, as was the wild type. On the other hand, oligomer formation was substantially decreased in the cell-associated forms of the FΔ1 mutant, intracellular localization of which is impaired because of the lack of the stem domain (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, essentially no oligomer formation was observed in the secreted enzyme, even the wild type, as well as the GnVΔ1 mutant (Fig. 6 B). These secreted GnT-Vs, both wild type and Δ1 mutant, were smaller by about 5 kDa than those of intracellular forms, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Thus, the secreted species of the wild type appeared to still contain the stem domain, but both secreted proteins appeared to lack the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain. It seemed that their secretion results from proteolytic cleavage at the site(s) immediately close to the transmembrane domain. The disulfide bridge-mediated oligomerization appeared to fail in some fractions of the translated GnT-V protein. Considering the lack of disulfide linkages in the GnVΔ1, it is conceivable that the consequence of this failure may be the result of the release of the enzyme from the cells even in the case of the wild type. Therefore, it is likely that a GnT-V fraction that remained in the nonoligomeric state because of absence of disulfide linkages could no longer be retained in the Golgi and might subsequently be released. Oligomer formation such as this was also observed in the case of a significant fraction of the chimeric GGT, in which the stem domain of GnT-V was inserted into GGT, whereas the nonchimeric GGT, which is localized on the cell surface, failed to form any detectable disulfide-linked oligomer (data not shown). The results showing that the absence of disulfide-linked oligomer formation is concomitant with the release of protein from the cells and impaired localization are consistent with the conclusion that the domain identified in this study serves to localize GnT-V in the Golgi apparatus by facilitating the formation of oligomers. Because the FN235 mutant oligomerized via disulfide bridges to a lesser extent, the formation of the covalent linkages in GnT-V may involve not only the stem domain but also other regions.Figure 6Disulfide-linked oligomerization of the wild type GnT-V and the deletion mutants. A, the FLAG epitope-tagged wild type and mutants expressed in COS-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions.

This result and the substantial dependence of the oligomer formation of GnT-V on the stem domain strongly suggest that the domain is exclusively capable of forming a homo-oligomer via intrinsic homophilic interactions. Thus, such a homophilic interaction was examined using a yeast two-hybrid system, and, as the result, specific homophilic binding of the domain was observed, but interaction with the C-terminal catalytic domain was not (Fig.7 A). This homophilic interaction was also confirmed by a GST pull-down assay. The His-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein bound to the GST fusion protein but not to nonfused GST (Fig. 7 B). In both of these two assays, interaction or binding was detected only in the combination of fragments that contained residues 45–184 but not in any other combination. These results suggest that the domains mutually interact in a homophilic manner. Thus, it is more likely that oligomerization of GnT-V is primarily mediated via the homophilic interaction of the domain, thus further supporting the critical role of the stem domain in the Golgi localization of GnT-V, which appears to be accomplished by an oligomerization-based mechanism.Figure 7Homophilic interaction of the region of Met-45-Ser-184 in GnT-V.

The absence of the domain identified in the stem region of GnT-V led to a loss of disulfide linkage-mediated oligomer formation in conjunction with a considerably diminished Golgi retention, whereas the enzymatic properties remained nearly completely intact. Furthermore, it was found that even if the protein contains the domain, i.e. a full-length wild type GnT-V, a failure in forming this covalently linked oligomer may also lead to an impaired retention of protein in the Golgi, leading to its subsequent release from the cells. It was also shown that the domain that was identified as being essential for retention is capable of forming its homo-oligomer by the homophilic interaction. These findings suggest that the intracellular localization of GnT-V is due, nearly exclusively, to this domain and that the mechanism for the intracellular localization involves homo-oligomer formation, triggered by the domain, but not substantially affected by the other regions that are intrinsic to GnT-V, such as the transmembrane domain and the catalytic domain.The mechanism for the retention of GnT-V in Golgi is consistent with kin recognition or a similar mechanism and is most probably based on homo-oligomerization (11Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Formation of the disulfide-linked homo-oligomerization would represent a critical step for the retention of this glycosyltransferase. Intermolecular covalent linkages appear to be efficiently formed, not only in the stem domain, in which 4 cysteine residues are present, but also in the other regions, probably because the entire luminal region of GnT-V contains as many as 20 cysteine residues (10Saito H. Nishikawa A. Gu J. Ihara Y. Soejima H. Wada Y. Sekiya C. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1994; 198: 318-327Google Scholar). In fact, although FΔ2 lacks those 4 cysteine residues in the stem domain, this mutant forms the disulfide-linked oligomer and is localized in the Golgi apparatus. The initial event leading to such covalent homo-oligomer formation would involve a clustering of newly biosynthesized GnT-V molecules, in which the covalent linkages have not yet been formed, and, subsequently, the clustered proteins might be covalently linked by enzymatic or nonenzymatic oxidation in the Golgi or more proximal subcellular compartments. Because the domain is absolutely required but not necessarily sufficient for the formation of covalent linkages, as suggested by the absence of intermo"

To study the mechanism of this decrease in LPL, we studied adipose tissue LPL expression in male rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Heparin releasable and extractable LPL activity in the epididymal fat decreased by 75–80% in the diabetic group and treatment of the rats with insulin prior to sacrifice reversed this effect. Northern blot analysis indicated no corresponding change in LPL mRNA levels. However, LPL synthetic rate, measured using [35S]methionine pulse labeling, was decreased by 75% in the diabetic adipocytes, and insulin treatment reversed this effect. These results suggested regulation of LPL at the level of translation. Diabetic adipocytes demonstrated no change in the distribution of LPL mRNA associated with polysomes, suggesting no inhibition of translation initiation. Addition of cytoplasmic extracts from control and diabetic adipocytes to a reticulocyte lysate system demonstrated the inhibition of LPL translation in vitro. Using different LPL mRNA transcripts in this in vitro translation assay, we found that the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the LPL mRNA was important in controlling translation inhibition by the cytoplasmic extracts. To identify the specific region involved, gel shift analysis was performed. A specific shift in mobility was observed when diabetic cytoplasmic extract was added to a transcript containing nucleotides 1818–2000 of the LPL 3′-UTR. Thus, inhibition of translation is the predominant mechanism for the decreased adipose tissue LPL in this insulin-deficient model of diabetes. Translation inhibition involves the interaction of a cytoplasmic factor, probably an RNA-binding protein, with specific sequences of the LPL 3′-UTR.

Patients with diabetes, especially insulin-deficient diabetes, often manifest a decrease in adipose tissue LPL activity, and this is accompanied by an increase in plasma triglycerides (1Taskinen M.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 551-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). With insulin treatment, there is an improvement in both LPL activity and triglycerides (2Pfeifer M.A. Brunzell J.D.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of LPL activity is closely linked to insulin levels and nutritional state, as demonstrated by the changes in LPL during cycles of feeding and fasting (4Eckel R.H. Borensztajn J.

However, recent studies demonstrated that the treatment of diabetes resulted in increases in LPL protein and LPL synthesis with no change in LPL mRNA levels, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation, possibly at the level of LPL translation (3Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tavangar K. Murata Y. Pedersen M.E. Goers J.F. Hoffman A.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Translational regulation has been identified as an important mechanism for the regulation of LPL in response to catecholamines and thyroid hormone (10Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Kern P.A. Ranganathan G. Yukht A. Ong J.M. Davis R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2332-2340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to catecholamines, cultured adipocytes demonstrate a 4-fold decrease in LPL synthesis mediated by the presence of a RNA-binding protein, which interacts with a region on the proximal 3′-UTR of LPL mRNA (12Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hypothyroid rats demonstrate an increase in LPL translation, and this is thought to be related to the absence of the RNA-binding protein that binds to the same region (11Kern P.A. Ranganathan G. Yukht A. Ong J.M. Davis R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2332-2340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of many other genes is regulated by translation, and this can occur through RNA-binding proteins that bind to specific regions of either the 5′- or 3′-UTRs of the mRNA, and interfere with translation (13Wormington M. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Kozak M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar).We have studied the mechanism involved in the regulation of LPL activity in the adipose tissue of diabetic rats. This inhibition of LPL activity was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in LPL synthetic rate with no significant change in LPL mRNA. To further characterize the mechanism involved, we made cytoplasmic extracts from adipocytes and studied the effect of cytoplasmic trans-acting factors on translation of various LPL constructs. We have identified a region of the 3′-UTR of LPL mRNA that is involved in an RNA protein interactions, resulting in inhibition of LPL translation in diabetes.RESULTSRats were sacrificed 14 days after streptozotocin injection. TableI shows the blood glucose and adipose tissue LPL activity in the three groups of rats. Because diabetes results in accelerated lipolysis and a reduction in fat cell size, LPL activity data were expressed per 106 cells (Table I). Blood glucose was uniformly elevated (>375 mg %) in the D rats, and LPL activity was decreased over 75% versus C. In the DI rats, blood glucose was lower than in the D rats, although still elevated compared with C. However, in the DI group of rats, LPL activity was greatly increased, and was higher than in the C group, especially in the heparin released fraction.To study the mechanism of regulation by diabetes and insulin treatment, LPL mRNA levels and LPL synthetic rate were measured. To examine LPL synthetic rate, adipocytes from C, D, and DI rats were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation of LPL. As shown in Fig. 1A, there was a 75% inhibition of LPL synthesis in the cells isolated from diabetic rat adipose tissue, whereas LPL synthetic rate in the DI adipocytes was similar to that in control adipocytes. To compare LPL mRNA levels, Northern blots were performed on the adipocytes from C, D, and DI rats. When expressed as the LPL/actin ratio, LPL mRNA in the D rat adipose tissue was no different from LPL mRNA in the C adipose tissue (Fig. 1 B). In a similar manner, the LPL/actin mRNA ratio in the DI adipocytes was not significantly different from the C group (Fig. 1 B). Thus, these data show that large changes in LPL activity can be explained by changes in LPL synthesis and are not reflected in changes in LPL mRNA. These data suggest that the major step of regulation is at the level of LPL translation.One mechanism of translational regulation involves the interaction of transacting factors with the 5′-UTR, leading to the dissociation of mRNA from the polysomes and an inhibition of translational initiation (30Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Enzyme ( Basel ). 1990; 44: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether such a mechanism also occurred with LPL, we studied the distribution of LPL mRNA on polysome preparations from C and D rat adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 2, we detected no change in the distribution of LPL mRNA associated with the polysomes. In both C and D rat adipose tissue, 40–45% of LPL mRNA was associated with polysomes, suggesting that the 5′-UTR was not be involved in the regulatory mechanism.Figure 2Effect of diabetes on LPL mRNA distribution in polysomes. Total RNA was extracted from C and D adipocytes after sucrose gradient fractionation of postmitochondrial supernatants. Fractions are numbered 1–24 from the bottomto the top of the gradient. The first 260 nm absorption peak was between fractions 1 and 3, which contains the mRNA, associated with the polysomes. The second peak was between fractions 10 and 15, which contains monosomes and short polysomes. Fractions 1–20 contain both 18 and 28 S ribosomal subunits. The amount of LPL mRNA present in each fraction was quantitated using RT-PCR and expressed as a percentage of the maximum LPL mRNA. The data shown represent one of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Another site for regulation by transacting binding proteins is the 3′-UTR, which is involved in the regulation of LPL by catecholamines (10Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar mechanism is involved with diabetes, we prepared cytoplasmic extracts from control and diabetic rat adipocytes as described under “Materials and Methods” and added these cytosolic extracts to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system containing LPL transcript. If cytoplasmic factors were present in the adipocyte extracts that bound to the LPL transcript and regulated translation, we would expect to see a change in LPL translation by the reticulocyte lysate system. In this in vitro translation reaction, we used three different constructs (Fig. 3). Each of these constructs contained the full 5′-UTR and coding sequence. The first 3.2-kilobase construct contained essentially the whole LPL mRNA sequence up to the first consensus polyadenylation sequence on the 3′-UTR (27Wion K.L. Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The second and third constructs contained progressive deletions of the 3′-UTR of the LPL mRNA and terminated at nucleotide 2435 and 1640, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, translation of constructs 1 and 2 was inhibited by the addition of diabetic adipocyte extracts. Although there was some inhibition of LPL translation by the control extracts, as described by us previously (11Kern P.A. Ranganathan G. Yukht A. Ong J.M. Davis R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2332-2340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the diabetic adipocyte extract significantly inhibited LPL translation in constructs 1 and 2. However, construct 3, which terminated at nucleotide 1640, was not inhibited by the addition of the extracts, indicating that an inhibitory factor was interacting with a sequence on the 3′-UTR beyond nucleotide 1640.To obtain further evidence for the interaction of a protein with the LPL 3′-UTR, we performed gel retardation assays. As described under “Materials and Methods,” RNA transcripts were made to fragments of LPL 3′-UTR spanning the region between nucleotides 1512 and 2144 (the end of the coding region is at nucleotide 1599). Equal amounts of adipocyte extract from C, D, and DI adipose tissue were then added to each of the 32P-labeled transcripts. Four overlapping RNA sequences were transcribed corresponding to LPL nucleotides 1512–1663, 1645–1833, 1818–2000, and 1981–2144 (transcripts 1–4, Fig. 4). Whereas RNA transcripts 1, 2, and 4 formed no complex with the diabetic adipose extract, RNA transcript 3, corresponding to nucleotides 1818–2000, formed a complex with the diabetic extract which caused a mobility shift (Fig. 4). Addition of the DI extract caused a mobility shift; however, the complex formed was 10-fold less intense with the same amount of extract protein, indicating a decrease in amount of complex generated. To demonstrate the specificity of this complex formation, we added an excess of unlabeled transcript 3. As shown in Fig. 5, an excess of transcript corresponding to nucleotides 1818–2000 prevented the gel shift, whereas the addition of an excess of irrelevant RNA transcript did not compete for complex formation.Figure 5Gel shift competition analysis on cytosolic extracts from control, diabetic, and insulin-treated rat adipocytes. Transcripts corresponding to LPL nucleotides 1818–2000 were incubated with C, D, or DI cytoplasmic extracts in the presence of unlabeled transcript, or irrelevant RNA transcript, as illustrated in the figure. Samples were separated on 5% polyacrylamide in 1× TBE and analyzed by autoradiography.

Cryer A. Ramji D.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The regulation of LPL in adipose tissue is complex and occurs at multiple cellular sites (33Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Insulin is an important regulator of adipose tissue LPL, but the mechanism of regulation by insulin is dependent on the species and system studied. For example, in humans and rats LPL activity is increased in the hyperinsulinemic postprandial state, and this increase is due to increased LPL posttranslational processing (5Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Changes in LPL activity are accompanied by increases in LPL mRNA levels in other animal models (34Enerbäck S. Semb H. Tavernier J. Bjursell G. Olivecrona T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 64: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of the effect of insulin on LPL in adipocytes have demonstrated increases in LPL mRNA levels in rat adipocyte primary cultures (18Ong J.M. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increased posttranscriptional processing in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (35Semenkovich C.F. Wims M. Noe L. Etienne J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9030-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes manifest decreased adipose LPL activity, which increases following treatment of the diabetes (2Pfeifer M.A. Brunzell J.D. Best J.D. Judzewitsch R.G. Halter J.B. Porte Jr., D. Diabetes. 1983; 32: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Taskinen M.-R. Nikkilä E.A. Diabetologia. 1979; 17: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Pykalisto O. Smith P.H. Brunzell J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1108-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In humans, this increase in LPL activity was not accompanied by an increase in mRNA levels, but was associated with an increase in LPL protein and synthetic rate (3Simsolo R.B. Ong J.M. Saffari B. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations were made in rats, which were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (9Tavangar K. Murata Y. Pedersen M.E. Goers J.F. Hoffman A.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since these data suggested a translational mechanism of regulation, we examined the regulation of LPL by streptozotocin-induced diabetes in greater detail.LPL activity was greatly decreased in the D rats compared with the C and DI rats. Of interest, the DI rats demonstrated LPL activity that was even higher than that of the control rats, which appeared to reflect the rapid rate of new LPL synthesis and processing that accompanied the administration of insulin. Similar finding were observed previously (9Tavangar K. Murata Y. Pedersen M.E. Goers J.F. Hoffman A.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When the adipose tissues of these rats were examined for LPL gene expression, there were minimal changes in LPL mRNA levels despite over 5-fold changes in LPL activity, indicating that the changes in LPL activity could not be explained based on the changes in LPL transcription. On the other hand, the changes in LPL synthesis, based on [35S]methionine labeling, closely paralleled the changes in LPL activity between the D and C rats. The considerable increase in LPL activity in the DI rats (compared with C) could not be accounted for by the small increase in LPL/actin mRNA and the increase in LPL synthetic rate, suggesting that posttranslational regulation was important, as has been described previously in other hyperinsulinemic states (5Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest that translational regulation is the primary means of LPL regulation in this setting of insulin deficiency.Translational regulation of protein synthesis can occur through the actions of trans-acting binding proteins and can involve sequences on either the 5′-UTR or 3′-UTR of the mRNA (14Kozak M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Involvement of the 5′-UTR has been described in the regulation of ferritin translation, where the binding of a trans-acting protein to the 5′-UTR resulted in the dissociation of ferritin mRNA from the polysomes (29Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 30Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Enzyme ( Basel ). 1990; 44: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To examine this mechanism in our system, we performed an analysis of polysomes prepared from control and diabetic adipocytes. We found no change in the distribution of LPL mRNA with the polysomes, suggesting that the translational regulation was not due to a change in initiation of translation.Translational regulation can also occur through interactions of transacting factors with the 3′-UTR (13Wormington M. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Ch'ng J.L. Shoemaker D.L. Schimmel P. Holmes E.W. Science. 1990; 245: 1003-1006Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We reported previously the involvement of trans-acting proteins that inhibited LPL translation by binding to the proximal 3′-UTR between nucleotides 1599 and 1638 (12Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We prepared cytoplasmic extracts from adipocytes derived from the C, D, and DI group of rats and added these extracts to an in vitro translation system. The cytoplasmic extract from the D rats inhibited translation of LPL in the reticulocyte lysate system. However, when the transcript used in the assay terminated at nucleotide 1640, the D extract did not inhibit translation, indicating that the motif on the 3′-UTR involved in regulating translation was located beyond nucleotide 1640.To further identify the motif, a gel shift analysis was performed, using overlapping 180–200 nucleotide RNA fragments corresponding to the 3′-UTR. These data indicated the presence of an RNA binding factor in the diabetic extract that interacted specifically with the RNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1818–2000. Taking into account the overlapping sequences of the other fragments, the motif for this RNA binding factor probably involves nucleotides 1834–1980. The cytoplasmic extract from DI rats did not inhibit LPL translationin vitro, but the gel shift reaction still demonstrated some residual binding. One explanation for this observation is the formation of an RNA-binding protein or complex that involves enzyme (e.g. kinase) activity. The adipose tissue from DI rats may still contain RNA binding protein, which may bind to the RNA, but it may be catalytically inactive due to the insulin treatment.Translational regulation of LPL has been identified previously following the depletion of PKC from adipocytes (37Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and following treatment of adipocytes with epinephrine and thyroid hormone (11Kern P.A. Ranganathan G.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the studies involving epinephrine and thyroid hormone, similar methods were used to identify the RNA binding motif, which was on the proximal 3′-UTR of LPL between nucleotides 1599 and 1638 (12Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the RNA binding motif in the diabetic adipose tissue (between nucleotides 1834 and 1980) is different from that of epinephrine treated cells and suggests that translation inhibition from diabetes may involve a different RNA-binding protein.In summary, insulin-deficient diabetic rats manifest low levels of adipose tissue LPL predominantly due to an inhibition of LPL translation. This decrease in translation is due to the interaction of a cytoplasmic substance with cis-acting sequences on the 3′-UTR of the LPL mRNA. The further characterization of this trans-acting substance will be important in the characterization of the abnormalities associated with the diabetic condition. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1 hydrolyzes the core of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein) into free fatty acids and monoacylglycerol, facilitating the removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the bloodstream. Patients with diabetes, especially insulin-deficient diabetes, often manifest a decrease in adipose tissue LPL activity, and this is accompanied by an increase in plasma triglycerides (1Taskinen M.R. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 551-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). With insulin treatment, there is an improvement in both LPL activity and triglycerides (2Pfeifer M.A. Brunzell J.D.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 89-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of LPL activity is closely linked to insulin levels and nutritional state, as demonstrated by the changes in LPL during cycles of feeding and fasting (4Eckel R.H. Borensztajn J.

Both in rat models of diabetes and human diabetes, the use of drugs to improve diabetes control resulted in increased adipose tissue LPL activity (1Taskinen M.R. Diabetes Metab.

However, recent studies demonstrated that the treatment of diabetes resulted in increases in LPL protein and LPL synthesis with no change in LPL mRNA levels, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation, possibly at the level of LPL translation (3Simsolo R.B.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1672-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Translational regulation has been identified as an important mechanism for the regulation of LPL in response to catecholamines and thyroid hormone (10Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Kern P.A. Ranganathan G. Yukht A. Ong J.M. Davis R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2332-2340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to catecholamines, cultured adipocytes demonstrate a 4-fold decrease in LPL synthesis mediated by the presence of a RNA-binding protein, which interacts with a region on the proximal 3′-UTR of LPL mRNA (12Ranganathan G. Vu D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hypothyroid rats demonstrate an increase in LPL translation, and this is thought to be related to the absence of the RNA-binding protein that binds to the same region (11Kern P.A. Ranganathan G. Yukht A. Ong J.M. Davis R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2332-2340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of many other genes is regulated by translation, and this can occur through RNA-binding proteins that bind to specific regions of either the 5′- or 3′-UTRs of the mRNA, and interfere with translation (13Wormington M. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Kozak M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). We have studied the mechanism involved in the regulation of LPL activity in the adipose tissue of diabetic rats. This inhibition of LPL activity was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in LPL synthetic rate with no significant change in LPL mRNA. To further characterize the mechanism involved, we made cytoplasmic extracts from adipocytes and studied the effect of cytoplasmic trans-acting factors on translation of various LPL constructs. We have identified a region of the 3′-UTR of LPL mRNA that is involved in an RNA protein interactions, resulting in inhibition of LPL translation in diabetes. RESULTSRats were sacrificed 14 days after streptozotocin injection. TableI shows the blood glucose and adipose tissue LPL activity in the three groups of rats. Because diabetes results in accelerated lipolysis and a reduction in fat cell size, LPL activity data were expressed per 106 cells (Table I). Blood glucose was uniformly elevated (>375 mg %) in the D rats, and LPL activity was decreased over 75% versus C. In the DI rats, blood glucose was lower than in the D r"

Its expression in a variety of adipocyte cell models is preceded by the appearance of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), which has been shown to regulate a number of other adipocyte-specific genes. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that several adipocyte cell lines that fail to express C/EBPα exhibit reduced insulin sensitivity, despite an apparent adipogenic phenotype. Here we show that transcription and function of the β3AR correlates with C/EBPα expression in these adipocyte models. A 5.13-kilobase pair fragment of the mouse β3AR promoter was isolated and sequenced. This fragment conferred a 50-fold increase in luciferase reporter gene expression in adipocytes. Two putative C/EBP binding sites exist at −3306 to −3298 and at −1462 to −1454, but only the more distal site is functional. Oligonucleotides corresponding to both the wild-type and mutated −3306 element were inserted upstream of a thymidine kinase luciferase construct. When cotransfected in fibroblasts with a C/EBPα expression vector, reporter gene expression increased 3-fold only in the wild-type constructs. The same mutation, when placed into the intact 5.13-kilobase pair promoter, reduced promoter activity in adipocytes from 50-fold to <10-fold. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that the site at −3306 generated a specific protein-oligonucleotide complex that was supershifted by C/EBPα antibody, while a probe corresponding to a putative site at −1462 did not.

For these reasons it is important to understand the tissue-specific and hormonal factors that regulate the expression of this receptor.Two groups of transcription factors are known to be responsible for initiating and maintaining adipocyte differentiation: the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) (11Freytag S.O.

From a large body of work in model adipocyte cell lines, such as 3T3-L1, it has been shown that the C/EBPs are expressed in a cascade-like fashion during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation, with C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ preceding the appearance of C/EBPα (15Yeh W.C.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate that the expression of the adipogenic transcription factor PPARγ is partially under the control of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and vice versa (22Wu Z.

Additionally, insulin-sensitive glucose uptake has been shown to be impaired in adipogenic cells that lack C/EBPα, due to deficits in insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (22Wu Z.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Like other adipocyte-specific genes, the β3AR is not expressed in preadipocytes, but appears late in the adipogenic program of both white and brown adipocytes (Refs. 25Feve B. Emorine L. Lasnier F. Strosberg D. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20329-20336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 26Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 40-45Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar; this report). Because of the pivotal role of C/EBPα in activating many adipocyte-specific genes, the focus of our studies was to determine the role of C/EBPα in initiating β3AR gene transcription during adipogenesis. Our results show that C/EBPα is required for the adipocyte-dependent expression of the mouse β3AR gene, and we define the C/EBP binding site in the β3AR promoter that is responsible for this regulation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that the mouse β3AR gene is specifically activated by C/EBPα and that this activation is correlated with the binding of C/EBPα to an element residing between −3306 and −3298 bp upstream of the β3AR gene transcription start site. By utilizing several cell lines that contain various combinations of the C/EBPs and PPARγ, we showed that only adipocytes expressing C/EBPα possess β3AR transcripts and concomitant functional activity. A 5.13-kb promoter fragment of the mouse β3AR gene containing two putative C/EBP binding sites, at −3306 to −3298 and at −1462 to −1454, confers robust expression of a luciferase reporter preferentially in adipocytes. This transcriptional activity is significantly decreased upon deletion of the more distal C/EBP element, while removal of the more proximal element had no further effect. We also showed that this C/EBP element at −3306 conveys transcriptional activity to C/EBPα in vitro. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays provided evidence that C/EBPα interacts specifically with the element at −3306 and not the element at −1462 in the mouse β3AR promoter. In every case, mutation of the −3306 C/EBP site eliminates these responses.Our observation that expression of the β3AR gene is positively regulated by C/EBPα is consistent with numerous reports showing the role of this transcription factor in adipogenesis. For example, ectopic expression of C/EBPα is sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation in a number of cell lines, while the expression of an antisense C/EBPα construct in 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocks differentiation (43Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vitrostudies, C/EBPα null mice fail to develop white adipose tissue (44Wang N. Finegold M. Bradley A. Ou C. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Taylor L. Wilson D. Darlington G. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).In addition to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have also been shown to be critical regulators of adipocyte differentiation. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are transiently expressed and precede the appearance of C/EBPα (12Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPδ, in preadipocytes converts them to adipocytes, suggesting that C/EBPβ can substitute for C/EBPα (15Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, the β/δ39 cells, which constitutively express C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, acquire an adipocyte phenotype, as evidenced by the presence of PPARγ and aP2, but fail to express either C/EBPα or β3AR. As shown in our gel shift assays, it appears that C/EBPβ is capable of binding the C/EBP element at −3306 in the mouse β3AR promoter. Perhaps this is not surprising because C/EBP isoforms have been shown to bind to a common DNA consensus sequence (21Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 41Elberg G. Gimble J.M. Tsai S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27815-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Despite this interaction, it is clear that C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ alone is insufficient to induce β3AR.Although we show a pivotal role for C/EBPα in transactivating the β3AR gene during adipogenesis, tissues containing high levels of C/EBPα, such as liver and lung, do not contain appreciable amounts of β3AR. In addition, we show that the NIH-α cells do not express β3AR in the preadipocyte state, despite the constitutive expression of C/EBPα. Therefore, it is clear that some other transcription factor(s) are important in directing the adipocyte-specific expression of the β3AR gene. Another key regulator of adipogenesis is PPARγ. Constitutive expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts can induce the conversion to the adipocyte phenotype (20Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). PPARγ ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones, which are a class of insulin-sensitizing agents, convert fibroblasts and multipotential stem cells to adipocytes (13Wu Z. Xie Y. Morrison R. Bucher N. Farmer S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 29Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Wilson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M.

Despite this apparent cooperation between C/EBPα and PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation, our initial attempts to locate a DR-1 PPARγ response element (PPRE) within our mouse β3AR promoter fragment or to demonstrate transactivation of the β3AR by PPARγ have been unsuccessful. It is plausible that a PPRE lies outside of the promoter region that we have isolated and studied. However, it is known that PPREs in several PPARγ target genes deviate significantly from the consensus DR-1 site (18Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For this reason we are currently investigating some regions that weakly resemble a PPRE half-site. To fully understand the role of the β3AR in obesity, it will be important for us to determine not only what other critical transcription factor(s) is/are required for the regulation of the β3AR gene, but how their effects on β3AR expression may contribute to obesity. The β3-adrenergic receptor (β3AR)1 is a unique member of the βAR family because, unlike the β1AR and β2AR, it is expressed predominantly in adipocytes and regulates both lipolysis and nonshivering thermogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Collins S.

For these reasons it is important to understand the tissue-specific and hormonal factors that regulate the expression of this receptor. Two groups of transcription factors are known to be responsible for initiating and maintaining adipocyte differentiation: the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) (11Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L.

From a large body of work in model adipocyte cell lines, such as 3T3-L1, it has been shown that the C/EBPs are expressed in a cascade-like fashion during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation, with C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ preceding the appearance of C/EBPα (15Yeh W.C.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate that the expression of the adipogenic transcription factor PPARγ is partially under the control of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and vice versa (22Wu Z.

Additionally, insulin-sensitive glucose uptake has been shown to be impaired in adipogenic cells that lack C/EBPα, due to deficits in insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (22Wu Z.

Like other adipocyte-specific genes, the β3AR is not expressed in preadipocytes, but appears late in the adipogenic program of both white and brown adipocytes (Refs. 25Feve B. Emorine L. Lasnier F. Strosberg D. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20329-20336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 26Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 40-45Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar; this report). Because of the pivotal role of C/EBPα in activating many adipocyte-specific genes, the focus of our studies was to determine the role of C/EBPα in initiating β3AR gene transcription during adipogenesis. Our results show that C/EBPα is required for the adipocyte-dependent expression of the mouse β3AR gene, and we define the C/EBP binding site in the β3AR promoter that is responsible for this regulation. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that the mouse β3AR gene is specifically activated by C/EBPα and that this activation is correlated with the binding of C/EBPα to an element residing between −3306 and −3298 bp upstream of the β3AR gene transcription start site. By utilizing several cell lines that contain various combinations of the C/EBPs and PPARγ, we showed that only adipocytes expressing C/EBPα possess β3AR transcripts and concomitant functional activity. A 5.13-kb promoter fragment of the mouse β3AR gene containing two putative C/EBP binding sites, at −3306 to −3298 and at −1462 to −1454, confers robust expression of a luciferase reporter preferentially in adipocytes. This transcriptional activity is significantly decreased upon deletion of the more distal C/EBP element, while removal of the more proximal element had no further effect. We also showed that this C/EBP element at −3306 conveys transcriptional activity to C/EBPα in vitro. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays provided evidence that C/EBPα interacts specifically with the element at −3306 and not the element at −1462 in the mouse β3AR promoter. In every case, mutation of the −3306 C/EBP site eliminates these responses.Our observation that expression of the β3AR gene is positively regulated by C/EBPα is consistent with numerous reports showing the role of this transcription factor in adipogenesis. For example, ectopic expression of C/EBPα is sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation in a number of cell lines, while the expression of an antisense C/EBPα construct in 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocks differentiation (43Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vitrostudies, C/EBPα null mice fail to develop white adipose tissue (44Wang N. Finegold M. Bradley A. Ou C. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Taylor L. Wilson D. Darlington G. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).In addition to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have also been shown to be critical regulators of adipocyte differentiation. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are transiently expressed and precede the appearance of C/EBPα (12Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPδ, in preadipocytes converts them to adipocytes, suggesting that C/EBPβ can substitute for C/EBPα (15Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, the β/δ39 cells, which constitutively express C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, acquire an adipocyte phenotype, as evidenced by the presence of PPARγ and aP2, but fail to express either C/EBPα or β3AR. As shown in our gel shift assays, it appears that C/EBPβ is capable of binding the C/EBP element at −3306 in the mouse β3AR promoter. Perhaps this is not surprising because C/EBP isoforms have been shown to bind to a common DNA consensus sequence (21Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 41Elberg G. Gimble J.M. Tsai S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27815-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Despite this interaction, it is clear that C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ alone is insufficient to induce β3AR.Although we show a pivotal role for C/EBPα in transactivating the β3AR gene during adipogenesis, tissues containing high levels of C/EBPα, such as liver and lung, do not contain appreciable amounts of β3AR. In addition, we show that the NIH-α cells do not express β3AR in the preadipocyte state, despite the constitutive expression of C/EBPα. Therefore, it is clear that some other transcription factor(s) are important in directing the adipocyte-specific expression of the β3AR gene. Another key regulator of adipogenesis is PPARγ. Constitutive expression of PPARγ in fibroblasts can induce the conversion to the adipocyte phenotype (20Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). PPARγ ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones, which are a class of insulin-sensitizing agents, convert fibroblasts and multipotential stem cells to adipocytes (13Wu Z. Xie Y. Morrison R. Bucher N.

Despite this apparent cooperation between C/EBPα and PPARγ in adipocyte differentiation, our initial attempts to locate a DR-1 PPARγ response element (PPRE) within our mouse β3AR promoter fragment or to demonstrate transactivation of the β3AR by PPARγ have been unsuccessful. It is plausible that a PPRE lies outside of the promoter region that we have isolated and studied. However, it is known that PPREs in several PPARγ target genes deviate significantly from the consensus DR-1 site (18Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For this reason we are currently investigating some regions that weakly resemble a PPRE half-site. To fully understand the role of the β3AR in obesity, it will be important for us to determine not only what other critical transcription factor(s) is/are required for the regulation of the β3AR gene, but how their effects on β3AR expression may contribute to obesity.

Vesicular or tubular structures transport folded proteins to the cis region of the Golgi complex, and the proteins process through the stacks of the Golgi complex to the trans side, after which vesicles deliver secretory proteins to the cell surface. Neuroendocrine cells, exocrine cells, peptidergic neurons, mast cells, and some other secretory cells have a specialized pathway to the cell surface in which certain secreted proteins are stored in concentrated forms in vesicles called secretory granules, so that the proteins are rapidly available in large amounts when needed. Concentration of protein hormones in granules is extensive; prolactin, for example, is 200 times more concentrated in dense cores of secretory granules than in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (1Farquhar M.G. Reid J.J. Daniell L.W. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 296-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism for concentrating proteins is self-association or aggregation; the formation of insoluble aggregates of prolactin in secretory granules is evidence for such a mechanism. Giannattasio et al. (2Giannattasio G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) isolated intact prolactin-containing secretory granules from rat pituitary glands and then removed the granule membranes with detergent. When the nonionic detergent Lubrol was used, the granule membranes dissolved, but the prolactin contents remained insoluble, and the dense cores of the granules retained their morphology (2Giannattasio G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dense cores of secretory granules with no surrounding membrane appear occasionally in the pericapillary space of the pituitary gland, indicating that the cores dissolve relatively slowly after exocytosis in animals (3Farquhar M.G. Dellmann H.-D. Johnson J.A. Klachko D.M. Comparative Endocrinology of Prolactin. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar, 4Zanini A. Giannattasio G. Nussdorfer G. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U.

Aggregates of prolactin resembling what are found in secretory granule cores are detectable by electron microscopy in the lumen of the trans-Golgi cisternae, so the process begins before the granules form (5Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Chretien M. Olivier L. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Prolactin in solution has a tendency to aggregate at mildly acidic pH (6Thompson M.E.

Such aggregation in solution has led to one of the simplest models for concentrating secretory granule proteins, which is that secretory proteins are soluble in the secretory pathway until they reach the trans-Golgi region, where they aggregate, facilitated by the decrease in pH that occurs there. In this model, aggregation in the trans-Golgi cisternae may play a role in sorting proteins as well as concentrating secretory granule proteins (14Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 15Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar), since small vesicles carry off soluble proteins, leaving behind aggregated proteins, too large to remove, to form dense cores of secretory granules. Prolactin and growth hormone have several properties that make them useful for understanding the processes that lead to storage in secretory granules. They are small (22 kDa), monomeric proteins that are stored in granules and neither glycosylated nor proteolytically processed beyond the cleavage of the signal sequence necessary for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. They are structurally similar proteins (16Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, their storage is regulated differently in a pituitary cell line. GH4C1cells are rat pituitary tumor cells that make prolactin, growth hormone, chromogranin B, and secretogranin II. These cells accumulate secretory granules with dense cores of prolactin and store prolactin when cultured with insulin, estradiol, and epidermal growth factor (17Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The patterns of prolactin release from GH4C1 cells cultured in these conditions and prolactin release from primary cultures of lactotrophs are similar when release is stimulated by several different mechanisms (18Delbeke D. Kojima I. Dannies P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1985; 43: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), indicating that the regulated pathway of secretory granules in these cells behaves as it does in normal lactotrophs. When GH4C1cells are cultured in the absence of estradiol, insulin, and epidermal growth factor, however, there are few dense core secretory granules in the cells, and prolactin storage is reduced (17Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Treatment does not increase storage of other proteins in secretory granules in these cells, including growth hormone, despite its similarity to prolactin (17Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S.

We have investigated whether hormone treatment increases the ability of cells to store prolactin by regulating their ability to aggregate prolactin preferentially. GH4C1cells, 1.5 × 105 cells/60-mm plate, were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture plus 15% gelding serum with or without hormone treatment (1 nm estradiol, 300 nm insulin, and 5 nm epidermal growth factor), as indicated, and used 4 days after plating. For incorporation of 35S-amino acids, cells were incubated with 200 μCi of Express 35S-Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 mm MES,1 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm NaHCO3, and 5% gelding serum (Central Biomedia, Inc.). During the chase period, cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, plus 2 mm cysteine, 2 mm methionine, 10 mmHepes, 10 mm MES, 4 mm NaHCO3, and 15% gelding serum with or without added estradiol, insulin, and epidermal growth factor. For analysis at each time point, medium and cells were collected, and cells were dissolved in 0.32 msucrose, 1.5% Lubrol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin and then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. When indicated, the cell lysate was layered over a 1.2 msucrose cushion before centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitation followed by gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (22Lee M.S. Dirkx Jr., R. Solimena M. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The amount of35S-protein in the supernatant, pellet, and medium was quantified after gel electrophoresis using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). AtT20 and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 2.5 × 105cells/60-mm plate, and transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen), no more than six plates at a time using Superfect stored in aliquots to ensure good replicate transfections. Pulse-chase analysis was performed 1 day after transfection. Antiserum to human growth hormone was from the NIDDK National Hormone and Pituitary Program and A. F. Parlow, and antiserum to human serum albumin was from Sigma. We obtained a clone of human albumin cDNA from the American Type Culture Collection, pILMALB5. This clone was missing the first 5 amino acids, which we added by polymerase chain reaction after inserting the sequence into pcDNA3 (InVitrogen), by using the primer 5′-cacgaattcggcagaatgaagtgggtaacctttatttcccttctttttctc-3′ and the bovine growth hormone sequencing primer in pcDNA3. Human growth hormone cDNA was a gift from Drs. Francis DeNoto (23DeNoto F.M. Moore D.D. Goodman H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3719-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and Brian West and cloned into pcDNA3 by adding XhoI and HindIII sites using 5′-tgtctcgagtattaggacaaggctggt-3′ and 5′-acaaagcttcctgtggacagctac-3′ as primers and del32–46 made as described previously (24Lee M.S.

P89L growth hormone was prepared using those primers, plus 5′-aactgcacgagctccagccacgactg-3′ and 5′-gctggagctcgtgcagttcctcagg-3′ by the overlapping primer technique of Ho et al. (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The constructions were sequenced by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University) and determined to be correct. GH4C1 cells were incubated with 150 μm N-(-((2, 4-dinitrophenyl)amino)propyl)-N-(3-aminopropyl)methylamine (DAMP) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in the presence or absence of 30 μm chloroquine for 30 min and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 120 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. DAMP was detected in cells using fluorescein-conjugated anti-dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 microscope at the Yale University Center for Cell Imaging. AtT20 cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 120 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and stained for human growth hormone using antiserum from the NIDDK National Hormone and Pituitary Program and A. F. Parlow and goat anti-rabbit antiserum conjugated to Texas red (Molecular Probes) as a second antibody. The properties of newly synthesized proteins were assessed immediately after a 10-min incubation with 35S-amino acids and also during a subsequent incubation with unlabeled amino acids to follow changes as proteins progressed through the secretory pathway. At the end of a 10-min pulse with 35S-amino acids,35S-prolactin is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (1Farquhar M.G. Reid J.J. Daniell L.W. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 296-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In GH4C1 cells treated with hormones, over 90% of newly synthesized 35S-prolactin was soluble when cell membranes were disrupted with Lubrol. At longer times after synthesis, some of the intracellular 35S-prolactin became insoluble in Lubrol (Fig. 1), a property of prolactin aggregates in the dense cores of secretory granules (2Giannattasio G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Over 50% of the total 35S-prolactin (intracellular plus extracellular) was insoluble 30 min after the end of the incubation with 35S-amino acids in the experiments summarized in Fig. 1; the portion of 35S-prolactin that became insoluble at 30 min ranged from 37 to 65% of the total35S-prolactin in all experiments. The investigations of prolactin aggregates in dense cores of secretory granules used 0.4% Lubrol to disrupt the membranes (2Giannattasio G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In most experiments, we used 1.5% Lubrol to disrupt the membranes; we found no difference in the percentage of 35S-prolactin that was insoluble using concentrations of Lubrol ranging from 0.4 to 1.5% (not shown). Lubrol is a more effective detergent for preserving aggregates of prolactin in the dense cores of secretory granules than sodium deoxycholate or SDS (2Giannattasio G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and this was also true in GH4C1 cells. There was much less insoluble35S-prolactin after a 30-min chase when cells were disrupted with sodium deoxycholate or SDS (TableI) than when they were disrupted by Lubrol. Purified prolactin remains at the top of a sucrose gradient in 0.3 m sucrose, but aggregates of prolactin in the dense cores of secretory granules sediment through 1.2 m sucrose, analyzed by velocity sedimentation over a sucrose cushion (2Giannattasio G. Zanini A. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 64: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This characteristic is shared by much of the Lubrol-insoluble form of35S-prolactin in GH4C1 cells. The proportion of 35S-prolactin in GH4C1 cells that had the size and density to sediment through 1.2 m sucrose increased with time after synthesis (Table II). In most experiments, we added detergent directly to cells to obtain rapid and complete recovery of 35S-prolactin, but in one experiment, we lysed the cells with a ball homogenizer and removed the nuclei with a low speed spin before adding Lubrol. The results were similar to when cells were lysed directly; the proportion of intracellular35S-prolactin that was Lubrol-insoluble after a 30-min chase period was 53 ± 2.5%, and 38 ± 1.6% sedimented through 1.2 m sucrose, indicating that the presence of nuclear components did not contribute to the sedimentation properties.Table IInsolubility of 35 S prolactin in detergentsDetergentInsoluble%1.5% Lubrol59 ± 21.5% deoxycholate4.6 ± 0.60.1% SDS9.9 ± 1.0GH4C1 cells were incubated for 10 min with35S-amino acids and then for 30 min after the 35S-amino acids were removed.

Although dense cores of prolactin secretory granules dissolve slowly enough so that they are detected outside cells of the pituitary gland after exocytosis (3Farquhar M.G. Dellmann H.-D. Johnson J.A.

Lubrol-insoluble prolactin in GH4C1 cells remains insoluble for over 1 h after the membranes are disrupted when incubated at 4 °C but becomes soluble rapidly when incubated at 37 °C, behavior consistent with the properties of prolactin in vivo (Table III).Table IIIEffect of temperature on solubility of 35 S-prolactinTemperatureInsoluble°C%452 ± 3.12216 ± 0.8370.9 ± 0GH4C1 cells were incubated with 35S-amino acids for 10 min, and cells were collected 30 min after the end of that incubation.

The data are the percentage of intracellular35S-prolactin that is insoluble. GH4C1 cells cultured in the absence of estradiol, insulin, and epidermal growth factor contain few secretory granules and store little prolactin relative to what they make (17Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized 35S-prolactin, however, showed the same conversion to a Lubrol-insoluble form with time in GH4C1 cells not treated with hormones (Fig.2). Thirty minutes after the incubation with 35S-amino acids, over 50% of the total35S-prolactin was Lubrol-insoluble. At this time, little35S-prolactin had been secreted, but over 70% was secreted by 2 h after the pulse (Fig. 2). The intracellular Lubrol-insoluble form decreased as 35S-prolactin was secreted from the cells, indicating that this form, and not just soluble prolactin, was secreted. After 2 h, more35S-prolactin was secreted from cells that had not been treated with hormones than from hormone-treated cells (TableIV). Over 90% of the Lubrol-insoluble form of 35S-prolactin 30 min after synthesis sedimented through a 1.2 m sucrose solution (not shown), indicating that the insoluble form of prolactin has the same properties in GH4C1 cells that do not store prolactin as in cells that do.Table IVSecretion of newly synthesized prolactin and growth hormone from GH 4 C 1 cellsGrowth hormoneProlactin%%Untreated77 ± 366 ± 5Treated72 ± 636 ± 3The secretion of rat 35S-growth hormone or35S-prolactin 2 h after a 10-min pulse of35S-amino acids as a percentage of the total35S-hormone in the culture is given.

Untreated cells were cultured in medium containing 15% gelding serum with no additions, and treated cells were cultured in medium containing 1 nm estradiol, 300 nm insulin, and 5 nm epidermal growth factor. Growth hormone is structurally similar to prolactin and is also stored in a concentrated form in secretory granules in the pituitary gland (16Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). GH4C1 cells produce both prolactin and growth hormone, but they do not store growth hormone well, and its storage is not increased by the hormone treatment that increases prolactin storage (17Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In GH4C1 cells, intracellular rat 35S-growth hormone behaved as prolactin did; it also became Lubrol-insoluble within 30 min after the pulse period, and the amount of the insoluble form declined subsequently as growth hormone was secreted from the cells (Fig. 2). GH4C1 cells secreted most35S-growth hormone within 2 h after its synthesis, whether cells were treated with hormones or not (Fig. 2 and TableIV). The conversion to an insoluble form appears to require transport along the secretory pathway. After the pulse of 35S-amino acids, either treating GH4C1 cells with brefeldin A, which disrupts transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (26Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar), or incubating them at 15 °C, which prevents transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (27Saraste J. Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), greatly reduced formation of the Lubrol-insoluble form of rat prolactin in GH4C1cells (Fig. 3). Incubating GH4C1 cells at 20 °C, which prevents transport from the trans-Golgi cisternae (28Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), reduced formation of the Lubrol-insoluble form of rat prolactin but not as much as the incubations at 15 °C. The conversion did not absolutely require an acidic compartment in the secretory pathway. The addition of 30 μm chloroquine at concentrations that neutralize acidic compartments in neuroendocrine cells (29Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6922-6928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mains R.E. May V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7887-7894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) slowed the conversion of 35S-prolactin to the insoluble form in GH4C1 cells but did not prevent the conversion (Fig. 1 C). Concentrations of 10 μm but not 1 μm chloroquine exerted similar effects, and the conversion of rat 35S-growth hormone was affected in a similar manner to 35S-prolactin in GH4C1 cells (not shown). Bafilomycin A1 inhibits vacuolar proton ATPases and therefore also neutralizes acidic compartments in cells (31Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar) and had a similar effect to chloroquine (Fig. 4). Bafilomycin A1 (1.6 μm) slowed secretion but did not prevent conversion to the insoluble form. We confirmed that acidic compartments in the cells are neutralized by immunostaining for DAMP, which accumulates in acidic compartments (32Anderson R.G. Pathak R.K. Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Treatment with chloroquine prevented the accumulation of DAMP in the cells (Fig.5).Figure 5Accumulation of DAMP in the presence or absence of chloroquine in GH4C1 cells treated with insulin, estrogen, and epidermal growth factor. Cells were incubated with 150 μm DAMP in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 30 μm chloroquine, and the accumulation of DAMP was assessed by immunofluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The conversion of growth hormone to a Lubrol-insoluble form also occurs in another neuroendocrine cell line, AtT20, a mouse pituitary cell line that produces proopiomelanocortin and stores ACTH in secretory granules. Human 35S-growth hormone, expressed in transiently transfected AtT20 cells, behaved as rat growth hormone in GH4C1 cells; it was soluble initially and became about 40% Lubrol-insoluble after 30 min (Fig.6). Serum albumin is secreted directly from the liver without storage and shows the same behavior when expressed in AtT20 cells (33Song L. Fricker L.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 35S-Albumin, expressed in transiently transfected AtT20 cells, was mostly soluble after synthesis and showed no change in solubility with increasing time (Fig. 6). The conversion of growth hormone to a Lubrol-insoluble form was less pronounced in COS cells than it was in neuroendocrine cells. Less than 10% of the total 35S-growth hormone became insoluble in transiently transfected COS cells (Fig.7). The ability to measure Lubrol insolubility in transfected cells allowed us to investigate how rigorous the structural requirements are for the process. Prolactin and growth hormone from almost all species, except a few fish, have a conserved proline in the second α-helix, proline 89 in human growth hormone. This residue is not involved in direct binding to growth hormone receptors"
https://openalex.org/W2139898970,"CD43, one of the most abundant glycoproteins on the T cell surface, has been implicated in selection and maturation of thymocytes and migration, adhesion, and activation of mature T cells. The adapter molecule Cbl has been shown to be a negative regulator of Ras. Furthermore, it may also regulate intracellular signaling through the formation of several multi-molecular complexes. Here we investigated the role of Cbl in the CD43-mediated signaling pathway in human T cells. Unlike T cell receptor signaling, the interaction of the adapter protein Cbl with Vav and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, resulting from CD43-specific signals, is independent of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting an alternative mechanism of interaction. CD43 signals induced a Cbl serine phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the tau-isoform of 14-3-3. protein. Protein kinase C-mediated Cbl serine phosphorylation was required for this interaction, because the PKC inhibitor RO-31-8220 prevented it, as well as 14-3-3 dimerization. Moreover, mutation of Cbl serine residues 619, 623, 639, and 642 abolished the interaction between Cbl and 14-3-3. Overexpression of Cbl in Jurkat cells inhibited the CD43-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and AP-1 transcriptional activity, confirming nevertheless a negative role for Cbl in T cell signaling. However, under normal conditions, PKC activation resulting from CD43 engagement was required to activate the MAPK pathway, suggesting that phosphorylation of Cbl on serine residues by PKC and its association with 14-3-3 molecules may play a role in preventing the Cbl inhibitory effect on the Ras-MAPK pathway. These data suggest that by inducing its phosphorylation on serine residues, CD43-mediated signals may regulate the molecular associations and functions of the Cbl adapter protein."
https://openalex.org/W2161396786,"The activity of melanocortin receptors (MCR) is regulated by melanocortin peptide agonists and by the endogenous antagonists, Agouti protein and AgRP (Agouti-related protein). To understand how the selectivity for these structurally unrelated agonists and antagonist is achieved, chimeric and mutants MC3R and MC4R were expressed in cell lines and pharmacologically analyzed. A region containing the third extracellular loop, EC3, of MC4R was essential for selective Agouti protein antagonism. In addition, this part of MC4R, when introduced in MC3R, conferred Agouti protein antagonism. Further mutational analysis of this region of MC4R demonstrated that Tyr268 was required for the selective interaction with Agouti protein, because a profound loss of the ability of Agouti protein to inhibit 125I-labeled [Nle4,d-Phe7]α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) binding was observed by the single mutation of Tyr268 to Ile. This same residue conferred selectivity for the MC4R selective agonist, [d-Tyr4]MT-II, whereas it inhibited interaction with the MC3R-selective agonist, [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH. Conversely, mutation of Ile265 in MC3 (the corresponding residue of Tyr268) to Tyr displayed a gain of affinity for [d-Tyr4]MT-II, but not for Agouti protein, and a loss of affinity for [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH as compared with wild-type MC3R. This single amino acid mutation thus confers the selectivity of MC3R toward a pharmacological profile like that observed for MC4R agonists but not for the antagonist, Agouti protein.

The identification of the endogenous MC receptor antagonists, Agouti protein and Agouti related-protein (AgRP), gave rise to an additional level of regulation of MC receptors, in which ligands with opposite activities control MCR activity (4Ollmann M.M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, whether the molecular interaction with the receptor of these oppositely acting ligands is achieved in a similar manner. Mouse Agouti protein is a 131-amino acid protein normally expressed in hair follicles, which acts on MC1R-expressing melanocytes to regulate pigmentation (6Bultman S.J. Michaud E.J. Woychik R.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 7Miller M.W. Duhl D.M. Vrieling H. Cordes S.P. Ollmann M.M. Winkes B.M. Barsh G.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 454-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In mice that ectopically overexpress Agouti protein, chronic MC1R blockade by Agouti protein results in a yellow coat color. In addition, these mice display severe obesity, hyperphagia, and increased plasma levels of the adipose derived satiety factor, leptin (8Wolff G.L. Roberts D.W. Galbraith D.B. J.

In these mice, obesity is thought to be the result of continuous blockade of the hypothalamic MC4R, since recombinant murine Agouti protein has been demonstrated to act as a high affinity antagonist for both mouse MC1R and MC4R in vitro but not for MC3R and MC5R (10Lu D.

This determination is in agreement with the finding that MC4R−/− mice recapitulate the obesity phenotype as observed in yellow obese mice (2Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H.

But its homologue, AgRP, is expressed in the hypothalami of mice, rats, primates, and humans (13Haskell-Luevano C. Chen P. Li C. Chang K. Smith M.S. Cameron J.L. Cone R.D.

Dickinson C.J. Wilken J. Barsh G.S. Kent S.B. Gantz I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice that overexpress AgRP display an obesity phenotype similar to that found in MC4R−/− mice (4Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Yang Y.K. Kerns J.A. Chen Y. Gantz I. Barsh G.S. Science. 1997; 278: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Thus, pharmacological, histochemical, and genetic studies suggest that hypothalamic AgRP is an important endogenous stimulator of feeding and exerts this function by inhibiting MCR signaling. Even though an important role of MC4R in body weight homeostasis is evident, the role of MC3R in the control of body weight and other processes is ill-defined because of the absence of MC3R selective ligands. Knowledge of the interaction between MCR and its ligands at the level of molecular detail would contribute to the design of selective MC3R and MC4R ligands. This is important not only for the understanding of MCR subtype-specific functions, but in addition, ligands that selectively activate or block MC4R may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of obesity (18Bray G.A. Tartaglia L.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and anorexia (19Huang Q.H. Hruby V.J. Tatro J.B. Am. J.

To investigate whether MCR agonists and the structurally unrelated antagonist, Agouti protein, are regulated in a similar manner, the aim of this study was to identify which part of the human MC4R is important for selective Agouti protein interaction and antagonism. To this end, chimeric and mutant MC3R and MC4R were expressed in cell lines and were tested for their interaction with full-length human Agouti protein, [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH, and [d-Tyr4]MT-II. The results indicate that a single residue in MC4R is required for the selective interaction with Agouti protein. In addition, the results show that selectivity for structurally unrelated agonists and antagonist is achieved in a similar manner. NDP-α-MSH ([Nle4,d-Phe7]-α-MSH) and α-MSH were purchased from Bachem Feinchemicalien, Bubendorf, Switzerland. [d-Tyr4]MT-II and [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH were synthesized using solid phase Fmoc chemistry and purified as described previously (21Schaaper W.M. Adan R.A. Posthuma T.A. Oosterom J. Gispen W.H. Meloen R.H.

In short, 4 μg of NDP-α-MSH was mixed with 1.2 IU bovine lactoperoxidase (Calbiochem) and 1 mCi of Na125I (ICN) in a final volume of 100 μl of 0.05m phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Then, 5 μl of 0.003% H2O2 was added every 60 s. After 4 min, 50 μl of 1 mm dithiothreitol was added to stop the reaction. The sample was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography with a μBondapak C18 column, 3.9 × 300 mm (Waters, Div. of Millipore) by elution with a 22–52% acetonitrile gradient in 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.5) in 40 min. The specific activity of 125I-NDP-α-MSH was 2.25 × 106 Ci/mol. All chimeric and MCR mutants used in this study were generated by polymerase chain reaction, and the sequences were verified as described previously (23Oosterom J. Nijenhuis W.A. Schaaper W.M.

The chimeric receptors were named after the extracellular receptor domain that was replaced. With “A” being the N-terminal domain (corresponding to residues 1–60 of MC4R), “B” the first extracellular loop (EC1, residues 67–142), “C” the second extracellular loop (EC2, residues 149–195), and “D” the third extracellular loop (EC3, residues 202–332). These receptors include chimera 3AB (MC4R with N-terminal through TM3 of MC3R), 3B (MC4R with IC1 through TM3 of MC3), 3C (MC4R with IC2 through EC2 of MC3), 3D (MC4R with TM5 through C-terminal of MC3R), 4D (the reverse of chimera 3D; MC3R with TM5 through C-terminal of EC3 of MC4R), “Loop” (MC4R with EC3 of MC3R), “1st half” (MC4R with first half of EC3 of MC3R), “2nd half” (MC4R with second half of EC3 of MC3R), and mutant MC4 (Tyr268 → Ile). In these constructs, EC3 of MC4R runs from residue Phe267through Ala282, the first half of EC3 runs from Phe267 through Gln273, and the second half of EC3 runs from Val278 through Ala282 (Fig.1). For the radioligand and adenylate cyclase assays, wild-type rat MC3R (24Roselli-Rehfuss L. Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Low M.J. Tatro J.B. Entwistle M.L. Simerly R., B. Cone R.D. Proc.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15174-15179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chimerae 3AB, 3B, 3C, 3D, and 4D were stably expressed in B16G4F mouse melanoma cells. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In addition, human MC4R, loop, 1st half, 2nd half, and MC4 (Tyr268 → Ile) were expressed in 293 HEK cells and used in the radioligand binding assay. 293 HEK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. An MC3R mutant was generated in which Ile265 of MC3R was mutated into Tyr (MC3(Ile265 → Tyr)). This mutant was made using the QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The rat MC3R cloned in pcDNA3.1 was used as template. The sequence of the mutagenic oligonucleotides was 5′-TTCCTCCACCTGGTCCTGTACATCACCTGCCCCACCAACC-3′ and its complementary oligonucleotide. For the pharmacological analysis, the rat MC3R (wild type) and MC3(Ile265 → Tyr) were expressed in BHK (baby hamster kidney) and 293 HEK cells with similar results. These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. B16G4F cells, stably expressing human MC4R, rat MC3R, and chimerae 3AB, 3B, 3C, 3D, or 4D were grown in 24-well plates (Corning Costar). Agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was measured as described previously (26Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). In short, after prelabeling with 500 μl of [3H]adenine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a concentration of 2 μCi/ml, the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, α-MSH in a concentration ranging from 0.3 nm to 3 μm, with and without 40 nm Agouti protein. The cells were harvested, and [3H]cAMP formation was calculated as the percentage of [3H]ATP converted into [3H]cAMP. For each curve, 12 duplicate data points were collected. EC50 values were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve with variable slope using GraphPad Prism 2.01 for Windows 95/NT (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Experiments were performed two times with the same results. MC receptor expressing B16G4F, 293 HEK cells, or BHK cells were grown in 24-well plates (Corning Costar). The cells were incubated with 100,000 cpm (≈0.1 nm) of125I-NDP-α-MSH and various concentrations of nonradioactive peptides diluted in binding buffer consisting of Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) (pH 7.4), 2.5 mmcalcium chloride, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm calcium chloride and lysed in 1m sodium hydroxide. Radioactivity of the lysates was counted in a Packard Cobra γ-counter. Competition curves were fitted from 12 duplicate data points with GraphPad Prism 2.01 for Windows 95/NT, nonlinear regression, one-site competition. IC50values were calculated with 99% confidence interval. Experiments were repeated at least two times with the same results. The affinities (IC50 values, using125I-NDP-α-MSH as radioligand) of full-length human Agouti protein, AgRP, and NDP-α-MSH were determined for the wild-type MC4R and MC3R expressed in B16G4F cells. NDP-α-MSH and AgRP possessed comparable IC50 values for both MC3R and MC4R (Fig.2). In contrast, Agouti protein displayed an almost 40-fold lower affinity for MC3R than AgRP and NDP-α-MSH, whereas Agouti protein displayed high affinity for MC4R. The IC50 of Agouti protein was 10-fold higher for MC3R than for MC4R. 2In this study, the terms “binding” and “affinity” always refer to the ability of a ligand to compete for125I-NDP-α-MSH binding. Next, the antagonistic properties of Agouti protein were analyzed. Agouti protein at a concentration of 40 nm was a potent antagonist for MC4R (Fig. 3) and was able to increase the EC50 of α-MSH almost 20-fold (TableI). In contrast, the same concentration of Agouti protein was not able to significantly alter the EC50 of α-MSH for MC3R.Table IEC 50 value (in nm) of α-MSH in the absence and presence of 40 nm human Agouti protein for MC3R, MC4R, and chimerae 3AB, 3B, 3C, 3D, and 4D expressed in B16G4F cellsMC4RMC3R3AB3B3C3D4Dα-MSH8.61.51.345.2583.2α-MSH + Agouti1441-aStatistically significant different from EC50 for α-MSH (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).3.9691-aStatistically significant different from EC50 for α-MSH (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).211-aStatistically significant different from EC50 for α-MSH (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).601-aStatistically significant different from EC50 for α-MSH (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).1131121-aStatistically significant different from EC50 for α-MSH (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).(α­MSH+Agouti)α­MSH16.72.6535.2121.935EC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism, sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting, variable slope.1-a Statistically significant different from EC50 for α-MSH (p < 0.01, unpaired t test). Open table in a new tab EC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism, sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting, variable slope. In addition, it was investigated as to which region of MC4R is required for the antagonistic properties of Agouti protein. Therefore, the ability of Agouti protein to antagonize α-MSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of chimeric MC3/MC4 receptors was analyzed. Agouti protein was able to effectively antagonize α-MSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity for all chimeric receptors except chimera 3D, which only has the C-terminal portion of MC3R starting at TM5 (Fig. 3 and Table I). Furthermore, the reverse chimera, 4D, which is an MC3R with only the C-terminal portion (starting at TM5) of MC4R, was able to confer Agouti protein antagonism to MC3R. Agouti protein was unable to significantly increase the EC50 of α-MSH for chimera 3D as observed for MC3R. To assess which region of MC4R determined the high affinity of Agouti protein for MC4R, the IC50 values of Agouti protein for chimeric MC3/MC4 receptors was analyzed. TableII summarizes the IC50 values of Agouti protein for all chimeric receptors. Chimerae 3AB, 3B, and 3C all displayed a high affinity for Agouti, which was not significantly different from the IC50 for MC4R. However, chimera 3D (MC4R with the C-terminal portion of MC3R, starting at TM5), displayed a significant reduction in the affinity for Agouti protein. The affinities of Agouti protein for chimera 3D and MC3R were comparable (Fig. 4). Conversely, chimera 4D (the reverse of 3D, MC3R with the C-terminal portion of MC4R) displayed high affinity for Agouti protein, which was not different from wild-type MC4R.Table IIInhibition constants (IC 50 in nm) of human Agouti protein for MC3R, MC4R, and chimerae 3AB, 3B, 3C, 3D, and 4DMC4MC33AB3B3C3D4DAgouti protein121122-aStatistically significant different from IC50 of Agouti protein for MC4R (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).3813141232-aStatistically significant different from IC50 of Agouti protein for MC4R (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).20All receptors were stably expressed in B16G4F cells.

IC50values were determined from competition binding curves using125I-NDP-α-MSH as radioligand, derived from 12 duplicate data points using GraphPad Prism, one site competition. Next, the role of EC3 of MC4R in interaction with Agouti protein was further specified. To this end, wild-type MC4R, mutant MC4(Tyr268 → Ile), and chimeric MC4R with small parts of EC3 of MC3R were expressed in 293 HEK cells. The chimera were: loop (MC4R with EC3 from MC3R), 1st half (MC4R with first half of EC3 from MC3R), and 2nd half (MC4R with second half of EC3 from MC3R). Fig.5 and TableIII show that the affinities of NDP-α-MSH for the MC4R, chimeric, and mutant receptors were comparable. However, when EC3 of MC4R was replaced by MC3R sequence (loop), the IC50 for Agouti protein increased more than 4-fold as compared with MC4R. This loss of affinity was also observed when only the first half of EC3 was replaced (1st half). Moreover, when only Tyr268 in the first half of EC3 of MC4R was mutated to Ile, the corresponding residue of MC3R, a more than 10-fold drop in Agouti protein affinity was still observed. In contrast, replacement of the second half of EC3 (2nd halfchimera) did not alter the affinity for Agouti protein as compared with wild-type MC4R. Next, MC3(Ile265 → Tyr), the reverse mutant of MC4 (Tyr268 → Ile), was analyzed by determining the IC50 values of NDP-α-MSH, Agouti protein, [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH, and [d-Tyr4]MT-II affinity (Fig.6 and TableIV). The latter two peptides were shown previously to display increased and decreased affinity, respectively, for MC4 (Tyr268 → Ile) (21Schaaper W.M. Adan R.A. Posthuma T.A. Oosterom J. Gispen W.H. Meloen R.H. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1998; 5: 1-4Google Scholar). The data show that the IC50 of NDP-α-MSH and Agouti protein for MC3R and MC3(Ile265 → Tyr) did not significantly differ. However, the affinity of [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH was ∼40 times lower for the mutant as compared with MC3R. In contrast, the affinity of [d-Tyr4]MT-II was significantly higher for MC3(Ile265 → Tyr).Table IIIInhibition constants (IC 50 in nm) of human Agouti protein for the MC4R, chimerae loop, 1st half, 2nd half, and mutant MC4 (Tyr 268 → Ile) expressed in 293 HEK cellsMC4loop1st half2nd halfTyr268 → IleNDP-α-MSH8116.98.35Agouti protein17>713-aStatistically significant different from IC50 of Agouti protein for MC4R (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).>1533-aStatistically significant different from IC50 of Agouti protein for MC4R (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).10>1703-aStatistically significant different from IC50 of Agouti protein for MC4R (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).For each ligand, IC50 values were determined from competition binding curves derived from 12 duplicate data points.

The melanocortin system is unique in the sense that MCR activity is regulated by two structurally unrelated endogenous peptides with opposing activities: on the one hand, POMC-derived melanocortin agonists, and on the other hand, Agouti protein and AgRP, which act as antagonists for MCR. Currently, selective MCR ligands are necessary to obtain a better understanding of the role of brain MC3R and MC4R in processes like the regulation of body weight. Because Agouti protein is a high affinity antagonist for the MC4R, this study was aimed at characterizing the selective interaction of human Agouti protein with the human MC4R. The pharmacological analysis of chimeric and mutant MC3R and MC4R suggested that a single amino acid residue in the first half of the third extracellular loop of MC4R conferred selectivity for Agouti protein. The results confirm that human Agouti protein is a high affinity antagonist for MC4R but not for MC3R. In contrast, AgRP does not discriminate between MC3R and MC4R. The selective interaction of Agouti protein with MC4R was studied using chimeric and mutant MC3R and MC4R. Apparently, the lower affinity of Agouti protein for chimera 3D (MC4R with EC3 and surrounding domains of MC3R) and MC3R wild type accounts for the inability of Agouti protein to antagonize α-MSH action on these receptors. Chimera 4D was tested for a gain of function for Agouti binding and antagonism to test whether this region (EC3 and surrounding domains of MC4R) alone is sufficient to obtain an MC4R-specific pharmacological profile. Indeed, this EC3-containing region of MC4R fully conferred Agouti protein antagonism to MC3R. Thus, this region changes the MC3R pharmacological profile to that of MC4R. A more detailed analysis of the role of EC3 in Agouti protein binding showed that the first half of EC3, in particular position Tyr268 of MC4R, was critical for high affinity Agouti protein binding because, when it was replaced by Ile, a loss of affinity for Agouti protein occurred. Previously, it was shown that Tyr268 was also required for the selective interaction of the agonist [d-Tyr4]MT-II with MC4R, whereas it hindered interaction with the MC3R selective agonist [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH (21Schaaper W.M. Adan R.A. Posthuma T.A. Oosterom J. Gispen W.H. Meloen R.H. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1998; 5: 1-4Google Scholar). Thus, Tyr268 is required for selective agonist and antagonist binding of the MC4R. This is a striking observation because there exists no obvious amino acid homology between melanocortins and Agouti protein (Fig. 7). To test whether Ile265 of MC3R hindered interaction with Agouti protein, Ile265 of MC3R was mutated into Tyr. MC3 (Ile265 → Tyr) did not show a gain of affinity for Agouti protein, indicating that Tyr268, in the context of the MC3R conformation, does not confer selectivity for antagonists. Surprisingly, MC3 (Ile265 → Tyr) displayed increased affinity for [d-Tyr4]MT-II and decreased affinity for [Nle4]Lys-γ2-MSH. Thus, this residue is able to change the pharmacological profile of MC3R toward that of MC4R for agonists but not for antagonists. These data imply that it may not be feasible to design MC3R-selective antagonists based upon MC3R selective agonists (such as γ-MSH) and MC4R-selective antagonists. This approach, however, may be applicable for MC4R because the structural requirements for selective agonists and antagonists interaction with MC4R is more alike. In conclusion, through pharmacological analysis of chimeric and mutant MC3R and MC4R, it was demonstrated that Tyr268 in EC3 of MC4R is critical for selective Agouti protein interaction. This study and previous data show that the mutation of MC4R Tyr268 to Ile decreases affinity for MC4R-selective ligands but increases affinity for the MC3R-selective ligands. Moreover, Tyr268in MC4R determined both agonist and antagonist selectivity. This is the first report describing details of the molecular recognition of the endogenous MCR antagonist, Agouti protein, by MC4R. This report demonstrates that the selectivity of structurally unrelated peptide ligands with opposite activities (melanocortin peptide agonist versus Agouti protein antagonist) is achieved in a similar manner, strongly suggesting that they use the same binding pocket. An understanding of the molecular basis governing selective ligand interaction with MC receptors contributes to the rational design of new selective ligands."

The crystal structure of Kvβ2 binds NADP+, and it has been suggested that Kvβ2 is an oxidoreductase enzyme (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To investigate how this function might relate to channel modulation, we made point mutations in Kvβ2 in either the NADPH docking or putative catalytic sites. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that these mutations did not disrupt the interaction of Kvβ2 with Kvα1 channels. To characterize the Kvβ2 mutants functionally, we coinjected wild-type or mutant Kvβ2 cRNAs and Kv1.4 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Kvβ2 increased both the amplitude and rate of inactivation of Kv1.4 currents. The cellular content of Kv1.4 protein was unchanged on Western blot, but the amount in the plasmalemma was increased. Mutations in either the orientation or putative catalytic sites for NADPH abolished the expression-enhancing effect on Kv1.4 current. Western blots showed that both types of mutation reduced Kv1.4 protein. Like the wild-type Kvβ2, both types of mutation increased the rate of inactivation of Kv1.4, confirming the physical association of mutant Kvβ2 subunits with Kv1.4. Thus, mutations that should interfere with NADPH function uncouple the expression-enhancing effect of Kvβ2 on Kv1.4 currents from its effect on the rate of inactivation.

Channels in the Kv1 subfamily consist of hetero-oligomeric protein complexes comprising four pore-forming α subunits in permanent association with four modulatory β subunits (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S.

Three different Kvβ subunit genes (β1, β2, and β3) have been cloned from different tissues in several species (2Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl.

Kvβ subunits coassemble with Kvα subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum and enhance biosynthesis, maturation, and surface expression of voltage-gated K+ channel complexes. Kvβ2 increases Kv1.2 (7Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol.

The N terminus of Kvβ1.x (β1.1, β1.2, and β1.3) acts as a ball peptide and rapidly inactivates open channels. This fast inactivation resembles the N-type inactivation produced by the N-terminal ball peptide of Kvα subunits. The Kvβ2 subunit while lacking the inactivation peptide accelerates the N-type inactivation of Kv1.4 and in addition increases Kv1.4 expression (8Accili E.A. Kuryshev Y.A. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 325-336Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The conserved C-terminal core region of Kvβ subunits shares a remarkable structural homology to aldo-keto reductases (10McCormack K. McCormack T. Tanouye M. Rudy B. Stuhmer W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the conserved core of Kvβ2 subunit depicts a 4-fold symmetrical TIM barrel structure with the bound cofactor NADP+ (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The structure shows that residues Ser-188 and Arg-189 are important for the orientation of the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ and that Asp-85 and Tyr-90 are the putative catalytic site residues of Kvβ2. The phenolic moiety of Tyr-90 positioned near the C-4 of nicotinamide ring would be a proton donor for reduction of a putative substrate aldehyde or ketone. The Asp-85 residue is involved in extensive hydrogen bonding and together with Tyr-90 positions the catalytic site as for other aldo-keto reductases. Despite this structural information, it is not known whether Kvβ subunits function as oxidoreductases and, if so, what their physiological substrates may be. In this study, we investigated the contribution of these residues to Kvβ2 function. We made site-directed point mutations in both the NADPH orientation and putative catalytic sites. The putative catalytic mutant (D85A, Y90F) is referred to as Kvβ2 Mut1 and the orientation mutant (S188A, R189L) is referred to as Kvβ2 Mut2. We tested the effects of these mutants on both the inactivation properties and the expression levels of Kv1.4 currents in Xenopusoocytes. We report that wild-type Kvβ2 increased Kv1.4 expression by enhancing its trafficking to the cell surface. Mutations at either site eliminated the ability of Kvβ2 to enhance Kv1.4 expression. However, mutant Kvβ2 subunits still interacted with Kv1.4 to increase the rate of inactivation. Thus, the dual effects of Kvβ2 regulation of Kv1.4 were shown to be independent by mutating residues involved in NADP+ binding. Site-directed mutations (D85A, Y90F mutant 1; S188A, R189L mutant 2) were made in Kvβ2 cDNA using the overlapping polymerase chain reaction method, from which the products were subcloned into the TOPO shuttle vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Wild-type and mutant Kvβ2 cDNAs were subcloned into the pCR3 vector (Invitrogen), which we modified to contain a poly(A)+ tail and a unique NruI site for linearizing the constructs prior to cRNA synthesis. Protein-protein interactions were monitored with the yeast Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). Kvβ2 wild-type and Kvβ2 mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector, pGBT9 (DNA binding domain vector). The N terminus of Kv1.4 (amino acids 1–305) was fused to the activation domain vector, pGAD424. Protein-protein interactions were tested in the yeast strain Y190 by cotransformation with pairs of pGBT9 and pGAD424 constructs as described previously (11Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cotransformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan (trp −) and leucine (leu −) after growth for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Representative colonies were replated on trp −/leu − medium to allow for direct comparison of individual colonies. Transcription of the reporter gene, lacZ, was tested by a β-galactosidase filter assay. cRNA was prepared using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion), and the concentrations were estimated on denaturing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide by comparison with an RNA mass ladder. Xenopus oocytes were injected with 46 nl of cRNA solution. Final concentrations of cRNA were 2 ng/μl Kv1.4 and 50 ng/μl Kvβ2 or Kvβ2 mutants. Whole cell current was measured at room temperature (20–22 °C) using the standard two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.2–0.5 megohms when immersed in bath solution containing (in mm): 50 KOH, 55 NaOH, 0.5 CaCl2·2H2O, 100 methanesulfonic acid, 2 MgCl2·6H2O, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. We used 50 mmK+ in bath solution to slow C-type inactivation and reduce its contribution to the N-type inactivation of Kv1.4. All currents were measured 6 days after injection. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz before digitization at 10 kHz. Data are reported as means ± S.E. Plasma membranes were prepared from Xenopus oocytes using a previously published procedure (12Wall D.A. Patel S. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Oocytes were homogenized (20 μl/oocyte) in buffer containing 0.25 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2·6H2O plus 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using a loose-fitting pestle. Sheets of plasma membrane were allowed to settle by gravity for 15 min and then washed and resedimented three times. Washed plasma membranes were solubilized in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 prior to determination of protein concentration. The supernatant from the initial homogenization was spun at 3,000 ×g for 10 min to remove debris, and the internal membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 60 min. Protein concentrations were estimated by the BCA method. For Western blotting, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-Kv1.4, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 1:500; or polyclonal anti-Kvβ2, QCB, 1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times (10 min/wash) with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:3000) for 1 h. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20, the blots were developed with the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total membranes were prepared from oocytes by methods previously established in our laboratory (13Wible B.A. Yang Q. Kuryshev Y.A. Accili E.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11745-11751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The oocytes were ground by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris, and the total membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 60 min. We first tested whether the mutations in the NADPH orientation and NADPH oxidoreductase catalytic sites affected interaction with Kv1.4 channels. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that neither set of mutations diminished the binding of Kvβ2 with the Kv1.4 N terminus, as evidenced by activation of the lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1). Kvβ2 has been reported to increase both the amplitude and the rate of inactivation of Kv1.4 currents. We investigated the effects of Kvβ2 mutations on Kv1.4 currents by coexpressing cRNAs encoding Kv1.4 with wild-type or mutant Kvβ2 in Xenopus oocytes. Six days after injection, we observed that Kvβ2 increased Kv1.4 current amplitude by 1.6-fold at +80 mV (compare Fig. 2,panels A and B). The current amplitude measured at +80 mV was 15.35 ± 0.78 μA (n = 9) (Fig. 2 B) in oocytes expressing a combination of Kv1.4 and Kvβ2 compared with 9.55 ± 0.88 μA (n = 7) for oocytes expressing Kv1.4 alone (Fig. 2A). The increase in current was manifest at all potentials above threshold (Fig.3 A). When Kvβ2 mutants were examined, the expression-enhancing effect of Kvβ2 on Kv1.4 was abolished. In fact, coexpression with Kvβ2 mutants produced a decrease in the amplitude of Kv1.4 current, and the decrease occurred at all potentials above threshold (Fig. 3 A). At +80 mV, mutations in the NADPH oxidoreductase catalytic site (D85A, Y90F) decreased currents by 63.3% to 4.46 ± 0.24 μA (n = 5) (Fig. 2 C), whereas mutations in the NADPH docking site (S188A, R189L) reduced currents by 36.6% to 6.05 ± 0.45 μA (n = 6) (Fig. 2 D). The double mutant in which all four residues were simultaneously disrupted also showed a reduction in current amplitude to 7.24 ± 0.36 μA (n = 6), a decrease of 24% (data not shown). The differences in mean current amplitude for Kv1.4 compared with mean current amplitude for Kv1.4 in combination with either Kvβ2 or Kvβ2 mutants (p < 0.01, one-way analysis of variance) were statistically significant.Figure 3Mutations in NADPH docking and oxidoreductase catalytic sites do not significantly alter the biophysical properties of Kv β2. A, current-voltage relationship of currents recorded from Xenopus oocytes. Whole cell currents were evoked from a holding potential of −80 mV by 125-ms depolarizing step pulses to +80 mV in 10 mV increments (current traces shown in Fig.2, A–D). B, coexpression of Kv1.4 with Kvβ2 or Kvβ2 mutants did not alter the voltage dependence of activation. I/Imaxratios were calculated by dividing the peak current at each potential with the maximal current at +80 mV and plotted as a function of potential. C, steady state inactivation levels of Kv1.4 in the presence and absence of Kvβ2 and Kvβ2 mutants were similar. Oocytes were held at −90 mV and pulsed to −10 mV in 10 mV increments for 1 s followed by a 450-ms test pulse to +70 mV and repolarization to −90 mV for 6 s (n = 4). Steady state inactivation curves were generated by normalizing the currents at each potential to the maximal currents at +70 mV. The data were fit to the Boltzman equation I/Imax = 1/[1 + exp(V0.5 −V)/k)], where V0.5is the potential for half-inactivation and k is the slope factor. D, plot of inactivation time constants versus test potential. Inactivating current traces of Kv1.4 in the presence of Kvβ2 and Kvβ2 mutants were fitted with a single exponential function. The time constants were plotted as a function of potential (n = 4). Inactivation time constants are significantly smaller when Kvβ2 or wild-type Kvβ2 mutants are coexpressed with Kv1.4, indicating enhanced inactivation; however, they are not significantly different from each other. E, plot of recovery from inactivation. From a holding potential of −90 mV, the oocyte was depolarized to +70 mV for 1 s and subsequently repolarized to −90 mV for time intervals ranging from 100 ms to 2.4 s. This was followed by a 400-ms test pulse to +70 mV (n = 4). The recovery curve is the plot of the ratio of inactivated current during the second pulse, normalized to the amount of inactivating current during the first pulse versus the inter-pulse interval. Kvβ2 slowed the recovery from inactivation compared with Kv1.4 alone, whereas the Kvβ2 mutants produced an even slower recovery from inactivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Yeast two-hybrid data indicated that the mutant Kvβ subunits were still able to interact with the Kv1.4 N terminus (Fig. 1). As a further test of association, we examined Kv1.4 currents for evidence of increased inactivation produced by association with Kvβ2 subunits. In an earlier study (8Accili E.A. Kuryshev Y.A. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 325-336Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we had shown that Kvβ2, although absent the inactivation peptide of Kvβ1.x, increased the rate of N-type inactivation of Kv1.4. Normalized current traces of Kv1.4 when coexpressed with either Kvβ2 or Kvβ2 mutants showed that wild-type and mutant Kvβ2 enhanced the intrinsic inactivation of Kv1.4 currents to a similar extent (Fig. 2 F). Plots of inactivation time constants as a function of membrane potential were also similar (Fig.3 D). At +80 mV, the mean inactivation time constants for Kv1.4, Kv1.4+ β2, Kv1.4 + β2 mut1, and Kv1.4 + β2 mut2 were 49.55 ± 2.3, 25.52 ± 0.37, 21.67 ± 0.18, and 22.32 ± 0.28, respectively. Neither wild-type nor mutant Kvβ2 subunits altered the voltage dependence of activation (Fig.3 B) or steady state inactivation (Fig. 3 C) of Kv1.4. Recovery from steady state inactivation, which was decreased when Kvβ2 was coexpressed with Kv1.4, was slowed further in the presence of the Kvβ2 mutants (Fig. 3 E). At −90mV, the mean time for half-recovery from inactivation for Kv1.4, Kv1.4 + β2, Kv1.4 + β2 mut1, and Kv1.4 + β2 mut2 were 3.35, 3.42, 4.23, and 5.82 s, respectively. To eliminate the possibility of nonspecific effects of Kvβ2 mutants on Kv1.4 in oocytes, Kvβ2 wild-type and mutants were also coexpressed with Kv2.1, a Kvα subunit with which they do not interact. Neither Kvβ2 nor the Kvβ2 mutants had any effect on Kv2.1 current amplitude or kinetics (data not shown). Our electrophysiological data showed that the expression-enhancing effect of Kvβ2 on Kv1.4 was distinct from its effects on the biophysical properties of the channel. The enhancement of Kv1.4 expression by Kvβ2 could be caused by: 1) an increase in total Kv1.4 protein, 2) an increase in the number of functional channels at the cell surface without an increase in total Kv1.4 levels, or 3) an increase in opening probability and/or single channel conductance. The third possibility was considered unlikely because the conductance-voltage relationship of Kv1.4 was unaltered by wild-type and mutant Kvβ2s (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether coexpression of Kvβ2 increased total Kv1.4 protein levels, we used Western blotting to examine membrane-enriched fractions from oocytes. Multiple bands of Kv1.4 were detected in oocytes injected with Kv1.4 cRNA: an immature or core-glycosylated ∼78-kDa band; and a mature, glycosylated, 105-kDa band, which resolved as a doublet in some experiments (Fig. 4). Coexpression with Kvβ2 did not alter the amounts of Kv1.4 protein in the total membrane fraction. However, coexpression with either of the Kvβ2 mutants did show a reduction in total Kv1.4 protein. Because Kvβ2 did not increase total Kv1.4 protein levels, we explored the possibility that Kvβ2 increased currents by enhancing trafficking of Kv1.4 channels to the plasma membrane by physically separating oocyte plasma membranes from internal membranes (i.e.endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi). Western blot analysis of Kv1.4 in these fractions showed an enhanced expression in the plasma membrane when coexpressed with Kvβ2 (Fig. 5,right). As expected, only the mature, fully glycosylated ∼105-kDa band (which was not resolved into a clear doublet in this gel) was detected in the plasma membrane. In the internal membrane fraction, we found both the immature and mature Kv1.4 bands with no apparent change in expression in the presence or absence of Kvβ2 (Fig. 5, left). Consistent with decreased currents, coexpression with Kvβ2 mutants showed a reduction of Kv1.4 in both the plasma and internal membrane fractions (Fig. 5). Both wild-type and mutant Kvβ2 subunits were detected in both the internal and plasma membrane fractions, providing further evidence for the interaction of mutant Kvβ2 subunits with Kv1.4. Although equal amounts of cRNAs were injected for each Kvβ cDNA, we consistently observed a lower level of expression of Kvβ2 mutant 1. It is not known whether this finding reflects an increased degradation of mutant protein, decreased synthesis, or a combination of both. Kvβ2 increased Kv1.4 current and its rate of inactivation (8Accili E.A. Kuryshev Y.A. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 325-336Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). From the present results it appears that the increased Kv1.4 current may be due to a redistribution of Kv1.4 protein to the plasmalemma rather than an increase in the total amount of membrane-associated Kv1.4 protein. Mutating wild-type Kvβ2 at the orientation site for NADPH (Mut2) or the putative catalytic site for aldo-keto reductase activity (Mut1) abolished the ability of Kvβ2 to increase Kv1.4 current without changing the ability of Kvβ2 to increase inactivation. The latter result, together with the persistent yeast two-hybrid interactions, showed that the mutant Kvβ2 subunits were still permanently associated with Kv1.4 subunits. However, the Kvβ2 mutants produced a reduction in both the plasmalemmal and total membrane-associated Kv1.4 protein, which probably explains the reduction in Kv1.4 currents associated with their coexpression (Fig.2 E). Our results do not show that NADPH binding by Kvβ2 has been abolished, nor do they show whether the effects of the mutations are specific for orientation of the nicotinamide ring or the putative catalytic site for aldo-keto reductase activity. Such studies are possible now that the crystal structure of Kvβ2 (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and the assembly of Kvβ1.x with the T1 domain of Kv1.x channels (14Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) have been resolved. Keeping these assumptions in mind, it may be possible that the aldo-keto reductase activity of Kvβ2 is important for the processing and trafficking of Kv1.4"

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar, 3Colonno R.J. Pang R.H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9234-9237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The study of genes activated by both type I and type II IFNs has led to the identification of two well-characterized promoter elements, namely, the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) (4Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and the IFN-γ activation sequence (GAS) (5Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Both type I and type II IFNs signal through pathways that employ STAT-1. IFN-γ promotes the activation of early response genes through a STAT-1 homodimer, GAF (IFN-γ-activated factor), which binds to GAS elements (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar, 6Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). IFN-α stimulation leads to the formation of a STAT-1 homodimer (AAF; IFN-α-activated factor) and heterodimer composed of STAT-1 and STAT-2. This STAT-1:STAT-2 dimer interacts with a “non-STAT” protein (for example, p48) to form an active transcription factor ISGF3 (7Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The AAF and ISGF3 complexes translocate to the nucleus and bind to GAS elements and ISRE elements, respectively. Differential screening of a cDNA library from IFN-γ-activated macrophages led to the identification of the murine CXC chemokine gene Mig (8Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Chemokines constitute a family of small cytokines that are produced during the process of inflammatory and immune reactions. They regulate efficient and orchestrated recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation (9Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 10Schall T.J. Bacon K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 11Mahalingam S. Karupiah G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mig is chemotactic for natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. Studies using macrophage cell lines and monocytes showed that both murine and human Mig were inducible only by recombinant IFN-γ in these cells (8Farber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5238-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 12Farber J.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1993; 192: 223-230Google Scholar). A fragment from the 5′-flanking region of −235 to −167 of theMig gene was able to mediate dramatic induction of a heterologous promoter by recombinant IFN-γ and this element termed γRE-1 has similarities to the IFN-γ activation sequence (GAS) (13Guyer N.B. Severns C.W. Wong P. Feghali C.A. Wright T.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3472-3480PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of NF-κB sites in theMig gene was shown to be important for gene transcription involving a synergistic interaction between IFN-γ and TNF (14Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that IFN-γ is necessary for induction of Mig in multiple organs of mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii,Plasmodium yeolli, or vaccinia virus (VV) (15Amichay D. Gazzinelli R.T. Karupiah G. Moench T.R. Sher A. Farber J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4511-4520PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that Mig mRNA is induced in multiple organs, albeit at low levels, in IFN-γ−/−mice after infection with VV. Treatment of VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice with an antibody to IFN-α/β completely abolished Mig induction in the liver, indicating that expression of the chemokine in VV-infected IFN-γ−/−mice is most likely mediated by IFN-α/β. This is further supported by our findings that Mig mRNA transcripts are absent in VV-infected mice lacking functional receptors for both type I and type II IFNs. Our data indicate that Mig mRNA induction in livers of VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice is most probably mediated via a STAT-1 complex (γRF-2) binding to a STAT binding element (γRE-1) in the Mig promoter. The transcription factor (γRF-2) appears to be a STAT-1 homodimer complex. Six- to eight-week-old specific pathogen-free C57BL/6J (B6) wild type (WT) mice and IFN-γ gene knockout (IFN-γ−/−) mice (16Dalton D.K. Pitts-Meek S. Keshav S. Figari I.S. Bradley A. Stewart T.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1739-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) on the B6 background were obtained from the Animal Breeding Establishment, John Curtin School of Medical Research (ABE, JCSMR), Canberra, Australia. Mice lacking functional type I (α/β) receptors (IFN-α/βR−/−), type II (γ) receptors (IFN-γR−/−), or both type I and type II IFN receptors (DR−/−) (17van den Broek M.F. Muller U. Huang S. Aguet M. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4792-4796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the 129/SvJ background also bred at the ABE, JCSMR, were used at 6–12 weeks of age. WT 129/SvJ mice were used as controls. The virulent vaccinia virus, Western-Reserve strain (VV-WR ATCC VR-119), was propagated in CV-1 cells and used after purification on a sucrose density gradient as described elsewhere (18Esposito J.J. Obejeski J.F. Nakano J.H. Virology. 1985; 89: 53-66Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mice were injected intraperitoneal on day 0 with 106plaque-forming units (PFU) of the virus. Purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to murine IFN-α/β was purchased from Lee Biomolecular Research Laboratories, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Groups of IFN-γ−/− mice were given (0.2 mg) 300 neutralizing units of anti-IFN-α/β on days −1, 1, and 2. One neutralizing unit of anti-IFN-α/β is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of antibody, which completely neutralizes 10 units of the IFN activityin vitro (19Karupiah G. Fredrickson T.N. Holmes K.L. Khairallah L.H. Buller M.L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4214-4226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were infected intraperitoneally with 106 PFU of VV-WR on day 0 and sacrificed on day 3. Mice similarly treated with 0.2 mg of rabbit IgG (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were used as controls. RNase-free plastic and water were used throughout the assay. Tissues (approximately 50 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of RNAzol B (Biotecx, Friendswood, TX), and total RNA was isolated as recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water containing 1 mm EDTA and quantitated spectrophotometrically. All samples were DNase-treated to remove genomic DNA. RNA gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm that RNA was intact and that the concentration had been determined correctly as described previously (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR procedure was performed as described previously (21Svetic A. Finkelman F.D. Jian Y.C. Dieffenbach C.W. Scott D.E. McCarthy K.F. Steinberg A.D. Gause W.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2391-2397PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification (22Oswald I.P. Wynn T.A. Sher A. James S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8676-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) to determine relative quantities of mRNA for Mig, IFN-γ, IFN-α1, IFN-β, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The primers and probes for all genes were prepared by the Biomolecular Resource Facility, JCSMR, on a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer and probe sequences for Mig, IFN-γ, IFN-α1, IFN-β, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase have been described previously (21Svetic A. Finkelman F.D. Jian Y.C. Dieffenbach C.W. Scott D.E. McCarthy K.F. Steinberg A.D. Gause W.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2391-2397PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wynn T.A. Eltoum I. Cheever A.W. Lewis F.A. Gause W.C. Sher A. J.

The cycle numbers used for amplification of each gene product are as follows: Mig, 24 cycles; IFN-γ, 25 cycles; IFN-α1 and IFN-β, 27 cycles; and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, 23 cycles. After the appropriate number of PCR cycles, the amplified DNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting, and detected using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Liver tissues were obtained from groups of WT B6, IFN-γ−/−, and DR−/−mice 3 days after infection with VV-WR. Liver tissues were also obtained from virus-infected IFN-γ−/− mice treated with antibody against IFN-α/β. To prepare cell suspension, the liver was teased apart and passed through a metal sieve into approximately 20 ml of ice-cold suspension buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was aspirated, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in ice-cold suspension buffer. Red blood cells were removed from the suspension using red blood cell lysis buffer, pH 7.3 (10 mm potassium bicarbonate, 0.15 mammonium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% fetal calf serum). The suspension was then spun at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed twice with ice-cold suspension buffer. Nuclear and cytosol extracts were then prepared from the cell suspension according to the method of Dignamet al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). Tris-glycine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of protein samples from cytosolic extracts was performed with 12% acrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). As a positive control, concentrated supernatants from CV-1 cells (monkey kidney cell line) infected with recombinant VV (rVV) expressing Mig was analyzed in parallel with liver cytosolic extracts. Construction of rVV encoding Mig has been described in detail elsewhere (24Mahalingam S. Farber J.M. Karupiah G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1479-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27Liao F. Rabin R.L. Yannelli J.R. Koniaris L.G. Vanguri P. Farber J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Anti-Mig serum, JH48, was kindly provided by Dr. Joshua Farber, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). This was performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides radiolabeled by fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as described previously (28Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides used were the γRE-1 sequence (−200 to −167) and NF-κB sequence (−145 to −154) of the Mig promoter (28Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Wright T.M. Farber J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the GAS sequence (−126 to −101) of the guanylate-binding protein promoter (5Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The ISRE sequence (−224 to −211) of the murine Crg-2 gene was used as a nonspecific competitor (30Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6677-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) using the protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Binding reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein), 2 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5 × 105 cpm) was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing γRE-1 element, GAS element, or ISRE element (competitors) were added to the binding reaction simultaneously during addition of radiolabeled fragment. In some experiments, antibody against STAT-1α (specific for p91; obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was included in the reaction mixture. Following incubation, 5 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue in binding buffer was then added and the mixture was immediately loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.25× TBE buffer (TBE buffer is 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) at 175 V with buffer recirculation. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Organs were harvested at days 3, 6, and 10 after infection of B6 WT mice with 106 PFU of VV-WR. Organs from uninfected mice were used as controls. Ovaries were pooled from groups of four mice for each time point, whereas other organs were analyzed individually. Fig. 1 A shows that Mig mRNA is expressed at high levels in all organs examined during the course of infection but was not detected in organs of uninfected mice. The time course of infection indicates thatMig mRNA is expressed at high levels in all organs on days 3 and 6, but declines by day 10. Levels of expression were highest in the liver followed by ovaries, uterus, and spleen. Expression of IFN-γ was highest in the ovaries followed by uterus, spleen, and liver. Thus, although a strong correlation between the kinetics and expression of Mig induction and that of IFN-γ was observed in the spleen, ovaries, and uterus, this was not the case in the liver where we observed high levels of Mig and comparatively low levels of IFN-γ mRNA. It is possible that Mig in the liver is up-regulated by the elevated serum IFN-γ levels following infection with VV (data not shown). It is also possible that some other factor(s) are responsible for Mig induction in the liver. To establish the role of IFN-γ in Mig induction during VV infection, we used IFN-γ−/− mice on the B6 background. Organs were harvested at days 3, 6, and 10 after virus infection while organs from uninfected mice were used as controls. Fig.1 B shows that Mig mRNA was not detected in uninfected IFN-γ−/− mice. Unexpectedly, however, low levels of Mig mRNA transcripts were detected in all organs at days 3 and 6 post-infection and expression was most prominent in the liver. We next investigated the expression of Mig during the course of VV infection in IFN-γR−/− mice (126/SvJ background). Fig. 2 A shows that Mig mRNA was expressed in the livers of VV-infected IFN-γR−/− mice and that the levels of expression are comparable with those in IFN-γ−/− mice (B6 background). This also indicates that, at least for the two strains of mice studied (B6 and 129), the genetic background of the animals did not influence Mig expression in the absence of IFN-γ function. It was also important to determine whether the expression ofMig mRNA was associated with the presence of Mig protein. We performed Western blot analysis on cytosolic extracts from livers pooled from groups of four B6 WT mice and four IFN-γ−/− mice 3 days after infection with VV. Clearly, Mig protein was detected in cytosolic extracts of IFN-γ−/− mice, but the level was significantly lower compared with that of B6 WT mice (Fig. 2 B). Culture supernatant from CV-1 cells infected with rVV expressing Mig was used as a positive control. These data show that Mig protein is expressed consonant with mRNA levels. In the preceding section we have shown thatMig mRNA and protein are present in VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice and that the expression of this chemokine was most prominent in the liver. Likely candidate(s) responsible for the induction of Mig in IFN-γ−/− mice are the type I IFNs. A time course study revealed that the expression ofMig mRNA also paralleled that of IFN-α1 and IFN-β in livers of VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice (Fig.3 A). It was therefore of interest to determine whether the expression of Mig in IFN-γ−/− mice was mediated through the activity of IFNα/β. We used a polyclonal antibody to IFNα/β to inhibit its function in vivo. As expected, Mig mRNA expression in VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice treated with an antibody to IFN-α/β was completely abolished (Fig. 3 B). However, in VV-infected IFN-α/βR−/− mice, where IFN-γ function is intact but IFN-α/β function is compromised,Mig mRNA expression was similar to that of WT mice (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the view that IFN-γ alone is a potent inducer of Mig gene transcription (13Guyer N.B. Severns C.W. Wong P. Feghali C.A. Wright T.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3472-3480PubMed Google Scholar), however, in the absence of IFN-γ, IFN-α/β can induce Mig expression. Next, we utilized mice deficient in receptors for both IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (DR−/−). Because the DR−/− mice are on a 129/SvJ background, the 129/SvJ wild-type mice were used as controls in these experiments. Livers were harvested 3 days after infection with VV and analyzed for Mig expression. Fig. 3 Cshows a complete absence of Mig mRNA transcripts in these mice, whereas in the control, 129/SvJ WT mice, the expression was similar to that observed in B6 WT animals (Fig. 1 A). These results, and those from the preceding sections, confirm that IFN-γ is important for the optimal induction of Mig expression in vivo. Interestingly, however, they also indicate that IFNs α/β are able to induce Mig mRNA, albeit at a low level, in VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice. Recent reports have shown that the IFN-γ-induced transcription factor, γRF-1, is involved in IFN-γ-mediated transcriptional regulation through γRE-1, a major regulatory element in the Mig promoter (13Guyer N.B. Severns C.W. Wong P. Feghali C.A. Wright T.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3472-3480PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wong P. Severns C.W. Guyer N.B. Wright T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We have found that nuclear extracts from the livers of virus-infected B6 WT mice abundantly express γRF-1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). This is consistent with the high levels of Mig mRNA found in this group (Fig. 1 A). γRF-1 was not detected in nuclear extracts from livers of uninfected B6 WT mice (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Time course studies revealed that the induction of γRF-1 in the liver of virus-infected B6 WT mice paralleled the expression of Mig mRNA (Fig.4 B). Given this association of γRF-1 and Mig expression in B6 WT mice, we were interested in determining whether the expression of Mig in VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice was also related to γRF-1 complex formation. However, γRF-1 was not detected in nuclear extracts of VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice (Fig.4 A, lane 3), in mice lacking functional IFN receptors (DR−/−) (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), or in IFN-γ−/− mice treated with antibody to IFN-α/β (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). This may explain, at least in part, the reduced levels or complete absence ofMig mRNA expression in these groups of mice. Besides γRF-1, an additional γRE-1 binding protein was also detected by EMSA and is referred to here as γRF-2. The γRF-2 complex demonstrated higher mobility than γRF-1 and was detected in both B6 WT and IFN-γ−/− mice, but the levels were clearly higher in the latter (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2and 3, respectively). This complex was not detected in the DR−/− mice and in IFN-γ−/− mice treated with antibody to IFN-α/β (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4and 5). In addition, the time course studies show a similar pattern of expression of Mig mRNA and γRF-2 in the livers of VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice (Fig.4 C). These findings are consistent with a role for γRF-2 in the induction of Mig expression in IFN-γ−/− mice infected with VV. The preceding sections strongly suggested that IFN-α/β is responsible for the low level Mig expression in VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice. It is possible that the transcription factor γRF-2, most probably induced by IFN-α/β, could have mediated this effect, because γRF-1 is not detected in these animals (Fig. 4 A). IFN-α can directly induce some of the genes activated by IFN-γ through STAT-1 complexes such as AAF or ISGF3 (33Decker T. Lew D.J. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A comparison of the γRE-1 element, which binds to γRF-1, with the GAS element, which binds to STAT-1 complexes GAF·AAF, showed partial homology (7 of 15 base matches). It was therefore possible that AAF may also contribute to the transcriptional activation of Mig mRNA in the IFN-γ−/− mice. Indeed, we have detected AAF in VV-infected B6 WT (Fig. 4 A, lane 8) and IFN-γ−/− mice (Fig. 4 A, lane 7) but not in the VV-infected DR−/− mice or IFN-γ−/− mice treated with antibody to IFN-α/β (Fig. 4 A, lanes 9 and 10). In addition, STAT-1 complexes, detected by Western blot analysis, were not present in extracts obtained from VV-infected DR−/− mice or from VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice treated with anti-IFN-α/β (data not shown). Our results suggest that, although γRF-1 is required for optimal induction ofMig mRNA in B6 WT mice, γRF-2 is responsible for the low level Mig expression in VV-infected IFN-γ−/− mice. Guyer and colleagues (13Guyer N.B. Severns C.W. Wong P. Feghali C.A. Wright T.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3472-3480PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that the γRF-1 complex consists of three proteins, one of which is related antigenically to STAT-1α. It is possible that γRF-2 also contains a STAT-1 subunit, which binds to the γRE-1 element of the Mig promoter. In gel shift analysis, the addition of anti-STAT-1α antibody resulted in reduced mobility (super-shift) of γRF-2 and AAF, suggesting that these complexes are antigenically related to STAT-1α (Fig.5). Because both AAF and γRF-2 exhibited identical mobility and are reactive to STAT-1 antibody, it is possible that γRF-2 is in fact AAF. Supporting this possibility is the recent finding of Ohmori et al. that the γRF-2 complex, which appears to be a STAT-1 homodimer, binds to the 3′-half-site of the γRE-1 motif (Ref. 42Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29202-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and T. Hamilton, personal communication). In addition, our UV cross-linking studies on γRF-2 and AAF show two identical bands corresponding to molecular mass of 95 kDa (data not shown), consistent with the idea that γRF-2 complex may indeed be a STAT-1 homodimer. Although our data show that AAF and γRF-2 are identical (STAT-1 homodimers), we have used the term AAF in gel shift assays where the DNA binding element is labeled GAS element. On the other hand, the term γRF-2 is used in assays where the DNA binding element is γRE-1. We next examined the binding affinity of γRF-2, induced in IFN-γ−/− mice, to γRE-1 and GAS elements. A competition assay was prepared in which increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing one of the elements GAS (GBP gene), γRE-1 (Mig gene), or ISRE (Crg-2 gene) were added to assays in which the complex was formed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing either the γRE-1 or GAS sites. When GAS sites were used as probes, increasing amounts of the competitor (unlabeled GAS fragment) in binding reactions resulted in diminished levels of AAF-labeled GAS complex formation (Fig.6 A). A reduction in AAF·GAS complex formation was observed when the unlabeled γRE-1 fragment was increased by 10-fold or more molar excess. The intensity of the complex formation was quantified with a densitometer and plotted against inhibitor concentration (data not shown). It was estimated that the apparent dissociation constant (the concentration of competitor DNA required to reduce AAF·GAS complex formation by 50%) for GAS was 0.4 nm and γRE-1 was 1.5 nm. On the other hand, when the radiolabeled γRE-1 element was used as a probe and competed with a 1-fold molar excess of unlabeled GAS element, there was approximately a 50-fold reduction in γRF-2·γRE-1 complex formation as analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, 1-fold molar excess of unlabeled γRE-1 resulted in a 20-fold reduction in γRF-2·γRE-1 complex formation (Fig.6 B). In competition experiments involving nuclear extracts from B6 WT mice probed with labeled γRE-1, a 1-fold molar excess of unlabeled GAS element resulted in loss of γRF-2·γRE-1 complex formation (Fig.6 C). Furthermore, a reduction in γRF-1·γRE-1 complex formation was observed when unlabeled GAS element was increased by 20-fold molar excess. When a 1-fold molar excess of unlabeled γRE-1 was used, γRF-2·γRE-1 complex formation was reduced markedly (Fig. 6C). These results demonstrate that the γRF-2 complex displays a higher binding affinity for GAS element than for γRE-1 element. The presence of NF-κB sites in the Mig gene was previously shown to be important for transcription of MigmRNA involving a synergistic interaction between IFN-γ and TNF (14Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907A"
https://openalex.org/W1978020607,"Destruction of pancreatic islet β-cells in type 1 diabetes appears to result from direct contact with infiltrating T-cells and macrophages and exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor TNF-α that such cells produce. We recently reported on a method for selection of insulinoma cells that are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of inflammatory cytokines (INS-1res), involving their growth in progressively increasing concentrations of IL-1β plus IFN-γ, and selection of surviving cells. In the current study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of cytokine resistance in INS-1rescells. By focusing on the known components of the IFN-γ receptor signaling pathway, we have discovered that expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1α are closely correlated with the cytokine-resistant and -sensitive phenotypes. That STAT-1α is directly involved in development of cytokine resistance is demonstrated by an increase of viability from 10 ± 2% in control cells to 50 ± 6% in cells with adenovirus-mediated overexpression of STAT-1α (p < 0.001) after culture of both cell groups in the presence of 100 units/ml IFN-γ plus 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 48 h. The resistance to IL-1β plus IFN-γ in STAT-1α-expressing cells is due in part to interference with IL-1β-mediated stimulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide production. Furthermore, overexpression of STAT-1α does not impair robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the INS-1-derived cell line 832/13. We conclude that expression of STAT-1α may be a means of protecting insulin-producing cell lines from cytokine damage, which, in conjunction with appropriate cell-impermeant macroencapsulation devices, may allow such cells to be used for insulin replacement in type 1 diabetes. Destruction of pancreatic islet β-cells in type 1 diabetes appears to result from direct contact with infiltrating T-cells and macrophages and exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor TNF-α that such cells produce. We recently reported on a method for selection of insulinoma cells that are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of inflammatory cytokines (INS-1res), involving their growth in progressively increasing concentrations of IL-1β plus IFN-γ, and selection of surviving cells. In the current study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of cytokine resistance in INS-1rescells.

Destruction of β-cells appears to result from direct contact with infiltrating T-cells and macrophages and exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ,1 IL-1β, and TNF-α that such cells produce (1Berke G.

Insulin replacement by injection, the current treatment, fails to replicate the precise control of fuel homeostasis afforded by normal regulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose and other physiological cues. Islet transplantation has therefore been investigated as an alternative to insulin injection therapy for more than 3 decades (6Sutherland D.E.R. Gores P.F. Hering B.J. Wahoff D. McKeehen D.A.

University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany1999: 1-20Google Scholar). Success in this area had been very limited until a recent trial in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in which a combination of mild immunosuppressive agents were used in conjunction with freshly isolated islet tissue to achieve insulin independence in seven successive patients studied for up to 14.9 months post-transplant (8Shapiro A.M.J. Lakey J.R.T. Ryan E.A. Korbutt G.S. Toth E. Warnock G.L. Kneteman N.M. Rajotte R.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4429) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, enthusiasm for this important finding is tempered by the fact that the number of human pancreata available for islet transplantation in the United States is on the order of several thousand per year (6Sutherland D.E.R.

International Islet Transplant Registry Report. University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany1999: 1-20Google Scholar), which does not approach the number of patients that could benefit from this new form of therapy. To deal with this problem, we and others have been attempting to develop a replenishable source of cells that could serve as islet surrogates for cell-based insulin replacement in diabetes (9Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Newgard C.B. Clark S. BeltrandelRio H. Hohmeier H.E. Quaade C. Normington K.

One working concept is that immortalized cell lines engineered for robust glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can be transplanted in the context of a cell-impermeant macroencapsulation device, preventing contact of cellular elements of the immune system with the transplanted cells (11Newgard C.B. Clark S. Thigpen A. Hohmeier H.E. Quaade C. Tran V.V. Normington K. Can. J. Diabetes Care. 1999; 23: 52-58Google Scholar). However, because such devices are envisioned to allow rapid exit of insulin, as well as highly efficient equilibration of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products, it is anticipated that soluble mediators of immunological damage such as cytokines or reactive oxygen species will readily gain access to the cells within the device. Thus, development of methods to protect transplanted cells against diffusable, noncellular mediators of immunological destruction may be important for the eventual success of cell-based insulin replacement strategies. Recently, we described a method for selection of cell lines with resistance to the cytotoxic effects of exposure to a mixture of IL-1β and IFN-γ, known mediators of β-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This involved growth of INS-1 insulinoma cells in progressively elevated concentrations of the two cytokines over an 8-week period and selection of surviving cells. The resultant cell line, termed INS-1res, was 80% viable after 5 days of exposure to the combination of 10 ng/ml IL-1β and 100 units/ml IFN-γ, while less than 1% of parental INS-1 cells survived when treated in the same fashion. Interestingly, resistance to IL-1β alone persisted for up to 6 months after removal of cytokines, while resistance to IFN-γ or IL-1β plus IFN-γ was partially lost upon removal of cytokines and restored upon their return to the culture medium (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to define the factor or factors responsible for resistance to IFN-γ or IFN-γ plus IL-1β in selected insulinoma cell lines. By focusing on the known components of the IFN-γ receptor (IFN-R) signaling pathway, we have discovered that expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1α are closely correlated with the cytokine-resistant and -sensitive phenotypes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of STAT-1α in cytokine-sensitive INS-1 cell lines confers resistance to the combination of IL-1β plus IFN-γ. Our findings suggest that expression of STAT-1α in insulin-secreting cell lines may be a means for enhancing their survival in a transplant setting. The insulinoma cell line INS-1 (15Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and clonal derivatives thereof (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 230-424Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Recombinant rat IL-1β was obtained from Endogen (Cambridge, MA). Recombinant rat γ-IFN was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-STAT-1 and anti-phospho-STAT-1 antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc (Beverly, MA), and anti-iNOS antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Cytokine-resistant 833/117 cells (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were kept in medium containing IL-1β plus IFN-γ for 24 weeks prior to RNA isolation using TRIzol (Life Technologies). cDNA was reverse-transcribed by the Advantage reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction kit (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Primers were derived from the published mouse STAT-1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number U06924) and included BamHI restriction enzyme recognition sequences: 5′-GGATCCAGGATGTCACAGTGGTTCG (sense), encompassing nucleotides −4 to 16, and 5′-GGATCCTCGCCAGAGAGAAATTCGTG (antisense), encompassing nucleotides 2256–2275. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pCRII from the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The amplified and subcloned rat STAT-1α cDNA was sequenced with a DNA Sequencer 377 (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the sequence was submitted to GenBankTM (accession numberAF205604). A 2.2-kilobase BamHI fragment of the STAT-1α cDNA containing the protein coding sequence was cloned into the adenovirus vector pACCMV.pLpA (17Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a recombinant virus (AdCMV-STAT-1α) was prepared by previously described methods (18Becker T. Noel R. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Control experiments were conducted with a recombinant virus containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-βGAL), prepared and used as described previously (19Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 20Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were inoculated at 50,000 cells/well into 48-well tissue culture plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY). After 24 h, cells were treated with 1.0 × 109 plaque-forming units (pfu) of AdCMV-STAT-1α or AdCMV-β-galactosidase recombinant viruses. After 12 h of viral treatment, culture medium was changed, and cells were incubated in the absence of virus for an additional 24 h prior to the addition of cytokines. After 48 h of cytokine treatment, media samples were collected for nitrite assay and replaced with 250 μl/well of medium with 75 μg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) for 1.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The resulting formazan crystals were solubilized in 250 μl of 0.04n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. The optical density of the solubilized formazan was read at 575 and 650 nm using a SpectraMax 340 (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader. The reduction in optical density caused by cytokine treatment was used as a measurement of cell viability, normalized to cells incubated in control medium, which were considered 100% viable. NO production was estimated by measurement of nitrite levels, as described previously (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Hohmeier H.E. Thigpen A. Tran V.V. Davis R. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and data were normalized to protein content per well, measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Cells were cultured in 24-well plates. Assays were initiated by removal of culture medium, washing of cells with 1 ml of PBS (Life Technologies) and incubation in 1 ml of secretion assay buffer containing 3 mm glucose for 1 h, followed by incubation in secretion assay buffer containing 3 or 15 mm glucose for 2 h at 37 °C. Secretion assay buffer contains 114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mmMgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, and 0.25% fatty acid-free bovine albumin (Sigma), pH 7.4. After centrifugation of media samples at 3000 rpm for 6 min to remove floating cells, the supernatants were subjected to insulin radioimmunoassay (DPC Coat-A-Count). The cells remaining in the wells were then washed once with PBS and lysed with 60 μl of PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for measurement of total protein (Bio-Rad). Cultured cells were washed once with PBS and lysed with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmsodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.2. Lysates were vortexed, kept on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. Supernatant fractions were collected, and protein concentrations were determined. Samples containing 25 or 50 μg of protein were suspended in 5× sample buffer (300 mm Tris, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8), heated for 5 min in boiling water, and electrophoresed using 10% precast Tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Blots were incubated with anti-STAT-1, anti-phospho-STAT-1, or anti-iNOS antibodies according to protocols supplied by the manufacturers. Protein bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblots were scanned with a UMAX UC840 scanner, and band intensities were measured by NIH Image 1.59. Total RNA was isolated by extraction with the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of total RNA was resolved on a 1.5% formaldehyde/agarose gel, and samples were transferred to nylon membrane and hybridized in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Life Sciences) with 32P-labeled STAT-1α cDNA probe, prepared with the Redi-priming labeling kit (Amersham Life Sciences). After hybridization and washing, nylon membranes were exposed to film to create autoradiographs. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test, assuming unequal variances. We have previously isolated cytokine-resistant insulinoma cell lines (INS-1res) by culture of the cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-1β plus IFN-γ for a period of 8 weeks (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). INS-1res cells exhibited impaired translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor in response to IL-1β, which may explain their attendant block of NO production and iNOS expression. However, iNOS expression and NO production did not account for resistance to IFN-γ or IFN-γ plus IL-1β, as evidenced by the fact that NG -monomethyl-l-arginine, an iNOS inhibitor, only partially blocked killing of INS-1 cells induced by IL-1β plus IFN-γ (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To gain understanding of the mechanism by which the selection process confers resistance to IFN-γ or IFN-γ plus IL-1β, we have analyzed known components of the IFN-γ signal transduction system in cytokine-resistant and -sensitive cell lines. The IFN-γ receptor transduces signals via its associated Jak kinase activity, which in turn binds to and phosphorylates STAT-1 transcription factors (22Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 23Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). We therefore treated clonal cell lines derived from INS-1res cells (lines 833/15 and 833/117) or parental INS-1 cells (line 834/40) acutely with IFN-γ or IL-1β + IFN-γ for a period of 20 min and then assayed phosphorylation and expression of STAT-1α by immunoblot analysis. Stimulation of STAT-1α phosphorylation in response to acute cytokine treatment was similar in all groups of cells, as shown in a representative experiment in Fig. 1. However, there was a clear correlation between susceptibility to cytokine damage and STAT-1α protein levels. Thus, 833/15 and 833/117 cells that are grown in the continual presence of cytokines are IFN-γ- and IFN-γ plus IL-1β-resistant (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and contain 6.9 and 7.0 times as much STAT-1α protein, respectively, as the same cell lines that had been grown in the absence of cytokines for 4 weeks or more (rendering them sensitive to IFN-γ- and IL-1 plus IFN-γ-mediated killing). Essentially identical results were obtained in a second independent experiment (data not shown). STAT-1α levels were also low in 834/40 cells, which had not been through the selection procedure and are thus highly susceptible to cytokine damage. These data suggest that STAT-1α expression may directly contribute to cytokine resistance induced by the selection protocol. To learn more about the regulation of STAT-1α expression by cytokines in the culture medium, we measured STAT-1α protein levels as a function of time after cytokine withdrawal. As shown in Fig. 2, culture of the INS-1res-derived cell lines 833/15 and 833/117 in the continual presence of cytokines resulted in very high STAT-1α protein levels. 2 days after cytokine removal, STAT-1α expression was unchanged in 833/15 cells and only mildly decreased in 833/117 cells. However, by 6 days after cytokine removal, STAT-1α protein levels were decreased by 48 and 67% in the two lines, respectively, relative to starting levels. The time course and magnitude of the decrease in STAT-1α expression was confirmed in a second independent experiment identical in design to the representative experiment shown in Fig. 2 (data not shown). Thus, constant IFN-γ treatment is required to maintain the high STAT-1α protein levels associated with cytokine resistance in INS-1res cells. We initially assumed that STAT-1α protein levels were being regulated mainly by IFN-γ in the tissue culture medium, as has been reported in other systems (25Fu X-Y. Schindler C. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7840-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 26Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 259: 1808-1812Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3, treatment with IFN-γ alone stimulates STAT-1α expression to a similar degree in cytokine-resistant and sensitive clones. However, the coaddition of IL-1β and IFN-γ to a cytokine-sensitive cell line (line 834/40) for 12 or 24 h resulted in accumulation of only 8.1 and 20% as much STAT-1α protein as observed with IFN-γ alone, while in cytokine-resistant cells (line 833/117), no inhibitory effect of costimulation with IL-1β was observed. This result was confirmed in three other independent experiments, similar in design to the representative experiment shown in Fig. 3. Thus, in unselected cells, IL-1β inhibits and delays IFN-γ-induced expression of STAT-1α. In contrast, selected cells lose IL-1β-mediated suppression of IFN-γ-mediated up-regulation of STAT-1α expression. The implication is that cytokine resistance in selected INS-1 cells may be a sequential process, in which development of IL-1β resistance alleviates inhibition of IFN-γ-mediated up-regulation of STAT-1α, allowing STAT-1α to accumulate to levels that protect against the cytotoxic effects of IFN-γ alone or the combination of IFN-γ plus IL-1β. The differential effects of IL-1β on cytokine-sensitive and -resistant cell lines were also apparent at the level of STAT-1α mRNA. In both a sensitive (834/40) and resistant (833/117) clone, IFN-γ administration caused an increase in STAT-1α mRNA within 4 h of treatment. However, STAT-1α mRNA levels were much lower in 834/40 cells than in 833/117 cells 24 h after treatment with the combination of IL-1β plus IFN-γ, and IL-1β clearly attenuated the IFN-γ-mediated increase in mRNA levels in the former but not the latter cells (data not shown). To investigate whether STAT-1α expression in cytokine-sensitive INS-1 cell lines can confer protection against cytokine damage, it was first necessary to clone the rat STAT-1α cDNA. This was achieved by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-mediated preparation of cDNA from the INS-1 cell line 833/117 after treatment with IFN-γ for 48 h to induce STAT-1α expression. The sequence of the rat STAT-1α cDNA was determined and deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF205604), and a fragment containing the entire protein coding region was used to prepare a recombinant adenovirus (AdCMV-STAT-1α). Treatment of INS-1 cells with a range of AdCMV-STAT-1α titers from 2.5 × 108 to 1 × 109 pfu/ml resulted in titer-dependent increases in STAT-1α protein overexpression, as evaluated by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4 A). Based on these results, the cytokine-sensitive cell line 834/40 was treated with 1 × 109 pfu/ml of AdCMV-STAT-1α or, as a control, the same amount of AdCMV-βGAL virus. These cell groups, as well as a group of cells not treated with adenovirus, were cultured in normal medium for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β, 100 units/ml IFN-γ or the combination of IL-1β plus IFN-γ. After 48 h of cytokine treatment, viability was measured by the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 4 B, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of STAT-1α in 834/40 cells increased the viabilities of the IL-1β-, IFN-γ-, and IL-1β plus IFN-γ-treated groups from 41.7 ± 2.0, 56.5 ± 3.2, and 19.0 ± 0.9%, respectively (control group with no viral treatment), or 60.9 ± 7.8, 44.0 ± 4.9, and 10.1 ± 2.4% (control group treated with AdCMV-βGAL) to 81.1 ± 3.8, 72.9 ± 7.9, and 50.1 ± 5.6% (AdCMV-STAT-1α-treated group), respectively. These data show that STAT-1α overexpression is sufficient to provide substantial, albeit incomplete, protection of insulinoma cells from cytokine-induced cytotoxicity. Our results also suggest that the induction of STAT-1α observed in response to IFN-γ treatment of insulinoma cells represents a defense mechanism for protection against cytokine attack. Finally, the data support the notion that the synergistic effects of IL-1β plus IFN-γ in promoting islet β-cell destruction may be related to the capacity of IL-1β to interfere with the normal IFN-γ-mediated induction of STAT-1α expression in cytokine-sensitive cells. IL-1β is known to stimulate NO production in islet β-cells via induction of iNOS, and NO production has been implicated in IL-1β-mediated β-cell destruction (2Mandrup-Poulsen T.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that the iNOS inhibitor,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine can block cytotoxicity mediated by IL-1β and that INS-1rescells do not produce NO in response to acute treatment with IFN-γ, IL-1β, or IL-1β plus IFN-γ (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Hohmeier H.E. Thigpen A. Tran V.V. Davis R. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test whether STAT-1α overexpression affects NO production and iNOS expression in cytokine-sensitive 834/40 cells, cells were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 5 with AdCMV-STAT-1α, AdCMV-βGAL, or no virus and were then exposed to 10 ng/ml IL-1β, 100 units/ml IFN-γ, or the combination of IL-1β + IFN-γ for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 5, after 48 h of treatment with IL-1β or Il-1β plus IFN-γ, nitrite production (a measure of NO accumulation) was significantly reduced in STAT-1α-overexpressing 834/40 cells compared with either control group. The impairment in NO production in STAT-1α-expressing cells was already apparent within 9 h of cytokine addition, proving that expression of the transcription factor effectively blocks the acute response to cytokine treatment (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, AdCMV-STAT-1α-treated cells exhibited a 70% reduction in IL-1β-induced accumulation of iNOS protein relative to untreated or AdCMV-βGAL-treated control cells and a 50% reduction following treatment with IL-1β plus IFN-γ, based on densitometric scanning of the two representative immunoblots shown in Fig.6. Taken together, these data suggest that protection against cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity in STAT-1α-overexpressing cells is in part attributable to reduced NO production and iNOS expression. It is interesting to note that the impairment of cytokine-induced NO production in STAT-1α overexpressing cells is partial, in contrast to our findings in cells taken through the cytokine selection process, in which NO production was completely blocked (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results imply that factors other than STAT-1α expression, possibly including impairment of IL-1β-induced NF-κB translocation (14Chen G. Hohmeier H.E. Gasa R. Tran V.V. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), contribute to the more complete blockade of NO production noted in the INS-1rescell lines.Figure 6Adenovirus-mediated expression of STAT-1α in a cytokine-sensitive INS-1-derived cell line partially blocks cytokine-induced iNOS expression.

Upon light stimulation of photoreceptors, PDE6 is activated by GTP-bound transducin-α, which displaces Pγ from the enzyme catalytic core. Two regions of Pγ are principally involved in the interaction with the PDE6 catalytic subunits, the central polycationic region (residues 24–45 of rod Pγ) and the Pγ C terminus. The C terminus of Pγ constitutes the key inhibitory domain, whereas the polycationic region enhances the overall affinity of Pγ toward PDE6 catalytic subunits (11Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem.

Single amino acid substitutions corresponding to PDE6α′ residues at positions 750–760 were generated in Chi16 by PCR-directed mutagenesis. To facilitate the screening procedure, mutant primers were designed to either introduce or eliminate a suitable restriction site. For each mutant, the PCR product was obtained using a forward primer containing a mutated codon and a reverse primer carrying the StuI site. Purified PCR products were used as reversed primers for a second round PCR amplification with a forward primer containing NheI. The pFastBacHTbChi16 vector was used as a template in both PCR rounds. Final PCR products were digested with NheI/StuI and subcloned into the pFastBacHTbChi16 vector cut with the same enzymes. Sequences of all mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Sf9 cells were harvested at 60 h after infection, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 50 mm NaCl, and resuspended in the same buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After sonication using 30-s pulses for a total duration of 3 min, the supernatant (100,000 × g, 45 min) was loaded onto a column with a His-Bind resin (Novagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10 mmimidazole. The resin was washed with a 5× volume of the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 25 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 250 mmimidazole. β-Mercaptoethanol (2 mm) was added to the mixture. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 40% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. PDE activity was measured using [3H]cGMP as described (27Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 539-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Less than 15% of cGMP was hydrolyzed during these reactions. The Ki values for inhibition of PDE activity by Pγ and zaprinast were measured using 0.5 μm cGMP (i.e. <35% ofKm value for chimeric and mutant PDEs). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using IgG as a standard, or by using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. The molar concentrations of Chi16 and mutant PDEs, [PDE], were calculated based on the fraction of PDE protein in preparations and the molecular mass of 93.0 kDa. The fractional concentrations of PDE were determined from analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet II CX/T scanner and Scion Image Beta 4.02 software. A typical fraction of PDE in partially purified preparations was 10–15%. Thekcat values for cGMP hydrolysis were calculated as Vmax/[PDE]. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 10–12% acrylamide gels.

Chi4 contained the regulatory, noncatalytic cGMP-binding domain of PDE6α′ and the catalytic domain of PDE5 (Fig. 1 A). Chi4 was used as a basic template for the generation of new chimeras in which various portions of the PDE5 catalytic domain were replaced by corresponding sequences from PDE6α′. Chi16, containing a segment of 48 residues from PDE6α′ (PDE6α′-(737–784)) (Fig. 1), was functionally expressed in Sf9 cells with a yield of soluble protein at ∼100 μg/100 ml of culture. Chi16 hydrolyzed cGMP with aKm value of 2.8 μm and akcat value of 9.0 s−1(Fig. 2 A and TableI). Both kinetic parameters of Chi16 were comparable to those of PDE5 and Chi4 (Table I). In addition, Chi16 was potently inhibited by zaprinast, a PDE5/PDE6- specific competitive inhibitor (IC50 0.12 μm) (Fig. 2 B).Table IFunctional properties of Chi16 mutantsMutantKmkcatIC50for zaprinastKi for Pγμms−1μmnmPDE6α′ 1-aData from Granovsky et al.

Open table in a new tab The PDEα′-(737–784) insert includes a segment PDEα′-(749–761) that was previously identified as a binding site for the Pγ C terminus. The sequence corresponding to PDEα′-(749–761) is unique for photoreceptor PDEs, which show a strong conservation at this site (15Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast to PDE5 and Chi4 (19Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the catalytic activity of Chi16 was effectively inhibited by Pγ. The Kivalue of 3.6 nm indicates that Pγ binds to Chi16 with only a 20-fold lower affinity than the affinity of its interaction with native PDE6α′ (Fig. 3 and Table I). To test the potential role of the PDE6 noncatalytic cGMP-binding domain, the PDE6α′-(737–784) region was also replaced into the PDE5 cDNA (Fig. 1). The resulting chimera, Chi17, had catalytic properties similar to those of PDE5 and Chi16 (Km1.9 μm and kcat 9.8 s−1) (Fig. 2 A and Table I). The IC50 value for the Chi17 inhibition by zaprinast (0.77 μm) was similar to the IC50 value for PDE5 but somewhat higher than the IC50 value for Chi16 (Fig. 2 B and Table I). Pγ inhibited the cGMP hydrolysis by Chi17 less potently than the catalytic activity of Chi16. The maximal inhibition was up to 70% of Chi17 activity, and theKi value was 142 nm (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the noncatalytic cGMP-binding domain of PDE6α′ contributes to the high affinity interaction with Pγ. An Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the Pγ C-terminal binding site in Chi16 was performed to identify the Pγ-binding residues of PDE6α′. Eleven consecutive residues starting at position 750 were substituted with alanine. The Chi16 mutants were expressed in Sf9 cells and partially purified from the soluble fraction using an affinity chromatography on a His-Bind resin. The expression levels of soluble Chi16 mutants were 50–100 μg/100 ml culture, i.e.comparable to that of Chi16. All Chi16 mutants were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze cGMP. Two mutants, L751A and D760A, were catalytically inactive. Two other mutants, P755A and I756A, displayed notably reduced catalytic rates (Table I). In addition to lowering thekcat value for cGMP hydrolysis, the P755A substitution also resulted in an increase in the Kmvalue from 2.8 to 42 μm (Table I). The catalytic properties of P755A indicate that this mutation likely affected the overall folding of the catalytic site in Chi16. TheKm values for cGMP hydrolysis for the remaining Chi16 mutants were within the 4–15 μm range (Table I). Inhibition of Chi16 mutants by zaprinast revealed no large variations in their IC50 values, which were comparable to the IC50 value for Chi16 (Table I). Next, all catalytically active Chi16 mutants were examined for inhibition by Pγ. Most of the mutants retained a functional interaction with Pγ with the Ki values of ∼0.8 to 5 nm (Table I). Two mutants, Q752A and M758A, were defective in Pγ binding. The Q752A mutation had a moderate effect on interaction with Pγ. Pγ was capable of full inhibition of the Q752A catalytic activity, but the Ki value was increased to 29 nm (Fig. 4 C). A major impairment of the Pγ interaction was observed for the M758A mutant. The inhibition of M758A by Pγ was incomplete (∼75%) with the Kivalue of 97 nm (Fig. 4 C). Since the catalytic properties of Q752A and M758A were similar to those of Chi16 (Fig. 4), the defects of Pγ binding are not likely to be caused by alterations in overall folding of the catalytic domain in these mutants. The vertebrate visual transduction cascade is among the most studied and best understood G protein signaling systems. Yet, PDE6, the key enzyme of vision, remains arguably one of the most obscure G protein effectors in terms of understanding its structure/function relationship. Difficulties in the development of an efficient expression system for PDE6 have precluded the systematic mutational analysis of the enzyme (17Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D. Proc. Natl.

Our attempts to express functionally wild-type PDE6α′ and co-express PDE6α′ with Pγ using the Baculovirus/Sf9, COS7, or retinoblastoma Y79 cell systems have also been unsuccessful. 2A. E. Granovsky and N. O. Artemyev, unpublished observations. A construction of chimeric enzymes between PDE6α′ and related PDE5 has been proven as a useful tool for the study of PDE6. Previously, we demonstrated that a fully functional chimeric PDE6α′/PDE5 enzyme, containing the PDE6α′ noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites and the PDE5 catalytic domain, can be efficiently expressed in the Baculovirus/insect cell system (19Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This chimeric enzyme showed catalytic properties and noncatalytic cGMP-binding characteristics analogous to those of PDE5 and PDE6α′, respectively. Chimeric PDE6α′/PDE5 proteins containing the PDE6α′-active site were catalytically inactive, suggesting that the catalytic domain contains specific sequences preventing its functional folding in insect cells. Based on these findings, we generated and analyzed a number of chimeric PDE6α′/PDE5 proteins with replacements of various PDE5 catalytic domain segments by corresponding PDE6α′ sequences. A sequence, PDE6α′-(737–784), containing the Pγ C-terminal binding site Pα′-(749–761) (15Artemyev N.O. Natochin M. Busman M. Schey K.L. Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5407-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), has been introduced in one of these chimeras, Chi16 (Fig. 1). Not only was Chi16 catalytically active withKm and kcat values similar to PDE5, but it also acquired sensitivity to Pγ. TheKi value of Chi16 for Pγ (3.6 nm) was just 10–20-fold higher than the Ki values of native PDE6α′ reported previously (19Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Contacts between Pγ and the PDE6α′ catalytic domain outside of PDE6α′-(737–784) may account for the lower Ki value of the native enzyme. The noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites are allosterically coupled with the Pγ-binding sites and may regulate Pγ affinity for the PDE catalytic subunits (33Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test the role of the cGMP-binding domain, PDE6α′-(737–784) was also replaced into the wild-type PDE5 sequence (Chi17). Pγ inhibited Chi17 (Ki of 142 nm) less potently than Chi16, indicating that the noncatalytic cGMP-binding domain of PDE6α′, allosterically or due to additional contacts, enhances the Pγ interaction with the catalytic domain. Previously we demonstrated (16Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that binding of the Pγ C terminus to the PDE6 catalytic domain blocks the access of cGMP to the catalytic site. The Pγ C-terminal binding was also competitive with zaprinast. We concluded that residues that participate in the binding/hydrolysis of cGMP and the binding of competitive inhibitors are in a very close proximity to the Pγ C-terminal binding residues in a three-dimensional structure of PDE6 (16Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, an introduction of the Pγ-binding site into the PDE5 catalytic domain did not appreciably alter the catalytic properties. Therefore, the residues that bind Pγ are not directly involved in binding/hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE6, and they likely form a domain distinct from the catalytic pocket. Both conclusions, proximity of the Pγ-site to and its structural independence from the catalytic pocket, are supported by the model of PDE6 catalytic site (Fig. 5). The model was generated based on the recently determined structure of PDE4 catalytic domain, the first crystal structure of a PDE enzyme (36Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). According to this model, the Pγ-binding site, PDE6α′-(749–761), forms a loop near the entrance to the catalytic cGMP-binding pocket. However, PDE6α′-(749–761) residues do not participate in the formation of the catalytic cavity itself. The latter is primarily assembled by residues conserved in the PDE superfamily. These residues include two histidines, His561 and His597 (His238 and His274 in PDE4), critical for coordination of two metal ions (36Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The two metal atoms, apparently a tightly bound Zn2+ and a more loosely associated Mg2+, are central to the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides by PDE6 (37He F. Seryshev A.B. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20572-20577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Corresponding residues, His607 and His643, are necessary for the metal support of catalysis in PDE5 (38Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9591-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another important residue within the PDE6α′ catalytic pocket is conserved Gln771 (Fig. 5). The docking of cAMP into the PDE4 structure shows that a side chain of an analogous Gln443hydrogen bonds with the 1-N and 6-NH2 groups of the adenine base, but if the Gln443 amide group is rotated by 180° it may interact with the 1-NH and 6-CO groups of cGMP (36Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Gln443 in PDE4 is constrained by the interaction with Tyr403 (36Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The Tyr residue is substituted by Gln729 and Gln765 in PDE6 and PDE5, respectively, which appears to contribute to the cGMP substrate specificity. The Gln765 → Tyr substitution was among several mutations that shifted the cGMP/cAMP selectivity of PDE5 (39Turko I.V. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4200-4205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ala-scanning mutational analysis of PDE6α′-(750–760) in Chi16 identified two mutants, Q752A and M758A, with impaired inhibition by Pγ. The M758A substitution resulted in a particularly profound defect of Pγ binding. Both mutants retained the catalytic properties (Km and kcat) for cGMP hydrolysis and the IC50 values for inhibition by zaprinast similar to those of Chi16, suggesting their intact overall folding. The model of the PDE6α′ catalytic domain shows that the side chains of Gln752 and Met758 are solvent-exposed and are similarly orientated on the surface of the molecule. Hence, in all probability, these residues directly interact with Pγ. If the Pγ C terminus is lined up along the plane formed by the side chains of Gln752 and Met758, it may also make a contact with Pro755. Our data do not rule out the possibility of this contact. The P755A mutant had a significantly reduced rate of cGMP hydrolysis, and therefore, its inhibition by Pγ might not be directly compared with that for Chi16. Out of the residues, Met758 is located at the very tip of the Pγ-binding loop facing the opening of the catalytic cavity. Such a location of the Pγ-binding residue would allow Pγ to effectively block the entry of cGMP into the catalytic pocket.

https://openalex.org/W2005522290,"Based on the crystal structure of human topoisomerase I, we hypothesized that hydrogen bonding between the side chain of the highly conserved His632 and one of the nonbridging oxygens of the scissile phosphate contributes to catalysis by stabilizing the transition state. This hypothesis has been tested by examining the effects of changing His632 to glutamine, asparagine, alanine, and tryptophan. The change to glutamine reduced both the relaxation activity and single-turnover cleavage activity by approximately 100-fold, whereas the same change at three other conserved histidines (positions 222, 367, and 406) had no significant effect on the relaxation activity. The properties of the mutant protein containing asparagine instead of histidine at position 632 were similar to those of the glutamine mutant, whereas mutations to alanine or tryptophan reduced the activity by approximately 4 orders of magnitude. The reduction in activity for the mutants was not due to alterations in substrate binding affinities or changes in the cleavage specificities of the proteins. The above results for the glutamine mutation in conjunction with the similar effects of pH on the wild type and the H632Q mutant enzyme rule out the possibility that His632acts as a general acid to protonate the leaving 5′-oxygen during the cleavage reaction. Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the only role for His632 is to stabilize the pentavalent transition state through hydrogen bonding to one of the nonbridging oxygens.

NH2-terminal truncation of human topoisomerase I missing the first 174 amino acids the indicated form of the human topoisomerase I enzyme containing the wild type amino acid sequence dithiothreitol camptothecin, bp, base pair(s) 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid glutathione S-transferase Type I topoisomerases promote the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by introducing a temporary break in one of the strands of the helix (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). This function is important for a number of different cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and chromatin remodeling (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar,2Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozzarelli N.R. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar). The type I topoisomerases have been divided into two subfamilies, type IA and type IB. These two subfamilies share no sequence homology and relax DNA by distinct mechanisms. The type IA subfamily was originally identified in prokaryotes but is now known to include topoisomerases III from eukaryotic organisms as well (3Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Type IA topoisomerases relax only negatively supercoiled DNA and require a region of single-stranded DNA as well as Mg2+ for DNA relaxation. The type IB topoisomerase subfamily includes eukaryotic topoisomerase I and the topoisomerases that are encoded by poxviruses such as vaccinia. The relaxation reaction catalyzed by a type IB topoisomerase is initiated by DNA binding followed by nucleophilic attack of the O-4 atom of the active site tyrosine on a phosphodiester bond in the DNA. The phosphodiester bond energy is preserved during the resulting cleaved state by a covalent linkage between the active site tyrosine and the phosphate at the 3′ end of the broken strand (2Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozzarelli N.R. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar). DNA is relaxed by the supercoil-driven rotation of the DNA helix downstream of the nick around one or more bonds in the intact strand. Since rotation of the DNA appears to be guided by contacts between the protein and the DNA, the process has been referred to as “controlled rotation” (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The DNA is religated by a similar nucleophilic attack by the 5′-hydroxyl at the end of the broken strand. After religation, the enzyme can either re-cleave the DNA or dissociate from the DNA. Unlike the type IA subfamily, members of the type IB family can relax both positively and negatively supercoiled DNA in the absence of a metal ion cofactor, although Mg2+ and Ca2+ have been shown to stimulate the relaxation activity (6Liu L.F. Miller K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3487-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 7Goto T. Laipis P. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

Addition of a protein denaturant such as SDS or NaOH to eukaryotic topoisomerase I reactions traps the enzyme molecules at the nicked intermediate stage (2Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozzarelli N.R. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 217-242Google Scholar).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3097-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A large number of SDS-induced break sites have been characterized that define a weak consensus sequence for cleavage of 5′-(A or T)(G, C, or A)(A or T)T-3′ in which the enzyme is covalently attached to the 3′-most thymidine nucleotide (defined as the −1 residue) (9Been M.D. Burgess R.R.

The NH2-terminal domain is poorly conserved, highly charged and unstructured, and dispensable for activity in vitro (8Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

It contains four putative nuclear localization signals and has been shown to interact with nucleolin (19Bharti A.K. Olson M.O. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 60: 111-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Topo701 is a truncated form of human topoisomerase I with a molecular mass of 70 kDa that lacks residues 1–174 of the NH2-terminal domain and retains full enzyme activity in vitro (8Stewart L.

Oguro M. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases and Its Application to Chemotherapy. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 121-130Google Scholar). The core domain is highly conserved and more protease-resistant than the other domains. The crystal structure of human topoisomerase I indicates that the core domain can be further divided into three subdomains as follows: subdomains I and II that fold together to form the cap structure that covers one side of the DNA, and subdomain III that contains all of the active site residues with the exception of Tyr723 and that cradles the DNA on the side opposite the cap (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The linker domain forms a coiled-coil structure that protrudes from the body of the enzyme and connects the core to the highly conserved COOH-terminal domain (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The active site tyrosine (Tyr723) is located in the COOH-terminal domain close to the scissile phosphate in the bound DNA (18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Complete enzymatic activity can be reconstituted by mixing a core fragment with a COOH-terminal domain fragment (22Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), thus the linker region is dispensable for activity in vitro. Although the details of catalysis for the eukaryotic topoisomerase I reaction still remain to be elucidated, based on the crystal structure of the non-covalent human topoisomerase I-DNA complexes (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 23Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.

Biol. 1999; 9: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), both Arg488 and Lys532 appear to hydrogen-bond to one of the nonbridging oxygens of the scissile phosphate (O-1P atom), whereas His632 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the other nonbridging oxygen (O-2P atom). Arg590 is intermediate between the two nonbridging oxygens and, in addition, is very close to the nucleophilic tyrosine O-4. Together, all of these residues likely constitute the active catalytic center of the topoisomerase. Consistent with this view is the observation that mutations leading to changes in the corresponding amino acids in the structurally similar vaccinia topoisomerase at all of these positions have adverse effects on the activity of the enzyme (25Cheng C.

To define further the role of His632 in the reaction catalyzed by human topoisomerase I and in particular to explore the possibility that the side chain acts as a general acid-base catalyst, we describe here the properties of a number of variants with amino acid changes at this position. Single mutations were introduced into the human topoisomerase I cDNA (16D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie H.D. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To make the H222Q, H367Q, and H427Q mutations, the XhoI/NheI fragment of human topoisomerase I was cloned in the pBluescript KS(−) vector and transformed into E. coli CJ236 (dut – ung –) to obtain the uracil-containing single-stranded DNA. After introducing the mutations, the topo70 coding region (8Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

For the H632Q mutation, three oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for use in the megaprimer PCR method as follows: two flanking primers with restriction sites for future cloning and a megaprimer with the single mutation. One of the flanking primers and the megaprimer were used for the first stage PCR. The first stage PCR product as well as the other flanking primer were used for the second stage PCR. The second stage PCR product containing the H632Q mutation was cloned in the pGEX-topo70 vector for GST fusion protein expression and purification from E. coli. A three-way ligation was used to generate the recombinant pFASTBAC1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing the topo70 coding region with the H632Q mutation. The pFASTBAC1 vector was cut with BamHI and EcoRI, and the large fragment was combined with the HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pGEX-topo70(H632Q) (above) containing the mutation and the BamHI-HindIII fragment from pADH1Btopo70 (30Ireton G.C.

After ligation and isolation of the desired pFASTBAC1 recombinant plasmid (pFASTBAC1 topo70 H632Q), the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to generate the recombinant baculovirus expressing the topo70 H632Q protein according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The PCR-based megaprimer method (29Ke S.H. Madison E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3371-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was used to generate PpuMI-NheI topoisomerase I-derived fragments containing the H632A, H632N, and H632W mutations. These fragments were used to replace the corresponding fragment in pFASTBAC1 topo70 H632Q to yield the additional mutant recombinant pFASTBAC1 derivatives. The generation of the recombinant baculovirus expressing WT topo70 was described previously (8Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the region derived from the PCR fragment. E. coli cells containing a recombinant pGEX plasmid (with the WT or mutant topo70 coding region) were cultured overnight in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight cultures were diluted into 10 volumes of LB with ampicillin and shaken vigorously (250 rpm) for 2 h at 37 °C until the A600 reached ∼0.5. Expression of the GST topo70 fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 40 μg/ml. Following incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended on ice in Sonication Buffer (500 mmKCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were sonicated with 2–3 30-s pulses on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the supernatant, and the solution was rotated at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 3 min and washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. The GST fusion proteins were stored on the beads in the wash buffer at 4 °C until used in the relaxation assays. Recombinant bacmid DNAs containing the coding region for the mutant forms of topo70 were purified from E. coli DH10BAC cells and transfected into insect SF9 cells to produce the recombinant baculovirus stocks. The procedures for baculovirus infection and purification of WT topo70 have been described previously (8Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purification of the mutant proteins was similar except that the topo70 H632N and topo70 H632A proteins eluted from the Mono S column at a slightly higher KPO4concentration than WT topo70 (160 mm instead of 140 mm). The purified proteins were stored in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT and 50% glycerol, and the purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Protogel from National Diagnostics). Both a time course and a serial dilution assay were used to determine the plasmid relaxation activity of WT and mutant forms of topo70. The Reaction Buffer for both assays contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The substrate used for the relaxation assays was pBluescript KSII(+) plasmid DNA (Stratagene) (final concentration 25 ng/μl). For the time course assays, the reaction was carried out at an enzyme concentration of 0.25 ng/μl in a final volume of 200 μl. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of Stop Buffer (2.5% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 25% Ficoll 400, 0.08% bromphenol blue, 0.08% xylene cyanol). For the serial dilution assay, the enzymes were 2-fold serially diluted in Reaction Buffer, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μl of the diluted enzyme to 18 μl of Reaction Buffer containing DNA. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 5 μl of Stop Buffer. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel and visualized with a UV illuminator after ethidium bromide staining. A 25-mer DNA oligonucleotide (CL25, see Fig. 4) was 5′ end-labeled by phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). To prepare the duplex substrate, the labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of the complementary 25-mer (CP25, Fig. 4) by heating to 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 10 min at 65 °C and then cooling to 25 °C for another 10 min. The DNA binding assay was carried out in 10 μl of Reaction Buffer containing the labeled duplex oligonucleotide (0.5 nm) and 2-fold serial dilutions of the topoisomerase yielding final concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 0.64 μm. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of 2.5 μl of 50% glycerol and analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The running buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl and 162 mm glycine, pH 8.5. Due to the high pI value of the topo70 protein (9.3), free protein and protein-DNA complexes migrated to the cathode under these electrophoresis conditions, and therefore only the unbound DNA entered the gel. The amount of unbound oligonucleotide in the gel was quantified by a PhosphorImager analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics), and the dissociation constant (Kd) was determined from the protein concentration at which one-half of the total oligonucleotide was bound (31Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A 14-mer DNA oligonucleotide (CL14, Fig. 5) was 5′ end-labeled as described above and annealed with a 3-fold molar excess of the complementary CP25 oligonucleotide. The complementary strand was phosphorylated at the 5′ end to prevent self-religation. The two strands were annealed by heating to 94 °C for 1 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C for 2 h. The single-turnover suicide cleavage reactions were carried out by incubating a 14-fold molar excess of the topoisomerase I protein with the suicide cleavage substrate (20 nm) in Cleavage Buffer (150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) at 23 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. A 10-μl sample of the reaction mixture prior to the addition of protein was removed and used as the zero time point. 10-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and mixed with an equal volume of 1% SDS to stop the reaction. Samples were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA and digested at 37 °C for 1 h to cleave all but a short peptide of the enzyme from the covalent complex. The digested samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel (SequaGel from National Diagnostics). Uncleaved oligonucleotide migrates as 14-mer, whereas the cleaved 12-mer oligonucleotide with the attached peptide migrates slightly slower. The extent of covalent complex formation was quantified using the PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The percentage of cleaved oligonucleotide (Cl%) was determined based on the end point cleavage values. The cleavage rate (kcl) was determined by fitting the data from the first three time points to the equation ln(100 − Cl %) = 4.605 − kcl t (26Petersen B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rate constant for religation (kr) was calculated according to the following equation where KCR is the equilibrium constant for the cleavage-religation reaction (see below),kr = kcl /KCR . Implicit in this calculation is the assumption that the rate of cleavage with the suicide substrate is the same as the cleavage rate on the completely duplex oligonucleotide. This assumption has been shown to hold true for vaccinia topoisomerase (32Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of pH on the suicide cleavage rate, the Cleavage Buffer was modified using the following buffers (50 mm) to the indicated pHs: NaMes, pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.2, and 7.4; Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 7.6, 8.4, 8.9, and 9.4. The percent cleavage was quantified as described above, and the logarithm of the cleavage rate was plotted against the pH. The 25-mer oligonucleotide CL25 was 5′ end-labeled, gel-purified, and annealed to the complementary 25-mer strand (CP25) as described above. The SDS-induced cleavage reactions were initiated by incubating a 14-fold molar excess of enzyme (0.28 μm) with the DNA oligonucleotide (20 nm) in 10 μl of Reaction Buffer lacking bovine serum albumin for the indicated times at 23 °C to allow the cleavage-religation reaction to reach equilibrium. The cleaved covalent complex was denatured by the addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS. Samples were precipitated by ethanol and digested in 10 μl of the trypsin solution described above for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were electrophoresed through a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The primary cleavage product, a 12-mer with a short attached peptide as well as a small amount of a secondary cleavage product (10-mer with peptide), were well resolved from the input 25-mer allowing the percent cleavage (%Cl) to be determined using the PhosphorImager. The value of KCR was calculated from the equation KCR = %Cl/(l00 − %Cl). The cleavage specificities of the WT and mutant topo70 enzymes were analyzed as described previously (22Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) except that the 136-bp NheI fragment from plasmid pBendWest that contains the preferred site for topoisomerase I cleavage was gel-purified prior to the 3′ end-labeling step. The cleavage reactions were initiated by mixing 2.8 pmol of the WT or mutant enzymes with 20 fmol of labeled DNA in a 10-μl reaction containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and, where indicated, 50 μm camptothecin (CPT). After incubation for 1 h at 23 °C, 2 μl of 5% SDS was added to induce topoisomerase I-mediated DNA breakage. The resulting breakage products were ethanol-precipitated and, after electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea gel, analyzed using the PhosphorImager. Bond distances and the effects of replacing amino acids on protein structure were determined using the Swiss-PDB Viewer (version 3.51) software (Glaxo Wellcome Experimental Research) (33Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9380) Google Scholar). Depending on whether it is protonated or not, a histidine side chain is an ideal candidate to act either as general acid or a general base during the cleavage and religation transesterification reactions catalyzed by human topoisomerase I (34Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15449-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The solution of the crystal structure of human topoisomerase I provided support for this view as the highly conserved His632 was found to be relatively close to the 5′-oxygen of the leaving deoxyribose sugar (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 18Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To test this possibility directly, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change His632 to glutamine; like histidine, glutamine can participate in hydrogen bonding, but unlike histidine it is unable to act as a general acid-base catalyst. As controls, we independently changed each of the other three invariant histidines in topoisomerase I proteins (His222, His367, His406) to glutamine as well. The histidine to glutamine mutations were introduced into the topo70 form of human topoisomerase I, and the mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli as GST fusions. Although human topoisomerase I is unstable when expressed in E. coli, we found previously that sufficient protein is present in crude extracts to permit reliable enzyme assays (35Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 525-532PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, we purified the four GST fusion proteins using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and carried out plasmid relaxation assays using equal amounts of protein as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The effects of the mutations on enzyme activity were analyzed by a standard serial dilution DNA relaxation assay, and the results are shown in Fig.1. Only a trace amount of enzyme activity was detect"

Earlier studies demonstrate that activator present in the β-cell-specific RIPE3b1-binding complex is critical for these actions. The DNA binding activity of the RIPE3b1 activator is induced in response to glucose stimulation and is inhibited under glucotoxic conditions. The C1 element within the RIPE3b region has been implicated as the binding site for RIPE3b1 activator. The RIPE3b region also contains an additional element, A2, which shares homology with the A elements in the insulin enhancer. Transcription factors (PDX-1 and HNF-1α) binding to A elements are critical regulators of insulin gene expression and/or pancreatic development. Hence, to understand the roles of C1 and A2 elements in regulating insulin gene expression, we have systematically mutated the RIPE3b region and analyzed the effect of these mutations on gene expression. Our results demonstrate that both C1 and A2 elements together constitute the binding site for the RIPE3b1 activator. In addition to C1-A2 (RIPE3b) binding complexes, three binding complexes that specifically recognize A2 elements are found in nuclear extracts from insulinoma cell lines; the A2.2 complex is detected only in insulin-producing cell lines. Furthermore, two base pairs in the A2 element were critical for binding of both RIPE3b1 and A2.2 activators. Transient transfection results indicate that both C1-A2 and A2-specific binding activators cooperatively activate insulin gene expression. In addition, RIPE3b1- and A2-specific activators respond differently to glucose, suggesting that their overlapping binding specificity and functional cooperation may play an important role in regulating insulin gene expression.

Further, mutational analysis of the promoter proximal region identified several cis-acting enhancer elements that are important for insulin expression. The insulin enhancer elements, with the exception of E-box elements, have been classified based on the nucleotide sequence of the element (8German M. Ashcroft S. Docherty K. Edlund H. Edlund T.

Limited but not identical cellular distribution of transcription factors PDX-1 and BETA2 suggests that cell-specific insulin gene expression may result because of the presence of a unique combination of enhancer element binding factors in the pancreatic β-cells.

The importance of the factor(s) binding to the RIPE3b element in mediating cell type-specific insulin gene expression is further emphasized from transgenic mice studies (5Stellrecht C.M.M.

Our earlier studies demonstrated that the binding activity of the cell-specific RIPE3b1 activator play a key role in regulating this glucose responsiveness (30Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1468-1476PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the binding activity of the RIPE3b1 activator is induced in response to acute change in glucose concentration, under glucotoxic conditions, as observed in HIT T-15 cells cultured chronically in the presence of high concentrations of glucose, the RIPE3b1 and PDX-1 binding activities were inhibited (37Sharma A.

PDX-1 protein and mRNA levels were also inhibited in rat islets, following development of diabetes after partial pancreatectomy (40Zangen D.H. Bonner-Weir S. Lee C.H. Latimer J.B. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in vitro and in vivo glucotoxic conditions regulate the levels and activity of insulin gene transcription factors. Interestingly, the binding activity of the RIPE3b1 factor, but not of PDX-1, is inhibited under glucotoxic conditions in the insulinoma cell line βTC-6 (41Poitout V. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This suggests that the inhibition of the RIPE3b1 activator binding may be the primary or initial defect under glucotoxic conditions.The cell type-specific and glucose-responsive transcription factors of the insulin gene also play an important role in pancreatic development and differentiation of β-cells. Mice homozygous for the null mutation in BETA2/NeuroD have a striking reduction in the number of β-cells and fail to develop mature islets, develop severe diabetes, and die perinatally (26Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The pdx-1 knockout mice have a more profound phenotype, being apancreatic; these animals also develop extreme hyperglycemia and die perinatally (20Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P. Ray M. Stein R.

During embryonic development, PDX-1 is also expressed in exocrine and ductal epithelial cells, whereas in the adult pancreas expression is predominantly restricted to β-cells (20Offield M.F.

However, expression of PDX-1 is induced in the ductal epithelium during pancreatic regeneration in adult animals (44Sharma A. Zangen D.H. Reitz P. Taneja M. Lissauer M.E. Miller C.P. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar).Similar to the PDX-1 and BETA2 factors, the RIPE3b1 activator, is an important regulator of cell type-specific and glucose-responsive expression of the insulin gene and may play an important role in pancreatic development and/or β-cell differentiation. The C1 element (Fig. 1) in the RIPE3b region has been implicated as the binding site for the RIPE3b1 activator (14Shieh S-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol.

Factors binding the C1 element were shown to functionally co-operate with E1 binding factors (BETA2-E12/E47) in regulating insulin gene expression (14Shieh S-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol.

The homeodomain family of transcription factors (PDX-1, HNF1 α, and Isl-1) that are important for pancreatic development bind insulin A elements (48Karlsson O. Thor S. Norberg T. Ohlsson H. Edlund T.

Furthermore, factors binding to A elements are implicated in synergistically interacting with other insulin gene transcription factors and regulating gene expression (52German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2165-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 53Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell.

We demonstrate that the presence of both C1 and A2 elements are essential for binding of the RIPE3b1 activator. We also identified factors that require the A2 element but not the C1 element for binding. Interestingly, one of the A2 element-binding complexes, A2.2, is selectively expressed in insulin-producing cell lines. We further demonstrate that two base pairs in the A2 element are critical for the formation of both β-cell-specific DNA-binding complexes, RIPE3b1 and A2.2. Results from transient transfection analysis indicate that C1-A2 (RIPE3b1) and A2-specific factors positively regulate insulin gene expression. A mutation that prevents binding of both activators shows greater inhibition of insulin gene expression than a mutation that prevents binding of either of these factors alone. Based on these results we suggest that the presence of two β-cell-specific factors with overlapping DNA-binding sites may provide an important means of regulating insulin gene expression in response to various metabolic/environmental signals.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that β-cell-specific RIPE3b1 and A2.2 factors recognize overlapping DNA-binding sites within the insulin enhancer. These factors can each positively regulate insulin gene expression as well as cooperatively activate insulin gene expression. Because the binding activity of RIPE3b1 activator is regulated by glucose (Fig. 7 and Refs. 28Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Sharma A. Fusco-DeMane D. Henderson E. Efrat S. Stein R. Mol.

Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), overlapping binding specificity and functional cooperation between A2.2 and RIPE3b1 activator may play major roles in regulating insulin expression in response to various metabolic stimulus. These observations suggest that like RIPE3b1, the A2.2 activator is an important regulator of insulin gene expression. Initial characterization indicates that A2-specific binding factors are distinct from PDX-1 (Fig. 6 A). Excess unlabeled A3 oligonucleotide did not prevent formation of A2-specific complexes (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that A2 binding factors might belong to a different family of transcription factors than the PDX-1 and other A element binding homeodomain factors. Similarly, anti-Nkx2.2 antibody did not recognize any of the A2-specific complexes, and mutating the Nk2 consensus sequence did not affect the formation of A2 complexes. These results indicate that A2-specific activators are novel and distinct from the Nk2 and other homeodomain family of transcription factors.The importance of the RIPE3b region in mediating β-cell-specific and glucose-responsive insulin gene expression is well established (5Stellrecht C.M.M.

Although two insulin enhancer elements, C1 and A2, were described in the RIPE3b region, we were unable to detect any C1 selective binding activity in insulin-producing cells. Our results demonstrate that C1 binding factors (RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2) require sequences present in the A2 element. Similarly, A2-specific factors require additional nucleotides upstream of the RIPE3b region for their binding (Figs. 2 and 3). These observations suggest a need to redefine the enhancer elements in the RIPE3b region. Because we were unable to identify any C1-specific binding factor, we suggest that designation of the C1 region as a DNA-binding element may not be accurate. We suggest that the binding element for RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 activator may accurately be described as C1-A2 or the CA element. Similarly, additional nucleotides must be included within the A2 element to describe it as a binding site for A2-specific factors. These criteria would help interpret earlier studies that describe mutations and deletions in C1 and A2 elements and their effect on insulin gene expression (47Tomonari A. Yoshimoto K. Tanaka M. Iwahana H. Miyazaki J. Itakura M. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 64Lu M. Seufert J. Habner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28349-28359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For example, Tomonari and co-workers (47Tomonari A. Yoshimoto K. Tanaka M. Iwahana H. Miyazaki J. Itakura M. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported the role of the A2 (GG1) element in regulating human insulin gene expression. Their results obtained from an A2 deletion construct would not only inhibit activation from the A2-specific factor but also from the RIPE3b1 activator. Similarly, other mutations in the A2 region described in the their study would also inhibit activation mediated by both RIPE3b1 and A2.2 factors. In addition, functional cooperation between the C1-A2 and A2-specific factors should be considered prior to interpreting results from earlier studies. We therefore suggest that a clear designation of the C1-A2 and A2 elements would be helpful in analyzing the role of this region in insulin gene expression.Mutational analysis of the RIPE3b region has provided important information regarding the RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 activators. Binding of these factors requires at least a 16-bp-long region (−123 to −107 bp; Figs. 2 and 8) of the rat insulin II enhancer. Nucleotides critical for binding of these factors are separated into two distinct regions, −112 to −107 bp and −123 to −117 bp. Although the nucleotides between these regions can be mutated without any effect on binding activity and insulin gene expression (Fig. 2 A, data not shown, and Ref.28Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), attempts to alter spacing between these regions by either insertion or deletion mutations prevented DNA binding (Fig.2 C). These observations suggest that RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 factors not only recognize specific nucleotide sequence but also the recognize specific structure/organization of these nucleotides. The two critical nucleotide regions are spaced apart by about one helical turn of DNA, suggesting that RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 activators may recognize only one surface of the DNA helix. This is consistent with the results from methylation interference analysis of RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 complexes by Shieh and colleagues (14Shieh S-Y. Tsai M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16708-16714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shieh S.Y. Stellrecht C.M.M. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21503-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), showing a strong interference at Gs −107, −108, and −111 and a weak interference at −114 bp. Furthermore, results from the methylation interference experiment demonstrated interference at Gs only on the bottom strand and not on the top strand. Our mutational analysis (Fig. 2) and transient transfection data (Fig. 9) are consistent with the importance of nucleotides −107, −108, and −111 bp in insulin gene expression. The role of weak interference at −114 bp is unclear, because −113 and −114 bp are not critical for binding nor gene expression (data not shown). Also, Zhao and co-workers (28Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutating −114 bp had no effect on insulin gene expression, suggesting that weak interference at −114 bp is not critical for binding of the RIPE3b1 factor and insulin gene expression. Our results demonstrate the requirement of a large binding region for the RIPE3b1 and the RIPE3b2 factors (−123 to −107 bp; Figs. 2 and 8); however, it is unclear why no interference was observed at Gs on the bottom strand at positions −117 and −120 bp.RIPE3b1 and RIPE3b2 factors have iden"

Crystallographic investigations suggest that Arg-94 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the γ-carboxylate of glutaryl-CoA. Substitution of Arg-94 by glycine, a disease-causing mutation, and by glutamine, which is sterically more closely related to arginine, reduced kcat of the mutant dehydrogenases to 2–3% of kcat of the wild type enzyme.

The steady-state kinetic constants of alternative substrates, hexanoyl-CoA and glutaramyl-CoA, which are not decarboxylated, are modestly affected by the mutations. The latter changes are probably due to steric and polar effects. The dissociation constants of the non-oxidizable substrate analogs, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, are not altered by the mutations. However, abstraction of a α-proton from 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, to yield a charge transfer complex with the oxidized flavin, is severely limited. In contrast, abstraction of the α-proton of acetoacetyl-CoA by Arg-94 → Gln mutant dehydrogenase is unaffected, and the resulting enolate forms a charge transfer complex with the oxidized flavin. These experiments indicate that Arg-94 does not make a major contribution to glutaryl-CoA binding. However, the electric field of Arg-94 may stabilize the dianions resulting from abstraction of the α-proton of glutaryl-CoA and 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, both of which contain γ-carboxylates.

A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). With the exception of Arg-94 in human glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, no acyl-CoA dehydrogenases contain a cationic residue in the active site (10Telford E.A. Moynihan L.M. Markham A.F. Lench N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structure of the dehydrogenase, it was proposed that Arg-94 participates in the binding of glutaryl-CoA. It was also suggested that the delocalized charge of the guanidinium group might also stabilize a transient crotonyl-CoA anion prior to protonation or might stabilize, developing a negative charge at the γ-carbon in the transition state for decarboxylation (9Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany1999: 539-542Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the functions of Arg-94 and Ser-98 (Arg-138 and Ser-142 in the complete sequence containing the 44-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence (3Goodman S.I. Kratz L.E. DiGiulio K. Biery B.J. Goodman K.E. Isaya G. Frerman F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). We determined steady-state kinetic constants of wild type GCD, Arg-94 → Gly, Arg-94 → Gln, and Ser-98 → Ala mutants of GCD using glutaryl-CoA and two alternate substrates, hexanoyl-CoA and glutaramyl-CoA, that are not decarboxylated. We also investigated the binding of non-oxidizable glutaryl-CoA analogs, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, by wild type GCD and the mutants. These studies suggest that Arg-94 functions to effectively decrease the p Ka of the α-proton in the low dielectric in the interior of the protein. Electrostatic stabilization by Arg-94 would favor formation of α-anions of the substrate and substrate analog, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, both of which contain γ-carboxylates. Arg-94 may also orient the substrate for efficient proton abstraction at the α-carbon from glutaryl-CoA. Arg-94 apparently does not play a major role in the binding of the substrate. Ser-98 also lies at the bottom of the active site and is conserved in several members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (long chain, α-methyl-butyryl-, and short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases) (10Telford E.A. Moynihan L.M. Markham A.F. Lench N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glu-99 occupies a similar position in the three-dimensional structure of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and participates in a hydrogen bonding network with tightly bound water molecules at the base of the active site in the absence of acyl-CoA ligands (11Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ser-98 by alanine has little effect on the steady-state kinetic constants of the dehydrogenase. The latter data suggest that the polarity of the β-hydroxyl group of Ser-98 is not essential for substrate binding or a rate-limiting step in turnover. Ferrocenium hexafluorophosphate (FcPF6) was obtained from Aldrich. CoASH, glutaryl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and hexanoyl-CoA were from Sigma. [1,5-14C]Glutaric acid was from ICN Biochemicals and [1,5-14C]glutaryl-CoA was prepared from the anhydride as described (2Lenich A.C. Goodman S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4090-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutaramic acid (glutaric acid monoamide) was synthesized as described by Marquez et al. (12Marquez V.E. Kelley J.A. Driscoll J.S. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 5308-5312Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) from glutaric anhydride and NH3. Synthetic glutaramic acid had a melting point of 93 °C in agreement with the literature value, 93–94 °C (13Jeffery, G. H., and Vogel, J. (1934) J. Chem. Soc.1101–1105Google Scholar), and the 1H NMR spectrum was as expected (12Marquez V.E. Kelley J.A. Driscoll J.S. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 5308-5312Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Glutaramyl-CoA was synthesized by the mixed anhydride method (14Bernert Jr., J.T. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6736-6744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3-Thiaglutaryl-CoA was synthesized as described by Dwyer et al. (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Porcine medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was purified as described previously (15Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Huhta K. McKean M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2195-2198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type GCD and the Arg-94 → Gly and Ser-98 → Ala mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of Arg-94 → Gly GCD (A269 nm:A370 nm:A447 nm::5.3:0.65:1.00) was very similar to that of the wild type dehydrogenase (A269 nm:A369 nm:A447 nm::5.0:0.62:1.00). The Arg-94 → Gln mutant of GCD was expressed in E. coligrown at 23 °C. Optimal expression was dependent on co-expression of the chaperones, GroEL/ES, from the plasmid reported by Gatenby (16Gatenby A.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Arg-94 → Gln was purified as described previously (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that the gradient on DEAE-Sepharose was extended from 150 to 170 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The ratios of absorption maxima of the purified Arg-94 → Gln GCD were A268 nm:A370 nm:A446 nm::5.3:0.67:1.0. The extinction coefficients of FAD at the visible absorption maxima, 446 or 447 nm, in wild type, Arg-94 → Gly, and Arg-94 → Gln dehydrogenases are 14.5 × 103 (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), 14.2 × 103, and 14.8 × 103m−1 cm−1, respectively. The latter values were determined after release of the FAD from the proteins with 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (17McKean M.C. Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1866-1870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The errors in these determination were ±0.6%. The Ser-98 → Ala mutant dehydrogenase was expressed and purified as the wild type dehydrogenase. The ratios of absorbance maxima were 268 nm:368 nm:449 nm::5.3:0.59:1.00. The extinction coefficient at 449 nm of the bound flavin is 16.7 × 103m−1 cm−1. The ratios of the maxima in absorption spectra of the mutants compared with the wild type dehydrogenase indicate that the mutants do not lose FAD, and the FAD:subunit ratio is unity. The GCD proteins were assayed at 25 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, with 200 μm FcPF6 as the electron acceptor; glutaryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and glutaramyl-CoA were the varied substrates. Enzyme activity was routinely determined using ε300 nm = 4.3 × 103m−1 cm−1 for FcPF6(18Lehman T.C. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10594-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GCD specific activity was also assayed by following the release of 14CO2 from [1,5-14C]glutaryl-CoA (2Lenich A.C. Goodman S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4090-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the standard reaction containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 25 μm [1,5-14C]glutaryl-CoA and 200 μm FcPF6. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenized plasmids were sequenced in the region of the mutations to verify introduction of the mutation. Cassettes containing the mutated site were removed by digestion with EcoRI and SacI and ligated into the wild type plasmid that had been digested with the same endonucleases. The expression vectors were then sequenced across junctions and through the mutated cassette to demonstrate the mutation and the absence of unwanted mutation. No unwanted mutations were detected. DNA was sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide termination method (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52743) Google Scholar) using the Alf express system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenases and calculation of binding constants were carried out as described previously (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All spectra were corrected for dilution due to addition of ligands. Binding of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA to wild type GCD and mutants was followed spectrophotometrically at 825 and 450 nm, respectively. Similarly, binding of acetoacetyl-CoA to Arg-94 → Gln GCD was followed at 322 nm (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the initial experiments, we determined the steady-state kinetic constants of wild type GCD and the three mutant dehydrogenases, Arg-94 → Gly, Arg-94 → Gln, and Ser-98 → Ala with glutaryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and glutaramyl-CoA (Table I). Decarboxylation is obviously not a step in the steady-state turnover of hexanoyl-CoA and glutaramyl-CoA. All reactions were assayed in 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.6, with FcPF6 as the electron acceptor.Table ISteady-state kinetic constants of wild type, Arg-94 → Gln, Arg-94 → Gly, and Ser-98 → Ala glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenases with glutaryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and glutaramyl-CoAWild type GCDArg-94 → Gly GCDArg-94 → Gln GCDSer-98 → Ala GCDKm (glutaryl-CoA) (μm)2.6 ± 0.441.1 ± 6.425.4 ± 2.41.4 ± 0.2kcat(glutaryl-CoA) (s−1)9.0 ± 0.40.24 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.0110.3 ± 0.3kcat/Km (s−1μm−1)3.50.0060.0097.3Km (hexanoyl-CoA) (μm)36.8 ± 6.020.1 ± 0.45.1 ± 0.140.3 ± 8.4kcat (hexanoyl-CoA) (s−1)18.5 ± 1.214.2 ± 0.68.8 ± 0.425.3 ± 1.7kcat/Km (s−1μm−1)0.50.71.70.6Km (glutaramyl-CoA) (μm)1.6 ± 0.321.2 ± 3.07.9 ± 1.83.4 ± 1.1kcat (glutaramyl-CoA) (s−1)2.2 ± 0.26.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.3kcat/Km (s−1μm−1)1.40.30.20.8Assayed spectrophotometrically in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, with FcPF6 as the electron acceptor. Open table in a new tab Assayed spectrophotometrically in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, with FcPF6 as the electron acceptor. kcat of the Arg-94 → Gly mutant with glutaryl-CoA as substrate decreases to about 3% that of the wild type dehydrogenase, and Km for glutaryl-CoA increases 16-fold. Glutamine was also substituted for Arg-94, because glutamine is sterically similar to arginine, and the amide group maintains the polar character at the mutated site, although the cationic charge is absent. Modeling of glutaryl-CoA into the active site suggests that Arg-94 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the γ-carboxylate of glutaryl-CoA (9Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany1999: 539-542Google Scholar). However, the glutamine side chain is at least 2.3 Å shorter than that of arginine; therefore, the γ-carboxylate of glutaryl-CoA and the amide of Gln-94 cannot interact as strongly as in the wild type dehydrogenase. Substitution of Arg-94 by glutamine increases Km for glutaryl-CoA 10-fold, and kcat decreases to 2% of kcat of wild type GCD. However, the kinetic constants of Ser-98 → Ala GCD with glutaryl-CoA as substrate are very similar to those of wild type GCD (Table I). Ser-98 apparently plays no major role in the steady-state kinetic pathway of the dehydrogenase. In contrast with these results, the steady-state kinetic constants of the enzymes are less affected with hexanoyl-CoA as the substrate. The 45% decrease in Km of the Arg-94 → Gly mutant may be attributed to the increased volume at the bottom of the active site, which is likely occupied by water molecules in the mutant protein. The mutation would eliminate an unfavorable interaction between the charged guanidinium group of Arg-94 and the alkyl chain of hexanoyl-CoA.kcat of Arg-94 → Gly GCD decreases somewhat (25%), but the specificity of the mutant enzyme reflected by kcat/Km is essentially unchanged when compared with the wild type GCD. By the same criterion, the specificity of the Arg-94 → Gln mutant actually increases. Moreover, the kinetic constants of this mutant enzyme are very similar to those of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in which a glutamine residue occupies the same position as Arg-94 in GCD (11Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20Ghisla S. Braunworth A. Vock P. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1996. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1997: 629-632Google Scholar). The residues comprising the active sites of GCD and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are reasonably conserved with the exception of Arg-94 and a negatively charged residue, Glu-99, in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (10Telford E.A. Moynihan L.M. Markham A.F. Lench N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Vock P. Engst S. Eder M. Ghisla S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1848-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Glutaryl-CoA is not a substrate for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, perhaps due to the unfavorable interaction of Glu-99 with the γ-carboxylate of glutaryl-CoA. The Km of Arg-94 → Gln GCD for hexanoyl-CoA decreases further with the elimination of Arg-94, and the cavity in Arg-94 → Gly GCD, presumably containing bound water, is occupied by the side chain of glutamine. kcat of this mutant with hexanoyl-CoA does decrease relative to that of wild type GCD, perhaps due to the decreased dissociation of product as in medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (22Kumar N.R. Peterson K.L. Srivastava D.K. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1996. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1997: 633-636Google Scholar) or positioning of substrate. The Km of wild type GCD for glutaramyl-CoA is similar to the Km for glutaryl-CoA, but kcat decreases. The structural similarity of the resulting 2,3-enoyl-CoA amide analog product with the tightly bound natural intermediate, glutaconyl-CoA, may limit steady-state turnover due to a slow off-rate. The increased volume of the active site and decreased strength of hydrogen bonding of the γ-amide may cause the increase of Km for glutaramyl-CoA, but the increased volume of the active site of Arg-94 → Gly GCD may promote the rate of dissociation of the 2,3-enoyl-CoA product. The Km for glutaramyl-CoA of Arg-94 → Gln is increased relative to wild type GCD but is significantly less than the Arg-94 → Gly mutant, which has the large cavity at the bottom of the active site. The substitution of glutamine at position 94 yields a mutant with a turnover that is similar to the wild type dehydrogenase, perhaps limiting turnover by decreasing the rate of dissociation of the glutaconyl-CoA analog. The specificity of the Arg-94 → Gln mutant is essentially identical to that of the Arg-94 → Gly mutant with the γ-amide analog substrate likely reflecting the absence of interaction between the amide and Arg-94 seen in the wild type dehydrogenase. The predominant effect of both substitutions for Arg-94 in GCD with glutaryl-CoA as substrate is to reduce kcat to 2–3% of the wild type turnover, although Km for glutaryl-CoA increases about 10- to 16-fold. The effects of the mutations of Arg-94 on the steady-state kinetic constants could be ascribed to a role in binding the γ-carboxylate, or, perhaps, to stabilization of the transient crotonyl-CoA carbanion prior to protonation to yield crotonyl-CoA (9Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany1999: 539-542Google Scholar). Stabilization of such a negatively charged intermediate is not required in the oxidation of either hexanoyl-CoA or glutaramyl-CoA. The effects of the mutations can also be evaluated from the resulting changes in kcat/Km (Table I). Glutaryl-CoA is, predictably, the best substrate of wild type GCD. When glycine or glutamine is substituted for Arg-94, the values of kcat/Km indicate that hexanoyl-CoA is the best of the three substrates and that the mutant enzymes are only slightly less efficient with glutaramyl-CoA as substrate. kcat/Km of the mutants with glutaryl-CoA as substrate is strongly influenced by the large decrease of kcat, again suggesting the possible involvement of the delocalized positive charge of the guanidinium group in stabilizing the transient crotonyl-CoA anion. The decrease in kcat does not seem to be of sufficient magnitude to indicate a role for Arg-94 in the stabilization of a developing negative charge at the γ-carbon in a decarboxylation transition state. It is important that the Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln mutants are capable of catalyzing decarboxylation in the standard radiochemical assay (Table II). Although not extrapolated to infinite substrate concentration, the decreased specific activities are of the same magnitude as the decreases in kcat shown in Table I. Thus, Arg-94 is not absolutely required for decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA.Table IISpecific activity of enzymatic decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA by wild type, Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenasesEnzymeActivity (% wild type)s−1Wild type3.1 ± 0.1Arg-94 → Gly0.030 ± 0.003 (0.9)Arg-94 → Gln0.010 ± 0.004 (0.3)Assayed by the release of 14CO2 from [1,5-14C]glutaryl-CoA in the standard assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Assayed by the release of 14CO2 from [1,5-14C]glutaryl-CoA in the standard assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” These experiments also suggest a catalytic basis for the pathogenicity of the Arg-94 → Gly mutation in humans (8Goodman S.I. Stein D.E. Schlesinger S. Christensen E. Schwartz M. Greenberg C.R. Elpeleg O.N. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Substitution of lysine for Arg-94 is also a disease-causing mutation (23Zschocke J. Quak E. Guldberg P. Hoffmann G.F. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); however, this mutant subunit was unstable when expressed in E. coli, and the mutation may affect the folding pathway of the mutant subunit. The stability of this subunit in human cells is not known. The function of Arg-94 was further investigated by determining the effects of the Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln mutations on the binding of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, a nonoxidizable analog of glutaryl-CoA (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The obvious difference between the wild type and mutants is that binding of the analog to the mutant proteins yields no detectable charge transfer complex with a maximum at about 825 nm that is observed in the titration of the wild type protein (Fig.1, A–C). The charge transfer species presumably results from the interaction of the α-carbanion of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA following abstraction of a α-proton of the analog with the electron deficient oxidized flavin (24Lau S.-M. Brantley R.K. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5089-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Tamaoki H. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Miura R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of the Arg-94 → Gln dehydrogenase a weak charge transfer band (λmax ≈ 650 nm) may be present (Fig. 1 C). The analog binds to both mutant proteins as demonstrated by the perturbation of the flavin spectra of the two mutants proteins, accompanied by a 7-nm blue shift in the spectra. The concentration-dependent binding of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA to the wild type, Arg-94 → Gly, and Arg-94 → Gln dehydrogenases is shown in Fig. 1 (A–C). The Kd values of complexes of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA with wild type GCD and the two mutants are given in Table III. These data indicate that Arg-94 is not a major determinant for glutaryl-CoA binding, because its absence has no affect on the dissociation constants of the complexes with mutant proteins when compared with the wild type. Rather, both mutations alter the equilibrium for the abstraction of the α-proton of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA.Table IIIConstants for the binding of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA with wild type, Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenasesEnzymeDissociation constantStoichiometry, ligand/flavinμmWild type6.7 ± 1.20.91 ± 0.04Arg-94 → Gly8.5 ± 2.10.99 ± 0.06Arg-94 → Gln10.4 ± 4.31.03 ± 0.10Spectrophotometric titration were carried out in 125 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 25°C. Open table in a new tab Spectrophotometric titration were carried out in 125 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 25°C. Proton abstraction from 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA by a Glu-370 → Asp mutant of GCD is also significantly decreased (≤97%) (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Glu-370 is the catalytic base in GCD that abstracts the α-proton of the substrate. The distance of the aspartate β-carboxylate in the Glu-370 → Asp GCD from the α-carbon of 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA apparently alters the equilibrium for proton abstraction. The Glu-370 → Asp mutation results in a 90–95% decrease in kcat, depending on pH (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is similar to the reduction of kcat of the Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln dehydrogenases. Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln mutations affect proton abstraction from 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA but do not significantly alter the Kd values. Arg-94 may facilitate abstraction of the α-proton by neutralization of the negative charge of the γ-carboxylate, effectively decreasing the p Ka of the α-proton in the low dielectric of the active site. Arg-94 may also function to orient the substrate for efficient abstraction of the α-proton. Wild type GCD binds acetoacetyl-CoA with a submicromolar Kd and abstracts the α-proton of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA with formation of the enzyme-bound enolate (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The wild type dehydrogenase-enolate complex exhibited decreased absorbance at 447 nm due to perturbation of the flavin upon acetoacetyl-CoA binding, increased absorbance at 322 nm due to the enolate, and increased absorbance in the 550-nm region due to formation of the charge transfer complex between the enolate and electron-deficient oxidized flavin (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Titration of the Arg-94 → Gln GCD with acetoacetyl-CoA (Fig.2) yields results that are very similar to those obtained with wild type GCD (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Acetoacetyl-CoA, lacking the γ-carboxylate, would not be expected to require Arg-94 to facilitate deprotonation of an α-proton, for binding, or orientation of the ligand with respect to Glu-370. The Kd of the complex is 0.1 μm, and the stoichiometry of binding is 0.87 per mol of enzyme flavin. The values for wild type GCD are 0.4 and 0.90 μm in 50 mm potassium phosphate at the same pH (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E.

The three-dimensional structure of human GCD suggested that Arg-94 could play a role in the binding of glutaryl-CoA and glutaconyl-CoA in the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA catalyzed by the enzyme (2Lenich A.C. Goodman S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4090-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When glutaryl-CoA was modeled into the active site of the enzyme, the γ-carboxylate is within hydrogen bonding distance of the guanidinium group of Arg-94 (9Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany1999: 539-542Google Scholar). The possibilities were also considered that Arg-94 could stabilize a transition state involving developing a negative charge at the γ-carbon prior to decarboxylation or stabilize the intermediate crotonyl-CoA anion (9Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany1999: 539-542Google Scholar). The experiments presented here show that the major effect of substitution of Arg-94 by glycine or glutamine is on kcat of the mutant enzymes. Both mutant enzymes have about 2–3% residual activity with glutaryl-CoA as substrate, but have smaller effects on Km for glutaryl-CoA. It is reasonable to conclude that Arg-94 does not participate in stabilization of a decarboxylation transition state, because the decrease in kcat is at least an order of magnitude less than might be expected for such an effect. When decarboxylation does not enter steady-state turnover, as with hexanoyl-CoA and glutaramyl-CoA, substitution at position 94 has comparatively little effect on the steady-state kinetic constants of the enzyme. It is of interest that the dehydrogenating activity of GCD determined with hexanoyl-CoA is 2-fold greater than the turnover of glutaryl-CoA, although the chemical steps for α,β-dehydrogenation are essentially identical. We speculate that the greater intrinsic dehydrogenation activity with the alternate substrate indicates that decarboxylation is rate-limiting in the turnover of glutaryl-CoA. The decarboxylation of glutaconyl-CoA and complete turnover involves oxidation of the dehydrogenase flavin, decarboxylation, protonation of the crotonyl-CoA anion intermediate, and product dissociation. A likely function of Arg-94 is to effectively decrease the p Ka of the α-proton of glutaryl-CoA and 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA. The α-anions of glutaryl-CoA and 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA are in close proximity to the γ-carboxylates. Electrostatic stabilization would facilitate the formation of the α-anion in the low dielectric of the enzyme interior. This hypothesis is supported by kinetic data that show that substitution of Arg-94 has comparatively little effect on the steady-state kinetic constants of the mutant enzymes with alternative substrates that do not contain a γ-carboxylate group. In the same vein, the charge transfer complex between the 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA anion with the dehydrogenase flavin is not stabilized by the Arg-94 → Gly or Arg-94 → Gln mutants. In contrast, the Arg-94 → Gln mutant deprotonates acetoacetyl-CoA and stabilizes the enolate. Absence of the γ-carboxylate permits deprotonation of acetoacetyl-CoA in the absence of Arg-94. A second possible function of Arg-94 in GCD may be similar to that of the conserved arginine residue, Arg-120, in prostaglandin endoperoxidases 1 (PGHS-1) and the homologous Arg-106 in PGHS-2. The steady-state kinetic constants and structures of the two proteins are almost identical. The crystal structures of ovine PGHS-1 and human and murine PGHS-2 have been determined with substrate analogs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) bound in the active sites (26Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-120 alters the steady-state kinetic constants of the mutants, and additional kinetic analyses of human Arg-106 → Gln PGHS-2 with alternate fatty acid substrates suggested that Arg-106 might position the substrate for abstraction of the 13-pro-S-hydrogen (30Bhattacharyya D.K.

Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ratio of products of the Arg-120vGln and Arg-120 → Leu mutants of human PGHS-2 is altered so that Arg-106 appears to position arachidonate such that bis-oxygenation is favored over monooxygenation (31Rieke C.J. Mulichak A.M. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, Arg-402 has been proposed to function in the binding and positioning of arachidonate in human 15-lipoxygenase (32Gan Q.-F. Browner M.F. Sloane D.L. Sigal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25412-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the case of the Gln and Gly substitutions of Arg-94 in GCD, the Km values increase only 10- to 16-fold, respectively, and decreases in kcat/Km values of the mutant enzymes are dominated by the 50-fold decreases of kcat. The decreased kcatcould be due to the positioning of the substrate with respect to Glu-370, the catalytic base, or with respect to the flavin so that the efficiency of hydride transfer also decreases. Substitution of aspartate for Glu-370 in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase results in a similar decrease of kcat as that determined for the Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln mutants (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Dwyer et al. (7Dwyer T.M. Rao K.S. Goodman S.I. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11488-11499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) proposed that the decreased kcat of the Glu-370 → Asp is due to the unfavorable equilibrium of the abstraction of the α-proton based on similar studies with 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA. The binding of the non-oxidizable substrate analogs, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, support the idea that Arg-94 positions the substrate for efficient deprotonation. The Arg-94 → Gly and Arg-94 → Gln mutant proteins bind the non-oxidizable substrate analog, 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA, with affinity equal to the wild type, but abstraction of the α-proton is severely limited. A role in positioning the substrate for hydride transfer is more difficult to determine, because the initial step in the reaction pathway of the Glu-370 → Asp mutant is compromised. Also consistent with conclusions from kinetic data with alternative substrates, the binding and deprotonation of acetoacetyl-CoA by Arg-94 → Gln GCD is essentially unaffected by the mutation. The evidence for this is based on the appearance of the charge transfer complex when the enolate is formed on the enzyme. Finally, preliminary data indicates that oxidized human glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase has enoyl-CoA hydratase activity and hydrates glutaconyl-CoA, the tightly bound intermediate in the reductive half-reaction of the dehydrogenase flavin. 2J. B. Westover and F. E. Frerman, unpublished data. Paracoccus denitrificans GCD and pig kidney medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase also exhibit enoyl-CoA hydratase activity with crotonyl-CoA (6Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3691-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Lau S.-M. Powell P. Buettner H. Ghisla S. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4184-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hydratase activity of Arg-94 → Gln GCD with glutaconyl-CoA as substrate is reduced 30-fold. These data suggest that Arg-94 also positions glutaconyl-CoA for hydration in the active site of the dehydrogenase. To summarize, Arg-94 does not appear to play a major role in the binding of glutaryl-CoA and, probably, glutaconyl-CoA. Other residues in the active site and the presumed hydrogen bonds of the thioester oxygen with the 2′-hydroxyl of the FAD and peptide amide hydrogen of Glu-370 (9Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Goodman S.I. Biery B.J. Frerman F.E. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1999. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany1999: 539-542Google Scholar) apparently play more significant roles. The data can be interpreted to indicate that Arg-94 electrostatically facilitates deprotonation of substrate and 3-thiaglutaryl-CoA. Arg-94 may also function to orient the substrate to facilitate proton abstraction. It is not clear whether Arg-94 is required for positioning glutaryl-CoA for hydride transfer to the flavin or stabilization of the transient crotonyl-CoA anion."

Mismatch repair begins with the recognition of mismatched base pairs in DNA by MutS.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). These DNA lesions can result in mutations, genetic diseases, and tumors. To remove such lesions, all organisms have developed DNA repair systems. The mismatch repair (MMR)1 system is one of such repair systems and is conserved significantly throughout all organisms. In Escherichia coli, MutS, MutL, and MutH proteins are included in the MMR system (2Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The pathogenic genes of human hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer appear to share a high degree of homology (∼30%) with bacterial MutS and MutL (3Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 4Fishel R. Wilson T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, MutS homologues have also been isolated from plants (5Kevin M.C. John B.H. Culligan K.M. Hays J.B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the MMR system is essential for all living organisms from bacteria to eukaryotes. Recently, the three-dimensional structures of E. coli MutL and MutH have been reported, and the relationships between structures and functions have been addressed (6Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8Ban C. Junop M.

Eukaryotic MutS homologues have been found to bind to mismatched/looped out DNA (9Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

It has also been reported that E. coli MutS binds to mismatched DNA as a dimer, forming an α-shaped loop structure (13Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that this protein has two DNA-binding sites, one of which binds to mismatched DNA and the other to homoduplex DNA. There have been many studies exploring the DNA-binding region of MutS. A C-terminal mutant of Salmonella typhimurium MutS was found to have reduced affinity for heteroduplex DNA (14Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal region of hMSH2, a human MutS homologue, has been shown to be sufficient for binding to mismatches in DNA (15Whitehouse A. Deeble J. Taylor G.R. Guillou P.J. Phillips S.E. Meredith D.M. Markham A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a phenylalanine residue (Phe-39) in the N-terminal region of Thermus aquaticus MutS was found to be important for heteroduplex DNA binding (16Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have reported that the central region of Thermus thermophilus HB8 MutS binds homoduplex DNA (17Tachiki H. Kato R. Masui R. Hasegawa K. Itakura H. Fukuyama K. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, the N-terminal end and central regions of E. coli MutS were demonstrated to be required for binding of mismatched DNA (18Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5948-5952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Overproduced and purified MutS protein (91.4 kDa) from T. thermophilus HB8 possesses ATPase activity and binds specifically to mismatched DNA (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). T. thermophilus HB8 is an aerobic, rod-shaped, and non-sporulating Gram-negative eubacterium, which can grow at temperatures over 80 °C (20Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Generally, the proteins fromT. thermophilus are suitable material for structural and functional analyses because they are stable under a wide range of conditions (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S.

T. thermophilus MutS protein is stable from pH 1.5 to 12 at 25 °C and at a neutral pH up to 80 °C (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Results from protein denaturation and limited proteolysis experiments suggest that T. thermophilus MutS can be divided into three domains as follows: A (N terminus to residue 274), B (residues 275–570), and C (residue 571 to C terminus) (17Tachiki H. Kato R. Masui R. Hasegawa K. Itakura H. Fukuyama K. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the B domain interacts with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA); however, the assay system used in that study employed a mixture of all three domains. The functions of the other domains, A and C, have not been analyzed. To investigate these domains further, a more refined assay system was required. Truncated genes corresponding to the domains were designed based on the results of proteolytic analysis. Three truncated proteins corresponding to the A–C domains were overproduced in E. coli and purified. To analyze the functions of the individual domains, we assayed for MutS-MutS protein interaction, ATPase activity, and DNA-binding ability. The DNA binding activity of the B domain was confirmed in this study. The results also suggest that the MutS-MutS protein interaction site is located in the B domain, whereas the mismatched DNA-binding site, as well as the ATPase activity, is located in the C domain, and the ATPase site is also in the C domain. On the basis of these results, the relationships between the functions and the structures of MutS are discussed. E. coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) carrying either a pLysE or pLysS plasmid were cultured in Terrific or LB broth at 37 °C (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). DNA manipulation was performed using standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The enzymes and reagents used were purchased from the following sources: restriction enzymes from Toyobo, New England Biolabs, and Nippon Gene;Taq DNA polymerase from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were from ICN; plastic-backed polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets (MN-Polygram CEL200PEI/UV) were from Machery and Nagel; glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; and His-Bind resin was from Novagen. Factor Xa was kindly provided by Dr. Kato (National Cardiovascular Center, Japan). Plasmid pSS1, derived from a pET3a (Novagen), contains the complete T. thermophilus mutS gene under control of a T7 promoter (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET16b (Novagen), which is designed to add 10 His residues at the N terminus of a target protein, was used for overproduction of the N-terminal and central domains of MutS proteins. Plasmid pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to overexpress N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused C-terminal MutS. All the other chemicals and reagents used were obtained from commercial sources. DNA fragments expressing each domain of T. thermophilus MutS (Fig. 1) were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using pSS1 as a template. The following pairs of primers were used for amplification of each domain: 5′-AGAAAGCGCATATGGGGGGGTATGGCGGATGGCGGAGTTAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGGGTCTAGGGTTCAAAGACCTCGAGGG-3′ (A domain), 5′-CTCGAGGTCTTTGAACGCTAGCGTCGACATATGACCCTCTTTGGCGTTC-3′ and 5′-ACCGGATCCTACCCCGCCCTGATCCGAAGCC-3′ (B domain), and 5′-ACCCGGCCCCGCTTCGTTTAAAGATATCATATGAGGGCGGGGCGCCACC-3′ and 5′-GGGGGATCCTACCCCTTCATGCTACCCAGGG-3′ (C domain). All of the forward primers contained NdeI restriction sites at the first ATG codon (underlined). After subcloning into vectors, the nucleotide sequences of the amplified DNA fragments were confirmed by the dideoxy method (Applied Biosystems, Taq cycle sequencing system) using a model 373S ABI automated DNA sequencer. By using theNdeI restriction sites, the DNA fragments corresponding to the A and B domains were each ligated with pET16b, and the resulting plasmids were named pSS5A and pSS5B, respectively. The DNA fragment corresponding to the C domain was inserted into pGEX5X-1, and the resulting plasmid was named pSS2C. The His-tagged sequences and the GST-fused region were designed so that they could be cleaved from the domains by factor Xa protease. Full-length T. thermophilus MutS protein was prepared as described previously (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pSS5A and pSS5B transformants were induced as described previously except the hostE. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was used, instead of pLysE. The E. coli strain DH5α was transformed with pSS2C, and the resultant transformant was induced by isopropyl-β-d(−)-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Purification methods differed for each truncated protein. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C except for the heat treatment and the elution steps from the His-Bind resin (Novagen) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The A domain, which carries the N-terminal region of the protein, was purified according to the following procedure. Frozen cells (20 g) carrying pSS5A were suspended in 200 ml of Bind buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.9) and were disrupted by sonication on ice. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), and the cell extract was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. Following this, the cell lysate was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged (39,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the A domain protein was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Millex-GV, Millipore) and loaded onto a His-Bind resin column (bed volume 5 ml) that was equilibrated with Bind buffer. The column was subsequently washed with 50 ml of Bind buffer and 30 ml of Wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, pH 7.9), and eluted in four steps with 15 ml each of 100, 300, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole in Elute buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.9). The fraction containing the A domain protein was eluted with 300–500 mm imidazole. Ammonium sulfate was added to the sample to a final concentration of 30% saturation and loaded onto a phenyl-Toyopearl 650M (Tosoh) column (bed volume 70 ml) that was equilibrated with 30% saturated ammonium sulfate in buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5). The column was washed with 210 ml of the same buffer, after which the protein was eluted with 700 ml of a gradient of 30–0% saturated ammonium sulfate in buffer I. Fractions containing the protein were loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (bed volume of 450 ml) equilibrated with buffer I. The protein was eluted with buffer I. The protein fractions were collected, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. The amount of the purified A domain protein was 42 mg, and the yield was 2.1 mg of protein per 1 g wet cell. The A domain protein was designated as MutS-A. For purification of the B domain protein, which carries the central region of MutS, E. coli cells carrying pSS5B were induced by IPTG and harvested. Frozen cells (20 g) were disrupted and processed by the same method as described for the MutS-A without the 70 °C incubation. The B domain protein elution fractions from the His-Bind resin column, containing 300–500 mmimidazole, were dialyzed three times against buffer I and loaded onto a CM-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (bed volume of 40 ml) previously equilibrated with buffer I. The column was washed with 120 ml of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with 400 ml of 0–3 m NaCl gradient in buffer I. Fractions containing the B domain protein were collected and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300HR column. The protein fractions were collected and dialyzed three times against 10-fold volumes of buffer I. Because the purified B domain protein had a tendency to precipitate at concentrations higher than 10 μm, its concentration was kept below 10 μmduring purification and storage. The amount of the purified B domain protein was 10 mg, and the yield was 0.5 mg of protein per 1 g wet cells. The B domain protein was designated as MutS-B. To obtain purified the C domain protein, which is composed of the C-terminal domain, E. coli cells carrying pSS2C were induced by IPTG and harvested. Frozen cells (20 g) were suspended in 20 ml of PBS buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3). Lysozyme was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following this, 180 ml of PBS buffer was added to the solution, and the cells were disrupted by sonication on ice. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the cell extract was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C, and then was centrifuged (39,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, most of the C domain protein (about 70–80%) was found in the insoluble fraction; however, a considerable amount of protein remained in the supernatant. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Millex-GV, Millipore) and was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (bed volume 2 ml) that was equilibrated with PBS buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and the GST-fused C domain was then eluted with 10 ml of glutathione elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmglutathione, pH 8.0) at room temperature. The elution fractions containing the C domain protein were loaded onto a SuperQ-Toyopearl (Tosoh) column (bed volume of 10 ml) equilibrated with buffer I. The column was washed with 30 ml of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a 100-ml gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer I. Fractions containing the C domain protein were collected and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300HR column. The protein fractions were collected and dialyzed three times against 10-fold volumes of buffer I. The purified C domain protein also had tendency to precipitate at concentrations over 10 μm. Therefore, the concentration of the protein was kept below 10 μm during purification and storage. The amount of the purified C domain protein was 1.0 mg, and the yield was 0.05 mg of protein per 1 g wet cells. The GST-fused C domain protein was designated as GST-C. To remove the His tag or the GST region from the purified fused proteins, 100 μl of 10 μm fusion protein was incubated with 5 μl of 0.36 mg/ml factor Xa at 37 °C overnight. The factor Xa was removed from the reaction mixture by the following procedure. The reaction solution was loaded onto a Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with buffer I. Then the column was eluted with the same buffer at room temperature and at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified proteins with and without cleavage by factor Xa were confirmed by an automated protein sequencer (ABI, model 473A). The cleaved products from GST-C were designated as GST-N and MutS-C (Fig. 1). The molar extinction coefficients of each purified truncated protein were calculated to be 19,500 (MutS-A), 51,000 (MutS-B), and 23,400m−1 cm−1(GST-C), using a procedure described previously (29Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). CD measurements were carried out in a sample solution containing 50 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol, pH 7.5, and 1 μm of each protein using a 0.1-cm cell. The residue molar ellipticity [θ] was defined as 100 θobs(lc)−1, where θobs is the observed molar ellipticity; l is the length of the light path in centimeters, and c is the residue molar concentration of each protein. CD measurements were performed using a Jasco spectropolarimeter, model J-720W. In order to analyze the relationship between the apparent molecular mass and the protein concentration of full-length MutS, 50 μl of the protein sample at various concentrations was injected onto a Superdex 200HR column (inner diameter, 1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with buffer comprising of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The measurements were carried out at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the absorption was detected at 280 nm. The following proteins were used as molecular size markers: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.8 kDa). In order to measure the molecular mass of each truncated MutS protein, 100 μl of each purified protein (3 μm) was injected onto a Superdex 200HR column that was equilibrated with buffer I or buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). As the nonspecific interaction between the MutS-B and the column resin was rather strong, the measurement of MutS-B was carried out in the presence of 1 m NaCl. The following proteins were used as molecular size markers: phosphorylaseb (97 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.8 kDa). The ATPase activity of each protein was analyzed using a TLC method (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 1 μm of each protein, 1 mm[α-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 10 min and stopped by addition of 0.5% SDS. The samples were spotted on PEI cellulose sheets and eluted with 0.75 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.4. The sheets were placed in contact with an imaging plate, and the resultant hydrolyzed products were analyzed by using a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji photo film). Gel retardation assays using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A 37-mer oligonucleotide TAKA1, 5′-ATGTGAATCAGTATGGTTTCTATCTGCTGAAGGAAAT-3′, was synthesized, and its 5′ terminus was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP. This oligonucleotide was annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide TAKA2, 5′-ATTTCCTTCAGCAGATAGAAACCATACTGATTCACAT-3′, or to the single mismatched base oligonucleotide TAKA4, 5′-ATTTCCTTCAGCAGATAGGAACCATACTGATTCACAT-3′. DNA-protein interactions were measured using an SPR sensor system, BIAcore 1000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were immobilized on the surface of the streptavidin-coated sensor chips (SA5-chip, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the following method. One microliter of 5′-biotinylated TAKA1 (0.5 μm) oligonucleotide in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) was applied at a flow rate of 5 μl/min over the sensor chip at 25 °C. Following this, 10 μl of TAKA2 or TAKA4 (5 μm) oligonucleotide was applied over the TAKA1-immobilized sensor chip at the same flow rate to make double-stranded oligonucleotide probes. From the intensities of the resonance unit before and after the annealing of the second oligonucleotide, it was estimated that about 90% of the second oligonucleotide was annealed to the first oligonucleotide. After immobilization of the oligonucleotide, 30 μl of a solution containing 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, or 2.0 μm of each protein was applied at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C over flow cells in sensor chips, either without oligonucleotide, with TAKA1, with TAKA1-TAKA2, or with TAKA1-TAKA4. Overlay plots were drawn from the data obtained between 10 and 90 s after injection. The data were averaged and corrected by the blank controls, obtained with eluent buffer A and the sensor chip without DNA. Data calculation was carried out using the BIAevaluation software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with algorithms for numerical integration (30Rovert K. Anders F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Apparent rate constants (kobs) were plotted against protein concentration, and the association rate constants (kon) and dissociation rate constants (koff) were calculated from the slope and the intercept of these plots, respectively. The value of dissociation constant, Kd, was calculated from those ofkon and koff. As we have already shown, MutS protein can be divided into at least three domains based on the results of limited proteolysis and the denaturation (17Tachiki H. Kato R. Masui R. Hasegawa K. Itakura H. Fukuyama K. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the functions of each domain in more detail, truncated proteins that correspond to the proteolytic fragments were designed (Fig. 1). Each truncated gene was inserted into an expression vector for overexpression in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These proteins were designated MutS-A (A domain), MutS-B (B domain), and GST-C (C domain), respectively (Fig. 1). MutS-A and MutS-B contain a short His repeat on their N termini, and GST-C was constructed as a fusion protein with GST on the N terminus. MutS-A, MutS-B, and GST-C were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). GST-C could be cleaved by factor Xa protease into two products, GST-N (GST region) and MutS-C (C domain region) (Fig. 1). CD measurements in the region between 200 and 250 nm showed that the purified proteins were retained the secondary structures (Fig. 3). MutS-A, but not MutS-B or GST-C, was stable at temperatures up to 80 °C, similar to the full-lengthT. thermophilus MutS (data not shown). This suggests that the N-terminal region of MutS contributes to the stability of the full-length protein.Figure 3Far-UV CD spectra of truncated proteins.CD measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmdithioerythritol, pH 7.5, and 1 μm of each protein. The residue molar ellipticity [θ] was defined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, MutS-A; B,MutS-B; C, GST-C; and D, factor Xa-digested GST-C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously showed that the apparent molecular mass of T. thermophilus MutS at 86 μm was about 330 kDa, which corresponds to a trimer or tetramer (19Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). With T. aquaticus MutS, a similar apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa was reported by size-exclusion chromatography (16Malkov V.A. Biswas I. Camerini-Otero R.D. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23811-23817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Biswas I. Ban C. Fleming K.G. Qin J. Lary J.W. Yphantis D.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23673-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, by other physicochemical methods, the molecular mass was estimated to be about 180 kDa, which corresponds to a dimer (31Biswas I. Ban C. Fleming K.G. Qin J. Lary J.W. Yphantis D.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23673-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that E. coli MutS exists as mixture of dimers and higher order forms (32Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the oligomerization state of T. thermophilus MutS in more detail, size-exclusion chromatography experiments at various protein concentrations were carried out. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the apparent molecular mass of T. thermophilus MutS at lower concentrations (1 or 5 μm MutS) was estimated to be 220 kDa, which corresponds to a dimer. As the protein concentration increased, the apparent molecular mass increased to about 350 kDa. This suggests that the minimal unit of T. thermophilus MutS is a dimer. The highly oligomerized state of MutS at higher protein concentrations may have some physiological functions that need to be elucidated. In order to determine where the MutS-MutS interaction site is located, the molecular sizes of the truncated proteins in solution were measured using size-exclusion chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of MutS-A was calculated to be 30 kDa (Fig. 4 B, open circle), which is almost identical to the size predicted by the amino acid sequence (32.6 kDa). The MutS-B elu"
