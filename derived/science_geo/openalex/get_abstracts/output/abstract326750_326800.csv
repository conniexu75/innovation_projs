https://openalex.org/W2005127398,"Present anthropogenic emissions of CO are apparently large enough to perturb the natural CO-OH-CH4 cycle, which plays a crucial role in the self-cleansing processes in the troposphere. A significant increase in global concentrations of CO, CH4, CH3Cl, and other trace gases may result from a decrease in the OH concentration caused by continued CO emissions. Even if the CO emissions were maintained at the present rate, increases in CO and CH4 by the year 2025 might be as large as 50 and 25 percent, respectively. The time constants associated with the perturbations of the CO-OH-CH4 cycle are of the order of a few decades. Perturbation of this cycle may also indirectly affect stratospheric chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1992985732,"Carbonaceous shales of the late Precambrian Chuar Group of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, contain abundant and well-preserved chitinozoans. The occurrence of these distinctive, tear- and flask-shaped microfossils, the oldest chitinozoans now known and the first to be reported from the Precambrian, seems to suggest that heterotrophic protists (or primitive metaozoans) were extant at least as early as about 750 +/- 100 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2053256207,"It has long been thought that farming and herding were comparatively recent introductions into the Kalahari and that it has been a preserve of foraging ""Bushmen"" for thousands of years. Agropastoral Bantu-speakers were thought to have entered this region only within the last two centuries. However, fully developed pastoralism and metallurgy are now shown to have been established in the Kalahari from A.D. 500, with extensive grain agriculture and intracontinental trade added by A.D. 800. Archeological, linguistic, and historical evidence delineates the continuation of mixed economies in the region into the present. Consequences of this revised view for anthropological theory and for policy planning concerning contemporary Kalahari peoples are indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2089003492,Hatchling green iguanas (Iguana iguana) emerge from the ground in small groups in a communal nesting area on a small Panamanian islet and engage in complex social interactions. Iguanas from different clutches often join together before and during departure from the nest site. They also usually move around the islet and migrate from it to the larger adjacent landmass in social groups. These and other observations indicate that the sophistication of saurian social organization and neonate behavior has been underestimated.
https://openalex.org/W1967358227,"Electron-transparent sections of the Allende meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite, have been prepared by ion-thinning and examined by high-voltage (800-kilovolt) transmission electron microscopy. The matrix crystals, mainly olivine, range in size from approximately 5 to approximately 0.01 micrometers; carbon is present as intergranular films of poorly crystalline graphite. The chondrules exhibit extensive radiation damage, a feature lacking in the matrix. In addition, both chondrules and matrix are undeformed and contain negative crystals; submicroscopic exsolution lamellae are present in pyroxenes. Comparison of the substructure in the Allende meteorite with that in the Parnallee meteorite and in lunar and selected terrestrial rocks leads to the conclusion that chondrule irradiation preceded cold accretion during formation of the solar system and that the meteorite has since been undisturbed."
https://openalex.org/W1973074314,"Queens of Lasioglossum zephyrum, a primitively eusocial bee, are considerably more active than workers. The queen's behavior stimulates worker activities; removal of the queen results in a marked reduction in activities of other bees. The queen not only activates workers but also directs them by a primitive recruitment behavior suggestive of tandem running of highly eusocial ants."
https://openalex.org/W2019665968,"Field studies of releases and recaptures of diurnal moths painted with yellow to resemble the edible tiger swallowtail and of black moths that resemble a toxic species of swallowtail produced these results: (i) A greater proportion of the black moths were recaptured; (ii) daily trapping for a week after each release showed that the black moths survived longer than the yellow-painted moths; (iii) an analysis of wing injuries shows that most attacks can be attributed to birds and that the yellow-painted moths were attacked more often, more vigorously, or more persistently than the black moths. These results are interpreted as showing a greater predation pressure on the yellow-painted than on the black moths and, therefore, as confirming the Batesian theory of mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W1972701972,"Early angiosperm leaves from the Aptian (113 to 119 million years ago) Baquer√≥ Formation of Patagonia have been found in a fossil flora dominated by more than 100 species of gymnosperms and pteridophytes. They may be the first early Cretaceous angiosperm leaves to be reported from southern South America and one of the few reported in the Southern Hemisphere. The leaves are large, lobate, craspedodromous, and dentate (A-1 teeth) and have ramified tertiary veins and random fourth-order venation. Several of these features have been found in coeval and younger strata elsewhere, but not in the same combination. They were probably a marginal component of the flora."
https://openalex.org/W1965880964,The sulfur found in coal stems in large part from sulfur incorporation at the peat-forming stage. Ester sulfate (a carbon-oxygen-sulfur linkage) is a major contributor to the sulfur in peat and thus is an important determiner of the quantity and forms of sulfur eventually found in coal.
https://openalex.org/W2045521925,"Goldfish (N = 408) spontaneously swam against flowing water into a calm-water well. After a single trial punished by brief electric shock, the fish avoided the well, as indexed by increased latencies of reentry. Avoidance declined during the first minute after shock, then rose to a peak 1 hour later. The biphasic time course is compatible with the two-store theory of memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2041080582,"At the end of the North American Pleistocene, birds and mammals suffered comparable degrees of generic extinction. Both the magnitude and pattern of avian extinction are incompatible with the hypothesis that humans played a major role in causing the demise of numerous North American mammalian genera at this time."
https://openalex.org/W1987550055,"The species Magicicada septendecim and Magicicada cassini of the 17-year cicada produce sound by sequentially buckling a series of stiff ribs embedded in a flexible tymbal. Each such collapse excites a damped oscillation in a resonant cavity. By this means the cavity (an abdominal air sac) is excited 10 to 12 times per muscle contraction, which permits a normal muscle to perform a task requiring very rapid repetitive activity."

A seasonal trend in color suggests that Neptune, like Uranus, may have a slightly reddened pole."
https://openalex.org/W2052407266,An irradiation of 3 x 1017 neutrons per square centimeter in a reactor core produced an increase in the coercive force of iron and kamacite of 16 to 21 percent. The alternating-current demagnetization spectrum of saturation isothermal remanence was shifted toward higher coercive forces. Similar neutron fluences produced by cosmic-ray exposure may be capable of converting soft isothermal remanence in meteorites and lunar samples to remanence with a higher coercive force.
https://openalex.org/W1964033787,"beta-Glucan synthesis from uridine diphosphoglucose by pea epicotyl tissue slices is increased two- to threefold by preliminary, short-term treatment with cellulases purified from auxin-treated peas. We suggest that cellulases introduce chain ends in accessible regions of cellulose microfibrils which then act as primers for chain elongation."

https://openalex.org/W1973895423,"An experiment has been performed in interplanetary space which closely simulates the observations that would be madef by an ultraviolet spectrometer observing the atmospheres of the jovian planets. A mixture of ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen was released from the Mariner spacecraft, and spectra were recorded while these gases were illuminated by sunlight. The principal emissions observed were the HI 1216-angstrom Lyman-alpha line, the H(2) B-X Lyman bands, and the NH c-a and A-X bands."

https://openalex.org/W2087204440,"Low world oil prices represent a serious threat to expanded commercial development of the Canadian oil sands in the near term, as they do to all of the higher cost alternatives to crude oil such as oil shales and coal liquefaction. Nonetheless, research and field testing of new technology for production of oil from oil sands are being pursued by industry and government in Alberta. New production technology is being developed in Canada to produce synthetic oil from the vast resources of bitumen trapped in the oil sands and bituminous carbonates of northern Alberta. This technology includes improved methods of mining, extraction, and upgrading of bitumen from near-surface deposits as well as new drilling and production techniques for thermal production of bitumen from the more deeply buried reservoirs. Of particular interest are the cluster drilling methods designed to reduce surface disturbance and the techniques for horizontal drilling of wells from underground tunnels to increase the contact of injection fluids with the reservoir."
