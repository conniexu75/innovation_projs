https://openalex.org/W2084506573,"The fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt) is a transmembrane receptor in the tyrosine kinase family. Expression of flt complementary DNA in COS cells conferred specific, high-affinity binding of vascular endothelial growth factor, also known as vascular permeability factor (VEGF-VPF), a factor that induces vascular permeability when injected in the guinea pig skin and stimulates endothelial cell proliferation. Expression of Flt in Xenopus laevis oocytes caused the oocytes to release calcium in response to VEGF-VPF. These findings show that flt encodes a receptor for VEGF-VPF."

https://openalex.org/W1978798502,"p21c-ras plays a critical role in mediating tyrosine kinase-stimulated cell growth and differentiation. However, the pathways through which p21c-ras propagates these signals remain unknown. We report that in PC12 cells, expression of a dominant inhibitory mutant of ras, c-Ha-ras(Asn-17), antagonizes growth factor- and phorbol ester-induced activation of the erk-encoded family of MAP kinases, the 85-92 kd RSKs, and the kinase(s) responsible for hyperphosphorylation of the proto-oncogene product Raf-1. In addition, we find that expression of the activated ras oncogene is sufficient to stimulate these events. These data indicate that ras mediates nerve growth factor receptor and protein kinase C modulation of MAP kinases, RSKs, and Raf-1."
https://openalex.org/W1598875012,"Structural mitochondrial damage accompanies the cytotoxic effects of several drugs including tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Using various inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport we have investigated the mechanism of TNF-mediated cytotoxicity in L929 and WEHI 164 clone 13 mouse fibrosarcoma cells. Inhibitors with different sites of action modulated TNF cytotoxicity, however, with contrasting effects on final cell viability. Inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport at complex III (cytochrome c reductase) by antimycin A resulted in a marked potentiation of TNF-mediated injury. In contrast, when the electron flow to ubiquinone was blocked, either at complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) with amytal or at complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) with thenoyltrifluoroacetone, cells were markedly protected against TNF cytotoxicity. Neither uncouplers nor inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation nor complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) inhibitors significantly interfered with TNF-mediated effects, ruling out the involvement of energy-coupled phenomena. In addition, the toxic effects of TNF were counteracted by the addition of antioxidants and iron chelators. Furthermore, we analyzed the direct effect of TNF on mitochondrial morphology and functions. Treatment of L929 cells with TNF led to an early degeneration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure without any pronounced damage of other cellular organelles. Analysis of the mitochondrial electron flow revealed that TNF treatment led to a rapid inhibition of the mitochondria to oxidize succinate and NADH-linked substrates. The inhibition of electron transport was dose-dependent and became readily detectable 60 min after the start of TNF treatment, thus preceding the onset of cell death by at least 3-6 h. In contrast, only minor effects were observed on complex IV activity. The different effects observed with the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors provide suggestive evidence that mitochondrial production of oxygen radicals mainly generated at the ubisemiquinone site is a causal mechanism of TNF cytotoxicity. This conclusion is further supported by the protective effect of antioxidants as well as the selective pattern of damage of mitochondrial chain components and characteristic alterations of the mitochondrial ultrastructure."

https://openalex.org/W2069132844,"Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) induces a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins. Expression of a dominant inhibitory Ras mutant specifically blocked NGF- and TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins of approximately 42 and 44 kd. Conversely, expression of an oncogenic variant of Ras induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the same 42 and 44 kd proteins. The 44 kd protein was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the 42 kd protein comigrated with a 42 kd MAPK, indicating that at least one and probably both Ras-regulated phosphoproteins are MAPKs. In addition, MAPK activation, as measured by in vitro phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, was also regulated by Ras. Ras was not required for NGF-induced activation of Trk or tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1. Thus, NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation occurs both prior to and following Ras action, and Ras plays a critical role in the NGF- and TPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs."

The resulting glasses allowed transport of small molecules into and out of the glasses at reasonable rates but nevertheless retained the protein molecules within their pores. Chemical reactions of the immobilized proteins could be monitored by means of changes in their visible absorption spectra. Silica glasses containing the immobilized proteins were observed to have similar reactivities and spectroscopic properties to those found for the proteins in solution. For example, encapsulated CuZnSOD was demetallated and remetallated, encapsulated ferricytochrome c was reduced and then reoxidized, and encapsulated met Mb was reduced to deoxy Mb and then reacted either with dioxygen to make oxy Mb or with carbon monoxide to make carbonyl Mb."

https://openalex.org/W1520176015,"A sphingomyelin cycle has been identified whereby the action of certain extracellular agents results in reversible sphingomyelin hydrolysis and the concomitant generation of ceramide. Moreover, a cell-permeable ceramide, C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine), is a potent modulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. We report herein that C2-ceramide, C6-ceramide, and natural ceramides activate a cytosolic serine/threonine protein phosphatase in a dose-dependent manner. Initial activation is observed at concentrations of ceramide as low as 0.1 microM with peak response occurring at 5-10 microM. However, other closely related sphingolipids, sphingosine and sphingomyelin, were largely inactive. Ceramide-stimulated phosphatase was inhibited by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, with an IC50 of 0.1-1 nM, depending on the concentration of ceramide. Ceramide-stimulated phosphatase was insensitive to Mg2+ and Mn2+ cations. Using sequential anion exchange chromatography, ceramide-stimulated phosphatase activity could be resolved from ceramide-nonresponsive phosphatases. The activity of partially purified enzyme was stimulated 3.5-fold by ceramide. The identification of a phosphatase as a molecular target for the action of ceramide defines a novel intracellular signaling pathway with potential roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1515371688,"Several enzymes involved in the phosphoinositide metabolism have been shown to be present in nuclei of rat liver and Friend cells. In this paper we demonstrate that nuclear matrices of mouse NIH 3T3-fibroblasts and rat liver cells, isolated by nuclease treatment and high salt extraction, contain phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PdtIns 4-kinase), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase), diacylglycerol kinase, and phospholipase C. By a selective extraction the nucleus can be dissected in the peripheral matrix (lamina-pore complex) and the internal matrix as shown by using marker antibodies. Surprisingly, PtdIns 4-kinase was found exclusively in the peripheral nuclear matrix, whereas PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase was found to be associated to internal matrix structures. Diacylglycerol kinase and phospholipase C activities were also preferentially detected in the internal matrix. These data demonstrate a differential localization of the phosphoinositide kinases in the nucleus and suggest that the phosphoinositide metabolism may play a specific role in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1551967741,"Unlike glucose transport, where translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane is the principal mechanism underlying insulin stimulation, no consensus exists presently for the mechanism by which insulin activates the Na+/K(+)-ATPase. We have investigated (i) the subunit isoforms expressed and (ii) the effect of insulin on the subcellular distribution of the alpha beta isoforms of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase in plasma membranes (PM) and internal membranes (IM) from rat skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis, using isoform-specific antibodies to the various subunits of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase, revealed that skeletal muscle PM contains the alpha 1 and alpha 2 catalytic subunits and the beta 1 and beta 2 subunits of the Na+ pump. Skeletal muscle IM were enriched in alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2; alpha 1 was barely detectable in this fraction. After insulin treatment, alpha 2 content in the PM increased, with a parallel decrease in its abundance in the IM pool; insulin did not have any effect on alpha 1 isoform amount or subcellular distribution. The beta 1 subunit, but not beta 2, was also elevated in the PM after insulin treatment, but this increase originated from a sucrose gradient fraction different from that of the alpha 2 subunit. Our findings suggest that insulin induces an isoform-specific translocation of Na+ pump subunits from different intracellular sources to the PM and that the hormone-responsive enzyme in rat skeletal muscle is an alpha 2:beta 1 dimer."

In human cells, both cyclin A and the cdk2 protein kinase were found in complexes with E2F. Although the total amounts of cdk2 were constant in the cell cycle, binding to E2F was detected only when cells entered S phase, a time when the cdk2 kinase is activated. These data suggest that the interaction between cdk2 and E2F requires an active kinase that has cyclin A as a targeting component."

In the human HT-29 epithelial cell line, polymeric IgA (pIgA) specific for EBV promoted infection of the otherwise refractory epithelial cells. When bound to pIgA, EBV entered epithelial cells through secretory component-mediated IgA transport but no longer infected B lymphocytes. Such an immune-induced shift in EBV tissue tropism provides a paradigm for endogenous spread of EBV in the immune host that predicts infectious sequelae of epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2049513959,"In anterior pituitary cells, dopamine, acting on D2 dopamine receptors, concomitantly reduces calcium currents and increases potassium currents. These dopamine effects require the presence of intracellular GTP and are blocked by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting that one or more G protein is involved. To identify the G proteins involved in coupling D2 receptors to these currents, we performed patch-clamp recordings in the whole-cell configuration using pipettes containing affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies raised against either Go alpha, Gi3 alpha, or Gi1,2 alpha. Dialysis with Go alpha antiserum significantly reduced the inhibition of calcium currents induced by dopamine, while increase of potassium currents was markedly attenuated only by Gi3 alpha antiserum. We therefore conclude that in pituitary cells, two different G proteins are involved in the signal transduction mechanism that links D2 receptor activation to a specific modulation of the four types of ionic channels studied here."

https://openalex.org/W2092509527,"A class of regulators of eukaryotic gene expression contains a conserved amino acid sequence responsible for protein oligomerization and binding to DNA. This structure consists of an arginine- and lysine-rich basic region followed by a helix-loop-helix motif, which together mediate specific binding to DNA. Peptides were prepared that span this motif in the MyoD protein; in solution, they formed α-helical dimers and tetramers. They bound to DNA as dimers and their α-helical content increased on binding. Parallel and antiparallel four-helix models of the DNA-bound dimer were constructed. Peptides containing disulfide bonds were engineered to test the correctness of the two models. A disulfide that is compatible with the parallel model promotes specific interaction with DNA, whereas a disulfide compatible with the antiparallel model abolishes specific binding. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of nitroxide-labeled peptides provided intersubunit distance measurements that also supported the parallel model."

https://openalex.org/W2044885256,"We have investigated the possible role of synapsin I, a nerve terminal-specific protein, in the maturation of neuromuscular synapses in Xenopus cell cultures. Purified synapsin I was loaded into embryonic spinal neurons by injection of the protein into one of the early blastomeres of a Xenopus embryo. At synapses made by synapsin I-loaded neurons, spontaneous synaptic currents occurred with higher frequency and amplitude, and the amplitude exhibited an earlier appearance of a bell-shaped distribution. These characteristics are indicative of more mature quantal secretion. Impulse-evoked synaptic currents also showed a significant increase in amplitude. Using cell manipulation techniques, enhanced transmitter release from synapsin I-loaded neurons was shown to occur at the onset of synaptogenesis, suggesting a presynaptic developmental action of synapsin I prior to synaptic contact. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous synapsin I may participate in the functional maturation of synapses."

Using these analogs, the Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity media were also synthesized (Hirata, M., Watanabe, Y., Ishimatsu, T., Yanaga, F., Koga, T., and Ozaki, S. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 168, 379-386). When the cytosol fraction from the rat brain was applied to an Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity column, an eluate with a 2 M NaCl solution was found to have remarkable Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding activity. The active fraction was further fractionated with gel filtration chromatography, and two proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 130 or 85 kDa were found to be Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding proteins but with no Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolizing activities. Partial amino acid sequences determined after proteolysis and reversed-phase chromatography revealed that the protein with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa is the delta-isozyme of phospholipase C and that of 130 kDa has no sequence the same as the Ins(1,4,5)P3-recognizing proteins hitherto examined. Ins(1,4,5)P3 at concentrations greater than 1 microM strongly inhibited 85-kDa phospholipase C delta activity, without changing its dependence on the concentrations of free Ca2+ and H+. Among inositol phosphates examined, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibited the binding of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 to the 130-kDa protein at much the same concentrations as seen with Ins(1,4,5)P3. This report seems to be the first evidence for the presence of soluble Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding proteins in the rat brain, one of which is the delta isozyme of phospholipase C."

https://openalex.org/W1480970818,"Human neutrophils use the H2O2-myeloperoxidase-chloride system to generate chlorinated oxidants capable of activating metalloproteinase zymogens that hydrolyze not only native and denatured collagens, but also the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1 PI). To identify the metalloenzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates alpha 1 PI, neutrophil releasates were chromatographed over gelatin-Sepharose and divided into fractions containing either progelatinase or procollagenase. The gelatinase-containing fraction cleaved alpha 1 PI in a manner inhibitable by native type V, but not type I, collagen. Conversely, while the collagenase-containing fraction also cleaved alpha 1 PI, this activity was inhibited by type I, but not type V, collagen. Because type I and V collagens are competitive substrates for collagenase and gelatinase, respectively, each of the metalloproteinase zymogens were purified to apparent homogeneity and examined for alpha 1 PI-hydrolytic activities. Both purified gelatinase and collagenase inactivated alpha 1PI by hydrolyzing the serpin within its active-site loop at the Phe352-Leu353 and Pro357-Met358 bonds, albeit with distinct kinetic properties. Furthermore, purified collagenase, but not gelatinase, cleaved a second serpin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, by hydrolyzing the Ala362-Leu363 bond within its active-site loop. These data demonstrate that human neutrophils use chlorinated oxidants to activate collagenolytic metalloproteinases whose substrate specificities can be extended to members of the serpin superfamily."

https://openalex.org/W1528969049,"When growing in a sodium-rich environment, wild-type Enterococcus hirae extrudes sodium by two mechanisms, ATP-driven sodium extrusion, and NaH-antiport. Mutant 7683 is unable to grow on sodium-rich media. This is due to two mutations, one inactivating ATP-driven sodium transport and a second rendering NaH-antiport inoperative. 7683 was transformed by electroporation with a gene bank, derived from E. hirae, in an Escherichia coli-E. hirae shuttle vector. Transformants which had regained the ability to grow on sodium-rich media were selected for and the transforming plasmids analyzed. A gene able to restore NaH-antiport activity in 7683 was identified. This gene was named napA. It codes for an extremely hydrophobic protein of 383 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis of this protein indicates that it probably forms 12 transmembraneous helices. In a mutant, possessing only the NaH-antiporter, the napA gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. The resultant strain failed to grow in sodium-rich media, and vesicles isolated from these cells exhibited a defect in sodium proton antiport activity. We conclude that the napA gene codes for a NaH-antiporter. The NapA protein does not exhibit significant homology to any protein in the EMBL genetic data bank."
https://openalex.org/W1657721555,"Abstract The effective resolution of human platelet cytosolic phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PLC) revealed five distinct activity peaks by Q-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose column chromatographies when assayed using phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The results of Western blotting analysis with various antibodies against PLC isozymes showed that peak-Ia (PLC-delta type), peak-Ib (PLC-gamma 1 type), and peak-IIc (PLC-beta type) and two unidentified activity peaks (PLC-IIa and PLC-IIb) were present in human platelet cytosol. A protein with guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-binding activity was coeluted with the PLC-IIa and was purified to homogeneity. It exhibited 86- and 42-kDa polypeptide bands upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which were identified as and actin by immunostaining, respectively. Large amounts of gelsolin/actin (1:1) gelsolin complex were detected in the PLC-delta and PLC-gamma 1 fractions. The PLC-gamma 1 and the were co-immunoprecipitated by the antibody raised against PLC-gamma 1. Furthermore, the partially purified bovine brain PLC-gamma 1 fraction also was found to be associated with the and the association was released by the addition of 1% sodium cholate. This finding has prompted us to examine effects of the and the free on activities of the above PLC isoforms from platelet cytosol. The did not affect the PIP2 hydrolyzing activities of all PLC isoforms. In contrast, the purified inhibited distinctly PIP2 hydrolyses by PLC-Ia (delta), PLC-Ib (gamma 1), and PLC-IIa (unidentified), whereas the inhibitory effects for PLC-IIb (unidentified) and PLC-IIc (beta) were moderate. The inhibitory effect of on PIP2-hydrolysis by PLC-gamma 1 was diminished by a large amount of PIP2 substrate. These results suggested that the inhibition of PLC by is due to sequestration of substrate PIP2 by its competitive binding."

https://openalex.org/W1597311448,"The location of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells made deficient in phosphatidylcholine was determined by immunofluorescence techniques. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 17 amino acid residues of rat liver cytidylyltransferase. The antibody recognized both native and denatured cytidylyltransferase from both rat liver and CHO cells. CHO cells were treated with phospholipase C to alter the lipid composition of the plasma membrane and to elicit translocation of cytidylyltransferase from the less active soluble pool to an activated membrane fraction. Visualization of cytidylyltransferase by indirect immunofluorescence revealed staining of the nuclear envelope in phospholipase C-treated cells but not in untreated cells. CHO cells were also starved for choline and supplemented with a choline analogue to provide an alternative technique of rendering the cells phosphatidylcholine-deficient. Although this treatment should affect different cellular membranes than those affected by phospholipase C treatment, cytidylyltransferase still translocated to the nuclear envelope, as shown by indirect immunofluorescence. These results indicate that activated, membrane-bound cytidylyltransferase is associated with the nuclear membrane and suggest that the nuclear membrane may be a site of de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2011624846,The phage Mu transpositional enhancer has been previously shown to stimulate the initial rate of the Mu DNA strand transfer reaction by a factor of 100. We now show that the Mu enhancer can function in trans on an unlinked DNA molecule. This activity is greatly facilitated by the presence of a free DNA end proximal to the enhancer element. Function of the enhancer in trans does not alter either the requirement for donor DNA supercoiling or for the two Mu ends to be in their proper orientation on the donor plasmid. An important consequence of these findings is that we have been able to evaluate directly the step in the transposition reaction for which the enhancer is required. We show that the role of the enhancer is limited to promoting productive synapsis; efficient strand cleavage can occur in the absence of the enhancer.

https://openalex.org/W1482241944,"A large number of mammalian proteins are anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Biosynthetic intermediates of the GPI anchor have been identified in mammalian cells. The early GPI precursors are sensitive to phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PLC). However, all of the later GPI precursors, which contain 1 or more mannose residues, are PI-PLC-resistant, suggesting that there is another unidentified precursor. Here, we report the identification of this missing link. This GPI precursor can only be labeled with glucosamine and inositol, and is resistant to PI-PLC but sensitive to GPI-phospholipase D. It accumulates in large quantity only in mutants which are defective in the addition of the first mannose residue to the elongating GPI core. Thus, fatty acylation of glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol, to render it PI-PLC-resistant, is an obligatory step in the biosynthesis of mammalian GPI anchor precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1492449638,"Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which develop hypertension approximately 10 weeks after birth, are considered to provide a good animal model for human essential hypertension. We report here that the abnormal activation of phospholipase C delta 1 (PLC-delta 1) may be one of the main causes of hypertension. Levels of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol are found to be higher in the aortas of 12-week-old SHR than in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), although the levels in the aortas of 7-week-old SHR, which have normal blood pressure, are the same as in WKY. Moreover, PLC activity is also higher in the aortas of 12-week-old SHR. Judging from Western blot analysis and immunoabsorption of PLCs, this activation is found to be due to that of PLC-delta 1. PLC-delta 1 from rat aorta is expressed significantly from 7 to 12 weeks, which correlates with the development of hypertension in SHR. The activity of PLC-delta 1 in the aortas of 12-week-old SHR is more markedly activated at low Ca2+ concentration than that of age-matched WKY. These results suggest that the abnormal enhancement of PLC-delta 1 activity is responsible for accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to continuous hypertonicity of vascular smooth muscle in SHR. The activity of PLC-delta 1 in the aortas of 12-week-old SHR is significantly higher at low Ca2+ concentration than that of normotensive WKY."

Furthermore, the capacity of the RecB protein to support ATP hydrolysis varies with the structure and length of the DNA cofactor. Single-stranded linear and circular DNA are markedly better in promoting ATP hydrolysis than duplex DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1495162093,"Recent data suggest that rat liver peroxisomes play a critical role in cholesterol synthesis. Specifically, peroxisomes contain a number of enzymes required for cholesterol synthesis as well as sterol carrier protein-2. Furthermore, peroxisomes are involved in the in vitro synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonate and contain significant levels of apolipoprotein E, a major constituent of several classes of plasma lipoproteins. In this study we have investigated the subcellular localization of mevalonate kinase (EC 2.7.1.36; ATP:mevalonate-5-phosphotransferase). Mevalonate kinase is believed to be a cytosolic enzyme and catalyzes the phosphorylation of mevalonate to form mevalonate 5-phosphate. Mevalonate kinase has been purified from rat liver cytosol and a cDNA clone coding for rat mevalonate kinase has also been isolated and characterized. In this study, utilizing monoclonal antibodies made against the purified rat mevalonate kinase, we demonstrate the presence of mevalonate kinase in rat liver peroxisomes and in the cytosol. Each of these compartments contained a different form of the protein. The pI and the Mr of the peroxisomal protein is 6.2 and 42,000, respectively. The pI and Mr of the cytosolic protein is 6.9 and 40,000, respectively. The peroxisomal protein was also significantly induced by a number of different hypolipidemic drugs. In addition, we present evidence for the unexpected finding that the purified mevalonate kinase (isolated from the cytosol and assumed to be a cytosolic protein) is actually a peroxisomal protein."
https://openalex.org/W1511620065,"We report here the molecular characterization of a recombinant cell line (293-STaR) expressing the heat-stable enterotoxin receptor (STaR) from human intestine. We have compared the 293-STaR cell line with the human colonic cell line T84 that endogenously expresses STa binding sites. Scatchard analysis of displacement binding studies revealed a single STa binding site with an affinity (Ki) of 97 pM in 293-STaR compared with 55 pM in T84 cells. Saturation isotherms of STa binding gave a Kd of 94 pM for the cloned receptor expressed in 293 cells and 166 pM for the receptor present in T84 cells. Kinetic measurements of STa binding to 293-STaR gave an association rate constant, K1, of 2.4 x 10(8) M-1 min-1 and a dissociation rate constant, K2, of 0.016 min-1. The half-time of dissociation was 43 min, and the Kd calculated from the ratio of the kinetic constants was 67 pM. The pH profile of STa binding showed that the number of STa binding sites is increased 3-fold at pH 4.0 compared with pH 7.0, with no effect on binding affinity. A polyclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of STaR immunoprecipitated two proteins of approximately 140 and 160 kDa from both 293-STaR and T84 cells. Cross-linking of 125I-STa to 293-STaR cells resulted in the labeling of proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 153, 133, 81, 68, 56, and 49 kDa, the two smallest being the more abundant. Similar results have been reported for the STaR present on rat brush border membranes. These data suggest that the STaR-guanylyl cyclase identified by molecular cloning is the only receptor for STa present in T84 cells."

To begin determining the structural basis for this property, we have isolated a cDNA encoding the predominant reticulocyte isoform of the E2 from a rabbit skeletal muscle library. The sequence predicts a protein of 152 amino acids with a molecular weight of 17,293. Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli and purification of the recombinant protein revealed an E2 with high affinity for E3 and ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1). The latter high affinity interaction appears to be between the ubiquitin charged form of E1 and the uncharged form of E2 and does not result in a stable complex between these two enzymes. The predicted sequence shows regions of strong homology with other sequenced E2s, suggesting that these regions may be involved in binding to E1 and/or in ubiquitin transfer from E1, functions common to all E2s. Surprisingly, the E2(14k)) sequence is markedly more similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 (69% identity) than to its proposed homologs UBC4/UBC5 (38% identity). The sequence is identical to that recently reported for a human 17-kDa E2 which can complement rad6 mutants thereby identifying rabbit E2(14k) as a RAD6 homologue. The biochemical properties of this previously uncharacterized human 17-kDa E2 are now defined and its misassignment as a homologue of rabbit E2(17k) is corrected. Our findings resolve current confusion regarding relationships among E2s and define yeast RAD6, rabbit E2(14k), and the human 17-kDa E2 as a subclass of E2s which biochemically support E3-mediated conjugation and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and physiologically play a role in DNA repair."

The complex impeded the unwinding activities of all tested helicases in a specific orientation, with the same polarity observed in case of blockage of a replication fork, and, as a result, there was a block of SV40 DNA replication in both crude and purified enzyme systems in vitro. As the specificity in polarity of inhibition extends to heterologous systems, there may be common structure/mechanism features in helicases."

Neutrophil oxidants, however, can cause significant host tissue destruction (Weiss, S. J. (1989) N. Engl. J. Med. 320, 365-376), and the regulation of free radical production is not well understood. We have previously shown that recombinant antichymotrypsin (rACT), a serine protease inhibitor, inhibits superoxide production in intact neutrophils (Kilpatrick, L., Johnson, J. L., Nickbarg, E. B., Wang, Z., Clifford, T. F., Banach, M., Cooperman, B. S., Douglas, S. D., and Rubin, H. (1991) J. Immunol. 146, 2388-2393). Using a cell-free NADPH oxidase preparation, we now demonstrate that rACT alone has no effect on superoxide production and that antichymotrypsin-chymotrypsin (rACT.CT) complexes are required to inhibit superoxide, suggesting that neutrophil chymotrypsin-like proteases produce conformational changes in ACT, allowing it to become active in regulating superoxide production. Additionally, we have identified NADPH oxidase itself as the target for rACT.CT and have demonstrated that rACT.CT interferes specifically with activation of the NADPH oxidase without changing the Km for NADPH or the rate constant describing the rate-limiting step in activation. These observations suggest an important role for antichymotrypsin in the regulation of NADPH-oxidase activation, which is a prerequisite for neutrophil superoxide production, and predict possible therapeutic uses for rACT in conditions where unregulated neutrophil-free radical production has been implicated in the mechanism of tissue destruction."

https://openalex.org/W1541178199,"A conformational distortion in the DNA duplex at the regulatory region of human papillomavirus type-11 next to an intermolecular triplex, formed with a synthetic oligonucleotide, was investigated with several chemical probes. The sequence targeted for triplex formation borders on the binding sites for the regulatory proteins encoded by the viral E2 open reading frame. Dimethyl sulfate, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and OsO4 all react to a greater extent with nucleotides in the duplex that are immediately adjacent to the triplex as compared to other bases throughout the duplex. This hypermodification was observed on both the polypurine and polypyrimidine strands of the duplex DNA. Similar hyperreactivity of bases flanking a triplex also was seen when the contiguous target polypurine tract was effectively extended by mutating interrupting pyrimidines in the human papillomavirus type-11 sequence to purines. We propose that this hyperreactivity is due to a structural distortion caused by the junction between the triplex and the duplex tracts."

https://openalex.org/W1482107161,"Transformed Syrian hamster embryo (NQT-SHE) fibroblasts do not synthesize the pro-alpha 1 subunit of type I procollagen, but secrete two modified forms of the pro-alpha 2(I) subunit that migrate more slowly than the normal chain during gel electrophoresis (Peterkofsky, B., and Prather, W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16818-16826). By electrophoretic analysis of cyanogen bromide and V8 protease-derived peptides from the collagenous domains of intra- and extracellular pro-alpha 2(I) chains, we find that the modification occurs almost exclusively in secreted molecules, is located in the region spanned by the cyanogen bromide peptide CB3,5, and persists when hydroxylation is inhibited. Thus, modification is due to a post-translational reaction other than hydroxylation. The modified chains appear to be secreted in the denatured state since: 1) helical structures formed at 4 degrees C under acidic conditions were unstable under neutral conditions at 37 degrees C; 2) conditions that destabilize the type I procollagen helix and thus inhibit its secretion, i.e. inhibition of proline hydroxylation or incorporation of the proline analog cis-hydroxyproline, did not affect secretion of the modified chains. The time courses for secretion of nonhelical modified chains from NQT-SHE and of hydroxylated helical procollagen I from control cells, as a proportion of total collagen synthesized, were similar. Although cis-hydroxyproline did not inhibit the secretion of the modified chains, it induced their rapid intracellular degradation."
