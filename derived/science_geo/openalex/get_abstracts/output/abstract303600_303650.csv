https://openalex.org/W2032952157,"During the 1990 Galileo Venus flyby, the Near Infaied Mapping Spectrometer investigated the night-side atmosphere of Venus in the spectral range 0.7 to 5.2 micrometers. Multispectral images at high spatial resolution indicate substanmial cloud opacity variations in the lower cloud levels, centered at 50 kilometers altitude. Zonal and meridional winds were derived for this level and are consistent with motion of the upper branch of a Hadley cell. Northern and southern hemisphere clouds appear to be markedly different. Spectral profiles were used to derive lower atmosphere abundances of water vapor and other species."
https://openalex.org/W1997826922,"Images of Venus taken at 418 (violet) and 986 [near-infrared (NIR)] nanometers show that the morphology and motions of large-scale features change with depth in the cloud deck. Poleward meridional velocities, seen in both spectral regions, are much reduced in the NIR. In the south polar region the markings in the two wavelength bands are strongly anticorrelated. The images follow the changing state of the upper cloud layer downwind of the subsolar point, and the zonal flow field shows a longitudinal periodicity that may be coupled to the formation of large-scale planetary waves. No optical lightning was detected."
https://openalex.org/W2033122596,"Terrestrial vertebrate fossils show that part of the Newark supergroup of the eastern United States, all of the Glen Canyon group of the southwestern United States, and the Upper Stormberg group of southern Africa are Early Jurassic. This new correlation demonstrates that the supposed widespread tetrapod extinction at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary is an artifact of spurious correlation."
https://openalex.org/W1997509869,"Near-infrared images of Venus, obtained from a global network of ground-based observatories during January and February 1990, document the morphology and motions of the night-side near-infrared markings before, during, and after the Galileo Venus encounter. A dark cloud extended halfway around the planet at low latitudes (>+/-40 degrees ) and persisted throughout the observing program. It had a rotation period of 5.5 +/- 0.15 days. The remainder of this latitude band was characterized by small-scale (400 to 1000 kilometers) dark and bright markings with rotation periods of 7.4 +/- 1 days. The different rotation periods for the large dark cloud and the smaller markings suggests that they are produced at different altitudes. Mid-latitudes (+/-40 degrees to 60 degrees ) were usually occupied by bright east-west bands. The highest observable latitudes (+/-60 degrees to 70 degrees ) were always dark and featureless, indicating greater cloud opacity. Maps of the water vapor distribution show no evidence for large horizontal gradients in the lower atmosphere of Venus."
https://openalex.org/W2047753558,"We have discovered numerous borings of Trypanites penetrating skeletons and synsedimentary cemented limestones in archaeocyathid reefs of the Forteau formation in southern Labrador. These are, to date, the oldest known macroborings. The discovery of these structures extends the record of large endolithic organisms 100 million years from the Lower Ordovician to the Lower Cambrian. This immediately postdates the appearance of metazoans with hard parts and confirms that endoliths have played a role in reef formation since the early Cambrian."
https://openalex.org/W2036158114,"Grass and paper coated with several compounds containing the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy moiety have been subjected to combustion. By using compounds that had been purified to achieve low background amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) together with an efficient cleanup and analysis of the residue, it was possible to detect as little as 0.001 microgram of TCDD in the combustion products of 0.5 gram of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy material. Small self-supported fires converted about 10(-6) of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy material to TCDD."
https://openalex.org/W2089652623,"The Galileo Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer obtained a spectrum of Venus atmospheric emissions in the 55.0- to 125.0-nanometer (nm) wavelength region. Emissions of helium (58.4 nm), ionized atomic oxygen (83.4 nm), and atomic hydrogen (121.6 nm), as well as a blended spectral feature of atomic hydrogen (Lyman-β) and atomic oxygen (102.5 nm), were observed at 3.5-nm resolution. During the Galileo spacecraft cruise from Venus to Earth, Lyman-α emission from solar system atomic hydrogen (121.6 nm) was measured. The dominant source of the Lyman-α emission is atomic hydrogen from the interstellar medium. A model of Galileo observations at solar maximum indicates a decrease in the solar Lyman-α flux near the solar poles. A strong day-to-day variation also occurs with the 27-day periodicity of the rotation of the sun."

Immunological comparisons of populations of the cryptic tetraploid Hyla versicolor indicate a recent origin, from hybridization between eastern and western H. chrysoscelis."
https://openalex.org/W2139896726,"The microwave spectrometer on the Nimbus 6 satellite has produced the first microwave spectral images of the earth. It has yielded global maps of (i) atmospheric temperature profiles, (ii) the distributions of water vapor and liquid water over ocean, and (iii) the coverage and type of ice and snow. The method has potential for operational synoptic monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2029777968,"By analyzing published geochemical data on xenon isotopes measured in a 2.46 x 10(9)-year-old telluride ore, a lower limit of 1.6 x 10(25) years has been obtained for the mean lifetime of the nucleons in the tellurium-130 nucleus. This result is insensitive to the particular mode by which the nucleons decay and therefore provides a rigorous limit on possible baryon number nonconservation. The new limit is about two orders of magnitude better than the previous rigorous limit on nucleon stability."
https://openalex.org/W2078777752,"At Venus the Energetic Particles Detector (EPD) on the Galileo spacecraft measured the differential energy spectra and angular distributions of ions >22 kiloelectron volts (keV) and electrons > 15 keV in energy. The only time particles were observed by EPD was in a series of episodic events [0546 to 0638 universal time (UT)] near closest approach (0559:03 UT). Angular distributions were highly anisotropic, ordered by the magnetic field, and showed ions arriving from the hemisphere containing Venus and its bow shock. The spectra showed a power law form with intensities observed into the 120- to 280-keV range. Comparisons with model bow shock calculations show that these energetic ions are associated with the venusian foreshock-bow shock region. Shock-drift acceleration in the venusian bow shock seems the most likely process responsible for the observed ions."
https://openalex.org/W2006323318,"Detailed chemical maps of the lunar surface have been constructed by applying a new weighted-filter imaging technique to Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 x-ray fluorescence data. The data quality improvement is amply demonstrated by (i) modes in the frequency distribution, representing highland and mare soil suites, which are not evident before data filtering and (ii) numerous examples of chemical variations which are correlated with small-scale (about 15 kilometer) lunar topographic features."
https://openalex.org/W2015145165,"Plasma measurements were obtained with the Galileo spacecraft during an approximately 3.5-hour interval in the vicinity of Venus on 10 February 1990. Several crossings of the bow shock in the local dawn sector were recorded before the spacecraft passed into the solar wind upstream from this planet. Although observations of ions of the solar wind and the postshock magnetosheath plasmas were not possible owing to the presence of a sunshade for thermal protection of the instrument, solar wind densities and bulk speeds were determined from the electron velocity distributions. A magnetic field-aligned distribution of hotter electrons or ;;strahl'' was also found in the solar wind. Ions streaming into the solar wind from the bow shock were detected. Electron heating at the bow shock, </=20%, was notably small, with substantial density increases by factors of 2 to 3 at the day side of the shock that decrease for shock crossings further downstream from the planet. A search for pickup ions from the hot hydrogen and oxygen planetary coronas yielded an upper limit for these densities in the range of 10(-3) ion per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with densities expected from current models of neutral gas densities."

https://openalex.org/W1983653691,"Images of the disk of Venus, taken at wavelengths between 8 and 22 micrometers, were obtained a few days after the Galileo spacecraft's closest approach on 8 February 1990; these images show variations in the thickness of the main H(2)SO(4) cloud deck and the overlying temperature structure. Several features are qualitatively similar to those of earlier observations, such as a hot region at the south pole, surrounded by a cold ;;collar,'' and brightening toward the lower latitudes, where low-contrast banding appears. The collar does have a northern counterpart that is warmer, however. Equatorial limb darkening is quantitatively similar to that of previous observations; fairly constant at wavelengths up to 20 micrometers, where limb darkening increases substantially. In contrast to what was found in previous observations, polar and equatorial limb darkening are nearly the same at most wavelengths. A longitudinal variation is observable that is consistent with a wavenumber-2 behavior and a brightness maximum near local midnight."
