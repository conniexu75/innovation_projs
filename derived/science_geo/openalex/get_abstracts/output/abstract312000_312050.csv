https://openalex.org/W2160827210,"A new type of atomic absorption spectrometer-one that detects trace mercury in host material, based on hyperfine structure lines in a magnetic field-was developed and tested on various substances. This device can detect trace mercury to about 0.04 part per million (40 parts per billion) in about 1 minute. No chemical separation from the host material is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W1989565304,"In plate tectonic theory, lithosphere that descends into the mantle has a largely derivative composition, because it is produced as a refractory residue by partial melting, and cannot be resorbed readily by the parent mantle. We suggest that lithosphere sinks through the asthenosphere, or outer mantle, and accumulates progressively beneath to form an accretionary mesosphere, or inner mantle. According to this model, there is an irreversible physicochemical evolution of the mantle and its layers. We make the key assumption that the rate at which mass has been transferred from the lithosphere to the mesosphere is proportional to the rate of radiogenic heat production. Calculations of mass transfer with time demonstrate that the entire mass of the present mesosphere could have been produced in geologically reasonable times (3 x 10(9) to 4.5 x 10(9) years). The model is consistent with the generation of the continental crust during the last 3 x 1O(9) years and predicts an end to plate tectonic behavior within the next 10(9) years."
https://openalex.org/W2038883726,"Assistance for disappearing species is at present too localized and dispersed to make much impact on the problem with its growing dimensions. Species are threatened primarily because of their status as common property. Institutional deficiencies, notably those of free markets and property rights, promote depletion of species. Conversely, present institutional mechanisms offer little scope for society to express its preferences for goods without price or to establish responsibility for common-heritage resources. The situation postulates corrective measures on the part of collective authority at the international level. These measures would require a joint commitment by the developed and developing worlds, on a scale to reflect the increasingly interdependent needs and opportunities of the community at large. Whether the community perceives itself as a community or not, it functions as such in many of its ecological relationships and economic interactions. The community will sooner or later be obliged to respond to the problem of vanishing species: either sooner, through protective measures of sufficient scope, or later, when it finds that the disappearance of large numbers of species represents a loss through which it is indivisibly impoverished."
https://openalex.org/W1992266190,"Nonradiobiological phenomena affected by /sup 85/Kr include environmental radioactivity, atmospheric electricity, and inadvertent weather modification. If release of /sup 85/Kr into the atmosphere continues unabated, global changes in the atmospheric electric circuit will occur within 50 years. Our present understanding of atmospheric processes is insufficient to determine the extent of consequent weather changes and whether they would be beneficial or harmful. Because of the 10-year half-life of /sup 85/Kr, global changes may last decades."
