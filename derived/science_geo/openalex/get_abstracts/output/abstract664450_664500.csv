https://openalex.org/W3108318864,"In U.S. Pacific Northwest coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), stormwater exposure annually causes unexplained acute mortality when adult salmon migrate to urban creeks to reproduce. By investigating this phenomenon, we identified a highly toxic quinone transformation product of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), a globally ubiquitous tire rubber antioxidant. Retrospective analysis of representative roadway runoff and stormwater-affected creeks of the U.S. West Coast indicated widespread occurrence of 6PPD-quinone (<0.3 to 19 micrograms per liter) at toxic concentrations (median lethal concentration of 0.8 ± 0.16 micrograms per liter). These results reveal unanticipated risks of 6PPD antioxidants to an aquatic species and imply toxicological relevance for dissipated tire rubber residues."

Martin et al. studied the Nicotiana benthamiana TIR-NLR ROQ1 (recognition of XopQ 1) and its response to the Xanthomonas effector. Both groups found that these TIR-NLRs formed tetramers that, when activated by binding to the pathogen effector, exposed the active site of a nicotinamide adenine dinucleoside (NAD) hydrolase.

https://openalex.org/W3108760242,"Cortico-striatal projections are critical components of forebrain circuitry that regulate motivated behaviors. To enable the study of the human cortico-striatal pathway and how its dysfunction leads to neuropsychiatric disease, we developed a method to convert human pluripotent stem cells into region-specific brain organoids that resemble the developing human striatum and include electrically active medium spiny neurons. We then assembled these organoids with cerebral cortical organoids in three-dimensional cultures to form cortico-striatal assembloids. Using viral tracing and functional assays in intact or sliced assembloids, we show that cortical neurons send axonal projections into striatal organoids and form synaptic connections. Medium spiny neurons mature electrophysiologically following assembly and display calcium activity after optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons. Moreover, we derive cortico-striatal assembloids from patients with a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a deletion on chromosome 22q13.3 and capture disease-associated defects in calcium activity, showing that this approach will allow investigation of the development and functional assembly of cortico-striatal connectivity using patient-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W3106809839,"Restoring vision by stimulating the brain Electrical stimulation of the visual cortex has long been proposed as an approach to restoring vision in blind people. Previous studies positioned electrodes on the surface of the brain and thus required delivery of relatively high currents. However, this approach limits the number of electrodes that can be safely stimulated simultaneously, and such surface electrodes activate several millimeters of cortex, which results in a low spatial resolution. Chen et al. demonstrated that the simultaneous stimulation of multiple intracortical electrodes in the monkey primary visual cortex gives rise to the perception of shape and successive stimulation to the perception of motion (see the Perspective by Beauchamp and Yoshor). This major improvement provides proof of concept for the use of electrical microstimulation to create a form of artificial vision in the blind. Science , this issue p. 1191 ; see also p. 1165"
https://openalex.org/W3106852064,"Resolving the momentum degree of freedom of excitons - electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb attraction in a photoexcited semiconductor, has remained a largely elusive goal for decades. In atomically thin semiconductors, such a capability could probe the momentum forbidden dark excitons, which critically impact proposed opto-electronic technologies, but are not directly accessible via optical techniques. Here, we probe the momentum-state of excitons in a WSe2 monolayer by photoemitting their constituent electrons, and resolving them in time, momentum and energy. We obtain a direct visual of the momentum forbidden dark excitons, and study their properties, including their near-degeneracy with bright excitons and their formation pathways in the energy-momentum landscape. These dark excitons dominate the excited state distribution - a surprising finding that highlights their importance in atomically thin semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W3110090701,"<h2>Summary</h2> Dynamic pluripotent stem cell (PSC) states are <i>in vitro</i> adaptations of pluripotency continuum <i>in vivo</i>. Previous studies have generated a number of PSCs with distinct properties. To date, however, no known PSCs have demonstrated dual competency for chimera formation and direct responsiveness to primordial germ cell (PGC) specification, a unique functional feature of formative pluripotency. Here, by modulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and WNT pathways, we derived PSCs from mice, horses, and humans (designated as XPSCs) that are permissive for direct PGC-like cell induction <i>in vitro</i> and are capable of contributing to intra- or inter-species chimeras <i>in vivo</i>. XPSCs represent a pluripotency state between naive and primed pluripotency and harbor molecular, cellular, and phenotypic features characteristic of formative pluripotency. XPSCs open new avenues for studying mammalian pluripotency and dissecting the molecular mechanisms governing PGC specification. Our method may be broadly applicable for the derivation of analogous stem cells from other mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W3109220022,"CRISPR-Cas defense systems have been coopted multiple times in nature for guide RNA-directed transposition by Tn7-like elements. Prototypic Tn7 uses dedicated proteins for two targeting pathways: one targeting a neutral and conserved attachment site in the chromosome and a second directing transposition into mobile plasmids facilitating cell-to-cell transfer. We show that Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements evolved a system of guide RNA categorization to accomplish the same two-pathway lifestyle. Multiple mechanisms allow functionally distinct guide RNAs for transposition: a conventional system capable of acquiring guide RNAs to new plasmid and phage targets and a second providing long-term memory for access to chromosomal sites upon entry into a new host. Guide RNAs are privatized to be recognized only by the transposon-adapted system via sequence specialization, mismatch tolerance, and selective regulation to avoid toxic self-targeting by endogenous CRISPR-Cas defense systems. This information reveals promising avenues to engineer guide RNAs for enhanced CRISPR-Cas functionality for genome modification."

However, the behavior of the larger hindwings during collisions in flight has not been clear because they do not readily flex. Phan and Park present a detailed study of the folding and unfolding mechanisms of the hindwings in free-flying rhinoceros beetles in which the wings were impacted during flight to simulate a cluttered environment (see the Perspective by Sun). They found that origami-like folds in the wing could rapidly collapse on impact and then spring back, thus acting as shock absorbers and stabilizers. The authors replicated this behavior in a flapping-wing robot, enabling it to fly safely after collisions. Science , this issue p. 1214 ; see also p. 1165"

Cabal et al. developed a theoretical model and tested it empirically to explain the rules that govern root growth (see the Perspective by Semchenko). Plants adjust how and where their roots grow according to how close neighboring—and competing—plants might be.

https://openalex.org/W3109790889,"Selection enhances mutation toleration Mutations generate variability that is either neutral or subject to natural selection. Robustness is a measure of the ability to withstand deleterious mutational effects. Zheng et al. exposed Escherichia coli populations expressing a yellow fluorescent protein to strong, weak, or no selection for yellow fluorescence for four generations. They then selected these populations to a related function, green fluorescence, for four more generations. The strong selection first for yellow and then green fluorescence resulted in the most green fluorescence and the accumulation of the most mutations. This outcome likely was due to the increased foldability of the protein. Selection thus provides a threshold for mutation accumulation, but robustness maintains a buffer necessary for protein evolution. Science , this issue p. eabb5962"
https://openalex.org/W3109166384,"Deep, hot, and more alive than we thought Marine sediments represent a massive microbial ecosystem, but we still do not fully understand what factors shape and limit life underneath the seafloor. Analyzing samples from a subduction zone off the coast of Japan, Heuer et al. found that microbial life, in particular bacterial vegetative cells, decreases as depth and temperature increases down to ∼600 meters below the seafloor, corresponding to temperatures of ∼70°C. Below this limit, endospores are common—a remnant, and a potential reservoir, of bacterial life. Deeper still is a sterile zone, and below 1000 meters is a scalding realm populated by vegetative cells. At such great depths, high concentrations of acetate and sulfate coexist, and there are also signs of hyperthermophilic methanogenesis. These data provide a fascinating window into an extreme and inhospitable environment that nonetheless supports microbial life. Science , this issue p. 1230"
https://openalex.org/W3109667977,"Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling components play an important role in the drought stress response in plants. Arabidopsis thaliana ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA1 ( ERA1 ) encodes the β-subunit of farnesyltransferase and regulates ABA signaling and the dehydration response. Therefore, ERA1 is an important candidate gene for enhancing drought tolerance in numerous crops. However, a rice ( Oryza sativa ) ERA1 homolog has not been characterized previously. Here, we show that rice osera1 mutant lines, harboring CRISPR/Cas9-induced frameshift mutations, exhibit similar leaf growth as control plants but increased primary root growth. The osera1 mutant lines also display increased sensitivity to ABA and an enhanced response to drought stress through stomatal regulation. These results illustrate that OsERA1 is a negative regulator of primary root growth under nonstressed conditions and also of responses to ABA and drought stress in rice. These findings improve our understanding of the role of ABA signaling in the drought stress response in rice and suggest a strategy to genetically improve rice."

This universality of physics comes about thanks to a property known as scale invariance. Patel et al. exploited this concept to draw universal conclusions about the attenuation of sound in such systems by studying a homogeneous gas of lithium-6 atoms at very low temperatures (see the Perspective by Schaefer).

https://openalex.org/W3107464740,"Here we describe mechanistically distinct enzymes (a kinase, a guanosine triphosphatase, and a ubiquitin protein hydrolase) that function in disparate biochemical pathways and can also act in concert to mediate a series of redox reactions. Each enzyme manifests a second, noncanonical function-transnitrosylation-that triggers a pathological biochemical cascade in mouse models and in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The resulting series of transnitrosylation reactions contributes to synapse loss, the major pathological correlate to cognitive decline in AD. We conclude that enzymes with distinct primary reaction mechanisms can form a completely separate network for aberrant transnitrosylation. This network operates in the postreproductive period, so natural selection against such abnormal activity may be decreased."

Complex carbohydrates decorate MPO at discrete sites, but their functional relevance remains elusive. To this end, we have characterised the structure–biosynthesis–activity relationship of neutrophil MPO (nMPO). Mass spectrometry demonstrated that nMPO carries both characteristic under-processed and hyper-truncated glycans. Occlusion of the Asn355/Asn391-glycosylation sites and the Asn323-/Asn483-glycans, located in the MPO dimerisation zone, was found to affect the local glycan processing, thereby providing a molecular basis of the site-specific nMPO glycosylation. Native mass spectrometry, mass photometry and glycopeptide profiling revealed significant molecular complexity of diprotomeric nMPO arising from heterogeneous glycosylation, oxidation, chlorination and polypeptide truncation variants and a previously unreported low-abundance monoprotomer. Longitudinal profiling of maturing, mature, granule-separated and pathogen-stimulated neutrophils demonstrated that nMPO is dynamically expressed during granulopoiesis, unevenly distributed across granules and degranulated upon activation. We also show that proMPO-to-MPO maturation occurs during early/mid-stage granulopoiesis. While similar global MPO glycosylation was observed across conditions, the conserved Asn355-/Asn391-sites displayed elevated glycan hyper-truncation, which correlated with higher enzyme activities of MPO in distinct granule populations. Enzymatic trimming of the Asn355-/Asn391-glycans recapitulated the activity gain and showed that nMPO carrying hyper-truncated glycans at these positions exhibits increased thermal stability, polypeptide accessibility and ceruloplasmin-mediated inhibition potential relative to native nMPO. Finally, molecular modelling revealed that hyper-truncated Asn355-glycans positioned in the MPO-ceruloplasmin interface are critical for uninterrupted inhibition.

This preproMPO form undergoes extensive proteolytic processing initiated by the removal of the signal peptide to form apoproMPO. The enzymatically active proMPO form is rapidly generated via heme acquisition in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (22Nauseef W.M. McCormick S. Yi H. Roles of heme insertion and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in processing of the human myeloid lysosomal enzyme, myeloperoxidase.Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protease-driven polypeptide processing then removes the propeptide and an internal hexapeptide, which separates the light (α, 12.5 kDa) and heavy (β, 60–65 kDa) chains that remain covalently linked via the catalytic heme. His261 and Arg405 (UniProtKB numbering used throughout the paper) are key catalytic residues of the active site that is formed around the heme moiety positioned between the α- and β-chains. By mechanisms that remain unclear, but presumably occurring within the Golgi, the α- and β-chains are further processed and extensively post-translationally modified before and/or after the formation of the mature MPO diprotomer (ααββ, ∼150 kDa) that is connected by a Cys319-Cys319 bridge (12Nauseef W.M.

In those studies, mass-spectrometry-based glycopeptide analyses detailed the site-specific monosaccharide compositions decorating nMPO. Compositions corresponding to uncommon chitobiose core- and paucimannosidic-type N-glycans as well as more conventional oligomannosidic- and complex-type N-glycans were reported, but neither the glycan fine structures and occupancy at each site nor the biosynthesis and functional relevance of the N-glycans carried by nMPO distributed across the neutrophil granules were addressed. In fact, the molecular-level knowledge of the roles of nMPO glycosylation is critically missing despite recent reports suggesting that MPO glycans regulate E-selectin binding (34Silvescu C.I.

Here, we address this fundamental knowledge gap by characterising the structure–biosynthesis–activity relationship of nMPO and by profiling the dynamic expression, protein processing and site-specific glycosylation of MPO from maturing, mature, granule-separated and activated neutrophils. Integration of mass spectrometry, computational and biochemical assays was used to provide new insight, from atomic to macromolecular detail, into the intriguingly complex MPO glycobiology. We first sought to unravel the molecular complexity of the heme-containing MPO (ααββ), which adopts a complex diprotomeric structure comprising two identical αβ protomers, Figure 1A. Each β-chain harbours five sequons (Asn323, Asn355, Asn391, Asn483, Asn729) enabling extensive N-glycosylation of the protein surface. We applied our established PGC-LC-MS/MS glycomics platform to fully define the molecular structure of all N-glycans present on nMPO, including identification of isomeric glycans, Figure 1B. Documentation for all reported structures has been provided, Figure S1, Table S1 and Data S1. Uncommon monoantennary complex-type (FA1G1S1a), under-processed oligomannosidic (M5–M6) and hyper-truncated paucimannosidic (M2Fa-M3F) and chitobiose core-type (GlcNAc1–GlcNAc1F) structures were found to be characteristic N-glycans of nMPO. These N-glycans are congruent with structures residing in the neutrophil granules (38Venkatakrishnan V. Dieckmann R. Loke I. Tjondro H.C. Chatterjee S. Bylund J. Thaysen-Andersen M. Karlsson N.G.

Many non-glycan nMPO modifications including a total of 18 Met and nine Trp mono-/di-oxidations, two sites for Tyr mono-chlorination and several polypeptide truncation variants of both the α- and β-chains were identified using sensitive peptide profiling facilitating a near-complete sequence coverage of nMPO (α-/β-chain, 100.0%/99.8%), Figure 1C, Figure S2 and Data S2, A–B. The observed polypeptide hyper-oxidation, which is known to be mediated by the reactive oxidising agents produced by MPO (30Ravnsborg T. Houen G. Hojrup P.

Such discrepancies may arise from differences in the methods used for the purification and/or analysis of the glycoprotein. Notably, we observed very similar glycosylation of all five sites of nMPO arising from different sources including from unperturbed neutrophil extracts (see detailed comparisons below) and acquired using different techniques supporting an unbiased isolation and characterisation of nMPO. Intact mass analysis revealed limited α-chain heterogeneity (12,350–12,550 Da) arising from relatively few polypeptide truncation and oxidation variants, presumably Met251 and Met253, as supported by peptide data, Figure 1E and Table S3A. The variable protein modifications identified at the glycopeptide and peptide level were however reflected in our native MS analysis of whole unfractionated nMPO as demonstrated by significant molecular complexity of diprotomeric nMPO (ααββ, 141.5–148.0 kDa, apex 143,958 Da), which matched a published lower-resolution profile of intact nMPO (apex 144,180 Da) (33Reiding K.R.

Native MS also indicated the existence of an nMPO monoprotomer with a slightly lower-than-expected molecular mass (αβ, 70–73 kDa, data not shown).

The presence of vastly different glycan structures across glycosylation sites on a given protein is interesting because the protein experiences the same ensemble of glycan-processing enzymes as it traffics the ER-Golgi pathways. We aimed to identify the biochemical basis for this heterogeneity by first investigating using in silico approaches the mechanisms impacting the early-stage glycoprotein processing where MPO enters the cis-Golgi as a fully folded monoprotomer (12Nauseef W.M. Biosynthesis of human myeloperoxidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2018; 642: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As we have observed for other mammalian glycoproteins (47Thaysen-Andersen M. Packer N.H. Site-specific glycoproteomics confirms that protein structure dictates formation of N-glycan type, core fucosylation and branching.Glycobiology. 2012; 22: 1440-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), strong associations between the Asn accessibility on the MPO surface and the degree of N-glycan type processing and core fucosylation were identified, Figure 2A, Table S2 and Table S4A. The relatively occluded Asn355- and Asn391-glycosylation sites carried under-processed oligomannosidic-type and afucosylated N-glycans as opposed to the surface exposed sites (Asn323, Asn483, Asn729) (p = 3.5 × 10−13 and 5.7 × 10−13, respectively) carrying significantly more processed N-glycans (p = 4.7 × 10−4 and 7.6 × 10−8) and core fucosylation (both p = 1.3 × 10−7).

ECs that lack miR-223 showed a decrease of high mannose versus sialylated sugars on N-glycoproteins such as the metalloprotease Adam10. EC-specific expression of an N-glycan Adam10 mutant or of the N-glycoenzymes phenocopied miR-223 mutant defects. Thus, the N-glycome is an intrinsic regulator of EHT, serving as a key determinant of the hematopoietic fate."

The service models of traditional tourism limit the diversity of service options and cannot fully meet the individual needs of tourists anymore. The aim is to integrate sparse tourism information on the Internet, thereby providing more convenient, faster, and more personalized tourism services. Based on the shortcomings of the traditional tourism recommendation system, a deep learning-based classification processing method of tourism product information is proposed. This method uses word embedding in the data preprocessing stage. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to process review information of users and tourism service items. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to process the necessary information of users and tourism service items. Also, factorization machine technology is used to learn the interaction between the extracted features to improve the prediction model. The results show that the proposed model can maintain an excellent precision of 64.2% when generating personalized recommendation lists for users. The sensitivity and accuracy of the recommendation list are better than other algorithms. By adding DNN, the word embedding method, and the factorization machine model, the precision is improved by 30%, 33.3%, and 40%, respectively. The model accuracy is the highest with 40 hidden factors, 100 convolutions, and a 100+50 combination hidden layer. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed algorithm can provide users with personalized travel products more accurately in personalized travel recommendations. The results have enriched and developed the theory of tourism service supply chain, providing a reference for constructing a personalized tourism service system."
https://openalex.org/W3110611479,"We address the role of enzyme conformational dynamics in specificity for a high-fidelity DNA polymerase responsible for genome replication. We present the complete characterization of the conformational dynamics during the correct nucleotide incorporation forward and reverse reactions using stopped-flow and rapid-quench methods with a T7 DNA polymerase variant containing a fluorescent unnatural amino acid, (7-hydroxy-4-coumarin-yl) ethylglycine, which provides a signal for enzyme conformational changes. We show that the forward conformational change (>6000 s−1) is much faster than chemistry (300 s−1) while the enzyme opening to allow release of bound nucleotide (1.7 s−1) is much slower than chemistry. These parameters show that the conformational change selects a correct nucleotide for incorporation through an induced-fit mechanism. We also measured conformational changes occurring after chemistry and during pyrophosphorolysis, providing new insights into processive polymerization. Pyrophosphorolysis occurs via a conformational selection mechanism as the pyrophosphate binds to a rare pretranslocation state of the enzyme–DNA complex. Global data fitting was achieved by including experiments in the forward and reverse directions to correlate conformational changes with chemical reaction steps. This analysis provided well-constrained values for nine rate constants to establish a complete free-energy profile including the rates of DNA translocation during processive synthesis. Translocation does not follow Brownian ratchet or power stroke models invoking nucleotide binding as the driving force. Rather, translocation is rapid and thermodynamically favorable after enzyme opening and pyrophosphate release, and it appears to limit the rate of processive synthesis at 4 °C."

https://openalex.org/W3109184006,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are opportunistic bacterial pathogens that cause severe infections in immunocompromised individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis. Both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus require iron to infect the mammalian host. To obtain iron, these pathogens may rely on siderophore-mediated ferric iron uptake, ferrous iron uptake, or heme uptake at different points during infection. The preferred iron source depends on environmental conditions, including the presence of iron-sequestering host-defense proteins. Here, we investigate how the presence of heme, a highly relevant iron source during infection, affects bacterial responses to iron withholding by the innate immune protein calprotectin (CP). Prior work has shown that P. aeruginosa is starved of iron in the presence of CP. We report that P. aeruginosa upregulates expression of heme uptake machinery in response to CP. Furthermore, we show that heme protects P. aeruginosa from CP-mediated inhibition of iron uptake and iron-starvation responses. We extend our study to a second bacterial pathogen, S. aureus, and demonstrate that CP also inhibits iron uptake and induces iron-starvation responses by this pathogen. Similarly to P. aeruginosa, we show that heme protects S. aureus from CP-mediated inhibition of iron uptake and iron-starvation responses.

These findings expand our understanding of microbial responses to iron sequestration by CP and highlight the importance of heme utilization for bacterial adaptation to host iron-withholding strategies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two of the most prevalent nosocomial pathogens that can cause deleterious infections in part due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains (1MacDougall C. Harpe S.E. Powell J.P. Johnson C.K. Edmond M.B. Polk R.E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and fluoroquiniolone use.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1197-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These pathogens frequently colonize the same sites, including the urinary tract, burn and surgical wounds, and the upper respiratory tract. In patients with the hereditary lung disease cystic fibrosis (CF), P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are the most prevalent bacterial pathogens that colonize the lung, and their co-colonization is associated with poor patient outcomes (2Ahlgren H.G. Benedetti A. Landry J.S. Bernier J. Matouk E. Radzioch D. Lands L.C. Rousseau S. Nguyen D. Clinical outcomes associated with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections in adult cystic fibrosis patients.BMC Pulm. Med. 2015; 15: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The virulence of these two pathogens in the CF lung and severity of CF lung disease are closely linked to iron homeostasis (3Gifford A.H. Miller S.D. Jackson B.P. Hampton T.H. O'Toole G.A. Stanton B.A. Parker H.W. Iron and CF-related anemia: expanding clinical and biochemical relationships.Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2011; 46: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In particular, the anti-staphylococcal activity of P. aeruginosa has been shown to be highly dependent on iron availability (4Nguyen A.T. Jones J.W. Ruge M.A. Kane M.A. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Iron depletion enhances production of antimicrobials by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, as an essential nutrient, iron also plays critical roles in the survival of these organisms and regulates the production of several virulence factors that alter their interactions with the host (5Hammer N.D. Skaar E.P. Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus iron acquisition.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Reinhart A.A. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G.

Immun. 2016; 84: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To support their iron requirements during infection, both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus use several mechanisms to scavenge different forms of iron in the host environment. P. aeruginosa has several iron-uptake strategies to acquire iron from the host, including siderophore-mediated ferric [Fe(III)] uptake, ferrous [Fe(II)] uptake, and heme uptake. P. aeruginosa produces two siderophores, pyoverdine and pyochelin, to obtain Fe(III) in the host (8Budzikiewicz H. Siderophores of the human pathogenic fluorescent pseudomonads.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fe(II) can be prevalent in low-oxygen or reducing environments, and P. aeruginosa uses the Feo Fe(II) iron-uptake system to acquire iron in these environments (9Lau C.K. Krewulak K.D. Vogel H.J. Bacterial ferrous iron transport: the Feo system.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 40: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, a class of redox-cycling molecules called phenazines can facilitate Fe(II) uptake by reducing extracellular Fe(III) to Fe(II), which allows for more efficient Fe(II) uptake by the Feo system (10Wang Y. Wilks J.C. Danhorn T. Ramos I. Croal L. Newman D.K. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid promotes bacterial biofilm development via ferrous iron acquisition.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 3606-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To acquire heme, P. aeruginosa uses a hemophore-dependent heme assimilation system (Has) and a non-hemophore-dependent heme uptake system (Pseudomonas heme uptake [Phu]) (11Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L. Genetics and regulation of two distinct haem-uptake systems, phu and has, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Microbiology. 2000; 146: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Has system uses the secreted hemophore HasAp to capture extracellular heme, which is then taken up by an outer membrane TonB-dependent receptor, whereas the Phu system uses a TonB-dependent receptor to directly sequester heme (12Huang W. Wilks A. Extracellular heme uptake and the challenge of bacterial cell membranes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 799-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Prior work examining CF lung sputum samples suggested that P. aeruginosa switches from using siderophores to depending more heavily on heme-acquisition and Fe(II)-acquisition strategies as infection progresses (13Konings A.F. Martin L.W. Sharples K.J. Roddam L.F. Latham R. Reid D.W. Lamont I.L. Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses multiple pathways to acquire iron during chronic infection in cystic fibrosis lungs.Infect.

Two iron-acquisition strategies that are important for S. aureus and have been extensively characterized are siderophore-mediated Fe(III) uptake and heme uptake (5Hammer N.D. Skaar E.P. Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus iron acquisition.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). S. aureus produces the siderophores staphyloferrin A and B, which allow the bacterium to compete for Fe(III) with host proteins lactoferrin and transferrin (15Park R.-Y. Sun H.-Y. Choi M.-H. Bai Y.-H. Shin S.-H. Staphylococcus aureus siderophore-mediated iron-acquisition system plays a dominant and essential role in the utilization of transferrin-bound iron.J. Microbiol. 2005; 43: 183-190PubMed Google Scholar). Although these siderophores provide an important iron-acquisition strategy for S. aureus, studies have shown that S. aureus prefers heme, which accounts for ∼80% of the iron in the host, as an iron source (5Hammer N.D.

S. aureus is able to access heme by secreting hemolysins, which lyse erythrocytes to release hemoglobin (5Hammer N.D. Skaar E.P. Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus iron acquisition.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Heme-uptake systems, including the iron-regulated surface determinants (Isd) transport system, subsequently import free heme into the bacterium (5Hammer N.D. Skaar E.P. Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus iron acquisition.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Prior work has shown that S. aureus preferentially uses heme and switches to using siderophores only when heme is less available (16Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O. Iron-source preference of Staphylococcus aureus infections.Science. 2004; 305: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The importance of Fe(II) uptake for S. aureus is not understood, but a putative metal uptake system in S. aureus that has homology to other bacterial Feo transporters has been identified and shown to be upregulated in iron-deficient growth conditions (17Ster C. Beaudoin F. Diarra M.S. Jacques M. Malouin F. Lacasse P. Evaluation of some Staphylococcus aureus iron-regulated proteins as vaccine targets.Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2010; 136: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In response to bacterial infection, the host uses iron-sequestering host-defense proteins, which are capable of limiting Fe(III), Fe(II), and heme at infection sites. These proteins include lactoferrin, lipocalin-2, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and calprotectin (CP) and serve to starve invading bacterial pathogens of iron as part of the metal-withholding innate immune response (12Huang W.

From the standpoint of iron in infection and immunity, CP is the only known Fe(II)-sequestering host-defense protein (20Nakashige T.G. Zhang B. Krebs C. Nolan E.M.

In the current work, we evaluate how the presence of heme affects responses of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus to Fe(II) withholding by CP. This topic is of significant interest because CP colocalizes with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in the CF lung and its levels correlate with disease severity (26Wakeman C.A. Moore J.L. Noto M.J. Zhang Y. Singleton M.D. Prentice B.M. Gilston B.A. Doster R.S. Gaddy J.A. Chazin W.J. Caprioli R.M. Skaar E.P.

Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 194-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Importantly, this study represents a step toward addressing the chemical complexity of infection sites by evaluating how a biologically relevant iron source affects bacterial responses to Fe(II) sequestration by CP. We report that P. aeruginosa upregulates expression of heme-uptake machinery in response to CP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that heme alleviates the inhibition of P. aeruginosa iron uptake and iron-starvation responses that CP causes (Fig. 1). We also examine the effect of CP on S. aureus iron homeostasis, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of whether CP induces iron starvation in this bacterial pathogen. We report that eight S. aureus strains, including CF clinical isolates, exhibit decreased iron uptake after CP treatment. Moreover, our results uncover that CP induces iron-starvation responses in S. aureus. Similarly to our observations for P. aeruginosa, heme protects S. aureus from both inhibition of iron uptake and iron starvation by CP. Taken together, these findings reveal the importance of heme for adaptation of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus to Fe(II) withholding by CP. P. aeruginosa uses heme uptake machinery during infection, and in some cases, preferentially utilizes heme over other iron sources (14Nguyen A.T. O'Neill M.J. Watts A.M. Robson C.L. Lamont I.L. Wilks A. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Adaptation of iron homeostasis pathways by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa pyoverdine mutant in the cystic fibrosis lung.J.

Within-host evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals adaptation toward iron acquisition from hemoglobin.mBio. 2014; 5e00966-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because CP can sequester Fe(II) and thereby lower the availability of non-heme iron, we questioned whether P. aeruginosa resists CP by upregulating expression of heme-acquisition machinery to obtain heme iron. We analyzed the effect of CP on transcriptional changes in hasA and hasR, two components of the Has heme uptake system, and phuS, a component of the Phu heme uptake system. Expression of hasA, hasR, and phuS was increased in cultures grown in the presence of CP (Fig. 2), indicating that P. aeruginosa upregulates heme-acquisition machinery in response to CP. Based on this observation, we reasoned that P. aeruginosa may adapt to CP by utilizing heme to rescue cellular iron levels. We analyzed cellular metal inventory by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) to determine the effect of heme supplementation on iron uptake during growth of P. aeruginosa in the absence or presence of CP. These studies were performed with CP and/or CP-Ser, which is a CP variant with two Cys→Ser point mutations [S100A8(C42S)/S100A9(C3S)]. CP-Ser was originally used in coordination chemistry studies to avoid potential complications of the two Cys residues (25Brophy M.B. Hayden J.A. Nolan E.M. Calcium ion gradients modulate the zinc affinity and antibacterial activity of human calprotectin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 18089-18100Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been commonly used in metal-binding and antimicrobial studies of CP and displays comparable activity to CP (25Brophy M.B. Hayden J.A. Nolan E.M. Calcium ion gradients modulate the zinc affinity and antibacterial activity of human calprotectin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012; 134: 18089-18100Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 cultures were grown in a chemically-defined medium (CDM) with or without a 5 μM heme supplement. We chose to perform these studies using CDM, which contains ∼300 nM manganese, ∼5 μM iron, and ∼6 μM zinc because it is a defined medium that lacks heme (29Nakashige T.G. Zygiel E.M. Drennan C.L. Nolan E.M. Nickel sequestration by the host-defense protein human calprotectin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017; 139: 8828-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also performed select experiments with Tris:tryptic soy broth (TSB), which contains ∼150 nM manganese, ∼4 μM iron, and ∼5 μM zinc (Table S1). This undefined medium contains low levels of heme but serves as a point of comparison based on its use in prior studies of CP and P. aeruginosa (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Regardless of the medium composition, we observed a decrease in cell-associated iron content for cultures of both PAO1 and PA14 that were grown in the presence of CP, in agreement with our prior work (Fig. 3, A–C) (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, for cultures grown in the presence of both heme and CP, we observed iron levels comparable with the untreated cultures and the cultures treated with only heme (Fig. 3, A–C). These data suggest that when heme is available, P. aeruginosa will use it as an iron source and thereby resist the consequences of Fe(II) withholding by CP (Fig. 3, A–C). In addition, when we used a heme-uptake knockout (KO) strain of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ΔhasRphuR) in this experiment, we found that the presence of heme did not affect inhibition of iron uptake by CP when heme could not be used (Fig. 3D). Cell-associated manganese for PA14 grown in Tris:TSB was also reduced by CP, consistent with our prior results for PAO1 in this medium (Fig. S3A) (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For PAO1 and PA14 grown in CDM, CP did not reduce manganese uptake, indicating that medium conditions may affect manganese withholding by CP (Figs. S1A and S2A). We observed negligible changes in cell-associated nickel, copper, and zinc in PAO1 and PA14 from CP treatment, consistent with our prior study (Figs S1, C–E, S2, C–E, and S3, C–E) (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of heme did not alter the effect of CP on cell-associated manganese, nickel, copper, or zinc in either CDM or Tris–TSB (Figs. S1, A and C–E, S2, A and C–E, and S3, A and C–E). We next questioned how CP affects cellular iron uptake if heme is the only iron source available to P. aeruginosa. We grew P. aeruginosa PAO1 in CDM prepared without iron salt and supplemented with 5 μM heme in the absence or presence of CP and measured cell-associated iron levels. When heme was the only iron source, CP treatment afforded an increase in iron uptake relative to the heme-only condition (Fig. 3A). We reason that the increase in iron uptake by P. aeruginosa when grown with CP and heme is attributable to the enhanced expression of heme uptake machinery caused by CP (Fig. 2). To probe whether heme uptake accounted for the observed increase in cell-associated iron in cultures treated with heme and CP, we used the stable 57Fe isotope to prepare CDM, allowing us to simultaneously track the uptake of heme iron (56Fe; 91.75% natural abundance) and non-heme iron (57Fe; 95% isotopic purity) using ICP–MS. For cultures treated with heme and CP, we observed a significantly higher 56Fe:57Fe ratio (∼2.7) than cultures treated with heme alone (∼1.0) (Fig. 3E). Thus, when CP is present in culture, P. aeruginosa prioritizes heme as a source of iron. Building upon our current observations, we hypothesized that heme utilization protects P. aeruginosa from undergoing CP-induced iron-starvation responses. We therefore examined select markers of iron-starvation responses in P. aeruginosa cultures treated with CP and/or heme. P. aeruginosa upregulates production of the siderophore pyoverdine in response to CP (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We analyzed pyoverdine levels in culture supernatants grown in the absence or presence of CP-Ser and heme and found that in comparison with the cultures treated with CP-Ser where pyoverdine was observed in culture supernatants, cultures treated with CP-Ser and heme had negligible pyoverdine levels (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that heme prevents CP from inducing a siderophore-mediated iron-starvation response. P. aeruginosa also downregulates expression of antR, which encodes an activator of an anthranilate catabolic pathway that is regulated by iron via ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-controlled PrrF sRNAs, in response to CP (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AntR directly controls transcription of iron-containing proteins; thus, when iron availability is low, PrrF sRNAs inhibit antR translation as part of an iron-sparing response (30Oglesby A.G. Farrow 3rd, J.M. Lee J.-H. Tomaras A.P. Greenberg E.P. Pesci E.C. Vasil M.L. The influence of iron on Pseudomonas aeruginosa physiology: a regulatory link between iron and quorum sensing.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15558-15567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We evaluated activity of an antR translational reporter in P. aeruginosa PAO1 (PAO1/PantR-‘lacZ-SD) grown in the absence or presence of CP and heme (31Djapgne L. Panja S. Brewer L.K. Gans J.H. Kane M.A. Woodson S.A. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PrrF1 and PrrF2 small regulatory RNAs promote 2-alkyl-4-quinolone production through redundant regulation of the antR mRNA.J. Bacteriol. 2018; 200e00704-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We observed lower levels of antR reporter activity in cultures grown in the presence of CP than in its absence, in agreement with our prior work (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In cultures grown in the presence of heme and CP, the observed levels of antR reporter activity were comparable with those of the untreated and heme-treated cultures and significantly higher than those of CP-treated cultures (Fig. 4B). Thus, the presence of heme prevents CP from inducing a PrrF-regulated iron-starvation response. The redox-cycling function of phenazines serves a number of purposes for P. aeruginosa biology, including promotion of Fe(II) uptake by the Feo system (10Wang Y. Wilks J.C. Danhorn T. Ramos I. Croal L. Newman D.K. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid promotes bacterial biofilm development via ferrous iron acquisition.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 3606-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We previously found that both CP treatment and iron-deficient conditions inhibit phenazine production by P. aeruginosa (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on our current results, we questioned whether heme utilization would recover phenazine production by P. aeruginosa in the presence CP. We quantified the concentrations of two phenazines, phenazine-1-carboxylate (PCA) and pyocyanin (PYO), in supernatants of P. aeruginosa PA14 cultures grown in the absence or presence of heme and CP-Ser (Fig. 5). In agreement with our prior data (22Zygiel E.M. Nelson C.A. Brewer L.K. Oglesby-Sherrouse A.G. Nolan E.M. The innate immune protein human calprotectin induces iron starvation responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 3549-3562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we observed a significant decrease in levels of both PCA and PYO for cultures treated with CP-Ser (Fig. 5, A and B). For cultures grown in the presence of heme, CP-Ser caused a similar decrease in phenazine levels. This result differs from the heme-mediated recovery of siderophore- and PrrF-controlled iron-starvation responses caused by CP. It is possible that CP affects distinct regulatory systems that inhibit phenazine production even when other iron-regulated responses are recovered by heme. Indeed, phenazine production can be mod"

Such techniques have been mostly applied to fine-grained rocks (chert), while studies on coarse-grained raw materials have been relatively infrequent. In this study, confocal microscopy was employed to investigate polished surfaces on a coarse-grained lithology, quartzite. Wear originating from contact with five different worked materials were classified in a data-driven approach using machine learning. Two different classifiers, a decision tree and a support-vector machine, were used to assign the different textures to a worked material based on a selected number of parameters ( Mean density of furrows , Mean depth of furrows , Core material volume-Vmc ). The method proved successful, presenting high scores for bone and hide (100%). The obtained classification rates are satisfactory for the other worked materials, with the only exception of cane, which shows overlaps with other materials. Although the results presented here are preliminary, they can be used to develop future studies on quartzite including enlarged sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W3107700756,"Background Short birth interval is a universal public health problem resulting in adverse fetal, neonatal, child and maternal outcomes. In Ethiopia, more than 50% of the overall inter birth spacing is short. However, prior scientific evidence on its determinants is limited and even then findings are inconsistent. Methods A community -based unmatched case-control study was employed on 218 cases and 436 controls. Cases were ever married reproductive age women whose last delivery has been in the past five years with birth interval of less than 3 years between the latest two successive live births whereas those women with birth interval of 3–5 years were taken as controls. A multistage sampling technique was employed on 30% of the kebeles in Dessie city administration. A pre-tested interviewer based questionnaire was used to collect data by 16 trained diploma nurses and 8 health extension workers supervised by 4 BSc nurses. The collected data were cleaned, coded and double entered into Epi-data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 22. Binary logistic regression model was considered and those variables with P&lt;0.25 in the bivariable analysis were entered in to final model after which statistical significance was declared at P&lt; 0.05 using adjusted odds ratio at 95% CI. Result In this study, contraceptive use (AOR = 11.2, 95% CI: 5.95–21.15), optimal breast feeding for at least 2 years (AOR = 0.098, 95% CI:0.047–0.208), age at first birth &lt;25 years (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.282–0.761), having male preceding child (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.166–0.793) and knowing the duration of optimum birth interval correctly (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.245–0.811) were significant determinants of short birth interval. Conclusion Contraceptive use, duration of breast feeding, age at first birth, preceding child sex and correct understanding of the duration of birth interval were significant determinants of short birth interval. Fortunately, all these significant factors are likely modifiable. Thus, the existing efforts of optimizing birth interval should be enhanced through proper designation and implementation of different strategies on safe breastfeeding practice, modern contraceptive use and maternal awareness about the health merits of optimum birth interval."
https://openalex.org/W3109947464,"Background Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. We previously identified adipolin, also known as C1q/Tnf-related protein 12, as an anti-inflammatory adipokine with protective features against metabolic and vascular disorders. Here, we investigated the effect of adipolin on myocardial remodeling in a mouse model of MI. Methods Male adipolin-knockout (APL-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to the permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to create MI. Results APL-KO mice exhibited increased ratios of heart weight/body weight and lung weight/body weight after MI compared with WT mice. APL-KO mice showed increased left ventricular diastolic diameter and decreased fractional shortening after MI compared with WT mice. APL-KO mice exhibited increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the post-MI hearts compared with WT mice. Systemic administration of adenoviral vectors expressing adipolin to WT mice after MI surgery improved left ventricular contractile dysfunction and reduced cardiac expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with adipolin protein reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Treatment with adipolin protein increased Akt phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. Inhibition of PI3 kinase/Akt signaling reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of adipolin in cardiomyocytes. Conclusion Our data indicate that adipolin ameliorates pathological remodeling of myocardium after MI, at least in part, by its ability to reduce myocardial inflammatory response and apoptosis."

Methods We calculated infection and death rates amongst US hospital workers per 100 COVID-19-related deaths in the general population based on observed numbers in Hubei, China, and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker (HW) infections in the US based on each of these two scenarios. We also assessed the impact of restricting hospital workers aged ≥ 60 years from performing patient care activities on these estimates. Results We estimated that about 53,000 hospital workers in the US could get infected, and 1579 could die due to COVID19. The availability of PPE for high-risk workers alone could reduce this number to about 28,000 infections and 850 deaths. Restricting high-risk hospital workers such as those aged ≥ 60 years from direct patient care could reduce counts to 2,000 healthcare worker infections and 60 deaths. Conclusion We estimate that US hospital workers will bear a significant burden of illness due to COVID-19. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing the exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could mitigate these risks."
https://openalex.org/W3106562518,"The recent efforts dedicated to understanding important features and consequences of city growth have profited from the scaling approach to urban indicators. This kind of analysis can be conveniently used to investigate the impact of geo-economic transformations, like fast urbanization and industrial development, which occurred in continental size countries (e.g., India, China, and Brazil) during the past half-century. Profiting from high quality data, this work explores how scaling relationships among urban indicators are influenced by strong regional heterogeneities in Brazil. It is based on economic, infrastructure and violence related data sets for the time interval 2002-2016. Results indicate that regional specificities related to infrastructure, economic development, and geography have a larger influence on the absolute value of the urban indexes. Regional scaling similarities and differences among Brazilian regions were also uncovered. Interesting enough, the results indicate that the richest and poorest Brazilian regions share similar scaling behavior, despite all huge different local influences. By contrast, the results for the two richest regions, with similar average values of urban indexes and the same kind of local influences have rather different scaling properties. Thus, scaling analysis suggests that distinct political solutions might be necessary to improve life’s quality, even for two regions with similar average values of urban indicators."
https://openalex.org/W3109348209,"Objectives The Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) is a public health surveillance system that provides representative estimates of the experiences and behaviors of adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States. In 2015, the sample design and frame of MMP changed from a system that only included HIV patients to one that captures the experiences of persons receiving and not receiving HIV care. We describe methods investigated for calculating survey weights, the approach chosen, and the benefits of using a dynamic surveillance registry as a sampling frame. Methods MMP samples adults with diagnosed HIV from the National HIV Surveillance System, the HIV case surveillance registry for the United States. In the methodological study presented in this manuscript, we compared methods that account for sample design and nonresponse, including weighting class adjustment vs. propensity weighting and a single-stage nonresponse adjustment vs. sequential adjustments for noncontact and nonresponse. We investigated how best to adjust for non-coverage using surveillance data to post-stratify estimates. Results After assessing these methods, we chose as our preferred procedure weighting class adjustments and a single-stage nonresponse adjustment. Classes were constructed using variables associated with respondents’ characteristics and important survey outcomes, chief among them laboratory results available from surveillance that served as a proxy for medical care. Conclusions MMPs weighting procedures reduced sample bias by leveraging auxiliary information on medical care available from the surveillance registry sampling frame.

https://openalex.org/W3110466396,"The shape of a neuron facilitates its functionality within neural circuits. Dendrites integrate incoming signals from axons, receiving excitatory input onto small protrusions called dendritic spines. Therefore, understanding dendritic growth and development is fundamental for discerning neural function. We previously demonstrated that EphA7 receptor signaling during cortical development impacts dendrites in two ways: EphA7 restricts dendritic growth early and promotes dendritic spine formation later. Here, the molecular basis for this shift in EphA7 function is defined. Expression analyses reveal that EphA7 full-length (EphA7-FL) and truncated (EphA7-T1; lacking kinase domain) isoforms are dynamically expressed in the developing cortex. Peak expression of EphA7-FL overlaps with dendritic elaboration around birth, while highest expression of EphA7-T1 coincides with dendritic spine formation in early postnatal life. Overexpression studies in cultured neurons demonstrate that EphA7-FL inhibits both dendritic growth and spine formation, while EphA7-T1 increases spine density. Furthermore, signaling downstream of EphA7 shifts during development, such that in vivo inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin in EphA7-mutant neurons ameliorates dendritic branching, but not dendritic spine phenotypes. Finally, direct interaction between EphA7-FL and EphA7-T1 is demonstrated in cultured cells, which results in reduction of EphA7-FL phosphorylation. In cortex, both isoforms are colocalized to synaptic fractions and both transcripts are expressed together within individual neurons, supporting a model where EphA7-T1 modulates EphA7-FL repulsive signaling during development. Thus, the divergent functions of EphA7 during cortical dendrite development are explained by the presence of two variants of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W3006970086,"Both molecular mechanical and quantum mechanical calculations play an important role in describing the behavior and structure of molecules. In this work, we compare for the same peptide systems the results obtained from folding molecular dynamics simulations with previously reported results from quantum mechanical calculations. More specifically, three molecular dynamics simulations of 5 $\mu$s each in explicit water solvent were carried out for three Asn-Gly-containing heptapeptides, in order to study their folding and dynamics. Previous data, based on quantum mechanical calculations and the DFT methods have shown that these peptides adopt $\beta$-turn structures in aqueous solution, with type I' $\beta$-turn being the most preferred motif. The results from our analyses indicate that for the given system the two methods diverge in their predictions. The possibility of a force field-dependent deficiency is examined as a possible source of the observed discrepancy."

The biciliate green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an excellent experimental organism to study ATP production pathways, including photosynthesis and respiration, particularly because it can be cultured either photoautotrophically or heterotrophically. Additionally, its cellular ATP concentration, [ATP], is reflected in the beating of its cilia. However, the methods currently used for quantifying the cellular ATP levels are time consuming or invasive. In this study, we established a rapid method for estimating cytosolic [ATP] from the ciliary beating frequency in C. reinhardtii. Using an improved method of motility reactivation in demembranated cell models, we obtained calibration curves for [ATP]–ciliary beating frequency over a physiological range of ATP concentrations. These curves allowed rapid estimation of the cytosolic [ATP] in live wild-type cells to be ∼2.0 mM in the light and ∼1.5 mM in the dark: values comparable to those obtained by other methods. Furthermore, we used this method to assess the effects of genetic mutations or inhibitors of photosynthesis or respiration quantitatively and noninvasively.

These sensors can be expressed in specific cellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and quantitatively monitor local ATP concentrations, [ATP], based on ratiometric analyses. These sensors, however, are not easy to use in some kinds of cells because they must be expressed as recombinant proteins in the target cells, they could perturb the cellular metabolism and the cellular ATP level when overexpressed (5Magidson V. Khodjakov A. Circumventing photodamage in live-cell microscopy.Methods Cell Biol. 2013; 114: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and in the case of phototrophic organisms, they are susceptible to chloroplast autofluorescence. In this study, we explored the possibility of easily estimating cytosolic [ATP] in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii from the beat frequency of its cilia (also called flagella). C. reinhardtii is an excellent model organism in various research fields, including photosynthesis, respiration, reproduction, and ciliary function. Because it can be cultured either photoautotrophically or heterotrophically, numerous mutants with defects in photosynthesis or respiration pathways have been isolated (6Cardol P. Remacle C.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA2009: 303-332Google Scholar). Some of these mutant cells swim slower than WT cells (13Wakabayashi K. King S.M. Modulation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellar motility by redox poise.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Low motility of such mutants may reflect a decrease in their intracellular [ATP]. Eukaryotic cilia are motile organelles driven by microtubule-based motor proteins: dyneins. Ciliary dyneins belong to the protein superfamily containing ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+ proteins) and generate force between adjacent doublet microtubules through ATP hydrolysis (14Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Evolutionary relationships and structural mechanisms of AAA+ proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The inner structure of the cilia, called the axoneme, is detergent-insoluble, and the motility of such a cytoskeleton-based structure has been traditionally studied in vitro by detergent extraction followed by the addition of ATP. This kind of experiments is originated from the in vitro contraction of glycerinated muscle by Szent-Györgyi (15Szent-Györgyi A. Free energy relations and contraction of actomyosin.Biol. Bull. 1949; 94: 140-161Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the method was applied for sperm flagella (16Bishop D.W. Hoffman-Berling H. Extracted mammalian sperm models. I. Preparation and reactivation with adenosine triphosphate.J. Cell Comp. Physiol. 1959; 53: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Paramecium cilia (17Naitoh Y. Kaneko H. Reactivated triton-extracted models of paramecium: modification of ciliary movement by calcium ions.Science. 1972; 176: 523-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and then C. reinhardtii cilia (18Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Submicromolar levels of calcium control the balance of beating between the two flagella in demembranated models of Chlamydomonas.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In each system, after detergent-extraction, motor proteins can be activated by the addition of ATP to show sliding motion against cytoskeletons, and the cell motility can be reproduced in vitro. This system enables in vitro assessment for the effects of various factors such as ions and nucleotides on cell motility. The detergent-extracted cilia or whole cells (cell models) of C. reinhardtii display motility in the presence of ATP such that demembranated cilia beat with almost the same pattern as that in live cells (Fig. 1A) (18Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Submicromolar levels of calcium control the balance of beating between the two flagella in demembranated models of Chlamydomonas.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of C. reinhardtii increases with [ATP] in a Michaelis–Menten pattern (19Kamiya R. Okamoto M. A mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that lacks the flagellar outer dynein arm but can swim.J. Cell Sci. 1985; 74: 181-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as found originally with sea urchin sperm flagella (20Brokaw C.J. Adenosine triphosphate usage by flagella.Science. 1967; 156: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This ATP-dependence of CBF conforming to Michaelis–Menten kinetics is an empirical observation that cannot be theoretically explained as representing the function of single or multiple enzymes. Nevertheless, we have experienced that the [ATP]–CBF curve is reproducible when the same cilia or flagella are tested under constant conditions. We thus hypothesized that cytosolic [ATP] could be estimated by interpolating the CBF of live cells if we can draw a reliable [ATP]–CBF curve from in vitro experiments. The methods for preparing detergent-extracted cell models of C. reinhardtii and reactivating their motility with the addition of ATP are well established and have been used in various studies (13Wakabayashi K. King S.M. Modulation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellar motility by redox poise.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Kamiya R. Witman G.B.

Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21Takada S. Kamiya R. Beat frequency difference between the two flagella of Chlamydomonas depends on the attachment site of outer dynein arms on the outer- doublet microtubules.Cell Motil.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4179-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, all of these methods are flawed in that the maximal CBF of the cell models under physiological [ATP] is lower than the CBF of live cells. Thus, an improved method has been awaited. In this study, we improved the conditions for motility reactivation of the cell models so that they display higher CBF comparable to the in vivo CBF over a more extensive [ATP] range. Using the improved [ATP]–CBF curve for calibration, we estimated intracellular [ATP] in cells under various conditions. The values thus obtained showed a reasonable agreement with those measured based on luciferin/luciferase phosphorescence. The CBF-based method is entirely noninvasive and rapid, and it is useful for monitoring the dynamics of cellular [ATP] in live cells. To draw a better [ATP]–CBF curve and estimate the cellular [ATP] from CBF, we first improved the buffer conditions for motility reactivation in detergent-extracted cell models. In previous studies, a reactivation buffer was used that contained 30 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM potassium acetate, and 1% polyethylene glycol (Mw: 20,000) (18Kamiya R.

Cytoskeleton. 1997; 36: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The motility of the cell models is readily reactivated by adding ATP to the cell models in this buffer. However, in these conventional experimental conditions, at [ATP] > 1 mM, CBF is lower than projected from the Michaelis–Menten curve (Fig. 1B). Because the physiological [ATP] is suggested to be 1 to 2 mM in plant cells (23De Col V. Fuchs P. Nietzel T. Elsasser M. Voon C.P. Candeo A. Seeliger I. Fricker M.D. Grefen C. Moller I.M. Bassi A.

Assuming that ATP uncoordinated with Mg2+ increases when [ATP] is increased with limited [Mg2+] (Fig. S1) and that such free ATP may inhibit dynein ATPase (25Hayashi M. Inhibition of axoneme and dynein ATPase from sea urchin sperm by free ATP.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we changed [Mg2+] in the buffer to 5 to 20 mM. The CBF, measured from the cell body vibration (26Kamiya R. Analysis of cell vibration for assessing axonemal motility in Chlamydomonas.Methods. 2000; 22: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), showed that 15 mM MgSO4 conditions yielded a curve well fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation and gave the highest Vmax value, which was higher than the CBF in live cells (Table 1). The increase in Vmax with [Mg2+] may mean that Mg2+-free ATP indeed inhibits the mechanochemical cycle of dyneins.Table 1Km, Vmax, and |R| values for Figure 1BMg2+ATP only[ATP]:[ADP] = 20:1Km (mM)Vmax (Hz)|R|Km (mM)Vmax (Hz)|R|5 mM0.14 ± 0.04456.00 ± 3.6690.98370.10 ± 0.01652.33 ± 2.1110.866510 mM0.22 ± 0.04562.11 ± 2.9200.99630.21 ± 0.03463.47 ± 1.3660.994515 mM0.49 ± 0.08172.85 ± 1.1560.99730.52 ± 0.06676.90 ± 1.6400.998920 mM0.52 ± 0.01059.70 ± 5.0270.98880.58 ± 0.10859.57 ± 4.9920.9735 Open table in a new tab As an additional improvement, we added ADP together with ATP. Several studies have suggested that ADP enhances dynein motor activity (27Furuta A. Yagi T. Yanagisawa H.A. Higuchi H. Kamiya R.

Slow ADP-dependent acceleration of microtubule translocation produced by an axonemal dynein.FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that in C. reinhardtii cells, the ATP: ADP ratio is almost always ∼20:1 (29Forti G. Furia A. Bombelli P. Finazzi G. In vivo changes of the oxidation-reduction state of NADP and of the ATP/ADP cellular ratio linked to the photosynthetic activity in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1464-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We thus added ADP at 1/20 concentration of ATP for reactivation of the motility of the cell models. The addition of ADP resulted in a curve showing an excellent fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation and a higher Vmax (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Based on the excellent in vitro motility attained, we decided to use the [ATP]–CBF curve obtained in the buffer containing 15 mM MgSO4 and ADP, in addition to other ordinary components, to estimate the cellular ATP concentration from the CBF of live cells (Videos S1–S4). The mean CBF of live WT cells (see Table 2 for the strains used in this study) grown in the light or the dark was measured as 61.0 ± 0.2 or 56.8 ± 0.8 Hz, respectively (mean ± SEM, n = 4) (Fig. 2A). These values corresponded with 2.0 ± 0.1 and 1.5 ± 0.1 mM [ATP], respectively, in the 15 mM Mg2+ curve of Figure 1B (and Fig. S1). It is reasonable that dark-adapted cells, not undergoing photosynthesis, showed lower CBF and cytosolic [ATP] than light-adapted cells.Table 2Strains used in this studyStrainDescriptionReferenceWild type (WT)A progeny of the cross CC-124 × CC125, agg1+, mt−This studyCC-124Wild-type strain, nit1−, nit2−, agg1−, mt−(44Harris E.H.

Before measuring live-cell CBF in these mutants, we examined the motility of their demembranated cells reactivated at different ATP concentrations to verify that the ciliary properties are unchanged. [ATP]–CBF curves (Fig. S3) were used to extrapolate and compare the Vmax values (Table S1). Mutants used were FUD50P lacking the beta subunit of chloroplast FoF1ATP synthase (CF1β) as a photosynthesis-deficient mutant (30Woessner J.P. Masson A. Harris E.H. Bennoun P. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Molecular and genetic analysis of the chloroplast ATPase of chlamydomonas.Plant Mol. Biol. 1984; 3: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and dum11 and dum22 as respiratory mutants (31Dorthu M.P. Remy S. Michel-Wolwertz M.R. Colleaux L. Breyer D. Beckers M.C. Englebert S. Duyckaerts C. Sluse F.E. Matagne R.F. Biochemical, genetic and molecular characterization of new respiratory-deficient mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Mol.

Biol. 2002; 319: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because the original FUD50 cilia contain less of an outer-arm dynein component probably caused by unintentional mutation, FUD50P, a progeny of the cross WT × FUD50 was used (see Experimental procedures and Fig. S2). The dum11 strain lacks complex III, and the dum22 strain lacks complexes I and III in the respiration chain in mitochondria. The cytosolic [ATP] of these stains were calculated from each strain’s [ATP]–CBF curve (Fig. S3). The cytosolic [ATP] for each mutant was calculated from the respective CBF values of live mutant cells (Fig. 2). Because FUD50P does not grow in the light and dum11 and dum22 do not grow in the dark, these strains were kept only in their preferred dark or light conditions, respectively. The cytosolic [ATP] of FUD50P was 1.3 ± 0.1 mM, which was close to the value of dark-grown WT (1.5 ± 0.1 mM). Consistently, dark-grown WT and the photosynthesis-deficient mutant showed similar cytosolic [ATP] values (Fig. 2). By contrast, the respiration mutants showed significantly lower [ATP] values (0.9 ± 0.1 mM in dum11 and 0.5 ± 0.1 mM in dum22) than the other strains, suggesting that respiration contributes to the cytosolic [ATP] more significantly than does photosynthesis under heterotrophic culture conditions (Fig. 2). For a more straightforward estimation of the cytosolic [ATP] in a mutant, its CBF can be extrapolated into the WT calibration curve instead of its own. The [ATP] values estimated from the WT calibration curve were not significantly different from those from the respective strain’s curve, except for FUD50P (Table 3). This difference may be caused by the remaining unintentional mutations in FUD50P, suggested from a slightly lower Vmax value of the calibration curve (Table S1, Fig. S3). Therefore, when estimating the cytosolic [ATP] from CBF, the calibration curve should be changed depending on the purpose: the respective strain’s calibration curve for better estimation and the WT calibration curve ([ATP] =0.52 mM ∗CBF/(76.9 Hz-CBF)) for easier estimation. We employed the former in this study below.Table 3Comparison of [ATP] estimated by different calibration curvesStrain and light conditionEstimated [ATP] (mM)p valueaStudent’s t test.By WT calibration curveBy each strain's calibration curvedum11, light0.96 ± 0.0960.91 ± 0.0980.3120dum22, light0.51 ± 0.0390.47 ± 0.0380.1700FUD50P, dark1.07 ± 0.0151.29 ± 0.0210.0001a Student’s t test. Open table in a new tab To validate the [ATP] values estimated from CBF, we next measured the intracellular ATP concentration by a bioluminescence-based method. Whole-cell extracts were prepared from each strain after TCA fixation, and the ATP amounts in cell lysates were measured by an ATP detection system based on the luciferin-luciferase reaction. To convert the ATP amount to its intracellular concentration, we approximated cells to spheres and calculated the total cell volume from the cell number and the mean cell radius (Fig. S4). The bioluminescence-based method yielded significantly higher [ATP] values than those estimated by the CBF method. However, both methods reported the same patterns in the [ATP] difference among cells under different physiological or genetic conditions (Fig. 3). The difference in the [ATP] values assessed by the two methods may not be surprising because the CBF reflects the [ATP] in cilia, whereas the bioluminescence method measures the total quantity of [ATP] contained in both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts. If we consider that the chloroplast occupies ∼51% of the total cell volume (33Gaffal K. Arnold C.-G. Friedrichs G. Gemple W.

Protistenkd. 1995; 145: 10-23Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas the cytoplasm occupies ∼40% (34Harris E.H. Cell architecture.in: The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 2009: 25-64Google Scholar), we may consider that [ATP] measured by the bioluminescence-based assay is greatly affected by the [ATP] in the chloroplasts. Taking advantage of the rapidity of the CBF-based method, we assessed the effects of two kinds of inhibitors on ATP production. First, we tested rotenone, a respiration inhibitor that targets complex I. WT, dum11, and dum22 cells were treated with 100 μM rotenone, and the CBF of each strain was measured for 30 min. The CBFs of dum11 and dum22 were lower than those of the WT before rotenone treatment (Fig. 4A). After the treatment, the CBFs of WT and dum11 (lacking complex III) cells decreased within 1 min, whereas the CBF of dum22 (lacking complexes I and III) cells assumed a low level at time zero that did not decrease further with time (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that rotenone inhibited complex I in the respiratory chain. These changes in CBF were converted to the change in the cytosolic [ATP] from each strain’s calibration curve (Fig. S3). Rotenone decreased cytosolic [ATP] in WT cells from 2.0 ± 0.2 to 1.6 ± 0.3 mM within 1 min (Fig. 4B), suggesting that respiration contributes to the cytosolic [ATP] by ∼0.4 mM under normal conditions. Next, we tested 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), a photosynthesis inhibitor that targets photosystem II. CBF decreased within 1 min after treatment with DCMU and recovered almost completely by 30 min (Fig. 5A). Conversion of CBF to [ATP] showed that, similarly, the cytosolic [ATP] dropped from 2.1 ± 0.2 to 1.0 ± 0.1 mM immediately after the DCMU treatment and spontaneously recovered to 2.1 ± 0.1 mM within 30 min (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that photosynthesis contributes to cytosolic [ATP] by ∼1.1 mM under heterotrophic culture conditions. We surmised that the activation of respiration is primarily responsible for this recovery. To test this idea, we treated the cells with both DCMU and rotenone. After the treatment, [ATP] decreased from 1.6 ± 0.1 to 0.5 ± 0.1 mM within 1 min and partially recovered to 1.0 ± 0.2 mM by 30 min (Fig. 5B). This modest recovery supports the concept that respiration activation is indeed crucial for recovery but simultaneously suggests that other metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, also play a role. We estimated the intracellular [ATP] in C. reinhardtii from CBF in vivo, using in vitro data on the [ATP]-dependence of ciliary movement in demembranated cells (cell models). Measurements of CBF in several metabolic mutants or cells treated with metabolic inhibitors allowed us to quantify the contribution of photosynthesis and respiration to the cytosolic [ATP]. CBF must reflect [ATP] in the cilia, but whether or how much this level differs from the cytosolic [ATP] is unclear. Because ATP molecules are produced in the cell body and diffuse into the cilia, where they are consumed by axonemal dyneins and other ATPases such as intraflagellar transport motors, the ATP concentration along each cilium could form a steep gradient (35Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. Diener D.R. Intraflagellar transport: the eyes have it.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, studies have shown that molecules as small as ATP can quickly diffuse from the base to the tip of the sperm tail (36Takao D. Kamimura S. FRAP analysis of molecular diffusion inside sea-urchin spermatozoa.J. Exp. Biol. 2008; 211: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Takao D. Kamimura S.

An example of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures in drug procurement is provided by the operation of the Global Drug Facility (GDF) of the Stop TB Partnership, the largest provider of tuberculosis (TB) medicines to the public sector worldwide. Methods Procedures and results of GDF’s quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) over the five-year period 2013–2017 were analysed retrospectively. 13,999 batches of 51 different medicines had been procured and reviewed within this period. 1,388 of these batches had been analysed in the laboratories of GDF’s external quality control agent (QCA). Assay and dissolution results determined by the manufacturers and by the external QCA were compared using Bland-Altman analysis. Results All investigated batches of medicines were in specifications at the time of shipment. The costs for QA/QC were 0.8% of purchase costs. The median time required for chemical analysis was 10 working days. Comparison of the medicine quality analysis results showed for the poorly water-soluble compound rifampicin a bias of 4.4%, with the manufacturers reporting higher values than the external QCA, most likely due to different methods employed for the analysis. Overall 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) were -6.7 to +8.0% for assay, and -10.1 to +11.8% for dissolution. In case of kanamycin injections, 95% LOAs for assay reached -14.5 to +13.2%, largely attributable to samples from one manufacturer who had used a microbiological assay while the external QCA had used an HPLC assay. Conclusions GDF’s procedures represent a useful benchmark when evaluating QA/QC procedures of other medicine procurement operations. Inter-laboratory comparison using Bland-Altman plots allows to investigate bias and variability in medicine quality control and should be considered as a routine procedure by drug procurement agencies, to identify priorities for further improvements."

Light-driven ion-pump activity has been reported for some rhodopsins based on heterologous E . coli or mammalian cell expression systems. However, neither their physiological roles nor the expression of those genes in native cells are known. To reveal their physiological roles, we investigated the expression patterns of these genes under various growth conditions. Nitrogen (N) deficiency induced color change in exponentially growing G . theta cells from brown to green. The 29 rhodopsin-like genes were expressed in native cells. We found that the expression of 6 genes was induced under N depletion, while that of another 6 genes was reduced under N depletion."
https://openalex.org/W3008923112,"Recent advances in distance-based protein folding have led to a paradigm shift in protein structure prediction. Through sufficiently precise estimation of the inter-residue distance matrix for a protein sequence, it is now feasible to predict the correct folds for new proteins much more accurately than ever before. Despite the exciting progress, a dedicated visualization system that can dynamically capture the distance-based folding process is still lacking. Most molecular visualizers typically provide only a static view of a folded protein conformation, but do not capture the folding process. Even among the selected few graphical interfaces that do adopt a dynamic perspective, none of them are distance-based. Here we present PolyFold, an interactive visual simulator for dynamically capturing the distance-based protein folding process through real-time rendering of a distance matrix and its compatible spatial conformation as it folds in an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. PolyFold integrates highly convergent stochastic optimization algorithms with on-demand customizations and interactive manipulations to maximally satisfy the geometric constraints imposed by a distance matrix. PolyFold is capable of simulating the complex process of protein folding even on modest personal computers, thus making it accessible to the general public for fostering citizen science. Open source code of PolyFold is freely available for download at https://github.com/Bhattacharya-Lab/PolyFold . It is implemented in cross-platform Java and binary executables are available for macOS, Linux, and Windows."
https://openalex.org/W3107264249,"Bradykinin-related peptides (BRPs) family is one of the most significant myotropic peptide families derived from frog skin secretions. Here, a novel BRP callitide was isolated and identified from the red-eyed leaf frog, Agalychnis callidryas , with atypical primary structure FRPAILVRPK-NH 2 . The mature peptide was cleaved N-terminally at a classic propeptide convertase cleavage site (-KR-) and at the C-terminus an unusual -GKGKGK sequence was removed using the first G residue as an amide donor for the C-terminally-located K residue. Thereafter, the synthetic replicates of callitide were assessed the myotropic activity and showed a significant contraction of balder, with the 0.63 nM EC 50 value, more potent than most discovered myotropic peptides. The binding mode was further speculated by molecular docking and stimulation. The result indicated that the C-terminal of callitide might selectively bind to bradykinin receptor B2 (BKRB2). Further investigation of the callitide needs to be done in the future to be exploited as potential future drug leads."
https://openalex.org/W3107349672,"The objective of this study is to describe how screen-preventable loss of life (screen-PLL) can be used to analyze the distribution of life savings with mammographic screening. The determination of screen-PLL with mammography is possible using a natural history model of breast cancer that simulates clinical and pathologic events of this disease. This investigation uses a Monte Carlo Markov model with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; American Cancer Society; and National Vital Statistics System. Populations of one million women per screening strategy are simulated over a lifetime with mammographic screening based on current guidelines of the American Cancer Society (ACS), United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), triennial screening from age 50–70, and no screening. Screen-PLL curves are generated and show guideline performance over a lifetime. The screen-PLL curve with no screening is determined by tumor discovery through clinical awareness and has the highest values of screen-PLL. The ACS and USPSTF strategies demonstrate screen-PLL curves favoring the elderly. The curve for triennial screening is more uniform than the ACS or USPSTF curves but could be improved by adding screen(s) at either end of the 50–70 age range. This study introduces the use of screen-PLL as a tool to improve the understanding of screening guidelines and allowing a more balanced allocation of life savings across an aging population. The method presented shows how screen-PLL can be used to analyze and potentially improve breast cancer screening guidelines."
