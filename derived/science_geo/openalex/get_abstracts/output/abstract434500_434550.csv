https://openalex.org/W1999068651,"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly being used to study basic vertebrate biology and human disease with a rich array of in vivo genetic and molecular tools. However, the inability to readily modify the genome in a targeted fashion has been a bottleneck in the field. Here we show that improvements in artificial transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provide a powerful new approach for targeted zebrafish genome editing and functional genomic applications. Using the GoldyTALEN modified scaffold and zebrafish delivery system, we show that this enhanced TALEN toolkit has a high efficiency in inducing locus-specific DNA breaks in somatic and germline tissues. At some loci, this efficacy approaches 100%, including biallelic conversion in somatic tissues that mimics phenotypes seen using morpholino-based targeted gene knockdowns. With this updated TALEN system, we successfully used single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides to precisely modify sequences at predefined locations in the zebrafish genome through homology-directed repair, including the introduction of a custom-designed EcoRV site and a modified loxP (mloxP) sequence into somatic tissue in vivo. We further show successful germline transmission of both EcoRV and mloxP engineered chromosomes. This combined approach offers the potential to model genetic variation as well as to generate targeted conditional alleles."

Notably, although the overwhelming majority of such editing events occur in transcripts derived from Alu repeat elements, the biological function of non-coding RNA editing remains uncertain. Here, we show that mutations in ADAR1 (also known as ADAR) cause the autoimmune disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). As in Adar1-null mice, the human disease state is associated with upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, indicating a possible role for ADAR1 as a suppressor of type I interferon signaling. Considering recent insights derived from the study of other AGS-related proteins, we speculate that ADAR1 may limit the cytoplasmic accumulation of the dsRNA generated from genomic repetitive elements."

Exome sequencing of three elderly females with clonal hematopoiesis, demonstrated by X-inactivation analysis, identified somatic TET2 mutations. Recurrence testing identified TET2 mutations in 10 out of 182 individuals with X-inactivation skewing. TET2 mutations were specific to individuals with clonal hematopoiesis without hematological malignancies and were associated with alterations in DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1989940296,"Notch signalling in the intestinal crypt is modulated to drive commitment to the secretory fate. Clevers and colleagues find that cells expressing the Notch ligand DLL1 are intermediate secretory cells that can revert to Lgr5+ stem cells upon damage. Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells generate enterocytes and secretory cells. Secretory lineage commitment requires Notch silencing. The Notch ligand Dll1 is expressed by a subset of immediate stem cell daughters. Lineage tracing in Dll1GFP–ires–CreERT2 knock-in mice reveals that single Dll1high cells generate small, short-lived clones containing all four secretory cell types. Lineage specification thus occurs in immediate stem cell daughters through Notch lateral inhibition. Cultured Dll1high cells form long-lived organoids (mini-guts) on brief Wnt3A exposure. When Dll1high cells are genetically marked before tissue damage, stem cell tracing events occur. Thus, secretory progenitors exhibit plasticity by regaining stemness on damage."
https://openalex.org/W2130535352,"Epigenetic inheritance is more widespread in plants than in mammals, in part because mammals erase epigenetic information by germline reprogramming. We sequenced the methylome of three haploid cell types from developing pollen: the sperm cell, the vegetative cell, and their precursor, the postmeiotic microspore, and found that unlike in mammals the plant germline retains CG and CHG DNA methylation. However, CHH methylation is lost from retrotransposons in microspores and sperm cells and restored by de novo DNA methyltransferase guided by 24 nt small interfering RNA, both in the vegetative nucleus and in the embryo after fertilization. In the vegetative nucleus, CG methylation is lost from targets of DEMETER (DME), REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), and their homologs, which include imprinted loci and recurrent epialleles that accumulate corresponding small RNA and are premethylated in sperm. Thus genome reprogramming in pollen contributes to epigenetic inheritance, transposon silencing, and imprinting, guided by small RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2137761603,"Excitatory connections in cortex are clustered into groups of highly connected neurons. Here the authors examine the effect this clustering has on the dynamics of neuronal networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. Their model suggests that the reported variability in spontaneous and evoked spiking activity may result from clustered cortical architecture. Anatomical studies demonstrate that excitatory connections in cortex are not uniformly distributed across a network but instead exhibit clustering into groups of highly connected neurons. The implications of clustering for cortical activity are unclear. We studied the effect of clustered excitatory connections on the dynamics of neuronal networks that exhibited high spike time variability owing to a balance between excitation and inhibition. Even modest clustering substantially changed the behavior of these networks, introducing slow dynamics during which clusters of neurons transiently increased or decreased their firing rate. Consequently, neurons exhibited both fast spiking variability and slow firing rate fluctuations. A simplified model shows how stimuli bias networks toward particular activity states, thereby reducing firing rate variability as observed experimentally in many cortical areas. Our model thus relates cortical architecture to the reported variability in spontaneous and evoked spiking activity."
https://openalex.org/W1983518163,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers multidrug resistance in cancer cells. It also affects the absorption, distribution and clearance of cancer-unrelated drugs and xenobiotics. For these reasons, the structure and function of P-gp have been studied extensively for decades. Here we present biochemical characterization of P-gp from Caenorhabditis elegans and its crystal structure at a resolution of 3.4 ångströms. We find that the apparent affinities of P-gp for anticancer drugs actinomycin D and paclitaxel are approximately 4,000 and 100 times higher, respectively, in the membrane bilayer than in detergent. This affinity enhancement highlights the importance of membrane partitioning when a drug accesses the transporter in the membrane. Furthermore, the transporter in the crystal structure opens its drug pathway at the level of the membrane's inner leaflet. In the helices flanking the opening to the membrane, we observe extended loops that may mediate drug binding, function as hinges to gate the pathway or both. We also find that the interface between the transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which couples ATP hydrolysis to transport, contains a ball-and-socket joint and salt bridges similar to the ATP-binding cassette importers, suggesting that ATP-binding cassette exporters and importers may use similar mechanisms to achieve alternating access for transport. Finally, a model of human P-gp derived from the structure of C. elegans P-gp not only is compatible with decades of biochemical analysis, but also helps to explain perplexing functional data regarding the Phe335Ala mutant. These results increase our understanding of the structure and function of this important molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2101151845,"There is a pressing need to identify prognostic markers of metastatic disease and targets for treatment. Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling. Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the patients. These findings identify LIFR as a metastasis suppressor that functions through the Hippo-YAP pathway and has significant prognostic power."
https://openalex.org/W2152406028,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of SNPs that are associated with human traits and diseases. But, because the vast majority of these SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the genome, the mechanisms by which they promote disease risk have remained elusive. Employing a new methodology that combines cistromics, epigenomics and genotype imputation, we annotate the non-coding regions of the genome in breast cancer cells and systematically identify the functional nature of SNPs associated with breast cancer risk. Our results show that breast cancer risk-associated SNPs are enriched in the cistromes of FOXA1 and ESR1 and the epigenome of histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) in a cancer- and cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, the majority of the risk-associated SNPs modulate the affinity of chromatin for FOXA1 at distal regulatory elements, thereby resulting in allele-specific gene expression, which is exemplified by the effect of the rs4784227 SNP on the TOX3 gene within the 16q12.1 risk locus."
https://openalex.org/W1974786493,"In mammals, one of the most pronounced consequences of viral infection is the induction of type I interferons, cytokines with potent antiviral activity. Schlafen (Slfn) genes are a subset of interferon-stimulated early response genes (ISGs) that are also induced directly by pathogens via the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway. However, many ISGs are of unknown or incompletely understood function. Here we show that human SLFN11 potently and specifically abrogates the production of retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Our study revealed that SLFN11 has no effect on the early steps of the retroviral infection cycle, including reverse transcription, integration and transcription. Rather, SLFN11 acts at the late stage of virus production by selectively inhibiting the expression of viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner. We further find that SLFN11 binds transfer RNA, and counteracts changes in the tRNA pool elicited by the presence of HIV. Our studies identified a novel antiviral mechanism within the innate immune response, in which SLFN11 selectively inhibits viral protein synthesis in HIV-infected cells by means of codon-bias discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2103566565,"Long-term plasticity contributes to memory formation and sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation. However, it is unclear whether sleep slow oscillation by itself induces long-term plasticity that contributes to memory retention. Using in vivo prethalamic electrical stimulation at 1 Hz, which itself does not induce immediate potentiation of evoked responses, we investigated how the cortical evoked response was modulated by different states of vigilance. We found that somatosensory evoked potentials during wake were enhanced after a slow-wave sleep episode (with or without stimulation during sleep) as compared to a previous wake episode. In vitro, we determined that this enhancement has a postsynaptic mechanism that is calcium dependent, requires hyperpolarization periods (slow waves), and requires a coactivation of both AMPA and NMDA receptors. Our results suggest that long-term potentiation occurs during slow-wave sleep, supporting its contribution to memory."

https://openalex.org/W2064830032,"Astrocytes are proposed to participate in brain energy metabolism by supplying substrates to neurons from their glycogen stores and from glycolysis. However, the molecules involved in metabolic sensing and the molecular pathways responsible for metabolic coupling between different cell types in the brain are not fully understood. Here we show that a recently cloned bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) sensor, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), is highly expressed in astrocytes and becomes activated in response to HCO₃⁻ entry via the electrogenic NaHCO₃ cotransporter (NBC). Activated sAC increases intracellular cAMP levels, causing glycogen breakdown, enhanced glycolysis, and the release of lactate into the extracellular space, which is subsequently taken up by neurons for use as an energy substrate. This process is recruited over a broad physiological range of [K⁺](ext) and also during aglycemic episodes, helping to maintain synaptic function. These data reveal a molecular pathway in astrocytes that is responsible for brain metabolic coupling to neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2020784233,"Evan Eichler and colleagues report an estimate of the mutation rate in humans that is based on the whole-genome sequences of five parent-offspring trios from a Hutterite population and genotyping data from an extended pedigree. They use a new approach for estimating the mutation rate over multiple generations that takes into account the extensive autozygosity in this founder population. Knowledge of the rate and pattern of new mutation is critical to the understanding of human disease and evolution. We used extensive autozygosity in a genealogically well-defined population of Hutterites to estimate the human sequence mutation rate over multiple generations. We sequenced whole genomes from 5 parent-offspring trios and identified 44 segments of autozygosity. Using the number of meioses separating each pair of autozygous alleles and the 72 validated heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) from 512 Mb of autozygous DNA, we obtained an SNV mutation rate of 1.20 × 10−8 (95% confidence interval 0.89–1.43 × 10−8) mutations per base pair per generation. The mutation rate for bases within CpG dinucleotides (9.72 × 10−8) was 9.5-fold that of non-CpG bases, and there was strong evidence (P = 2.67 × 10−4) for a paternal bias in the origin of new mutations (85% paternal). We observed a non-uniform distribution of heterozygous SNVs (both newly identified and known) in the autozygous segments (P = 0.001), which is suggestive of mutational hotspots or sites of long-range gene conversion."

https://openalex.org/W2136246789,"Adaptive success in social animals depends on an ability to infer the likely actions of others. Little is known about the neural computations that underlie this capacity. Here, we show that the brain models the values and choices of others even when these values are currently irrelevant. These modeled choices use the same computations that underlie our own choices, but are resolved in a distinct neighboring medial prefrontal brain region. Crucially, however, when subjects choose on behalf of a partner instead of themselves, these regions exchange their functional roles. Hence, regions that represented values of the subject’s executed choices now represent the values of choices executed on behalf of the partner, and those that previously modeled the partner now model the subject. These data tie together neural computations underlying self-referential and social inference, and in so doing establish a new functional axis characterizing the medial wall of prefrontal cortex.

Valuation and choice for self and other exhibit parallel computations in PFC vmPFC computes choices that will be executed, whether for self or other Rostral dmPFC computes choices that are modeled, whether for self or other A similar gradient is present in temporoparietal cortex Across many species, behavior is driven by an ability to evaluate candidate actions with respect to one’s own motives. In social animals, the success of different actions may also depend on the preferences and actions of other individuals. Thus, adaptive success crucially depends on our ability to make inferences about the motives, values, and likely actions of others. In human behavior, this social valuation process is often a dominant factor shaping decisions. For example, a central factor determining the value of a new property is what the buyer believes other people will pay for it when it is later resold. When purchasing a new piece of clothing, the buyer (if not a neuroscientist) will often consider how it will appear in the eyes of others. In the human brain, two neighboring regions of medial prefrontal cortex are often implicated in these two different functions (Amodio and Frith, 2006Amodio D.M. Frith C.D. Meeting of minds: the medial frontal cortex and social cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). In studies of decision making and neuroeconomics, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) consistently reflects an individual’s subjective valuation (Behrens et al., 2008Behrens T.E. Hunt L.T.

One possibility is that the ability to impute the intentions (Frith and Frith, 2006Frith C.D. Frith U. The neural basis of mentalizing.Neuron. 2006; 50: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) and predict the actions (Behrens et al., 2008Behrens T.E. Hunt L.T. Woolrich M.W. Rushworth M.F. Associative learning of social value.Nature. 2008; 456: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) of others derives from the same mechanisms that allow us to reflect on our own goals and actions (Amodio and Frith, 2006Amodio D.M. Frith C.D. Meeting of minds: the medial frontal cortex and social cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar; Buckner and Carroll, 2007Buckner R.L.

Inferences about mental states.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Such a theory is appealing, as it would allow a computational understanding of goal-directed choice to be extended to social inferences. However, this idea is difficult to reconcile with the existence of brain regions that appear specialized for processing self and other. Instead, it raises the intriguing possibility that a functional specialization in rostromedial prefrontal cortex (and in related temporoparietal cortex; Mitchell, 2008Mitchell J.P. Activity in right temporo-parietal junction is not selective for theory-of-mind.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar; Saxe and Wexler, 2005Saxe R. Wexler A. Making sense of another mind: the role of the right temporo-parietal junction.Neuropsychologia. 2005; 43: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) is driven more by differences between choices that are executed versus those that are imagined or modeled. Teasing these two possible functional architectures apart is problematic as they are almost always aligned in cognitive tasks, where self-choices tend to be executed and others’ actions and intentions modeled. Here, we describe neural signals that compute the choice preferences of another individual, whether or not they are relevant to the current choice. These signals precisely mirror well-studied signals reflecting personal choice preferences. Furthermore, by designing situations in which values of self and other may be either modeled or executed, we show that the functional gradient in the medial prefrontal cortex does not align with the individual, but is dependent on whether choices are executed by the subject or instead are modeled without overt execution. To examine neural computations for self and others in medial prefrontal cortex, we designed a delegated intertemporal decision-making task (Figure 1A). Subjects chose between a large monetary reward delivered later, and a small reward delivered sooner. Critically, we asked subjects to choose for themselves in some trials, but in other trials to choose on the basis of what a partner participant would have chosen in the same context (Figure 1A). It is known that different individuals display significant variability in their preferences, with “low-discounters” preferring to wait for a later higher-value option and “high-discounters” preferring the more immediate smaller reward (Kable and Glimcher, 2007Kable J.W. Glimcher P.W. The neural correlates of subjective value during intertemporal choice.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). This behavioral variability is quantified by estimating a subject’s unique “discount rate,” a parameter that captures an individual’s disposition to discount the value of delayed relative to more immediate reward. We were interested in neural signals that distinguish the two individuals both in terms of their subjective valuations and in terms of their choices. In previous studies of value comparison, vmPFC activity has been found to correlate with the subjective value difference between chosen and unchosen options (Basten et al., 2010Basten U. Biele G. Heekeren H.R. Fiebach C.J. How the brain integrates costs and benefits during decision making.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 21767-21772Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; Boorman et al., 2009Boorman E.D. Behrens T.E. Woolrich M.W. Rushworth M.F. How green is the grass on the other side?

Seymour B. Dolan R.J. The role of human orbitofrontal cortex in value comparison for incommensurable objects.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8388-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because this signal distinguishes between chosen and unchosen values, it is assumed that this region accesses both subjective values and choice (Wunderlich et al., 2010Wunderlich K. Rangel A. O’Doherty J.P. Economic choices can be made using only stimulus values.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 15005-15010Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In our delegated choice task, however, there are four different values to consider (Figure 1B). We reasoned that a signal that represents the subject’s own choices would correlate with the difference in valuations between the subject’s preferred and nonpreferred options (Basten et al., 2010Basten U. Biele G. Heekeren H.R. Fiebach C.J. How the brain integrates costs and benefits during decision making.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 21767-21772Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; Boorman et al., 2009Boorman E.D. Behrens T.E. Woolrich M.W. Rushworth M.F. How green is the grass on the other side?

Seymour B. Dolan R.J. The role of human orbitofrontal cortex in value comparison for incommensurable objects.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8388-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Similarly, a signal that represents the partner’s choices should also reflect a value difference signal, but here computed according both to the partner’s own values and choice preferences (i.e., the partner’s valuation of the option that the partner would have chosen minus the partner’s valuation of the option that the partner would have left unchosen) (Figure 1B). Crucially, we required that these two value difference signals (self and other) could be identified simultaneously in evoked brain activity. We took two steps to ensure this would be the case (see Supplemental Information for more detail and Figure S1 available online). First, we prescreened 87 potential participants, using their choices in an online intertemporal choice questionnaire to estimate their individual discount rate. Twenty participants were then paired for the main experiment, such that each pair of individuals comprised one high and one low discounter. Consequently, by design, there would be many trials where the two partners express preference for different options (Figure 1B; Table S1). Second, we optimized the selection of intertemporal choices presented in the scanner such that the subjective value signals of the two participants (determined by their unique discount rates) would be maximally decorrelated (Figure 1C). An example of how this approach decorrelates the different choice variables can be found in the Supplemental Information. Prior to scanning, ten pairs of subjects completed a trial-and-error learning session in which they each could learn their partner’s preferences from their online prescreen questionnaire choices (Figure 1D; see Supplemental Information). Partners then met each other and were subsequently each scanned, with their partner viewing from the operator room. During fMRI scanning, participants were presented with a new set of intertemporal choices in blocks of 40 trials. In each block, the subject in the scanner made choices either on behalf of themselves, or on behalf of their partner. At the end of the experiment, two of their actual choices would be realized: one prize randomly selected from the self-regarding blocks would go to the subject, and one from the other-regarding blocks would go to the partner. We reasoned that, if the functional organization of medial frontal cortex is tied to the frame of reference of the individual (Behrens et al., 2009Behrens T.E. Hunt L.T. Rushworth M.F. The computation of social behavior.Science. 2009; 324: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar; Jenkins et al., 2008Jenkins A.C. Macrae C.N. Mitchell J.P. Repetition suppression of ventromedial prefrontal activity during judgments of self and others.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4507-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), then the vmPFC signal would always reflect the subject’s own value difference and the rostral dmPFC always reflect their partner’s value difference. In other words, the mPFC would show a functional gradient along an axis of self (ventrally) to other (dorsally). In contrast, if the organization is tied to the relevance of valuation for current choice, then this axis would show a gradient of executed values (i.e., self values during self choice and other values during other choice) to modeled values (i.e., other values during self choice and self values during other choice). To test these two opposing hypotheses, we recomputed subject’s discount rates and resultant valuations on the basis of the choices made in the scanner and identified regions of the brain that correlated with value difference averaged across both reference frames (Figure 2A), i.e., highlighting value-sensitive regions independently from their preferred frame. Within these regions, we tested whether there was a functional gradient along an axis of either self versus other, or executed versus modeled. We identified a large value-sensitive region spanning the medial wall of the rostral PFC (Figure 2A), which provided a functional mask reflecting any value difference encoding that was orthogonal to the statistical tests subsequently performed. Within this mask, no gradient was apparent when we compared self to partner value differences, but a clear ventral-dorsal gradient was immediately apparent when we compared executed to modeled value differences (Figure 2B), with more ventral regions reflecting executed and more dorsal regions modeled choices. To perform a formal test of these differences, we fitted a regression slope to data extracted at five distinct locations spanning a ventral-dorsal axis (Figure 2A; Figure S2). Put simply, we tested whether there was a linear relationship between spatial position and functional coding. Across the group, we found a significant gradient along an executed/modeled axis (t[18] = 6.28, z = 4.513, p < 0.00001), but no such gradient for self versus other (t[18] = −1.06, z = −1.02 p > 0.30). The difference between these two gradients, indicative of the two candidate functional organizations, survived a formal comparison (paired t[18] = 6.18, z = 4.47, p < 0.00001; Figure 2C). We also note that, among other regions implicated in valuation, a similar gradient was exhibited in temporoparietal cortex (TPC) (x = −34 to −54, y = −54, z = 20 to 38, t[18] = 4.25, z = 3.49, p < 0.0005). Again, no such gradient could be found when we analyzed the data in the frame of reference of self versus other, and again the difference in the two candidate regression slopes survived formal statistical comparison (paired t[18] = 3.1, z = 2.74, p < 0.01; Figure 2C). These data identify a dorsal-ventral functional organization of the medial PFC that does not follow a frame of reference of self versus other, but instead is tied to a frame of reference of executed versus modeled choices. To explore the data that underlies this functional gradient, we looked at activity that correlated with subjective preference-related activity separately under each choice condition (choice for self or for other). In blocks where subjects chose on behalf of themselves, activity in vmPFC correlated with the difference between the subject’s valuation (discounted by their own discount rate) for the chosen and unchosen options (Figure 3A), thus reflecting their personal choice preferences (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] atlas 12, 53, −11, t = 3.31, z = 2.76). Simultaneously, dmPFC activity also exhibited a value difference correlate but here values were discounted according to the partner’s discount rate, and the relevant value difference was between the partner’s preferred and nonpreferred choices (MNI 3, 41, 25, t = 5.00, z = 3.75). Hence in self-choice trials, despite the fact that the partner’s valuation bore no relevance to the task, dmPFC activity nevertheless reflected the experimental subject’s estimate of their partner’s preferences. As predicted by the gradient analysis, we observed a dramatically different pattern of activity during the delegated choice condition (Figure 3B). When subjects now made choices on behalf of their partner, these regions precisely swapped agents, such that the vmPFC now maintained an estimate of the partner’s values, expressed in the frame of reference of the choices made on behalf of the partner (MNI −6, 23, −11, t = 7.36, z = 4.94). Conversely, the dmPFC now reflected the subject’s own values, signed according to the choices that the subject themselves would have preferred in the same context (MNI 0, 50, 19, t = 4.01, z = 3.34). Accordingly, when we searched for regions that contained a conjunction of voxels responding to both types of executed, or choice-relevant, value differences (p < 0.05) we recovered a signal in vmPFC. At the same threshold, a region within dmPFC contained voxels representing modeled, or choice-irrelevant, value difference, be it those of the subject or those of the partner (Figure 3C). The data presented in Figures 3A and 3B are not multiple comparison corrected and therefore do not constitute formal tests. We present these data to illustrate the effects in the individual conditions that underlie the formal tests of interaction. In order to provide a formal test that the regions switched agents between conditions, we designed a test that selected peaks exclusively from one choice condition and extracted data from these peaks in the alternative choice condition. Thus, peaks isolated from self-choice trials were used to assess data in other-choice trials, and vice versa. This test obviates questions of multiple comparisons, as peaks are selected from one set of data and tested in the independent alternative data set. From within the value-coding region shown in Figure 2A, we selected the peaks that correlated maximally with “self value-difference relative to other value-difference” and with “other value-difference relative to self value-difference” in each of self-choice and other-choice conditions. As predicted by the gradient analysis (Figure 2), this resulted in two peaks at the ventral extreme of the rmPFC (peak MNI −12, 26, −11, t = 3.57, z = 3.06 for self choices; peak MNI −3, 17, −8, t = 4.10, z = 3.40 for other choices) and two peaks at the dorsal extreme (peak MNI 3, 44, 25, t = 4.35, z = 3.55 for self choices; peak MNI 9, 38, 43, t = 5.06, z = 3.94 for other choices) in each condition. We therefore labeled these peaks vmPFC and dmPFC. We then extracted data from these peaks in the alternative condition. This allowed us to test several predictions that the regions switched agents between conditions, as detailed statistically in Figure 3D. In brief, vmPFC showed significant effects of self values, but not other values, during self-choice, and other values, but not self values, during other-choice. The interaction within vmPFC demonstrated that vmPFC switched its value coding. dmPFC showed significant effects of other values, but not self values, during self choice, and self values, but not other values, during other choice. Again, the interaction within dmPFC demonstrated a switched coding pattern. Finally, the formal three-way interaction between brain region, value-scheme and choice condition demonstrated that the two regions switched their coding in opposite fashions, and hence exchanged agents. Specifically, vmPFC always represented the values relevant for choice, while dmPFC always tracked the values irrelevant for choice (Figure 3D). As temporoparietal cortex had exhibited a similar gradient to rmPFC, we also subjected this region to the test described above. That is, we tested whether neighboring subregions of temporoparietal cortex exchanged agents in the different choice conditions. Again, within a mask defined by the average value effect over both agents, we applied the same procedure in which peaks were selected from one choice condition, and data extracted from the other (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This analysis revealed that, as in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral extremes of temporoparietal cortex exchanged agents between conditions. This was true whether data were averaged across hemispheres (Figure 3D) or tested independently in each hemisphere (Figure S3A). Understanding the values and predicting the actions of other individuals is important for all social animals. In humans, social factors impinge on almost every decision that we make. Here, we show that when we make a value-dependent choice, other people’s values and preferences are represented in regionally distinct patterns of neural activity. Notably, the values of other people were identified with the same computational regressor (value difference) used to identify personal subjective values in imaging and single unit physiology studies (Basten et al., 2010Basten U.

However, it was not the case that value computations for self and other were constrained to particular brain regions. Instead, the two representations swapped locations, both in the prefrontal cortex and in the temporoparietal cortex, depending on which valuation was relevant to the expression of a current choice. The two prefrontal brain regions that form the central focus of our study have been extensively studied in neuroeconomics and social neuroscience. The vmPFC is a region that lies on the boundary of the pregenual cingulate cortex (areas 32,25), the orbitofrontal cortex (area 14) and the medial polar cortex (medial area 10). It is a region commonly implicated in stimulus valuation (Hare et al., 2011Hare T.A. Schultz W. Camerer C.F. O’Doherty J.P. Rangel A.

In the retina, this includes predicting how the integration of signals across visual space shapes the outputs of retinal ganglion cells. Existing models of this process generalize poorly to predict responses to new stimuli. This failure arises in part from properties of the ganglion cell response that are not well captured by standard receptive-field mapping techniques: nonlinear spatial integration and fine-scale heterogeneities in spatial sampling. Here we characterize a ganglion cell's spatial receptive field using a mechanistic model based on measurements of the physiological properties and connectivity of only the primary excitatory circuitry of the retina. The resulting simplified circuit model successfully predicts ganglion-cell responses to a variety of spatial patterns and thus provides a direct correspondence between circuit connectivity and retinal output."

With its small nervous system, Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system in which to understand how the dynamics of neural activity control this search behaviour. Extensive work on the nematode has identified the neurons that are necessary for the different locomotory behaviours underlying chemotaxis through the use of laser ablation, activity recording in immobilized animals and the study of mutants. However, we do not know the neural activity patterns in C. elegans that are sufficient to control its complex chemotactic behaviour. To understand how the activity in its interneurons coordinate different motor programs to lead the animal to food, here we used optogenetics and new optical tools to manipulate neural activity directly in freely moving animals to evoke chemotactic behaviour. By deducing the classes of activity patterns triggered during chemotaxis and exciting individual neurons with these patterns, we identified interneurons that control the essential locomotory programs for this behaviour. Notably, we discovered that controlling the dynamics of activity in just one interneuron pair (AIY) was sufficient to force the animal to locate, turn towards and track virtual light gradients. Two distinct activity patterns triggered in AIY as the animal moved through the gradient controlled reversals and gradual turns to drive chemotactic behaviour. Because AIY neurons are post-synaptic to most chemosensory and thermosensory neurons, it is probable that these activity patterns in AIY have an important role in controlling and coordinating different taxis behaviours of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1981388324,"The final cytokinesis event involves severing of the connecting intercellular bridge (ICB) between daughter cells. FIP3-positive recycling endosomes (FIP3 endosomes) and ESCRT complexes have been implicated in mediating the final stages of cytokinesis. Here we analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, FIP3-endosome fusion and ESCRT-III localization during cytokinesis to show that the ICB narrows by a FIP3-endosome-mediated secondary ingression, whereas the ESCRT-III complex is needed only for the last scission step of cytokinesis. We characterize the role of FIP3 endosomes during cytokinesis to demonstrate that FIP3 endosomes deliver SCAMP2/3 and p50RhoGAP to the ICB during late telophase, proteins required for the formation of the secondary ingression. We also show that the FIP3-endosome-induced secondary ingression is required for the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex to the abscission site. Finally, we characterize a FIP3-endosome-dependent regulation of the ICB cortical actin network through the delivery of p50RhoGAP. These results provide a framework for the coordinated efforts of actin, FIP3 endosomes and the ESCRTs to regulate cytokinesis and abscission."

Recent studies suggest that transcriptional repression may underlie these events. To identify transcriptional repressors, we compared the transcriptomes of MG and MG-derived progenitors and identified insm1a, a repressor exhibiting a biphasic pattern of expression that is essential for retina regeneration. Insm1a was found to suppress ascl1a and its own expression, and link injury-dependent ascl1a induction with the suppression of the Wnt inhibitor dickkopf (dkk), which is necessary for MG dedifferentiation. We also found that Insm1a was responsible for sculpting the zone of injury-responsive MG by suppressing hb-egf(a) expression. Finally, we provide evidence that Insm1a stimulates progenitor cell-cycle exit by suppressing a genetic program driving progenitor proliferation. Our studies identify Insm1a as a key regulator of retina regeneration and provide a mechanistic understanding of how it contributes to multiple phases of this process."

https://openalex.org/W1984085143,"Metastasis, which remains incompletely characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels, is a highly specific process. Despite the ability of disseminated cancer cells to intravasate into distant tissues, it has been long recognized that only a limited subset of target organs develop clinically overt metastases. Therefore, subsequent adaptation of disseminated cancer cells to foreign tissue microenvironment determines the metastatic latency and tissue tropism of these cells. As a result, studying interactions between the disseminated cancer cells and the adjacent stromal cells will provide a better understanding of what constitutes a favorable or unfavorable microenvironment for disseminated cancer cells in a tissue-specific manner. Previously, we reported a protein signature of brain metastasis showing increased ability of brain metastatic breast cancer cells to counteract oxidative stress. In this study, we showed that another protein from the brain metastatic protein signature, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), has a dual function of regulating the metastatic growth of metastatic breast cancer cells and reducing the activation of immune response in the brain. More importantly, increased NT-3 secretion in metastatic breast cancer cells results in a reversion of mesenchymal-like (EMT) state to epithelial-like (MET) state and vice versa. Ectopic expression of NT-3 in EMT-like breast cancer cells reduces their migratory ability and increases the expression of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and E-cadherin at the cell–cell junction. In addition, both endogenous and ectopic expression of NT-3 reduced the number of fully activated cytotoxic microglia. In summary, NT-3 appears to promote growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain by facilitating the re-epithelialization of metastatic breast cancer cells and downmodulating the cytotoxic response of microglia. Most importantly, our results provide new insights into the latency and development of central nervous system macrometastases in patients with HER2-positive breast tumors and provide mechanistic rationale to target HER2 signaling for HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis."

Consistently, overexpression of the essential hadABC genes encoding the (3R)-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratases resulted in more than a 16- and 80-fold increase in the resistance of M. tuberculosis to ISO and TAC, respectively.

Subthreshold EPSP-like waveforms also activated a large component of transient sodium current, but IPSP-like waveforms engaged primarily persistent sodium current with only a small additional transient component.

A noninvasive technology that quantitatively measures the activity of oncogenic signaling pathways could have a broad impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment with targeted therapies.

The use of 89Zr-transferrin produces high-contrast PET images that quantitatively reflect treatment-induced changes in MYC-regulated TFRC expression in a MYC-driven prostate cancer xenograft model. Moreover, 89Zr-transferrin imaging can detect the in situ development of prostate cancer in a transgenic MYC prostate cancer model, as well as in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) before histological or anatomic evidence of invasive cancer.

Here, we show that VEGF-A-inducible phosphorylation of Pfn-1 at Tyr 129 is critical for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Chemotactic activation of VEGF receptor kinase-2 (VEGFR2) and Src induces Pfn-1 phosphorylation in the cell leading edge, promoting Pfn-1 binding to actin and actin polymerization. Conditional endothelial knock-in of phosphorylation-deficient Pfn1(Y129F) in mice reveals that Pfn-1 phosphorylation is critical for angiogenesis in response to wounding and ischaemic injury, but not for developmental angiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2158571482,"In congenital neutropenia, myeloid-lineage differentiation in response to the cytokine G-CSF is defective. Julia Skokowa et al. now show that an interplay among three proteins—the adapter proteins HCLS1 and HAX1 and the transcription factor LEF-1—is required for G-CSF–triggered granulocytic differentiation, and they provide evidence that this pathway is dysregulated in both congenital neutropenia and acute myeloid leukemia. We found that hematopoietic cell–specific Lyn substrate 1 (HCLS1 or HS1) is highly expressed in human myeloid cells and that stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) leads to HCLS1 phosphorylation. HCLS1 binds the transcription factor lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1), transporting LEF-1 into the nucleus upon G-CSF stimulation and inducing LEF-1 autoregulation. In patients with severe congenital neutropenia, inherited mutations in the gene encoding HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) lead to profound defects in G-CSF–triggered phosphorylation of HCLS1 and subsequently to reduced autoregulation and expression of LEF-1. Consistent with these results, HCLS1-deficient mice are neutropenic. In bone marrow biopsies of the majority of tested patients with acute myeloid leukemia, HCLS1 protein expression is substantially elevated, associated with high levels of G-CSF synthesis and, in some individuals, a four-residue insertion in a proline-rich region of HCLS1 protein known to accelerate intracellular signaling. These data demonstrate the importance of HCLS1 in myelopoiesis in vitro and in vivo."

The pore association of Nup50 was further characterized by immunoelectron microscopy, which mapped Nup50 to the basket element of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), 3The abbreviations used are: NPCnuclear pore complexNLSnuclear localization signalEGFPenhanced GFPRGGRev-GFP-glucocorticoid receptorBS1/2binding segment 1/2. in close proximity to Nup153 (5Guan T.

Although there is not complete agreement on the precise mechanism by which Nup50 contributes to import, its interactions with soluble transport factors are well characterized. In this regard, Nup50 has three main functional domains: an N-terminal region that interacts with importin α (N); a central region, with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs shared by many nucleoporins, that provides a docking site for importin β (F); and a C-terminal region that confers binding to the transport regulator Ran (R) (see Fig. 1A) (10Moore M.S. Npap60: a new player in nuclear protein import.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 61-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Yoneda and co-workers (11Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y.

Cell. 2010; 21: 630-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently extended this groundwork by comparing the two main isoforms of Nup50, which arise from alternative splicing and differ in the extreme N-terminal sequences (see Fig. 1A). This divergence lies at a critical region, where Nup50 binds to importin α. Thus, although the distinction between the isoforms is quite discrete, it results in significantly different behavior with respect to the ability of Nup50 to displace the cognate nuclear localization signal (NLS) cargo of importin α. To date, the focus for Nup50 analysis has been on its interfaces with soluble transport factors, and this has been very informative with respect to building functional models (8Matsuura Y. Stewart M.

Biol. 2009; 16: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, consideration of Nup50 function needs to further incorporate the fact that, in the context of the nuclear pore, Nup153 provides not just a targeting site but also a broader scaffold that likely influences the role of Nup50. Here, we have characterized the Nup153-Nup50 partnership to provide critical information about the context of Nup50 function. Mammalian plasmids that express an enhanced GFP (EGFP) fusion of Nup50 and its domains were generated by cloning their PCR fragments into the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech). A plasmid encoding a HA-tagged version of the Nup50 N terminus was established by replacing the EGFP gene with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding 3×HA. To make integration plasmids for T-REx HeLa cells, genes cloned into the pEGFP-N2 vector described above were digested with BglII and NotI, and the resultant fragments were ligated into the BamHI and NotI sites of pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). A bacterial expression plasmid that expresses GST fused to Nup153(401–609) was generated by cloning this region as a PCR fragment into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Escherichia coli expression plasmids for T7-tagged versions of Nup153 and its N-terminal deletion mutant were described by Dimaano et al. (14Dimaano C. Ball J.R. Prunuske A.J. Ullman K.S. RNA association defines a functionally conserved domain in the nuclear pore protein Nup153.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45349-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T-REx HeLa cells containing genes encoding the Tet repressor and Flp recombination target site were a kind gift from Drs. Dobrikova and Gromeier (Duke University) (15Kaiser C. Dobrikova E.Y.

To establish stable cell lines, the parental cells were cotransfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO containing genes of interest and pOG44 (Invitrogen), which expresses Flp recombinase, and selected in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B and 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin. Protein expression in the established cell lines was stimulated with 0.3 μg/ml doxycycline in medium without selection drugs for 24–48 h. HeLa cells were harvested after trypsinization and two washes with ice-cold PBS. For immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown assays, cells were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm magnesium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 μm PMSF, and 0.1 mm sodium fluoride) or in PBS lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) with cOmplete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and then incubated on ice for 5 min. For Western blotting, cells were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS) and then incubated on ice for 5 min. Bacteria harvested by centrifugation were frozen once, resuspended in E. coli lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 400 μg/ml lysozyme, and then incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking. After lysis, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. The levels of recombinant protein were normalized by mixing with bacterial lysate without expressed protein to achieve approximately similar levels (determined by Western analysis) of the T7-tagged fusion protein in each input. Bacterial lysates containing GST, GST-Nup50, and GST-Nup153(401–609) were incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C with rotation. Proteins were eluted from the beads with E. coli lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 20 mm reduced glutathione. Eluates were dialyzed overnight against lysis buffer without Triton X-100 at 4 °C. 500 μg of mammalian cell lysate (1 mg/ml) was incubated with GST and GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the incubation, beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, and proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer. GFP fusion proteins were retrieved from mammalian cell lysates using GFP-Trap A beads (ChromoTek). 500 μg of mammalian cell lysate (1 mg/ml) containing the appropriate EGFP fusion protein was incubated with the beads at 4 °C for 15 min with rotation. After the reaction, the beads were washed three times with mammalian lysis buffer at 4 °C and incubated with SDS sample buffer to elute proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (16Mackay D.R. Elgort S.W. Ullman K.S. The nucleoporin Nup153 has separable roles in both early mitotic progression and the resolution of mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For live import assay, HeLa cells were grown in CO2-independent medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (Invitrogen). Following cotransfection with Rev-GFP-glucocorticoid receptor (RGG) (17Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Reconstitution of HIV-1 Rev nuclear export: independent requirements for nuclear import and export.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and constructs encoding either mCherry fused to Nup153(401–609) or mCherry alone, cells were seeded in 4-well Lab-Tek II chambers (Thermo Scientific) coated with fibronectin. After 24 h, dexamethasone was added to a final concentration of 25 nm. Images were acquired with a DeltaVision system every 3 min for 40 min at 37 °C using a 20× objective. Image analysis and intensity measurements were performed on background subtracted images of specific time points in ImageJ. Thresholds were applied to GFP montages to measure total raw integrated intensity. Freehand selections were used to measure raw integrated intensity of nuclei. Nup50 is an established protein partner of Nup153 (4Smitherman M. Lee K. Swanger J. Kapur R. Clurman B.E.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5631-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the two proteins share specific attributes. Both associate with protein phosphatase complexes (18Moorhead G.B. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Nimick M. De Wever V. Campbell D.G. Gourlay R. Lam Y.W. Lamond A.I.

Repo-Man coordinates chromosomal reorganization with nuclear envelope reassembly during mitotic exit.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 328-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and both are highly mobile nuclear pore proteins (7Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Mapping the dynamic organization of the nuclear pore complex inside single living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). They are also both recruited relatively early during the process of post-mitotic NPC formation (20Dultz E. Zanin E. Wurzenberger C. Braun M. Rabut G. Sironi L. Ellenberg J. Systematic kinetic analysis of mitotic dis- and reassembly of the nuclear pore in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some of the assays underlying these observations also point to distinctions between the two nucleoporins, as their off-rates from the pore are different, and their recruitment to newly forming pores is not in precise synchrony (7Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Mapping the dynamic organization of the nuclear pore complex inside single living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 20Dultz E. Zanin E. Wurzenberger C. Braun M. Rabut G. Sironi L. Ellenberg J. Systematic kinetic analysis of mitotic dis- and reassembly of the nuclear pore in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, although Nup50 and Nup153 overlap spatially and participate in similar processes (likely in concert), a fundamental question that has not been addressed is whether this partnership is limited to a subset of Nup50 found in the cell. We observed that relatively little Nup50 co-precipitated in an immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nup153 (supplemental Fig. S1). Because the absolute level of co-immunoprecipitation is influenced by the arbitrary conditions of the experiment, we tested whether a limited pool of Nup50 associates with Nup153 by challenging the system with exogenous GFP-Nup50. If the lack of efficient co-precipitation were due simply to a failure to maintain the association during the procedure, GFP-Nup50 would be predicted to be recovered in the same proportion relative to its input and independent of endogenous Nup50 recovery. In contrast, if the population of Nup153 available for interaction with Nup50 is limited, then the total levels of Nup50 recovered would be restricted, and GFP-Nup50 would displace comparable levels of endogenous Nup50. For this experiment, we expressed the Nup50L isoform, as this is the isoform we confirmed was expressed in the line of HeLa cells used here (supplemental Fig. S1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, despite robust levels of GFP-Nup50 expression (lane 2), its recovery (lane 6) did not exceed the recovery of endogenous Nup50 in the presence of control GFP protein expression (lane 5), and in fact, endogenous Nup50 recovery was reduced in the presence of GFP-Nup50 (lane 6 versus lane 5). This could be due to limiting levels of Nup153 or to other factors that affect accessibility of the two partners. In either case, models that integrate the context of Nup153 in understanding the role of Nup50 must account for a limited pool of Nup50 in association with Nup153 at any one time (see “Discussion”). To better understand the molecular determinants of the Nup50-Nup153 partnership, expression constructs encoding either full-length Nup50 or domain fragments were expressed as GFP fusions in HeLa cells. Proteins with the GFP moiety were then recovered from cell lysates using a previously employed affinity-trap method (21Rothbauer U. Zolghadr K. Muyldermans S. Schepers A. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. A versatile nanotrap for biochemical and functional studies with fluorescent fusion proteins.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 282-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and probed for the co-precipitation of Nup153. The N-terminal domain of Nup50 robustly isolated Nup153, whereas the central FG domain region (F) or the Ran-binding region (R) had no detectable interaction despite equivalent expression and recovery. Notably, Nup153 associated to a similar degree with both short and long isoforms of Nup50, whether in the context of the full-length protein or the N-terminal domain fragment (Fig. 2). To next determine the interface on Nup153 that mediates interaction with Nup50, fragments of Nup153 corresponding to its unique N-terminal domain (N), tandem zinc finger domain (Z), or FG-rich C-terminal domain (C) were expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). These GFP fusions proteins were then recovered and probed for the co-isolation of endogenous Nup50. Both the N- and C-terminal domains were found to recover Nup50, although interaction with the C-terminal domain of Nup153 was somewhat less robust (Fig. 3B). As the N-terminal region of Nup50 accounted for interaction with Nup153 (Fig. 2), we next specifically tested if the Nup50 N-terminal domain binds to these two distinct regions within Nup153. We further wanted to probe both Nup50 isoforms for the two contacts with Nup153. HA-tagged Nup50 N-terminal domain constructs representing both the short and long isoforms were therefore expressed along with the same panel of Nup153-derived GFP fusion proteins. The N-terminal domain from Nup50L indeed interacted with both Nup153-N and Nup153-C (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 12). In contrast, whereas the Nup50S N-terminal domain was recovered proportionately to input with Nup153-N, little was recovered with Nup153-C (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 11), suggesting that the sequence differences between these isoforms selectively impact one interface with Nup153. To test for direct binding as well as to map the determinants of Nup50 binding to Nup153 more finely, we produced a series of N-terminal truncations of Nup153 in E. coli. Bacterial lysates were then incubated with GST-Nup50L or GST alone. Full-length Nup153 and several constructs with residues truncated from the N-terminal end of this nucleoporin were recovered specifically with GST-Nup50L (Fig. 4A, lanes 11–14), strongly suggesting a direct interaction between Nup50 and Nup153. When the full-length N-terminal domain of Nup153 was deleted (Δ609), the Nup50-binding activity lost (Fig. 4A, lane 15). In contrast, truncation of the first 400 amino acids (Δ400) retained full binding capacity (Fig. 4A, lane 14). This result identifies residues between positions 401 and 609 (Fig. 3A, gray box) as necessary for this interaction. To determine whether these residues are sufficient for interaction with Nup50, this small region was expressed as a fusion protein with GFP and recovered as before. The co-isolation observed for endogenous Nup50L with Nup153(401–609) (Fig. 4B, lane 4) establishes this distal part of the Nup153 N-terminal domain as sufficient for contact with Nup50. Expressing a GFP fusion of this fragment was also found to reduce recovery of Nup50 in a Nup153 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4C). Although contact between Nup153-N and Nup50 may not be restricted to this region, this experiment confirms the necessity of this interface for Nup50-Nup153 interaction. Next, to investigate the contribution of this interface to the localization of Nup50, we engineered HeLa cells to inducibly express the minimal binding fragment (Nup153(401–609)). Induction of this fragment did not alter the levels of Nup50 or other basket nucleoporins (Fig. 5A). Under non-induced conditions, Nup50 was detected throughout the nucleus and at the nuclear rim (Fig. 5B), consistent with its dynamic localization at the NPC (7Rabut G. Doye V. Ellenberg J. Mapping the dynamic organization of the nuclear pore complex inside single living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and its additional nucleoplasmic roles (22Kalverda B. Pickersgill H. Shloma V.V. Fornerod M. Nucleoporins directly stimulate expression of developmental and cell cycle genes inside the nucleoplasm.Cell. 2010; 140: 360-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The specificity of this pattern was confirmed by pretreating cells with Nup50-specific siRNA and similarly performing immunolocalization of Nup50 (supplemental Fig. S2). A reduction in signal at both the rim and nucleoplasm was seen using two independent siRNAs. In the presence of doxycycline-induced GFP-Nup153(401–609), the population of Nup50 at the rim of the nucleus was notably reduced (Fig. 5B) compared with either the non-induced cells or cells induced to express GFP alone. This implicates the Nup153 N-terminal site of interaction as a key determinant of Nup50 NPC targeting. Importantly, expression of this fragment did not alter the localization of Nup153 itself, and it did not interfere with the localization of the nuclear pore basket component Tpr (Fig. 5C), which binds an adjacent region of Nup153 (6Hase M.E. Cordes V.C. Direct interaction with Nup153 mediates binding of Tpr to the periphery of the nuclear pore complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1923-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The lack of detectable binding upon deletion of the Nup153 N-terminal domain in the context of recombinant proteins (Fig. 4A) suggested that interaction between Nup50 and the Nup153 C-terminal domain requires an additional factor(s). Moreover, any bridging factors are likely to interact differentially with the short and long isoforms of the Nup50, as the isoforms differ in their interaction with Nup153-C (Fig. 3C). These data pointed to importin α as a good candidate for modulating the interaction of Nup50 with Nup153-C. Both binding segments BS1 and BS2 make contact with importin α (8Matsuura Y. Stewart M. Nup50/Npap60 function in nuclear protein import complex disassembly and importin recycling.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3681-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Pumroy R.A. Nardozzi J.D. Hart D.J. Root M.J. Cingolani G. Nucleoporin Nup50 stabilizes closed conformation of armadillo repeat 10 in importin α5.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2022-2031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but BS1 is not present in the short form of Nup50 (Fig. 1A). The resulting absence of contact sites for Nup50S in the minor NLS-binding site of importin α results in lower affinity between the short Nup50 isoform and importin α compared with the long isoform (Fig. 6B, lane 7 versus lane 9). To test for a role of importin α in the Nup50-Nup153 interaction, residues within the BS2 region of Nup50 critical to the Nup50-importin α interface (8Matsuura Y. Stewart M. Nup50/Npap60 function in nuclear protein import complex disassembly and importin recycling.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3681-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were mutated. This five-amino acid substitution (Fig. 6A) was previously found to disrupt association with importin α (Fig. 6B, lane 9 versus lane 10) (9Lindsay M.E. Plafker K. Smith A.E. Clurman B.E. Macara I.G.

Miyamoto Y. Asally M. Oka M. Yasuda Y. Yoneda Y. Two isoforms of Npap60 (Nup50) differentially regulate nuclear protein import.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 630-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epitope (HA)-tagged versions of the Nup50L N-terminal domain in either wild-type or mutant form were coexpressed with GFP fusion proteins of Nup153 domain fragments (Fig. 6C). Recovery of these GFP fusion proteins again revealed an interaction with both the N- and C-terminal regions of Nup153 (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, whereas both wild-type and mutant Nup50 associated equivalently with Nup153-N (Fig. 6C, lanes 7 and 8), mutation of Nup50 abrogated its association with Nup153-C (lane 12). Thus, binding of importin α by Nup50 appears to aide specifically in mediating the association of the Nup153 C-terminal domain and Nup50. The C-terminal region of Nup153 is FG-rich. Nup domains rich in this motif share the ability to interact with import and export transport receptors (23Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Structural basis for the interaction between FxFG nucleoporin repeats and importin β in nuclear trafficking.Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Shah S. Tugendreich S. Forbes D. Major binding sites for the nuclear import receptor are the internal nucleoporin Nup153 and the adjacent nuclear filament protein Tpr.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that this general property may confer a Nup50/importin α/β-docking site. In addition to the general affinity for karyopherin family members via its FG repeats, however, Nup153 has been noted to have a specific binding site for importin α (25Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. RanGTP-mediated nuclear export of karyopherin α involves its interaction with the nucleoporin Nup153.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9699-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Oka M. Yoneda Y. The interaction between importin α and Nup153 promotes importin α/β-mediated nuclear import.Traffic. 2012; 13: 934-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This independent motif is found in the terminal residues of Nup153 (amino acids 1458–1475). To determine whether Nup50 docking at the C-terminal region of Nup153 relies on this specific binding site for importin α or whether the general properties of the FG-rich terminal domain confer this indirect interaction with Nup50, we compared the recovery of endogenous Nup50L with GFP fusions of the Nup153 C-terminal domain in its wild-type form or with a 18-amino acid truncation of the terminal residues (153CΔ). Recovery of Nup50 was markedly decreased by truncation of Nup153-C (Fig. 6D). As expected, recovery of importin α was decreased by this mutation. Of note, this was the case for a range of importin α isoforms (supplemental Fig. S3). Probing for importin β revealed that it too relies on these residues in Nup153 for robust interaction (supplemental Fig. S3); presumably, the more general interaction with FG repeat domains is below the threshold of detection in this pulldown assay. Together, this mutational analysis supports the notion that importin α bridges Nup50 to Nup153 specifically at a discrete region at the C terminus of Nup153. To test the importance of contact between Nup153 and Nup50, HeLa cells were transfected with the Nup153(401–609) fragment to interfere with this partnership (Fig. 4C). Nuclear import was then assessed by tracking a cotransfected glucocorticoid-responsive import cargo, RGG (17Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A.

Using low levels of dexamethasone and tracking import in real time (Fig. 7, A and B), we observed that nuclear accumulation of the RGG cargo was notably slower when the Nup50-Nup153 interaction was disrupted by Nup153(401–609). This was also the case in an independent experiment tracked at intervals with fixed samples (data not shown). These results suggest that the contribution of Nup50 to transport efficiency relies on its interaction with Nup153. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which Nup153 works as a scaffold for Nup50 by means of an anchoring interaction at the Nup153 N-terminal domain in conjunction with an indirect interaction with the distal C terminus of Nup153 via importin α (Fig. 7C). The role of Nup153 as a scaffold likely extends to its ability to bind other participants in the nuclear import cycle as well, such as Ran and CAS (cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein) (27Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. Nup153 is an M9-containing mobile nucleoporin with a novel Ran-binding domain.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Ball J.R. Ullman K.S. Versatility at the nuclear pore complex: lessons learned from the nucleoporin Nup153.Chromosoma. 2005; 114: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, at any one time, a limited population of Nup50 (which includes and may be restricted to the population dynamically localized to the nuclear pore) is in a local environment where factors necessary for delivery of the NLS cargo and recycling of importins α and β are readily accessible to facilitate this process efficiently. Consistently, importin α interaction with the Nup153 C terminus was found to be important for efficient import (26Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Oka M. Yoneda Y. The interaction between importin α and Nup153 promotes importin α/β-mediated nuclear import.Traffic. 2012; 13: 934-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results reported here also underscore a distinction between Nup50S and Nup50L that may underlie certain functional differences (11Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Asally M. Oka M. Yasuda Y. Yoneda Y. Two isoforms of Npap60 (Nup50) differentially regulate nuclear protein import.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 630-638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, Nup50S lacks determinants that contribute to a second site of interaction with Nup153. The C-terminal importin α-docking site on Nup153 is highly conserved across species (29Sistla S. Pang J.V. Wang C.X. Balasundaram D. Multiple conserved domains of the nucleoporin Nup124p and its orthologs Nup1p and Nup153 are critical for nuclear import and activity of the fission yeast Tf1 retrotransposon.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3692-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and has affinity for a range of importin α isoforms (supplemental Fig. S3) (29Sistla S. Pang J.V. Wang C.X. Balasundaram D.

Cell. 2007; 18: 3692-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the context of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae basket nucleoporin Nup1p, this tail region has been found to be important for the efficiency of import (30Pyhtila B. Rexach M. A gradient of affinity for the karyopherin Kap95p along the yeast nuclear pore complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42699-42709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, this motif has been proposed to contribute to export of importin α (25Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. RanGTP-mediated nuclear export of karyopherin α involves its interaction with the nucleoporin Nup153.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9699-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In both cases, association was shown to take place (even enhanced) between the Nup protein and importin α in the presence of the NLS peptide cargo (25Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. RanGTP-mediated nuclear export of karyopherin α involves its interaction with the nucleoporin Nup153.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9699-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Oka M. Yoneda Y. The interaction between importin α and Nup153 promotes importin α/β-mediated nuclear import.Traffic. 2012; 13: 934-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the context of Nup50L docked at the N-terminal domain of Nup153, the NLS cargo would be subject to displacement by the high affinity binding of the Nup50L N-terminal region (BS1 and BS2) as described (12Pumroy R.A. Nardozzi J.D. Hart D.J. Root M.J. Cingolani G. Nucleoporin Nup50 stabilizes closed conformation of armadillo repeat 10 in importin α5.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2022-2031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have indicated that Nup153 is not required for import to take place, subtle effects on import were noted in mammalian cells (16Mackay D.R. Elgort S.W. Ullman K.S. The nucleoporin Nup153 has separable roles in both early mitotic progression and the resolution of mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Zhou L. Panté N. The nucleoporin Nup153 maintains nuclear envelope architecture and is required for cell migration in tumor cells.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and characterized in Drosophila cells (32Sabri N. Roth P. Xylourgidis N. Sadeghifar F. Adler J. Samakovlis C. Distinct functions of the Drosophila Nup153 and Nup214 FG domains in nuclear protein transport.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as well in nuclei reconstituted in Xenopus egg extracts (33Walther T.C. Fornerod M. Pickersgill H. Goldberg M. Allen T.D. Mattaj I.W. The nucleoporin Nup153 is required for nuclear pore basket formation, nuclear pore complex anchoring, and import of a subset of nuclear proteins.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5703-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The results reported here are consistent with a role for Nup153 in the efficiency of import, perhaps by promoting the Nup50-importin α interaction in a spatially restricted manner. Intriguingly, the more recent analysis of importin α binding at the Nup153 C terminus suggested that there could be a non-canonical role for importin α at this site (26Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Oka M. Yoneda Y. The interaction between importin α and Nup153 promotes importin α/β-mediated nuclear import.Traffic. 2012; 13: 934-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The model proposed, in which importin α can occupy this site and contribute to import without binding the NLS cargo itself, could further influence the interpretation of the Nup153-Nup50 interaction. For instance, two molecules of Nup50 could be in contact with Nup153 (one at region 401–609 and one bridged by importin α at the C terminus), playing separate roles in transport. It is also important to keep in mind that RGG is a complex cargo, with multiple sequences that can direct transport, including those that bind importins α and 7 (34Freedman N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Importin 7 and importin α/importin β are nuclear import receptors for the glucocorticoid receptor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For all of these reasons, to continue moving beyond the core machinery of transport and to understand regulatory layers that ensure efficiency, further study will be required. In Nup124p (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), this C-terminal motif was found to be critical retrotransposon activity, specifically for Tf1-Gag import (29Sistla S. Pang J.V. Wang C.X. Balasundaram D. Multiple conserved domains of the nucleoporin Nup124p and its orthologs Nup1p and Nup153 are critical for nuclear import and activity of the fission yeast Tf1 retrotransposon.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3692-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the other region of Nup124p critical to retrotransposon function shares homology with Nup153 as well, in this case, at the site within the N-terminal domain of Nup153 (residues 448–634) that we found here is important for the interface with Nup50 (35Varadarajan P. Mahalingam S. Liu P. Ng S.B. Gandotra S. Dorairajoo D.S. Balasundaram D. The functionally conserved nucleoporin Nup124p from fission yeast and the human Nup153 mediate nuclear import and activity of the Tf1 retrotransposon and HIV-1 Vpr.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1823-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This dual mode of interaction with Nup153 (or similar Nup proteins in other species) may be a paradigm used more generally, as two distinct types of Nup153-binding proteins, lamins (36Al-Haboubi T. Shumaker D.K. Köser J. Wehnert M. Fahrenkrog B. Distinct association of the nuclear pore protein Nup153 with A- and B-type lamins.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and NPC-associated SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) proteases (37Chow K.H. Elgort S. Dasso M. Ullman K.S. Two distinct sites in Nup153 mediate interaction with the SUMO proteases SENP1 and SENP2.Nucleus. 2012; 3: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), have each recently been found to interact with sites in both the N- and C-terminal regions of Nup153. The characterization here of interaction regions within both the N- and C-terminal domains of Nup153 with respect to Nup50 provides an important framework for understanding the cooperative roles of these dynamic nucleoporins.

https://openalex.org/W2013752918,"The measles virus (MV) fusion apparatus consists of a fusion protein and an attachment protein named hemagglutinin (H). After receptor-binding through its cuboidal head, the H-protein transmits the fusion-triggering signal through its stalk to the fusion protein. However, the structural basis of signal transmission is unclear because only structures of H-heads without their stalk have been solved. On the other hand, the entire ectodomain structure of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of another Paramyxovirus revealed a four-helix bundle stalk. To probe the structure of the 95-residue MV H-stalk we individually substituted head-proximal residues (positions 103-153) with cysteine, and biochemically and functionally characterized the resultant proteins. Our results indicate that most residues in the central segment (positions 103-117) can be cross-linked by engineered disulfide bonds, and thus may be engaged in a tetrameric structure. While covalent tetramerization disrupts fusion triggering function, disulfide bond reduction restores it in most positions except Asp-113. The next stalk segment (residues 123-138) also has high propensity to form covalent tetramers, but since these cross-links have little or no effect on function, it can conduct the fusion-triggering signal while remaining in a stabilized tetrameric configuration. This segment may act as a spacer, maintaining H-heads at an optimal height. Finally, the head-proximal segment (residues 139-154) has very limited propensity to trap tetramers, suggesting bifurcation into two flexible linkers clamped by inter-subunit covalent links formed by natural Cys-139 and Cys-154. We discuss the modular structure of the MV H-stalk in the context of membrane fusion triggering and cell entry by Paramyxoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2013092232,"Proper coordination between glycolysis and respiration is essential, yet the regulatory mechanisms involved in sensing respiratory chain defects and modifying mitochondrial functions accordingly are unclear. To investigate the nature of this regulation, we introduced respiratory bypass enzymes into cultured human (HEK293T) cells and studied mitochondrial responses to respiratory chain inhibition. In the absence of respiratory chain inhibitors, the expression of alternative respiratory enzymes did not detectably alter cell physiology or mitochondrial function. However, in permeabilized cells NDI1 (alternative NADH dehydrogenase) bypassed complex I inhibition, whereas alternative oxidase (AOX) bypassed complex III or IV inhibition. In contrast, in intact cells the effects of the AOX bypass were suppressed by growth on glucose, whereas those produced by NDI1 were unaffected. Moreover, NDI1 abolished the glucose suppression of AOX-driven respiration, implicating complex I as the target of this regulation. Rapid Complex I down-regulation was partly released upon prolonged respiratory inhibition, suggesting that it provides an ""emergency shutdown"" system to regulate metabolism in response to dysfunctions of the oxidative phosphorylation. This system was independent of HIF1, mitochondrial superoxide, or ATP synthase regulation. Our findings reveal a novel pathway for adaptation to mitochondrial dysfunction and could provide new opportunities for combatting diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2153155707,"The interaction between episodic retrieval and visual attention is relatively unexplored. Given that systems mediating attention and episodic memory appear to be segregated, and perhaps even in competition, it is unclear how visual attention is recruited during episodic retrieval. We investigated the recruitment of visual attention during the suppression of gist-based false recognition, the tendency to falsely recognize items that are similar to previously encountered items. Recruitment of visual attention was associated with activity in the dorsal attention network. The inferior parietal lobule, often implicated in episodic retrieval, tracked veridical retrieval of perceptual detail and showed reduced activity during the engagement of visual attention, consistent with a competitive relationship with the dorsal attention network. These findings suggest that the contribution of the parietal cortex to interactions between visual attention and episodic retrieval entails distinct systems that contribute to different components of the task while also suppressing each other."
https://openalex.org/W1983028272,"The transcription factor E2F1 has pivotal roles in both cell proliferation and cell death, and is an important molecular target in cancer. Under proliferative conditions E2F1 induces the expression of genes that promote cell cycle progression, such as E2F2, whereas under proapoptotic conditions E2F1 induces expression of genes such as p73 that lead to apoptosis. The mechanism by which the apoptotic function of E2F1 is activated remains unclear, however. We now show that members of the E2F family are covalently conjugated with the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8. Overexpression of SENP8, a NEDD8-specific cysteine protease, resulted in deNEDDylation of E2F1 and promoted its transactivation activity at the p73 gene but not at the E2F2 gene. Knockdown of SENP8, on the other hand, attenuated p73 expression and apoptosis induced by E2F1 or by DNA damage. SENP8 also promoted the interaction between E2F1 and its cofactor Microcephalin 1, which is required for p73 induction. These results suggest that NEDDylation is a molecular trigger that modifies the target specificity of E2F1, and could have important implications for E2F1 regulation of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035694509,"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) form a superfamily of multifunctional proteins with essential roles in cellular detoxification processes. A new fungal specific class of GST has been highlighted by genomic approaches. The biochemical and structural characterization of one isoform of this class in Phanerochaete chrysosporium revealed original properties. The three-dimensional structure showed a new dimerization mode and specific features by comparison with the canonical GST structure. An additional β-hairpin motif in the N-terminal domain prevents the formation of the regular GST dimer and acts as a lid, which closes upon glutathione binding. Moreover, this isoform is the first described GST that contains all secondary structural elements, including helix α4' in the C-terminal domain, of the presumed common ancestor of cytosolic GSTs (i.e. glutaredoxin 2). A sulfate binding site has been identified close to the glutathione binding site and allows the binding of 8-anilino-1-naphtalene sulfonic acid. Competition experiments between 8-anilino-1-naphtalene sulfonic acid, which has fluorescent properties, and various molecules showed that this GST binds glutathionylated and sulfated compounds but also wood extractive molecules, such as vanillin, chloronitrobenzoic acid, hydroxyacetophenone, catechins, and aldehydes, in the glutathione pocket. This enzyme could thus function as a classical GST through the addition of glutathione mainly to phenethyl isothiocyanate, but alternatively and in a competitive way, it could also act as a ligandin of wood extractive compounds. These new structural and functional properties lead us to propose that this GST belongs to a new class that we name GSTFuA, for fungal specific GST class A."

https://openalex.org/W1976421909,"Myocardin belongs to the SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS (SAP) domain family of transcription factors and is specifically expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle. Myocardin functions as a transcriptional coactivator of SRF and is sufficient and necessary for smooth muscle gene expression. We have previously found that myocardin induces the acetylation of nucleosomal histones surrounding SRF-binding sites in the control regions of cardiac and smooth muscle genes through recruiting chromatin-modifying enzyme p300, yet no studies have determined whether myocardin itself is similarly modified. In this study, we show that myocardin is a direct target for p300-mediated acetylation. p300 acetylates lysine residues at the N terminus of the myocardin protein. Interestingly, a direct interaction between p300 and myocardin, which is mediated by the C terminus of myocardin, is required for the acetylation event. Acetylation of myocardin by p300 enhances the association of myocardin and SRF as well as the formation of the myocardin-SRF-CArG box ternary complex. Conversely, acetylation of myocardin decreases the binding of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) to myocardin. Acetylation of myocardin is required for myocardin to activate smooth muscle genes. Our study demonstrates that acetylation plays a key role in modulating myocardin function in controlling cardiac and smooth muscle gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2026994602,"Retinoic acid (RA) is essential during embryogenesis and for tissue homeostasis, whereas excess RA is well known as a teratogen. In humans, excess RA is associated with hair loss. In the present study, we demonstrate that specific levels of RA, regulated by Cyp26b1, one of the RA-degrading enzymes, are required for hair follicle (hf) morphogenesis. Mice with embryonic ablation of Cyp26b1 (Cyp26b1(-/-)) have excessive endogenous RA, resulting in arrest of hf growth at the hair germ stage. The altered hf development is rescued by grafting the mutant skin on immunodeficient mice. Our results show that normalization of RA levels is associated with reinitiation of hf development. Conditional deficiency of Cyp26b1 in the dermis (En1Cre;Cyp26b1f/-) results in decreased hair follicle density and specific effect on hair type, indicating that RA levels also influence regulators of hair bending. Our results support the model of RA-dependent dermal signals regulating hf downgrowth and bending. To elucidate target gene pathways of RA, we performed microarray and RNA-Seq profiling of genes differentially expressed in Cyp26b1(-/-) skin and En1Cre;Cyp26b1f/- tissues. We show specific effects on the Wnt-catenin pathway and on members of the Runx, Fox, and Sox transcription factor families, indicating that RA modulates pathways and factors implicated in hf downgrowth and bending.

Archaea produce ATP using an ATP synthase that is distinct from the well known F1FO ATP synthase found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (1Schäfer G. Meyering-Vos M. F-Type or V-Type? The chimeric nature of the archaebacterial ATP synthase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Archaeal A1AO ATP synthases are evolutionary more closely related to vacuolar V1VO ATPases, notwithstanding the fact that these act as ATP-driven ion pumps and are therefore functionally different (2Müller V.

Like F-ATP synthases and V-ATPases, A-ATP synthases comprise a membrane motor, AO, which is driven by downhill translocation of H+ or Na+, and a soluble domain, A1, where ATP is synthesized from ADP and Pi. A1 and AO are mechanically coupled by three protein stalks: one central and two peripheral. Under suitable conditions A1 can also hydrolize ATP and function as a motor for uphill ion translocation across AO (2Müller V. Grüber G. ATP synthases.

Moreover, one ion-binding site was lost during the duplication event leading to a rotor with only half the number of ion-binding sites.

Instead, the rotor favors generation of large ion gradients, a function important for the cellular physiology of eukaryotes (3Cross R.L. Müller V.

Moreover, in some species the sequence motif characteristic of the ion-binding site is absent in one hairpin, which would result in c subunits with one ion-binding site within four transmembrane helices or two within six transmembrane helices (10Müller V.

In particular, the DNA data for Pyrococcus furiosus implies that its c subunit has a typical V-type topology with two hairpins but only one Na+-binding site per subunit (10Müller V.

The implication, according to common wisdom, would be that the enzyme lost its function as an ATP synthase. However, the A1AO ATP synthase from P. furiosus is the only ATP synthase encoded in the genome and functions as an ATP synthase in vivo (19Robb F.T. Maeder D.L. Brown J.R. DiRuggiero J. Stump M.D. Yeh R.K. Weiss R.B. Dunn D.M. Genomic sequence of hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus.

The structural rationale for the ATP synthesis activity of the P. furiosus enzyme, despite the predicted V-type c subunit, is unknown. It could involve post-transcriptional modifications as well as additional, yet hidden ion-binding sites in the mature protein. Because the primary structure and number of ion-binding sites are assumed based on predictions from the DNA sequence, it was important to isolate the mature c subunit and determine experimentally its primary structure, molecular mass, and ion-binding sites. These studies culminate in a three-dimensional computational model of the c ring from P. furiosus, which provides a structural interpretation for our biochemical experiments, and enables us to assess the physiological ion specificity of this and other archaeal A1AO ATP synthases. P. furiosus DSM 3638 was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung für Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany) and was grown anaerobically in a 300 liter enamel-coated fermenter at 98 °C in medium without sulfur, but with yeast extract, starch, and pepton as energy source and N2/CO2 (80:20, v/v) as described before (21Pisa K.Y. Huber H. Thomm M. Müller V. A sodium ion-dependent A1AO ATP synthase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon.Pyrococcus furiosus. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3928-3938Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and stored at −80 °C until further use. 20–40 g of P. furiosus cells (wet weight) were resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF) containing 0.1 mg DNase I/ml. The cells were homogenized and disrupted by three passages through a French pressure cell (Aminco) at 3000 p.s.i. Cell debris and the thermosome, a cytoplasmatic heat shock protein present at high temperatures, were removed by four centrifugation steps (Beckman Avanti J-25, JA 14 rotor; 7,500, 7,900, 8,200, and 8,500 rpm each for 20 min at 4 °C). The membranes were sedimented from the crude extract by centrifugation (Beckman Optima L90-K, 50.2 Ti rotor; 12,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C) and were washed with buffer B (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (v/v), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm PMSF). The washed membranes were collected by centrifugation (Beckman Optima L90-K, 50.2 Ti rotor; 16,000 rpm, 5 h, 4 °C) and resuspended in buffer C (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm PMSF), and the protein concentration was determined as described (62Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). Washed membranes were resuspended in buffer C and used for membrane protein solubilization. Triton X-100 was added to a concentration of 3% (v/v) (1 g of Triton X-100/g of membrane protein), and membranes were incubated for 2 h at 40 °C and then overnight at room temperature under shaking. The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckman Optima L90-K, TFT 65.13 rotor; 42,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C), and contaminating proteins were precipitated with PEG 6000 (4.1%, w/w) for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (Beckman Optima L90-K, TFT 65.13 rotor; 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a sucrose gradient (20–66%) and centrifuged for 19 h in a vertical rotor (Beckman Optima L90-K, VTi50 rotor; 43,000 rpm at 4 °C). ATP hydrolysis activity of each sucrose gradient fraction was tested as described before (21Pisa K.Y. Huber H. Thomm M. Müller V. A sodium ion-dependent A1AO ATP synthase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon.Pyrococcus furiosus. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3928-3938Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fractions with the highest ATPase activity were pooled and applied to anion exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sepharose, which was equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.1% (v/v) reduced Triton X-100). A salt gradient (0–1 m NaCl) in buffer D was used for protein elution at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions with the highest ATPase activity were pooled, concentrated (molecular mass cutoff, 100 kDa), and applied to gel filtration using a Superose 6 column (10/300 GL; GE Healthcare). Gel filtration was performed in buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Again, fractions with the highest ATP hydrolysis activity were pooled. The membranes resuspended in buffer C were mixed with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 20 h at 4 °C and filtered. 0.2 volume of H2O was added to the filtrate and mixed for another 20 h at 4 °C. The organic phase was separated from the aqueous and interphase using a separation funnel and was washed twice with 0.5 volume of chloroform/methanol/H2O (3:47:48, v/v/v). The washed organic phase was filled up with 1 volume of chloroform. Methanol was added until the turbid solution cleared up. The volume of the solution was reduced to 1 ml using vacuum evaporation. Protein was precipitated with 4 volumes of diethylether at −20 °C for 12 h and sedimented by centrifugation (Eppendorf 5417R, FA-45–24-11 rotor; 8,000 rpm at −8 °C). Sedimented protein was resolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). For labeling experiments with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD, dissolved in ethanol), 3The abbreviations used are: DCCDN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimideFEPfree energy perturbationCHES2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. purified A1AO ATP synthase was used. 1 ml of ATP synthase was dialyzed in a dialysis tube (molecular mass cutoff, 3.5 kDa) against 1000 ml of buffer F (25 mm Tris, 25 mm MES, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) adjusted to pH 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 with HCl or KOH for 12 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of ATP synthase (9 μg of protein) was incubated with 250 or 500 μm DCCD at pH levels of 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 for 60 min at room temperature. For competition experiments between DCCD and NaCl or KCl, the salts were added to the ATP synthase solution in concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, or 25 mm, directly before labeling. After labeling with DCCD, the ATP synthase was purified using C4 Zip Tips to remove excessive DCCD and salts. The C4 matrix (bed volume, 0.6 μl) of a 10-μl Zip Tip was first equilibrated with 20 μl of 100% acetonitrile and 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. ATP synthase was coupled to the equilibrated matrix and washed with 30 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The A1A0 ATP synthase was eluted with 10 μl of 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To desintegrate the ATP synthase and the c ring of P. furiosus into c monomers, 10 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added and mixed. The solution containing the c monomers were dried by vacuum evaporation for 1.5 h at room temperature. The dried protein pellet was mixed with 1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone matrix and applied to MALDI-TOF-MS as described below. N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide free energy perturbation 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. Chloroform/methanol extracts for protein m/z determination were mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with matrix 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (15 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone in 75% ethanol in 20 mm sodium citrate; Bruker Daltonics) or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (30 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid/100 μl of TA solution (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile, 1:2 (v/v); Bruker Daltonics)) and spotted on ground steel target plates (Bruker Daltonics). MALDI mass spectra were recorded in a mass range of 5–20 kDa using a Bruker Autoflex III Smartbeam mass spectrometer. Detection was optimized for m/z values between 5 and 20 kDa and calibrated using calibration standards (protein molecular weight calibration standard 1; Bruker Daltonics). Chloroform/methanol extracts of P. furiosus membranes were mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, containing 0.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and the organic phase was removed by a gentle N2 stream until the turbid solution was getting clear. The protein extract was then submitted to 12.5% SDS-PAGE (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Tricine-sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa.Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar) and stained with silver, suitable for mass spectrometry (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7805) Google Scholar). Bands of interest were excised, reduced, alkylated, and digested using trypsin, chymotrypsin or both proteases according to standard mass spectrometry protocols (24Buschmann S. Warkentin E. Xie H.

Proteolytic digests were applied to reverse phase columns (trapping column C18: particle size, 3 μm; length, 20 mm; and analytical column C18: particle size, 3 μm; length, 10 cm) (NanoSeparations, Nieuwkoop, Netherlands) using a nano-HPLC (Proxeon easy nLC), eluted in gradients of water (0.1% formic acid, buffer A) and acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid, buffer B) in 50 min at flow rates of 300 nl/min and ramped from 5 to 65% buffer B. Eluted peptides were ionized using a Bruker Apollo electrospray ionization source with a nanoSprayer emitter and analyzed in a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker maxis). The proteins were identified by matching the mass lists on a Mascot server (version 2.2.2; Matrix Science) against NCBInr database. Homologous sequences of the P. furiosus target c subunit sequence were obtained after five PSI-BLAST iterations (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70319) Google Scholar) on the nonredundant database, using 0.001 as the E-value cutoff. For scoring we used the BLOSUM62 matrix (26Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Amino acid substitution matrices from protein blocks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar), a gap open penalty of 11 and a gap extension penalty of 1. The results were then clustered at 65% sequence identity using CD-HIT (27Li W. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Clustering of highly homologous sequences to reduce the size of large protein databases.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 28Li W. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Tolerating some redundancy significantly speeds up clustering of large protein databases.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Representative sequences of each cluster, plus target and template sequences, were used as input for a multiple alignment, using T-Coffee (29Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. T-Coffee. A novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar). The pairwise target-template alignment used for homology modeling was derived from this multiple alignment. Two-thousand structural models of the c10 ring of P. furiosus were constructed using the structure of the c ring from Enterococcus hirae V-type ATPase (30Murata T. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Structure of the rotor of the V-Type Na+-ATPase from Enterococcus hirae.Science. 2005; 308: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) as template (Protein Data Bank entry 2BL2; 36% sequence identity with P. furiosus c subunit). Modeler 9v8 was employed to generate these models. The scoring functions GA341 (31Melo F. Sali A. Fold assessment for comparative protein structure modeling.Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2412-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and DOPE (discrete optimized potential energy) (32Shen M.Y. Sali A. Statistical potential for assessment and prediction of protein structures.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2507-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) were used to select the best three models. The coordinates of the bound Na+ were translated from the template to the target structure. Secondary structure and transmembrane predictions for the P. furiosus c ring, obtained with Psipred v2.5 (33Jones D.T. Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar) and TopCons (34Bernsel A. Viklund H. Hennerdal A. Elofsson A. TOPCONS. Consensus prediction of membrane protein topology.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W465-W468Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), respectively, were compared with the actual secondary structure (determined with the DSSP algorithm (35Kabsch W. Sander C. Dictionary of protein secondary structure.

Pogozheva I.D. Mosberg H.I. OPM. Orientations of proteins in membranes database.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar)) of the template. A pairwise alignment of M. ruminantium target sequence with the c subunit from E. hirae (33% sequence identity) was generated as for the P. furiosus sequence. We then generated and selected the best model of a c3 subconstruct of M. ruminantium in the same manner as explained previously for the P. furiosus c10 ring (the stoichiometry of M. ruminantium c ring is unknown). Secondary structure and transmembrane predictions for the target were compared with the secondary structure and transmembrane regions of the template as mentioned above. The c10 rings of E. hirae and P. furiosus and the c3 construct of M. ruminantium were inserted in a hydrated palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine membrane (540, 542, and 189 lipid molecules and 38499, 38319, and 11763 water molecules, respectively), using GRIFFIN (37Staritzbichler R. Anselmi C. Forrest L.R. Faraldo-Gómez J.D. GRIFFIN. A versatile methodology for optimization of protein-lipid interfaces for membrane protein simulations.J. Chem. Theory Comp. 2011; 7: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The c10 rings have a single Na+ in each c subunit, coordinated by Glu-139/Glu-142. The c3 construct of M. ruminantium, however, carries one Na+ coordinated by Glu-140 in each c subunit and another coordinated by Glu-59 in between adjacent c subunits. The protein/membrane systems were equilibrated using constrained all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The strength of the constraints on the protein were gradually weakened over 12 ns for the c10 rings and 7 ns for the c3 construct. Subsequently, unconstrained simulations were carried out for 40 and 10 ns, respectively. The conformations obtained after the unconstrained equilibrations were used as input of all-atom free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations of the exchange between Na+ and H+ in each binding site and vice versa. The FEP calculations were performed in the forward and backward direction, in 32 intermediate steps; each of these steps consists of 500 ps of sampling time, including 100 ps of equilibration. Both molecular dynamics and FEP calculations were carried out with NAMD2.7 (38Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K.

All simulations were at constant pressure (1 atmosphere) and temperature (298 K), and with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. The dimensions of the simulation box in the plane of the membrane (150 × 150 Å for the c10 rings and 72 × 96 Å for the c3 construct) were kept constant. The particle mesh Ewald method was used to compute the electrostatic interactions, with a real space cutoff of 12 Å. A cutoff of 12 Å was also used for van der Waals interactions, computed with a 6–12 Lennard-Jones potential. During the molecular dynamics and FEP simulations of the M. ruminantium c3 construct, the conformations of the first (residues 6–77) and last hairpins (residues 86–161) were preserved using a weak harmonic restraint on the root mean square deviation of the backbone, relative to the initial model.

https://openalex.org/W1973124648,"Phosphorylation of Tyr-88/Tyr-89 in the 3(10) helix of p27 reduces its cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitory activity. This modification does not affect the interaction of p27 with cyclin-CDK complexes but does interfere with van der Waals and hydrogen bond contacts between p27 and amino acids in the catalytic cleft of the CDK. Thus, it had been suggested that phosphorylation of this site could switch the tumor-suppressive CDK inhibitory activity to an oncogenic activity. Here, we examined this hypothesis in the RCAS-PDGF-HA/nestin-TvA proneural glioma mouse model, in which p21 facilitates accumulation of nuclear cyclin D1-CDK4 and promotes tumor development. In these tumor cells, approximately one-third of the p21 is phosphorylated at Tyr-76 in the 3(10) helix. Mutation of this residue to glutamate reduced inhibitory activity in vitro. Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine reduced the tumor-promoting activity of p21 in the animal model, whereas glutamate or alanine substitution allowed tumor formation. Consequently, we conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation contributes to the conversion of CDK inhibitors from tumor-suppressive roles to oncogenic roles."
https://openalex.org/W2145595863,"The epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN) is under tonic inhibition by a local purinergic signaling system responding to changes in dietary sodium intake. Normal BK(Ca) channel function is required for flow-sensitive ATP secretion in the ASDN. We tested here whether ATP secreted through connexin channels in a coupled manner with K(+) efflux through BK(Ca) channels is required for inhibitory purinergic regulation of ENaC in response to increases in sodium intake. Inhibition of connexin channels relieves purinergic inhibition of ENaC. Deletion of the BK-β4 regulatory subunit, which is required for normal BK(Ca) channel function and flow-sensitive ATP secretion in the ASDN, suppresses increases in urinary ATP in response to increases in sodium intake. As a consequence, ENaC activity, particularly in the presence of high sodium intake, is inappropriately elevated in BK-β4 null mice. ENaC in BK-β4 null mice, however, responds normally to exogenous ATP, indicating that increases in activity do not result from end-organ resistance but rather from lowered urinary ATP. Consistent with this, disruption of purinergic regulation increases ENaC activity in wild type but not BK-β4 null mice. Consequently, sodium excretion is impaired in BK-β4 null mice. These results demonstrate that the ATP secreted in the ASDN in a BK(Ca) channel-dependent manner is physiologically available for purinergic inhibition of ENaC in response to changes in sodium homeostasis. Impaired sodium excretion resulting form loss of normal purinergic regulation of ENaC in BK-β4 null mice likely contributes to their elevated blood pressure."

Wrp is highly expressed in the ventricular stem cell niche, and it is a gene required for cytoskeletal organization and is associated with syndromic and psychiatric disorders in humans.

Syst. 2006; 22: 1543-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it is assumed that increased CSF pressure causes distension of the lateral ventricles, leading to damage within adjacent brain tissues. However, the initial processes or factors that give rise to aqueductal obstruction are poorly defined, making it difficult to understand the detailed etiology of this disorder. Moreover, many of the current genetic animal models of hydrocephalus are nonobstructive, including Ift88 (2Banizs B. Pike M.M. Millican C.L. Ferguson W.B. Komlosi P. Sheetz J. Bell P.D.

However, the population of patients that have ciliary defects, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, is very rare (1 in 20,000–30,000) when compared with that of hydrocephalus (1 in 500), suggesting the existence of other unknown etiological factors. cerebral spinal fluid subventricular zone olfactory bulb rostral migratory stream doublecortin glial fibrillary acidic protein corpus callosum lateral ventricle amyloid precursor protein immunohistochemistry arabinofuranosyl cytidine.

Wrp is one of several genes that are commonly deleted in 3p-syndrome, a form of syndromic mental retardation. The phenotypic range of this syndrome is variable but can encompass brain anomalies with enlarged lateral ventricles (13Kariya S. Aoji K. Akagi H. Fukushima K. Chikumoto E. Ogawa T. Karaki M.

Lining the lateral ventricles is the subventricular zone (SVZ) and ependyma, which form a specialized stem cell niche in rodents and humans from which newborn cells are continuously produced and migrate into the olfactory bulb (OB) through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) (14Roy N.S.

Mammalian neural stem cells.Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4089) Google Scholar), suggesting that the special environmental conditions there are essential for maintaining stem cell properties. Recent studies have proposed that the multipotent neural progenitors that escape from the ventricular stem cell niche are at risk for malignant transformation and have a high potential to form gliomas (20Bachoo R.M.

A midterm exam.Neuron. 2008; 58: 832-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In rodents, the amount of progenitor cell production in the ventricular niche at the perinatal stage is 40-fold higher than that of the adult (24Faiz M. Acarin L. Castellano B. Gonzalez B. Proliferation dynamics of germinative zone cells in the intact and excitotoxically lesioned postnatal rat brain.BMC Neurosci. 2005; 6: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the collective evidence implies that that the perinatal period could be particularly sensitive to migration abnormalities from the SVZ niche, which may lead to progenitor migration into neighboring brain regions and mis-differentiation. Here, we describe the development of enlarged ventricles and obstructive hydrocephalus in Wrp-deficient mice that is associated with abnormalities in Nestin+ cells of the subventricular region. We find that Wrp mRNA and protein are highly expressed in progenitor cells of the stem cell niche in the SVZ, ependyma, RMS, and OB. Wrp knock-out mice develop massive disruptions within the brain, predominantly in the neighboring corpus callosum (CC) where abnormally located progenitor cells are observed. Viral lineage tracing and conditional genetic deletion of Wrp in Nestin+ cells indicate that the mislocated cells originate as progenitor cells that mis-migrate from the ventricular zone. Subsequently, the CC disruption leads to cystic cavities and debris formation. The debris appears to be released into the ventricular space, resulting in blockage of the aqueduct and ultimately leading to obstructive hydrocephalus. Together, these findings suggest that abnormalities in the neural stem cell niche can be an initiating factor for the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus. Wrp null mice (25Carlson B.R. Lloyd K.E.

Littermate mice from heterozygous parents were used for all experiments. Both male and female mice were analyzed, with no differences noted between sexes. All mice were housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources facilities at Duke University, and all procedures were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. In situ hybridization histochemistry was performed as described previously (27Kim I.H. Park S.K. Sun W. Kang Y. Kim H.T. Kim H. Spatial learning enhances the expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase A in the hippocampal formation of rat.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 124: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen developing rat brains (P3, P7, P12, P18, and P25) were sectioned (12 μm) on a cryostat (Leica CM 3000), thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated glass slides, allowed to dry, and stored at −20 °C until use. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydrides (Sigma) in 0.1 m triethanolamine, 0.9% NaCl (pH 8.0). The antisense riboprobes for Wrp were prepared from pGEM T-EASY (Promega) vectors containing Wrp (GenBankTM accession number XM_575637, nucleotides 2159–2706) using an in vitro transcription system (Promega) in the presence of γ-35S-UTP (Amersham Biosciences). The sections were then hybridized overnight with radiolabeled probe (1.2 × 106 cpm/slide) and washed sequentially in 2×, 1×, 0.5×, and in 0.1× SSC with 160 μl of 2.5 m DTT for 30 min each at 62 °C. Finally, the sections were dehydrated, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax MR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then perfused transcardially with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4) containing 25 units/ml heparin, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS. Brains were removed, postfixed overnight at 4 °C in the same fixative, and then cryo-protected with 30% sucrose in TBS. Brains were cut by cryostat (Leica CM 3000) and stored at −20 °C until use. Sections were blocked for 4 h with TBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 and then incubated with the following: guinea pig anti-DCX antibody (1:2,000; Millipore); mouse anti-Nestin monoclonal antibody (1:200; BD Biosciences); mouse anti-EphA2 monoclonal antibody (1:200; Sigma); mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (1:500; BD Biosciences); mouse anti-Alzheimer precursor protein A4 (APP) monoclonal antibody (1:200, clone 22C11; Millipore); rabbit anti-AQP1 polyclonal antibody (1:2,000; Alpha Diagnostics); rabbit anti-red fluorescent protein polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Rockland); or rabbit anti-Ki-67 polyclonal antibody (1:200; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. For rat anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) and rabbit anti-WRP polyclonal antibody (VO112), antigen retrieval procedure was carried out before the immunostainings. After washing three times with TBST (TBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100), sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor® 555 IgG (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution (DAPI; Sigma). After washing four times, the sections were coverslipped with aqueous mounting medium (Calbiochem) and observed under a confocal microscope (LSM 710; Zeiss) or fluorescent microscope (DMRA2; Leica). To reduce variations, all the tissues in one set of experiments were processed at the same time. To identify newly generated cells in SVZ and RMS, 200 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma) in saline solution was injected intraperitoneally into P40 mice. Four days after single administration of BrdU, mice were perfused, and brains were processed for immunohistochemical assays. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed as described previously (28Badea A. Ali-Sharief A.A. Johnson G.A. Morphometric analysis of the C57BL/6J mouse brain.Neuroimage. 2007; 37: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) on a 9.4-tesla Oxford vertical bore magnet with a GE EXCITE Console (EPIC 11.0) that has been specially adapted for magnetic resonance microscopy. We used a 14-mm diameter RF solenoid coil. Images were acquired using a three-dimensional gradient recalled echo protocol with echo time (TE) = 3.4 ms, repetition time (TR) = 50 ms, band width (BW) = 62.5 kHz, and a flip angle of 60°. Images were acquired with a field of view of 22 × 11 × 11 mm and a matrix size of 512 × 256 × 256, resulting in an isotropic resolution of 43 μm. The brain images were manually segmented for ventricles using both ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software suites. The ventricle system was segmented as four discrete systems comprised of the left lateral ventricle, the right lateral ventricle, the third ventricle and cerebral aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle. Manual segmentation was possible due to the high contrast between brain tissues and the cerebral spinal fluid within the ventricles. Two-dimensional area ratios between the brain section and the ventricles were made using the ImageJ software. Three-dimensional reconstructions were produced using the MetaMorph software. P9, P12, and P40 mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (150 mg/kg)/xylazine (15 mg/kg). The 30-gauge dental needle (connected to microdriver with a 10-μl Hamilton syringe) was positioned at 0.1 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral to the bregma using a stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments). Five percent of Evans blue dye in PBS (2 μl for P9 mice, 3 μl for P12, and 5 μl for P40 mice) was infused slowly into right side of the LV (1 μl/min). Mice were sacrificed 1 h after the infusion, and whole brains were removed and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 72 h. Following coronal serial section, the distribution of the dye was traced from LVs to spinal cord. P5 mice were anesthetized by hypothermia and placed on an inverted illuminating platform. One microliter of 10% nano-beads (FluoSpheres®, red-orange, 40 nm diameter; Invitrogen) were infused into the lateral ventricle by a Hamilton syringe. At P12, the mice were perfused and post-fixed followed by cryo-protection as described under “Immunohistochemistry.” The hemispheres opposite to the injected side were sagittally cut (40 μm thick) and counterstained with DAPI followed by mounting onto slides. Eighty planes of images (0.5 μm gap) were captured from each section to create a z-stack by confocal microscopy (LSM 710; Zeiss), and the bead densities in the ependyma and the CC area were visualized by ZEN software (Zeiss). The lentiviral and packaging vectors (FCtdTW, VSVg, and Δ8.9) were generously provided from Dr. Michael Ehlers (Duke University), and the viruses were purified as described before (29Arenkiel B.R. Klein M.E. Davison I.G. Katz L.C. Ehlers M.D. Genetic control of neuronal activity in mice conditionally expressing TRPV1.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One microliter of lentivirus expressing tdTomato was infused into the lateral ventricle of P3 mice as described under “Fluorescent Nano-bead Tracing.” At P12, the mice were perfused to prepare sections (40 μm thick) for following immunohistochemical assays as described above. The sections were immunostained by anti-Nestin antibody, and by anti-red fluorescent protein antibody for amplifying the tdTomato signals. Resulting sections were observed by confocal microscopy (LSM 710; Zeiss). The brain sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slide glasses and dried for 24 h. The slides were rehydrated through 100% ethanol to distilled water, followed by dipping into staining solution. For Nissl staining, slides were placed in 0.1% cresyl violet solution for 5 min. For H&E staining, slides were placed in hematoxylin solution for 4 min followed by further staining with 0.25% eosin for 1 min. After quick rinsing with distilled water, the sections were dehydrated by ethanol at graded concentrations from 90 to 100%, followed by dipping into xylene. Finally, the slides were mounted with permanent medium. Brain images were observed and captured by microscope (SteREO, Discovery V8, Zeiss) connected with a CCD camera (AxioCam MRc, Zeiss). P5 mice were anesthetized by hypothermia and placed on an inverted illuminating platform. Three microliters of 5% AraC in saline with 0.01% fast green dye were infused into the lateral ventricle by a Hamilton syringe. At P9 or P25, brain sections were prepared as described for the nano-bead tracing method. The sections were then immunostained as described under “Immunohistochemistry” or were Nissl-stained as described above. Images were obtained by confocal microscopy (LSM 710; Zeiss) or light microscope (SteREO, Discovery V8, Zeiss). Tamoxifen was administered by subcutaneous injection between the front shoulder blades two times at P0 and P1 (0.2 mg/pup) into Wrpflox/flox:N4CreER− mice and Wrpflox/flox:N4CreER+ mice. Student's t test (SPSS 12.0) was used for the analysis of a difference between two groups. All values were expressed as mean ± S.E., and results were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Recently, we generated a Wrp (Srgap3) knock-out mouse model to analyze the role of WRP in neural development (25Carlson B.R. Lloyd K.E. Kruszewski A. Kim I.H. Rodriguiz R.M. Heindel C. Faytell M. Dudek S.M. Wetsel W.C. Soderling S.H. WRP/srGAP3 facilitates the initiation of spine development by an inverse F-BAR domain, and its loss impairs long term memory.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the initial characterization of these mice, we noted enlarged LVs (25Carlson B.R. Lloyd K.E. Kruszewski A. Kim I.H. Rodriguiz R.M. Heindel C. Faytell M. Dudek S.M. Wetsel W.C. Soderling S.H.

This phenotype became more severe following backcross to C57BL/6, a strain that is susceptible to hereditary hydrocephalus (30Goto J. Tezuka T. Nakazawa T. Sagara H. Yamamoto T.

Genet. 2004; 13: 2089-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), so that by n8–10 homozygotes exhibited swollen brains typical of hydrocephalus with complete penetrance (Fig. 1A). Intra-cranial magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1B) and surface rendering of the ventricular space (Fig. 1C) showed grossly enlarged LVs in the Wrp KO mice compared with WT littermates. Morphological studies with developing brains showed that this hydrocephalus did not initiate during embryogenesis but instead developed after birth (Fig. 1D). The LV size of Wrp KO mice was normal until postnatal day 9 (P9), and by P12 the KO brains (n = 3 for WT; n = 4 for KO) began to display enlarged LVs (t = 4.29, df = 5, p < 0.01) that were more severe at P40 (n = 3 for WT; n = 4 for KO) (t = 14.87, df = 5, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1E). Ependymal cilia appeared normal in P12 KO mice (data not shown), suggesting the hydrocephaly was not due to ciliary defects. To determine whether the hydrocephalus is communicating or noncommunicating, Evans blue dye was injected into the LV of P40 mice. Surface viewing showed that the stain reached the spinal cord of WT mice, whereas no stain was found in the spinal cord of KO mouse (blue arrows in Fig. 1F). Serial coronal sectioning then showed the stain in LVs and third ventricle but excluded from the cerebral aqueduct (red arrows in Fig. 1F), indicating a blockage of the aqueduct leading to hydrocephalus. These data indicate that the hydrocephalus in the Wrp KO mice initiates at an early postnatal stage and ultimately results in obstructive hydrocephalus. To investigate the etiology of the hydrocephalus in Wrp KO mice, we first carried out in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the relative expression pattern of Wrp mRNA and protein, respectively. In situ hybridization histochemistry with horizontal brain sections showed high levels of Wrp mRNA expression in LVs, in addition to the OB, hippocampus, and cerebellum throughout the postnatal periods (Fig. 2A). To confirm these data, IHC was performed using WT P40 sagittal brain sections. This clearly showed that WRP protein is highly expressed in the RMS and the SVZ (Fig. 2B). We note that lower levels of WRP are expressed in most other brain regions in addition to the RMS and SVZ (11Soderling S.H. Binns K.L. Wayman G.A. Davee S.M. Ong S.H. Pawson T. Scott J.D. The WRP component of the WAVE-1 complex attenuates Rac-mediated signaling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The pattern of WRP immunoreactivity overlapped that of BrdU, which was injected 4 days before sacrifice to label actively dividing cells within the SVZ, suggesting WRP is expressed in newborn progenitor cells originating from the SVZ. For a more detailed examination of individual cells, we performed co-IHC with WRP and DCX. Confocal Z-stack imaging showed that WRP is expressed within a subpopulation of DCX-positive cells within the RMS (Fig. 2C) and SVZ (Fig. 2D), in addition to ependymal cells (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data suggest the possibility that like other members of the srGAP family, WRP may regulate the migration of newborn cells from the ventricular niche. Abnormalities in this migration might be related to the enlarged ventricles and development of hydrocephaly in the Wrp null animals. If the main initiating factor of hydrocephalus in Wrp KO mice arises from abnormalities in the ventricular niche, specific deletion of Wrp in the niche area should lead to phenotypes that overlap those observed in the Wrp KO mice. To test this hypothesis, Wrpflox/flox mice (25Carlson B.R. Lloyd K.E. Kruszewski A. Kim I.H. Rodriguiz R.M. Heindel C. Faytell M. Dudek S.M. Wetsel W.C. Soderling S.H.

However, the mechanisms underlying these responses are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 during anchorage loss, which is important for cell cycle arrest of nonadherent cells in the G1 phase. Up-regulation was mediated by an upstream element, designated as the detachment-responsive element (DRE), that contained Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) recognition sites; both of these together were necessary for transactivation, as individually they were insufficient. RNAi experiments revealed that KLF4 and a multidomain adaptor protein, hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (HIC-5), were critically involved in DRE transactivation. The role of HIC-5 in this mechanism was to tether KLF4 to DNA sites in response to cellular detachment. In addition, further analysis suggested that oligomerization and subsequent nuclear matrix localization of HIC-5, which was accelerated spontaneously in cells during anchorage loss, was assumed to potentiate the scaffolding function of HIC-5 in the nucleus and consequently regulate p21Cip1 transcription in a manner responding to anchorage loss. At the RUNX1 site, a LIM-only protein, CRP2, imposed negative regulation on transcription, which appeared to be removed by anchorage loss and contributed to increased transcriptional activity of DRE together with regulation at the KLF4 sites. In conclusion, this study revealed a novel transcriptional mechanism that regulated gene expression in a detachment-dependent manner, thereby contributing to anchorage-dependent cell growth.
