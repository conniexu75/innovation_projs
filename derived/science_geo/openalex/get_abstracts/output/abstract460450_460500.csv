https://openalex.org/W2066107559,"Stress granules and P bodies are conserved cytoplasmic aggregates of nontranslating messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) implicated in the regulation of mRNA translation and decay and are related to RNP granules in embryos, neurons, and pathological inclusions in some degenerative diseases. Using baker's yeast, 125 genes were identified in a genetic screen that affected the dynamics of P bodies and/or stress granules. Analyses of such mutants, including CDC48 alleles, provide evidence that stress granules can be targeted to the vacuole by autophagy, in a process termed granulophagy. Moreover, stress granule clearance in mammalian cells is reduced by inhibition of autophagy or by depletion or pathogenic mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP), the human ortholog of CDC48. Because mutations in VCP predispose humans to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, inclusion body myopathy, and multisystem proteinopathy, this work suggests that autophagic clearance of stress granule related and pathogenic RNP granules that arise in degenerative diseases may be important in reducing their pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1987699071,"SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that governs many physiological pathways, including circadian rhythm in peripheral tissues. Here, we show that SIRT1 in the brain governs central circadian control by activating the transcription of the two major circadian regulators, BMAL1 and CLOCK. This activation comprises an amplifying circadian loop involving SIRT1, PGC-1α, and Nampt. In aged wild-type mice, SIRT1 levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus are decreased, as are those of BMAL1 and PER2, giving rise to a longer intrinsic period, a more disrupted activity pattern, and an inability to adapt to changes in the light entrainment schedule. Young mice lacking brain SIRT1 phenocopy these aging-dependent circadian changes, whereas mice that overexpress SIRT1 in the brain are protected from the effects of aging. Our findings indicate that SIRT1 activates the central pacemaker to maintain robust circadian control in young animals, and a decay in this activity may play an important role in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2093883442,"Most available information on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contacts in cells of higher eukaryotes concerns proteins implicated in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry. However, growing evidence suggests that such contacts play more general roles in cell physiology, pointing to the existence of additionally ubiquitously expressed ER-PM tethers. Here, we show that the three extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) are ER proteins that participate in such tethering function via C2 domain-dependent interactions with the PM that require PI(4,5)P2 in the case of E-Syt2 and E-Syt3 and also elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) in the case of E-Syt1. As they form heteromeric complexes, the E-Syts confer cytosolic Ca(2+) regulation to ER-PM contact formation. E-Syts-dependent contacts, however, are not required for store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Thus, the ER-PM tethering function of the E-Syts (tricalbins in yeast) mediates the formation of ER-PM contacts sites, which are functionally distinct from those mediated by STIM1 and Orai1."
https://openalex.org/W2037911961,"The ability to ensure proteostasis is critical for maintaining proper cell function and organismal viability but is mitigated by aging. We analyzed the role of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR(ER)) in aging of C. elegans and found that age-onset loss of ER proteostasis could be reversed by expression of a constitutively active form of XBP-1, XBP-1s. Neuronally derived XBP-1s was sufficient to rescue stress resistance, increase longevity, and activate the UPR(ER) in distal, non-neuronal cell types through a cell-nonautonomous mechanism. Loss of UPR(ER) signaling components in distal cells blocked cell-nonautonomous signaling from the nervous system, thereby blocking increased longevity of the entire animal. Reduction of small clear vesicle (SCV) release blocked nonautonomous signaling downstream of xbp-1s, suggesting that the release of neurotransmitters is required for this intertissue signaling event. Our findings point toward a secreted ER stress signal (SERSS) that promotes ER stress resistance and longevity."

Protein translation is central to cellular life. Although individual steps in translation such as the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex are known in intricate molecular detail, a global understanding of how these steps combine to set the pace of protein production for individual genes remains elusive (Jackson et al., 2010Jackson R.J.

Systematic measurements for some of the most critical rates—such as the gene-specific rates of 5′ UTR scanning and start codon recognition—are extremely difficult to perform. As a result, questions as fundamental as the relative role of initiation versus elongation in setting the pace of protein production are still actively debated (Kudla et al., 2009Kudla G. Murray A.W.

Automated design of synthetic ribosome binding sites to control protein expression.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Sequencing techniques such as ribosomal profiling provide snapshots of the translational machinery in a cell (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar; Reid and Nicchitta, 2012Reid D.W.

Chem. 2012; 287: 5518-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One way to leverage this new information is to develop a computationally tractable model of translation in a cell, to parameterize it from known measurements, and to use it to infer any unknown parameters of global translation dynamics. Here, we develop a whole-cell model of protein translation, and we apply it to study translation dynamics in yeast. Our model describes translation dynamics to the single-nucleotide resolution for the entire transcriptome. In combination with ribosomal profiling data, we use our model to infer the initiation rates of all abundant yeast transcripts. We systematically explore how the codon usage, transcript abundance, and initiation rate of a transgene jointly determine protein yield and cellular growth rate. Applied to the endogenous genome, our model reproduces one of the defining features of ribosomal profiling measurements: a decrease in ribosome density with codon position. We evaluate both elongation- and initiation-driven hypotheses for the ramp of 5′ ribosome densities. We also describe the factors that influence ribosomal pausing along mRNA molecules, as well as the effects of stress on translation. We developed a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov model of translation. The model tracks all ribosomes and transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules in a cell—each of which is either freely diffusing or bound to a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule at a specific codon position at any time point (Extended Experimental Procedures). Rates of initiation and elongation are based on physical parameters that have been experimentally determined in yeast, including the cell volume, the abundances of ribosomes and tRNAs, and their diffusion constants (Tables 1 and S1 available online). Transition rates among states are parameterized in seconds so that the model describes the dynamics of translation in real time, as opposed to using arbitrary discrete time steps. We provide a precise definition of the Markov state space, as well as pseudocode and complete source code in Data S1 and S2 and also Table S2.Table 1Summary of Model ParametersParameterDescriptionValue or Range of ValuesReferencesRtnumber of ribosomes2 × 105(Warner, 1999Warner J.R.

In particular, if many ribosomes are engaged in translating the mRNAs of one gene, this reduces the pool of free ribosomes and tRNAs available to translate other genes. Our model makes a number of simplifying assumptions. Most importantly, our model treats the total number of ribosomes, tRNA molecules, and mRNA molecules in the cell as fixed quantities because the dynamics of their production and decay are typically slower than those of protein translation (García-Martínez et al., 2004García-Martínez J.

We infer gene-specific initiation probabilities (Extended Experimental Procedures) so that 85% of ribosomes are bound to mRNAs in equilibrium in agreement with measurements in yeast (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Single-RNA counting reveals alternative modes of gene expression in yeast.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We further assume that tRNA charging is fast, which is reasonable because 80% of all tRNAs are charged at any given time in exponential-phase cells (Varshney et al., 1991Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. Direct analysis of aminoacylation levels of tRNAs in vivo. Application to studying recognition of Escherichia coli initiator tRNA mutants by glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.J. Biol.

The role of tRNA and ribosome competition in coupling the expression of different mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6705-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a result of these parameters, the equilibrium number of free ribosomes available in the cell is typically smaller than the number of available charged tRNAs of each species. In this regime, we will show that protein production is generally limited by the rate of translation initiation in the sense that increasing the initiation probability of an mRNA molecule will typically increase the rate at which protein is produced, but increasing its codon elongation rates generally will not increase production. The initiation-limited regime agrees with the long-standing view of endogenous protein synthesis (Andersson and Kurland, 1990Andersson S.G. Kurland C.G.

We implemented our Markov model of translation using the Gillespie algorithm. We simulated 1,500 s of translation and extracted the final 500 s to collect data on translation dynamics in equilibrium (Experimental Procedures). Our implementation requires about 1,300 s of computation time to simulate all initiation and elongation events in a wild-type cell for 1,500 s. In these simulations, at equilibrium, the mean elongation rate is 9.3 aa/s (median = 9.5 aa/s), and the mean distance between consecutive bound ribosomes is 60 codons (median = 34). Both of these quantities agree with empirical measurements in yeast (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D.

To study this in a quantitative model, we simulated translation of a transgene within the context of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell containing 3,795 endogenous genes whose transcript levels and gene-specific initiation probabilities were estimated from ribosomal profiling data (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R.S. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar) (Experimental Procedures). By varying the codon adaptation index (CAI) (Sharp and Li, 1987Sharp P.M. Li W.-H. The codon Adaptation Index—a measure of directional synonymous codon usage bias, and its potential applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar) and transcript level of the transgene across many simulations, we delineated the regimes for which increasing codon bias is expected to increase protein yield and by what mechanisms. Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an example transgene, we found that increasing the CAI of a transgene significantly improves the rate of proteins produced per mRNA molecule only when the transgene mRNA accounts for a substantial proportion of all the mRNA in the transcriptome (Figure 2 and Table S4). For a transgene whose messages account for 50% of the cell’s mRNA content, for example, increasing CAI from almost zero to one results in nearly 3.6-fold more proteins produced per transcript per second (Figure 2B, triangles), whereas optimizing CAI in a transgene expressed at only 1% of the transcriptome results in a more modest increase (∼50%) in its rate of protein production (Figure 2B, squares). These results help explain the divergent views of biotechnological studies, which often report large gains in protein production upon optimizing transgene CAI (Gustafsson et al., 2004Gustafsson C. Govindarajan S. Minshull J. Codon bias and heterologous protein expression.Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 346-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), and evolutionary studies of endogenous translation, which typically report very small effects of CAI on protein production per message (Bulmer, 1991Bulmer M.

Genet. 2011; 12: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The discrepancy arises because transgenes are usually overexpressed and comprise a substantial fraction of all cellular mRNA, whereas endogenous genes are expressed at 1% of the transcriptome or less. Why does codon bias strongly influence protein yield only when a gene has high mRNA abundance? The reason has to do with the effects of codon bias on the pool of free ribosomes, as seen in Figure 3. At equilibrium, neglecting rare abortion events, the rate of protein production from any given mRNA (i.e., the rate of polypeptide termination) must equal the rate of initiation on that mRNA, which, in turn, depends primarily on the abundance of free ribosomes in the cell. Increasing the CAI of a gene will increase its codon elongation rates and thus decrease the density of ribosomes on each of its mRNAs, but the overall effect on the pool of free ribosomes is small when the gene accounts for a small proportion (<1%) of mRNA in the transcriptome, as virtually all endogenous genes do. As a result, increasing the CAI of a gene at low mRNA abundance is not expected to strongly increase the rate of protein production, as our simulations confirm (Figure 2). By contrast, for a transgene at very high abundance (e.g., 50% of cellular mRNA), a significant fraction of all ribosomes in the cell are bound to its mRNAs. Increasing the CAI of such a gene leads to a significant increase in the pool of free ribosomes (Figure 3) and thus a significant increase in initiation rates and protein production from all mRNAs in the cell, including from the transgene itself. Our simulations confirm the mechanistic role of free ribosomes in shaping the relationship between codon bias and protein yield. For a transgene at high abundance, such as 50% of the transcriptome, increasing its CAI causes a 3.2-fold increase in the equilibrium number of free ribosomes in the cell (Figure 3B), which accounts for the great majority of the concomitant 3.6-fold increase in its protein production. By contrast, for a transgene expressed at low levels (e.g., 1% of transcriptome), increasing CAI results in only 3% more free ribosomes (Figure 3B), which is not sufficient to explain the concomitant 50% increase in transgene protein production. (Nonetheless, a 3% fitness gain suffices to explain selection for codon bias in highly expressed endogenous genes over evolutionary timescales.) In this case, the gain in transprotein production is explained instead by reduced ribosomal trafficking at the 5′ end of transgene mRNAs: about 47% more transgene mRNAs are available to be initiated (that is, they are not bound by a ribosome at their 5′ end) when CAI ≈ 1 compared to CAI ≈ 0 in our simulations of such a transgene. In summary, increasing transgene codon bias has a modest effect on translational efficiency, which is limited to the transgene mRNAs themselves and is caused by reduced ribosomal occupancy of their 5′ ends, whereas increasing CAI can have a huge effect on protein production globally—which is caused by an increased pool of free ribosomes—when the transgene has very high transcript abundance. These results (Figures 2 and 3) hold whenever protein translation is limited by the pool of ribosomes freely available for initiation, as is the case in healthy yeast cells (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2153868117,"The smallest reported bacterial genome belongs to Tremblaya princeps, a symbiont of Planococcus citri mealybugs (PCIT). Tremblaya PCIT not only has a 139 kb genome, but possesses its own bacterial endosymbiont, Moranella endobia. Genome and transcriptome sequencing, including genome sequencing from a Tremblaya lineage lacking intracellular bacteria, reveals that the extreme genomic degeneracy of Tremblaya PCIT likely resulted from acquiring Moranella as an endosymbiont. In addition, at least 22 expressed horizontally transferred genes from multiple diverse bacteria to the mealybug genome likely complement missing symbiont genes. However, none of these horizontally transferred genes are from Tremblaya, showing that genome reduction in this symbiont has not been enabled by gene transfer to the host nucleus. Our results thus indicate that the functioning of this three-way symbiosis is dependent on genes from at least six lineages of organisms and reveal a path to intimate endosymbiosis distinct from that followed by organelles."

Here we analyzed how polyQ aggregation interferes with the clearance of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). We show in a yeast model that polyQ-expanded proteins inhibit the UPS-mediated degradation of misfolded cytosolic carboxypeptidase Y(∗) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CG(∗)) without blocking ubiquitylation or proteasome function. Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that the polyQ aggregates sequester the low-abundant and essential Hsp40 chaperone Sis1p. Overexpression of Sis1p restores CG(∗) degradation. Surprisingly, we find that Sis1p, and its homolog DnaJB1 in mammalian cells, mediates the delivery of misfolded proteins into the nucleus for proteasomal degradation. Sis1p shuttles between cytosol and nucleus, and its cellular level limits the capacity of this quality control pathway. Upon depletion of Sis1p by polyQ aggregation, misfolded proteins are barred from entering the nucleus and form cytoplasmic inclusions."

Conditional deletion of LKB1 after axon specification or knockdown of NUAK1 drastically reduced axon branching in vivo, whereas their overexpression was sufficient to increase axon branching. The LKB1-NUAK1 pathway controls mitochondria immobilization in axons. Using manipulation of Syntaphilin, a protein necessary and sufficient to arrest mitochondrial transport specifically in the axon, we demonstrate that the LKB1-NUAK1 kinase pathway regulates axon branching by promoting mitochondria immobilization. Finally, we show that LKB1 and NUAK1 are necessary and sufficient to immobilize mitochondria specifically at nascent presynaptic sites. Our results unravel a link between presynaptic mitochondrial capture and axon branching."

To study the effects of such lesions, we generated animals carrying regulatable Fbxw7 mutant alleles. Here, we show that these mutations specifically bolster cancer-initiating cell activity in collaboration with Notch1 oncogenes but spare normal hematopoietic stem cell function. We were also able to show that FBXW7 mutations specifically affect the ubiquitylation and half-life of c-Myc protein, a key T-ALL oncogene. Using animals carrying c-Myc fusion alleles, we connected Fbxw7 function to c-Myc abundance and correlated c-Myc expression to leukemia-initiating activity.

The noncoding Xist RNA is expressed and initiates XCI only when more than one X chromosome is present. Current models invoke a dependency on the X-to-autosome ratio (X:A), but molecular factors remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that molecular titration between an X-encoded RNA and an autosomally encoded protein dictates Xist induction. In pre-XCI cells, CTCF protein represses Xist transcription. At the onset of XCI, Jpx RNA is upregulated, binds CTCF, and extricates CTCF from one Xist allele. We demonstrate that CTCF is an RNA-binding protein and is titrated away from the Xist promoter by Jpx RNA. Thus, Jpx activates Xist by evicting CTCF.

Design of the FingR incorporates a transcriptional regulation system that ties FingR expression to the level of the target and reduces background fluorescence. In dissociated neurons and brain slices, FingRs generated against PSD-95 and Gephyrin did not affect the expression patterns of their endogenous target proteins or the number or strength of synapses.

Although hemodynamics-based networks have been associated with widespread low-frequency correlations in local field potentials (Arieli et al., 1996Arieli A. Sterkin A. Grinvald A. Aertsen A. Dynamics of ongoing activity: explanation of the large variability in evoked cortical responses.Science. 1996; 273: 1868-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar; Cohen and Kohn, 2011Cohen M.R.

Arieli A. Spontaneously emerging cortical representations of visual attributes.Nature. 2003; 425: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), there is little evidence that resting-state connectivity is related to underlying neuronal connectivity. Moreover, as resting-state studies have focused on broad cortico-cortical networks, little attention has been paid to resting-state connectivity patterns at finer local cortical scales. In this study, we seek to establish the relationship between anatomical connectivity, functional neuronal connectivity, and local resting-state connectivity patterns revealed by fMRI. Our testbed for this study is the connectivity pattern of digit-tip representations in the somatosensory cortex (areas 3b and 1) of squirrel monkeys, an area central to manual behavior in monkeys and amenable to study with fMRI and electrophysiological and anatomical connectivity techniques. This multimodal approach aims to establish an understanding of local (at the millimeter scale) baseline networks revealed by resting-state connectivity and, furthermore, provide evidence to support a local to global hierarchy of resting states within the brain. Resting-state functional connectivity patterns of digit-tip representations in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) were examined in 11 squirrel monkeys (one case is shown in Figures 1A, 1B, and 1D–1F ). Under isoflurane anesthesia, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) maps of digit activation (Figure 1B) and the resting-state acquisitions (static probe touching digit-tip skin; Figures 1D–1F) were recorded using a 9.4T Varian MRI scanner. Seed locations (Figures 1A and 1B, open blue squares) were selected based on fMRI and/or electrophysiological maps of areas 3b and 1 (Figure 1A); using surface vasculature as landmarks (arrowheads), these maps were readily coregistered to the maps acquired by MRI (cf. Chen et al., 2007Chen L.M. Turner G.H. Friedman R.M. Zhang N. Gore J.C. Roe A.W. Avison M.J. High-resolution maps of real and illusory tactile activation in primary somatosensory cortex in individual monkeys with functional magnetic resonance imaging and optical imaging.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9181-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To examine functional connectivity, a seed (Figure 1D, solid blue square) was placed at the voxel that responded strongly to D2 tip tactile stimulation in area 3b, and voxels with significantly correlated resting-state activity (r > 0.7) were identified (Figure 1D). Significant correlated voxels were revealed within area 3b spanning adjacent digits (D1, white dots; D2, yellow dots; D3, red dots; D4, green dots). The voxels with the highest significance in area 3b fell within the seed digit-tip or adjacent digit-tip representations. Within area 1, the largest number of significantly correlated voxels was more restricted along the mediolateral axis and fell largely within representations matching the seed voxel reflected across the border between areas 3b and 1 (D2/D3 digit-tip region). The observed pattern revealed predominantly digit-matched connectivity between areas 3b and 1 and within area 3b broad connectivity impinging on other digits. These results were not dependent on the specific seed chosen within a locale (Figure S1 available online). To examine the specificity of this resulting fMRI correlation pattern, we generated two other resting-state functional connectivity maps with seeds placed in area 3a (Figure 1E) and in the face area of area 3b (Figure 1F). These two seeds produced connectivity patterns quite distinct from the area 3b digit-tip seed. The area 3a seed revealed strong functional connectivity with area 1 but not with area 3b, consistent with known anatomical connectivity (Huffman and Krubitzer, 2001Huffman K.J. Krubitzer L. Area 3a: topographic organization and cortical connections in marmoset monkeys.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 849-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; Jones et al., 1978Jones E.G. Coulter J.D. Hendry S.H. Intracortical connectivity of architectonic fields in the somatic sensory, motor and parietal cortex of monkeys.J. Comp. Neurol. 1978; 181: 291-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The seed in the area 3b face area exhibited intrinsic connectivity within area 3b but little significant correlated activity elsewhere, also consistent with known anatomy (cf. Manger et al., 1997Manger P.R. Woods T.M. Muñoz A. Jones E.G. Hand/face border as a limiting boundary in the body representation in monkey somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6338-6351PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that different seed locations reveal different connectivity patterns that parallel underlying anatomy. Such patterns were observed across animals, as illustrated in summary resting-state connectivity maps (Figures 1G–1I) and in the population pairwise correlation coefficients (Figure 1C). Cross-animal correlation maps were generated by averaging the correlation r values on a voxel-by-voxel basis across 21 runs obtained from 10 animals. As imaging planes are tangential to the surface of the cortex, seed voxels (located in area 3b or area 3a D2, D3, or D4 digit-tip locations or in the control area 3b face location) were used to align images across animals. Despite the normal spatial variations of seed location relative to landmarks such as the central sulcus, consistent patterns were observed across cases. For the area 3b seed (Figure 1G), there was clearly a focus of high correlation near the seed in area 3b and a secondary peak corresponding to area 1. The greater mediolateral extent of strong connectivity within area 3b compared to area 1 (Figure 1G, thresholded red region) was consistent with that observed in individual cases. The population area 3a digit seed (Figure 1H) revealed a large focus in area 3a and a second in area 1. The population face seed in area 3b revealed a single large region of high correlation (Figure 1I). These differences were further quantified, as shown in the boxplot of seed-pair correlation coefficients in Figure 1C. Robustness of these patterns across studies is also bolstered by the high reproducibility across days (compare Figures 2A–2C and 2D–2F ) and across runs (compare Figures 2G–2I and 2J–2L). Thus, across cases, resting-state connectivity exhibited similar patterns and was demonstrably not random in nature. Having established area-specific resting-state connectivity patterns, we further evaluated whether digit-specific connectivity could be revealed. Figure 3A illustrates the 3D plot of correlation r values for voxels (r > 0.2) within the imaged field of view for one case with a seed in area 3b D3. This reveals a range of r values, with the highest (red) occurring over the matching digit location in area 1, weaker r values with other voxels within area 3b and with nonmatching digits in area 1 (green). The weakest r values were between area 3b digit and control locations (blue). These findings were consistent across runs (Figure 3B). Voxel-voxel correlations between face seeds in area 3b produced the highest values within local face voxels and not with digit voxels in area 3b, area 3a, or area 1/2 (Figures 3C and 3D). These differences in r values are not a byproduct of signal/noise ratio variation, as the region of interest has relatively even intensity (Figure S2). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4, seeds placed in voxels overlying other digits produced digit-specific connectivity patterns that shifted in appropriate topographic fashion (D2 seed in area 3b with D2 in area 1, red dotted line, Figure 4A; D3 seed in area 3b with D3 in area 1, green dotted line, Figure 4B; D4 seed in area 3b with D4 in area 1, blue dotted line, Figure 4C; face seed correlates only with nearby face voxels, Figure 4D).Figure 4Seeds in Different Digits in Area 3b Produce Corresponding Shifts in Resting-State Connectivity PatternsShow full captionDotted colored lines indicate the location of the seed of different digits in area 3b.

Across three runs in one animal (high-resolution data from one animal), we found on average different connectivity r values between different cortical loci: the strongest occurred between matching digits in area 3b and area 1 (Figure 3E, 2), intermediate values between different digits within area 3b (Figure 3E, 3), lower values between noncorresponding digits in area 3b and area 1 (Figure 3E, 4), and lowest values between area 3b digit and control areas (Figure 3E, 1). These statistically significant digit-specific differences between seed pairs (p < 0.001) suggest that one can evaluate fine structure in anatomical connectivity using resting-state connectivity patterns. To examine whether the resting-state pattern of area 3b parallels anatomical connectivity, we made single focal anatomical tracer injections (biotin dextran amine [BDA]) into functionally identified digit-tip locations in three other squirrel monkeys. Since squirrel monkeys are small animals (600–900 g) and can only undergo a limited number of procedures (one to three) involving recovery from surgery or anesthesia, we collected different data sets in separate animals. Electrophysiological mapping revealed the orderly digit topography in area 3b and area 1 (Figure 5A). Consistent with our previous studies (Friedman et al., 2004Friedman R.M. Chen L.M. Roe A.W. Modality maps within primate somatosensory cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12724-12729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Friedman et al., 2008Friedman R.M. Chen L.M. Roe A.W.

Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), optical imaging of cortical activation in response to stimulation of single digit tips revealed two activation spots, one in area 3b and one in area 1 (response to D2 stimulation shown in Figure 5B). A focal injection of BDA confined to the single digit-tip representation (<500 μm in diameter) (Figure 5C) was made in the D2 tip location, and the resulting cellular label was reconstructed (Figures 5D and 6). The injection resulted in heavy labeling of cells (orange and yellow) near the injection site in area 3b, as well as patchy label (green and blue) distant from the injection site in the hand area in area 3b (Figure 5D; see also Figure 6). These included adjacent digit locations within area 3b in distal D1, D3, and D4. Heavy label was also observed in area 1, predominantly in the D2/D3 region with heavy focus in the tip representation zone (Figure 5D). Consistent with reciprocal connectivity patterns in somatosensory cortex, BDA-labeled axonal terminal patches (Figure 6) were also observed to share a similar pattern of connectivity (Négyessy et al., 2013Négyessy L. Pálfi E. Ashaber M. Palmer C. Jákli B. Friedman R.M. Chen L.M. Roe A.W. Intrinsic horizontal connections process global tactile features in the primary somatosensory cortex: Neuroanatomical evidence.J. Comp. Neurol. 2013; (Published online February 22, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.23317Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the labeling in this case suggests topographically widespread inputs from other digit locations within area 3b, and relatively mediolaterally restricted inputs from area 1, from largely topographically matched locations. This differential intra- versus interareal pattern of labeling was also seen in two other cases (Figures 5E and 5F; see also Figure 6). Thus, anatomical connections were characterized by two primary axes of information flow (broad intra-areal [Figures 5D–5F, curved red arrows] and comparatively focused interareal connectivity [Figures 5D–5F, straight red arrows]). This pattern was consistent with the strong digit-matched resting-state connectivity between area 3b and area 1, the weaker but distinct connectivity between different digits within area 3b, and the even weaker connectivity between nonmatching digits between area 3b and area 1 (Figure 3E).Figure 6Photomicrographs Showing Anterograde and Retrograde BDA LabelingShow full caption(A–C) Inverse bright-field micrographs providing dark-field-like view of BDA labeling after injections in the D2 tip of area 3b in three squirrel monkeys.

These patterns of connectivity within area 3b and between areas 3b and 1 also were supported by electrophysiological recordings of steady-state neuron-neuron interactions in four other squirrel monkeys. After optical imaging and electrophysiology mapping (Figures 7A and 7B ), on separate electrodes, single units were isolated in the digit-tip representations (D2, D3, and D4 tips) of area 3b and area 1. Area 3b-area 1 (A3b-A1) pairs were either same-digit or adjacent-digit pairs; area 3b-area 3b (A3b-A3b) pairs were all adjacent-digit pairs. To achieve sufficient spike numbers, we elevated spontaneous activity by placing a static tactile probe on the digit tips (raster plots and histograms shown in Figure S3A); this is a common method of increasing spike rate for functional connectivity studies that does not affect the nature of the neuronal correlation in primates (Kaas et al., 1990Kaas J.H.

Such baseline activity of each neuron was collected and neuronal interaction was assessed with cross-correlation methods (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We observed robust intra-areal and interareal synchronized neuronal firing in this cortical network. Typical of cortical correlograms (CCGs), peaks tended to be broad (approximately 50 ms in width at half height) and centered on zero (individual examples shown in Figure S3B, blue lines). Both shuffled and simulated spike trains produced flat cross correlograms (Figure S3B, red lines). Population correlograms are shown in Figures 7C and 7D. We examined whether there were any differences in connectivity between same-digit and adjacent-digit pairs. Of the A3b-A1 pairs that exhibited significant correlogram peaks (A3b/A1 same digit, 50.5%, 160/317; A3b/A1 adjacent digit, 48.7%, 153/314), we found the stronger interactions (as measured by both peak size and peak area) in the A3b-A1 same-digit pairs than in the adjacent-digit pairs (Figure 7C; blue, A3b-A1 same digit; red, A3b-A1 adjacent digit; p < 0.001; grand mean peak values: same-digit, 0.080, adjacent digit, 0.065). Frequency histograms of the peak strengths, together with their empirical cumulative distributions, further corroborated the peak size differences (Figure S3C). In sum, these comparisons revealed that, as a population, same-digit interactions were stronger than different-digit interactions, consistent with the relative robustness of same-digit interaction revealed anatomically and with resting-state fMRI. CCGs also revealed robust intra-areal interactions in area 3b (all recorded between adjacent D2-D3 or D3-D4 digit pairs). Although somewhat weaker than interareal interactions (grand mean peak 0.058, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 0.05), significant interactions were observed in roughly half of the pairs (area 3b/3b, 45.6%, 63/138 pairs). This is illustrated in the population correlogram in Figure 7D. Thus, in an area that traditionally has been considered highly topographic, these data underscore surprisingly prominent interdigit interactions in area 3b, and are consistent with the intra-areal connectivity patterns revealed by anatomy and resting-state fMRI. We next examined whether there was any evidence for directionality in the population of interactions between area 3b and area 1. Consistent with previous studies on cortical neuronal interactions (Steinmetz et al., 2000Steinmetz P.N. Roy A. Fitzgerald P.J. Hsiao S.S. Johnson K.O. Niebur E.

Specificity of color connectivity between primate V1 and V2.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2719-2730PubMed Google Scholar), most neuronal interactions in the SI were centered on zero; that is, the bulk of CCGs had peaks occurring at zero. However, we noticed that there were often asymmetries in the overall shape of CCGs, indicating that of the neuronal interactions that were directional, more were in the positive than in the negative direction (i.e., more feedforward than feedback interactions). To quantify these impressions across the population, for each CCG, we computed an asymmetry index [ASI = (R − L)/(R + L), where R and L are the numbers of interactions to the right and left of zero, respectively]. This index ranges from −1 to 1, with larger numbers indicating greater asymmetry, where a value of 0.33 indicates that the distribution to the right of zero is twice that to the left of zero. This index indicates the directionality of the population of coincidences within a CCG and is not the same as peak position. For both same-digit (Figure 7E, blue) and adjacent-digit (Figure 7E, red) populations of A3b-A1 pairs, the distributions of ASI of individual CCGs were significantly shifted to the right (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, p < 0.001; same-digit pairs, median value = 0.07, n = 160 pairs; adjacent-digit pairs: median = 0.06, n = 153 pairs), suggesting an overall feedforward direction from area 3b to area 1. There were no significant differences in ASI distribution between same-digit (blue) and adjacent-digit (red) interareal pairs (Figure 7E, p > 0.1). Thus, although the strongest interactions appear to be due to common input (i.e., co"

The molecular mechanism underlying the development of temporal lobe epilepsy remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB promotes epileptogenesis caused by status epilepticus. We investigated a mouse model in which a brief episode of status epilepticus results in chronic recurrent seizures, anxiety-like behavior, and destruction of hippocampal neurons. We used a chemical-genetic approach to selectively inhibit activation of TrkB. We demonstrate that inhibition of TrkB commencing after status epilepticus and continued for 2 weeks prevents recurrent seizures, ameliorates anxiety-like behavior, and limits loss of hippocampal neurons when tested weeks to months later. That transient inhibition commencing after status epilepticus can prevent these long-lasting devastating consequences establishes TrkB signaling as an attractive target for developing preventive treatments of epilepsy in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2104127415,"An ultimate goal of evolutionary biology is the prediction and experimental verification of adaptive trajectories on macroevolutionary timescales. This aim has rarely been achieved for complex biological systems, as models usually lack clear correlates of organismal fitness. Here, we simulate the fitness landscape connecting two carbon fixation systems: C3 photosynthesis, used by most plant species, and the C4 system, which is more efficient at ambient CO2 levels and elevated temperatures and which repeatedly evolved from C3. Despite extensive sign epistasis, C4 photosynthesis is evolutionarily accessible through individually adaptive steps from any intermediate state. Simulations show that biochemical subtraits evolve in modules; the order and constitution of modules confirm and extend previous hypotheses based on species comparisons. Plant-species-designated C3-C4 intermediates lie on predicted evolutionary trajectories, indicating that they indeed represent transitory states. Contrary to expectations, we find no slowdown of adaptation and no diminishing fitness gains along evolutionary trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2114476117,"Although communication between neurons is considered a function of the synapse, neurons also release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. We found that dendritic transmitter release coordinates activity across distinct neuronal populations to generate integrative homeostatic responses. We show that activity-dependent vasopressin release from hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons in the paraventricular nucleus stimulates neighboring (~100 μm soma-to-soma) presympathetic neurons, resulting in a sympathoexcitatory population response. This interpopulation crosstalk was engaged by an NMDA-mediated increase in dendritic Ca(2+), influenced by vasopressin's ability to diffuse in the extracellular space, and involved activation of CAN channels at the target neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interpopulation crosstalk plays a pivotal role in the generation of a systemic, polymodal neurohumoral response to a hyperosmotic challenge. Because dendritic release is emerging as a widespread process, our results suggest that a similar mechanism could mediate interpopulation crosstalk in other brain systems, particularly those involved in generating complex behaviors."

In mobility shift assays, PHR1 and its close homologue PHL1 (PHR1-like 1) interact with Element 2 of the AtFer1 promoter, containing a P1BS (PHR1 binding site). In a loss of function mutant for genes encoding PHR1 and PHL1 (phr1 phl1 mutant), the response of AtFer1 to phosphate starvation was completely lost, showing that the two transcription factors regulate AtFer1 expression upon phosphate starvation. This regulation does not involve the IDRS (iron-dependent regulatory sequence) present in the AtFer1 promoter and involved in the iron-dependent regulation. The phosphate starvation response of AtFer1 is not linked to the iron status of plants and is specifically initiated by phosphate deficiency. Histochemical localization of iron, visualized by Perls DAB staining, was strongly altered in a phr1 phl1 mutant, revealing that both PHR1 and PHL1 are major factors involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2065993573,"Serum paraoxonases (PONs) are detoxifying lactonases that were first identified in mammals. Three mammalian families are known, PON1, 2, and 3 that reside primarily in the liver. They catalyze essentially the same reaction, lactone hydrolysis, but differ in their substrate specificity. Although some members are highly specific, others have a broad specificity profile. The evolutionary origins and substrate specificities of PONs therefore remain poorly understood. Here, we report a newly identified family of bacterial PONs, and the reconstruction of the ancestor of the three families of mammalian PONs. Both the mammalian ancestor and the characterized bacterial PONX_OCCAL were found to efficiently hydrolyze N-acyl homoserine lactones that mediate quorum sensing in many bacteria, including pathogenic ones. The mammalian PONs may therefore relate to a newly identified family of bacterial, PON-like ""quorum-quenching"" lactonases. The appearance of PONs in metazoa is likely to relate to innate immunity rather than detoxification. Unlike the bacterial PON, the mammalian ancestor also hydrolyzes, with low efficiency, lactones other than homoserine lactones, thus preceding the detoxifying functions that diverged later in two of the three mammalian families. The bifunctionality of the mammalian ancestor and the trade-off between the quorum-quenching and detoxifying lactonase activities explain the broad and overlapping specificities of some mammalian PONs versus the singular specificity of others."
https://openalex.org/W2151648265,"Recent findings have ignited a controversy over whether the hippocampus is critical for visual perception as well as memory. Some studies have shown that hippocampal damage impairs perception of scenes, but others found no evidence for hippocampal involvement. These studies measured perception as a unitary phenomenon, but recent findings indicate that perceptual discriminations can be based on two kinds of information: states of perceiving local differences or global strength of relational match. In the current study, we separated state- and strength-based perception using a change detection paradigm with scenes. Patients with selective hippocampal damage exhibited significant reductions in strength-based perception but showed spared state-based responses. In a follow-up neuroimaging study, hippocampal activation linearly tracked confidence in strength-based perception, and was not differentially associated with state-based responses. The hippocampus therefore plays a selective role in perception, contributing high-resolution strength information possibly through its role in the representation of relational information."

https://openalex.org/W1985342948,"Neural circuits are shaped by activity-dependent elimination of redundant synapses during postnatal development. In many systems, postsynaptic activity is known to be crucial, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1 mediates elimination of surplus climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in the developing cerebellum. CF synapse elimination was accelerated when activity of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing PCs was elevated by 2-day photostimulation. This acceleration was suppressed by PC-specific knockdown of either the P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) or Arc. PC-specific Arc knockdown had no appreciable effect until around postnatal day 11 but significantly impaired CF synapse elimination thereafter, leaving redundant CF terminals on PC somata. The effect of Arc knockdown was occluded by simultaneous knockdown of P/Q-type VDCCs in PCs. We conclude that Arc mediates the final stage of CF synapse elimination downstream of P/Q-type VDCCs by removing CF synapses from PC somata."

To generate force for the movement of large organelles, dynein needs to be anchored, with the anchoring sites being typically located at the cell cortex. However, the mechanism by which dyneins target sites where they can generate large collective forces is unknown. Here, we directly observe single dyneins during meiotic nuclear oscillations in fission yeast and identify the steps of the dynein binding process: from the cytoplasm to the microtubule and from the microtubule to cortical anchors. We observed that dyneins on the microtubule move either in a diffusive or directed manner, with the switch from diffusion to directed movement occurring upon binding of dynein to cortical anchors. This dual behavior of dynein on the microtubule, together with the two steps of binding, enables dyneins to self-organize into a spatial pattern needed for them to generate large collective forces."
https://openalex.org/W2005470715,"Glomerular hypertrophy is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. Akt kinase activated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) plays an important role in glomerular mesangial hypertrophy. However, the mechanisms of Akt activation by TGF-β are not fully understood. Recently, miR-200 and its target FOG2 were reported to regulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (the upstream activator of Akt) in insulin signaling. Here, we show that TGF-β activates Akt in glomerular mesangial cells by inducing miR-200b and miR-200c, both of which target FOG2, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.

Ziyadeh F.N. Molecular mechanisms of diabetic renal hypertrophy.Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic fibrotic changes have been found to be preceded by hypertrophic growth (4.Ziyadeh F.N. The extracellular matrix in diabetic nephropathy.Am. J.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of mesangial hypertrophy is important for the development of approaches to treat DN. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway plays a key role in cellular hypertrophy. The PI3K enzyme, a well known upstream mediator of Akt kinase activation, is composed of a catalytic subunit, p110, and a regulatory subunit, p85α. When activated, the catalytic subunit of PI3K recruits Akt kinase to the membrane and activates it by phosphorylation (7.García Z. Kumar A. Marqués M. Cortés I. Carrera A.C. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase controls early and late events in mammalian cell division.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Activated Akt phosphorylates several downstream proteins that play central roles in hypertrophy, cell growth, cell survival, and protein synthesis. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) is a major promoter of diabetic renal manifestations. Enhanced expression of TGF-β in renal cells can lead to glomerular mesangial hypertrophy and fibrosis under diabetic conditions (2.Kanwar Y.S. Sun L. Xie P. Liu F.Y. Chen S.

Recent studies have found that PI3K-Akt activation by TGF-β plays a key role in its downstream actions (15.Ghosh Choudhury G. Abboud H.E.

Interestingly, recent studies have shown that down-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a key mechanism by which TGF-β activates PI3K-Akt and that this occurs via microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-216a/miR-217 that target PTEN (16.Mahimainathan L.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Growing evidence suggests that miRNAs play critical roles in the progression of DN. miRNAs are a group of endogenously produced, short noncoding RNAs that bind to the 3′UTRs of target mRNAs through base pairing and inhibit mRNA translation or promote mRNA degradation (20.Bartel D.P.

MicroRNA control of signal transduction.Nat. Rev. 2010; 11: 252-263Crossref Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Several miRNAs expressed in the kidney were found to be mis-regulated in the renal cortex and glomeruli of animal models of diabetes as well as in mouse and human mesangial cells treated with TGF-β or high glucose, and they could modulate the expression of extracellular matrix genes, suggesting a functional role in DN pathophysiology (3.Kato M.

Recently, a novel protein FOG2 was found to bind with the p85α, regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby inhibiting PI3K activation (35.Hyun S. Lee J.H. Jin H. Nam J. Namkoong B. Lee G. Chung J. Kim V.N.

In addition, miR-200 was reported to decrease FOG2 expression by targeting the 3′UTR of the FOG2 mRNA, thereby altering PI3K activity and regulating the insulin signaling pathway and metabolism (35.Hyun S. Lee J.H. Jin H. Nam J. Namkoong B. Lee G. Chung J. Kim V.N.

However, the role of FOG2 in TGF-β signaling and cellular hypertrophy has not been examined. In this study, we show that TGF-β up-regulates miR-200b/c in mouse mesangial cells (MMC) and subsequently down-regulates its target FOG2, which leads to PI3K-Akt activation and glomerular mesangial hypertrophy. Furthermore, we observed that a FOG2 siRNA could directly increase Akt activity and cellular hypertrophy, whereas inhibitors of miR-200b/c could attenuate TGF-β-induced mesangial cellular hypertrophy. These results reveal a novel new role for FOG2 regulated by miR-200b/c in TGF-β-induced PI3K-Akt activation in the pathogenesis of DN. All animal studies were conducted according to protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope. Type 2 diabetic db/db mice and genetic control nondiabetic db/+ mice (10–12 weeks old, eight per group), were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were injected with 50 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneally on 5 consecutive days. Mice injected with diluent served as controls. Diabetes was confirmed by tail vein blood glucose levels (fasting glucose >300 mg/dl). Each group was composed of eight mice. All mice were sacrificed at 16 weeks post-induction of diabetes. Glomeruli were isolated from freshly harvested kidneys by a sieving technique. Renal capsules were removed, and the cortical tissue of each kidney was separated by dissection. The cortical tissue was then carefully strained through a stainless sieve with a pore size of 150 μm by applying gentle pressure. Enriched glomerular tissue below the sieve was collected and transferred to another sieve with a pore size of 75 μm. After several washes with cold PBS, the glomerular tissue remaining on top of the sieve was collected. The pooled glomeruli were centrifuged, and the pellet was collected for RNA extraction. Each glomeruli sample was composed of tissue pooled from two mice. MMC were obtained and cultured as described previously in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (22.Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. MicroRNA-192 in diabetic kidney glomeruli and its function in TGFβ-induced collagen expression via inhibition of E-box repressors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

LY-294002 was from Calbiochem, and MK-2206 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). LY-294002 and MK-2206 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at a final concentration of 20 and 1 μm, respectively, as described previously (36.Kato M. Dang V. Wang M. Park J.T.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of mouse kidneys were mounted onto positively charged slides, deparaffinized, washed with water, blocked with Dako protein block (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and incubated with FOG2 antibody (1:25) for 30 min. Slides were washed with Dako wash, treated with hydrogen peroxide for 5 min, washed with PBS, incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with a peroxidase polymer (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and washed and incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 8 min. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Images were taken at ×40 magnification using an Olympus BX51 microscope with In Studio (Pixera Corp., Santa Clara, CA) software to collect images. ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD) was used to quantify staining. RNA was extracted using miRNeasy columns (Qiagen, Inc. Valencia, CA). miRNA expression analysis was performed with the qScript miRNA cDNA synthesis kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) and PerfeCTa SYBR Green Supermix (Quanta Biosciences). GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and POWER SYBR Green mix (Applied Biosystems) were used for mRNA quantification. Extracted mature miRNAs were first polyadenylated with poly(A) polymerase followed by reverse transcription into cDNA using oligo(dT) primer with universal tag. miRNAs were amplified using specific mature miRNA sequences as forward primers and the universal primer provided in the kit as reverse primer. Real time quantitative PCRs were performed on the 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR primer sequences were as follows: FOG2, 5′-GAGCTGCGAAGACGTGGAGT-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCTGTCCTGGTTTGTC-3′; and TGF-β1, 5′-CAACGCCATCTATGAGA-3′ and 5′-AAGCCCTGTATTCCGTCTCC-3′. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (22.Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. MicroRNA-192 in diabetic kidney glomeruli and its function in TGFβ-induced collagen expression via inhibition of E-box repressors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3432-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Laemmli's sample buffer. Lysates were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Antibody against FOG2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (1:500). Antibodies against phospho-Akt, Akt, and β-actin were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Blots were scanned using GS-800 densitometer and quantified with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides representing the miR mimics, negative control for mimics (NC-M), the miR-200b/c inhibitors, and the negative control for the inhibitors (NC-I) were all obtained from Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA). Cells (1 × 106/transfection) were transfected with siRNA or miRNA oligonucleotides using an Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocols as described previously (19.Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H. Lanting L. Nair I. Gunn A. Nakagawa Y. Shimano H. Todorov I. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. TGF-β activates Akt kinase through a microRNA-dependent amplifying circuit targeting PTEN.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). MMC were trypsinized and resuspended in Basic Nucleofection Solution at 1 × 107/ml. Subsequently, 100 μl of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells) was mixed with miRNA mimic, hairpin inhibitor oligonucleotides, or ON-TARGET plus siRNA or negative controls (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) as indicated. Transfected cells were harvested for RNA and protein isolation at indicated times. Hypertrophy was assessed by measurement of cellular protein/cell counts as described previously (19.Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H. Lanting L. Nair I. Gunn A. Nakagawa Y. Shimano H. Todorov I. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. TGF-β activates Akt kinase through a microRNA-dependent amplifying circuit targeting PTEN.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). MMC were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter Counter with 100-μm aperture (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Cells were lysed, and total protein content was measured using protein assays from Bio-Rad. Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM software (Graph-Pad, San Diego, CA) for data analysis with Student t tests or analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were expressed as means ± S.E. To evaluate whether glomerular FOG2 is related to the progression of DN, we first examined the expression of FOG2 in glomeruli of type 2 and type 1 diabetic mice. The immunohistochemical staining of FOG2 was significantly decreased in glomeruli from type 2 diabetic db/db mice compared with nondiabetic control mice (db/+) (Fig. 1, A–C). FOG2 mRNA levels were also significantly lower in the renal glomeruli of the diabetic db/db mice when compared with control db/+ mice (Fig. 1D). Conversely, TGF-β1 gene expression levels were increased in the glomeruli from db/db mice (Fig. 1E). A similar decrease in FOG2 staining was observed in glomeruli from streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice (STZ) compared with nondiabetic control mice (CON) (Fig. 1, F–H). FOG2 mRNA levels were lower in STZ glomeruli (Fig. 1I), whereas TGF-β1 expression levels were significantly higher (Fig. 1J). To further clarify whether the glomerular expression of FOG2 is regulated by diabetic conditions in vitro, MMC were cultured with either normal glucose (NG, 5.5 mm) or high glucose (HG, 25 mm) for 72 h. The expression of FOG2 mRNA and protein was significantly down-regulated by HG relative to NG treatment (Fig. 2, A–C). The down-regulation of FOG2 in HG-treated MMC was associated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and D). These changes were accompanied by a significant increase of TGF-β1 expression in HG-treated MMC (Fig. 2E). Because TGF-β is increased in renal cells under diabetic conditions, is up-regulated by HG, and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DN, we next examined the effects of TGF-β. TGF-β treatment in MMC resulted in a significant decrease in FOG2 mRNA (from 6 to 24 h; Fig. 3A) and protein levels (from 1 to 24 h; Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, in parallel, there was a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation in the TGF-β-treated MMC (Fig. 3, B and D). Together, these results suggest that FOG2 expression is decreased in mesangial cells under diabetic conditions in vivo and in vitro, and this is associated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation. In addition, the findings imply that these changes are associated with TGF-β expression, suggesting a link between FOG2 inhibition and Akt phosphorylation in glomerular mesangial cells under diabetic conditions.FIGURE 3TGF-β decreases the expression of FOG2 in MMC.

Recently, FOG2 and its fly analog U-shaped (USH) were found to suppress PI3K activity and thereby repress insulin receptor signaling in human cell lines and Drosophila melanogaster to control growth (35.Hyun S. Lee J.H. Jin H. Nam J. Namkoong B. Lee G. Chung J. Kim V.N.

Therefore, we investigated whether FOG2 also affects the phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of PI3K, in MMC. FOG2 gene silencing by transfection with specific siRNAs (siFOG2) resulted in a significant decrease in FOG2 mRNA (Fig. 4A) as well as FOG2 protein levels (Fig. 4, B and C) relative to nontargeting control siRNA (siNTC). Furthermore, siFOG2 transfection also significantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt relative to siNTC transfection in MMC (Fig. 4, B and D), suggesting that the down-regulated FOG2 in TGF-β-treated cells may have a functional relationship with Akt activation in MMC. Previous studies have shown that glomerular mesangial hypertrophy, a major feature of DN, is a downstream consequence of Akt activation (16.Mahimainathan L. Das F. Venkatesan B. Choudhury G.G.

Mutations of the X-linked protein PHF6 cause the intellectual disability disorder Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS). However, the biological role of PHF6 relevant to BFLS pathogenesis has remained unknown. We report that knockdown of PHF6 profoundly impairs neuronal migration in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo, leading to the formation of white matter heterotopias displaying neuronal hyperexcitability. We find that PHF6 physically associates with the PAF1 transcription elongation complex, and inhibition of PAF1 phenocopies the PHF6 knockdown-induced migration phenotype in vivo. We also identify Neuroglycan C/Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 5 (NGC/CSPG5), a potential schizophrenia susceptibility gene, as a critical downstream target of PHF6 in the control of neuronal migration. These findings define PHF6, PAF1, and NGC/CSPG5 as components of a cell-intrinsic transcriptional pathway that orchestrates neuronal migration in the brain, with important implications for the pathogenesis of developmental disorders of cognition."

Consistent with previous studies, we found that response rank order to the most- and least-preferred stimuli was preserved throughout the receptive field.

At a fine spatial scale, these neurons exhibit local variation in orientation. In contrast, neurons that prefer straight contours exhibit spatially invariant orientation-tuning and homogenous fine-scale orientation maps. Both of these patterns are consistent with a simple orientation-pooling model, with tuning for straight or curved shapes resulting, respectively, from pooling of homogenous or heterogeneous orientation signals inherited from early visual areas.

Visual shape information is processed in the ventral cortical pathway, which progresses from the primary visual cortex (V1), the secondary cortex (V2), intermediate areas (V3/V4), and finally onto the inferotemporal (IT) cortex (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar). In the earlier stages, shape is encoded primarily through local orientation in V1 (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat’s striate cortex.J.

At the final stages in IT, cells have been shown to be selective for complex objects like faces (Desimone et al., 1984Desimone R. Albright T.D. Gross C.G. Bruce C.

How this transformation is achieved remains largely unknown. In addition, the selectivity to complex features becomes more invariant to simple stimulus transformations such as size or spatial position as one traverses the ventral cortical hierarchy (Rust and Dicarlo, 2010Rust N.C.

To understand how contours of objects are integrated into coherent percepts in the later stages, a detailed understanding of shape processing in intermediate stages like V4 is critical. Previous studies (Pasupathy and Connor, 1999Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Responses to contour features in macaque area V4.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2490-2502PubMed Google Scholar, Pasupathy and Connor, 2001Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Shape representation in area V4: position-specific tuning for boundary conformation.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2505-2519PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that neurons in monkey visual area V4 are involved in the processing of shapes of intermediate complexity and are sensitive to curvature. These studies showed that V4 neurons responded more strongly to a preferred stimulus, as compared to a null stimulus, throughout the receptive field (RF)—a form of translation invariance. However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie shape tuning of neurons in area V4 or about the degree to which translation invariance depends on stimulus complexity. Using a dense mapping procedure, we sought to understand the detailed structure of shape selectivity within V4 RFs. We analyzed responses from 93 isolated neurons in area V4 of two awake-behaving male macaques (see Experimental Procedures). The stimuli consisted of oriented bars presented alone or linked end to end to form curves or in the most tightly curved conditions: “C” shapes (Figure 1A). Bars were presented at eight orientations. Composite shapes were composed of three bars linked together to yield five categories of shapes: straight, low curvature, medium curvature, high curvature, and C shaped. Stimuli were presented in fast reverse correlation sequences (16 ms duration, exponential distributed delay between stimuli with a mean delay of 16 ms) at various locations within the RF of peripheral V4 neurons (2°–12° eccentricity) while the monkeys maintained fixation for 3 s. The composite shapes were presented on a 5 × 5 location grid centered on the RF, while the oriented bars were presented on a finer 15 × 15 location grid. The grid of locations and the size of visual stimuli were scaled with RF eccentricity to maintain the same proportions as shown in Figure 1A. A pseudorandom sequence from the combined stimulus sets was presented in each trial. We found that the majority of neurons in our population were significantly selective to the composite contours. Example neurons with significant tuning for composite contours are illustrated in Figure 2 (neurons I, II, and III). The middle panels (labeled B) show the mean firing rate response to each of the composite forms tested (5 × 16 array) at the most responsive spatial location. The adjacent panels to the right show the Z scores of the responses after subtracting the mean spatial response (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1A, available online, for details of assessing significance). Example neuron I is preferentially tuned to straight shapes, neuron II to medium-curvature shapes, and neuron III to high-curvature/C shapes. Neuron IV had a significant spatial response but no significant shape selectivity. The distribution of spatial and shape selective tuning is shown in Figure 1B. Across the population, 80 of 93 neurons showed significant shape selectivity while a smaller subset (n = 13, labeled in blue) had spatial tuning without significant shape tuning. We did not analyze this subset further. Furthermore, among neurons with significant shape selectivity, those preferring either straight or more curved stimuli exhibited similar degrees of selectivity (Figure 1C). There was no correlation between the degree of selectivity and shape preference. We find that neurons that are tuned for straight (zero-curvature) or low-curvature contours are spatially invariant in their tuning. That is, they respond preferentially to the same shape in different parts of the RF. The response characteristics of an example neuron are shown in Figure 3 (example neuron I). Earlier studies (Pasupathy and Connor, 1999Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Responses to contour features in macaque area V4.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2490-2502PubMed Google Scholar) examined spatial invariance by comparing the neuronal responses to the most (black bar) and least (white bar) preferred stimulus across different spatial locations, as seen in the lower right panel of Figure 3A. Our fast mapping procedure allowed us to estimate the selectivity for the full set of composite shapes at different spatial locations. Examination of the location-specific response maps taken from four significant response locations (Figure 3B) reveals the neuron’s full spatial invariance. The local maps show clear tuning for straight shapes, with an orientation preference that is shared across locations. This point is further clarified by plotting the shape (or set of shapes) to which the neuron preferentially responds at different locations of the stimulus grid. This is shown in Figure 3A (bottom-left panel), in which the set of shapes to which the neuron responded (greater than 90% of local peak rate) at each location are spatially superimposed (color indicates firing rate). This spatial invariance to orientation tuning is also reflected in the homogeneity of the fine-scale orientation-tuning map obtained from the bar stimuli on the 15 × 15 grid (Figure 3C). Several other examples of straight- and low-curvature-tuned neurons exhibiting spatial invariance are shown in Figure S2. In contrast, we found that neurons tuned for curved (medium to high) and C-shaped stimuli exhibited a high degree of spatial variation in their shape preference. Two such example neurons are shown in Figure 3 (neurons II and III). In both cases, comparing the relative responses evoked by the most and least preferred stimuli across locations (Figure 3A, lower right panels) suggests a degree of spatial invariance, consistent with earlier studies (Pasupathy and Connor, 1999Pasupathy A. Connor C.E. Responses to contour features in macaque area V4.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2490-2502PubMed Google Scholar). However, the pattern of selectivity to the full set of stimuli across locations reveals that the preferred stimulus varies considerably across locations. Example neuron II exhibits selectivity for distinct clusters of medium-curvature shapes in different parts of its RF (Figure 3B). The fine-scale orientation-tuning map for this neuron (Figure 3C) shows that although there is relatively sharp tuning for orientation at each location, there is a systematic variation in tuning across locations, and this variation appears to be correlated with the neuron’s spatially varying curvature preference. Note that the average fine-scale orientation response (Figure 3C, left inset) for this neuron is not tuned and therefore does not reflect the diversity of orientation tuning at the fine scale. Such a neuron would be mischaracterized as nonorientation selective if mapped at a coarse level. Example neuron III shows similar spatially varying preference for the C stimuli and a heterogeneous fine-scale orientation map. We see evidence for tuning along both dimensions of our stimulus space: orientation (e.g., neuron III, location 4) and shape category (e.g., neuron II, locations 2 and 4). We considered if neurons selective to highly curved shapes might be less tuned to the orientation of the shape. However, at the population level, we find that orientation tuning, as indexed by circular variance (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), is not correlated with shape preference (Figure S1C). We also considered if these neurons might be less tuned in the shape dimension (Figure S1B). Again, we find that at the population level, an index of shape tuning (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) is not correlated with shape preference (Figure S1D). Other examples of neurons exhibiting spatial variation in shape preference are shown in Figure S3. To quantify the relationship between curvature preference and spatial invariance at the population level, we examined two complementary aspects of the neuronal data. First, we computed the shape preference and the preferred orientation at each location in the stimulus presentation grid where the neuron responded significantly (see Experimental Procedures). As one measure of translation invariance, we determined the preferred shape and orientation at the maximally responsive location and measured how shape and orientation preferences changed relative to those values at other spatial locations (Figure 4). We find a clear difference in spatial invariance between the population of cells that prefer straight/low curvature (local shape preference values between 0 and 1, n = 32; Figure 4A) versus those that either prefer medium curvature (local shape preference values between 1.5 and 2.5, n = 16; Figure 4B) or high-curvature/C-shaped stimuli (local shape preference values between 3 and 4, n = 20; Figure 4C). We find that those neurons that preferred straight or low curvature at the most responsive location tend to be tuned for similar orientations at other RF locations and preserve their shape preference across locations (Figure 4A). In contrast, although neurons that prefer high curvature at their maximally responsive location continue to prefer high curvature at other locations within the RF, the preferred shapes do not generally share the same orientation (Figure 4C). Similarly, neurons with preference for medium curvature at their maximally responsive location tend to prefer medium curvature at other locations, but the preferred shapes are not as sharply aligned with the reference orientation (Figure 4B). The marginal distribution of orientation preference for the straight/low-curvature neurons (Figures 4A, right histogram) was significantly different from those of the other two subpopulations (Figures 4B and 4C, right histograms; p = 0.03 and p = 0.006, respectively; see Experimental Procedures). Second, we compared neuronal response patterns across the entire set of curved shapes between pairs of locations within the RF. For any pair of location-specific response maps where the neuron responded significantly, we estimated the empirical distribution of correlation coefficients between the response patterns (see Experimental Procedures; Figure S4). The mean pattern correlation (ρ, expected value of the empirical distribution) provides a measure of tuning similarity or invariance between pairs of locations in the RF, with values closer to 1 corresponding to spatially invariant tuning. The average pattern correlation for each neuron (averaged across all pairwise ρ values) when plotted against the average shape preference (Figure 5A) shows a power-law decay relationship. Neurons with preference for medium curvature and higher tend to have little spatial invariance. In contrast, neurons with very low-curvature preference tend to have substantial spatial invariance, with few units exhibiting low invariance. For each location pair in our population, we also calculated the reliability of the estimated pattern correlation from the SD of the empirical distribution (see Experimental Procedures). This controls for the possibility that noisier data gave rise both to greater response heterogeneity and lower pattern correlations. A scatterplot of pattern correlation (ρ) versus pattern reliability (r) is shown in Figure 5B for all possible location pairs across all neurons in our population. We see no difference in the reliability of our estimates for three subpopulations of location pairs: those that come from neurons with average shape preference for straight/low curvature (shape preference values between 0 and 1), those from neurons with average shape preference for medium curvature (shape preference values between 1.5 and 2.5), and those from neurons with average shape preference for high-curvature/C-shaped stimuli (shape preference values 3 and 4) (Figure 5B, lower histograms). If those neurons that showed variation in their response pattern across locations did so due to noise in their estimates (i.e., due to low firing rates or fewer trial repeats), then we would expect them to have low reliability values. Thus, differences in spatial invariance cannot be attributed to differences in the statistical reliability of estimates. One last point that is worth highlighting is that pairs with lower pattern correlation values come from neurons with a preference for higher-curvature/C shapes, whereas those with higher pattern correlation come from neurons with a preference for straight/low-curvature shapes. The distribution of pattern correlation of the straight/low-curvature subpopulation is significantly different from those of the other two subpopulations (Figure 5B, right histograms; p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively; see Experimental Procedures). We thus find evidence for a trade-off between shape selectivity and position invariance. This phenomenon is evident in terms of both the peak shape selectivity and the overall firing rate patterns to the entire set of composite shapes. We questioned whether or not we could explain the diversity of shape tuning from the diversity in the fine-scale orientation-tuning maps of V4 neurons (Figure 6). Some neurons show high degrees of translation invariance for orientation at this finer scale (Figure 6, bottom row) while others show heterogeneous tuning (Figure 6, top row). As noted above, the spatial layout of the fine-scale orientation-tuning maps in our example cells (Figure 3C) seems to reflect the cell’s shape-selective properties. It has been proposed, both from experimental observations (Chapman et al., 1991Chapman B. Zahs K.R. Stryker M.P.

Retinal origin of orientation maps in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), that simple pooling of the spatially segregated afferent connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the primary visual cortex (V1), might determine both the orientation-tuning characteristics of V1 neurons as well as the pinwheel structure of orientation maps in V1. We hypothesized that this pooling architecture might carry forward to downstream retinotopic extrastriate areas like V4. This hypothesis is also consistent with earlier proposals, in which neuronal responses in V4 to combinations of line elements are weighted averages of the responses evoked by individual elements (Ghose and Maunsell, 2008Ghose G.M.

To examine the degree to which the pooling of orientation signals could account for the observed complexity of shape tuning in V4 neurons, we generated location specific-response predictions to the composite shapes derived from a simple weighted average of the component responses obtained from the fine-scale orientation-tuning maps (see Experimental Procedures). We then calculated the correlation coefficient between the observed response pattern and the predicted response pattern. Note that the fine-scale orientation maps contain both a spatial response component and an orientation-tuning component. To investigate the contribution of these components, we also considered two reduced versions of the pooling model (see Experimental Procedures; Figure S5C). A space-only version was obtained by averaging across orientation at each fine-grid location. This model did not have any local orientation tuning. An orientation-only version was obtained by subtracting the space-only response from the measured data at each fine-grid location, leaving only orientation tuning. Thus, this model did not contain any local spatial information. The predicted response maps for two example neurons (neurons II and III in Figures 2 and 3) are shown in Figure 7A (panels labeled “prediction”). Maps are shown for three different RF locations for each neuron. For the RF location marked “1”, the left panel shows the empirical data, while the other three panels show the predicted responses from the full model and the two reduced models. Shown below the predicted response maps are the corresponding sections of the fine-scale orientation map, which were used to generate the predictions. To take the example of RF location 1 in neuron II, we can see clearly that the selectivity for medium-curvature shapes pointing upward arises from the layout of the fine-scale map; the middle location is tuned to horizontal elements, the upper-left location is tuned to elements tilted 45 degrees counterclockwise, and the upper-right location is tuned to elements tilted 45 degrees clockwise (and also vertical). There is a close correspondence between the data and the predicted patterns both for the full model and the orientation-only model. The space-only model performed less well but still explained significant parts of the response (ρ=0.43 for the space-only model versus ρ=0.58 for the orientation-only model). Thus, both spatial and orientation components contribute giving the best correlation (ρ=0.67) for the full model. Only the predictions of the full model are shown for RF locations “2” and “3”. The model correlations (full model only) at each spatially significant location are shown in the lower left panel of Figure 7A. In the case of example neuron III, the local orientation tuning was highly heterogeneous and most of its curvature selectivity could be explained by local spatial tuning alone. As seen for RF location 1, the largest responses occur for composite shapes whose ends fall in the upper part of the fine-scale grid where the spatial response is higher (i.e., on the RF boundary). The orientation of the end elements is not critical, but they must fall inside the RF. The space-only model provided a better fit (ρ=0.66) as compared to the local orientation information (ρ=0.22), and, in fact, the combined orientation and spatial information in the full model slightly worsens the prediction (ρ=0.60). This neuron may thus be largely nonselective to orientation but nevertheless exhibits curvature selectivity at the boundaries of the RF due to spatial inhomogeneity. This highlights to what extent texture- or nonorientation-selective units can exhibit curvature-selective responses at their spatial boundaries. Other cells tuned for high-curvature shapes exhibited similar orientation heterogeneity (Figure 6, top row) and had selectivity for curved shapes typically at the RF boundary (see examples in Figure S3). To test the predictive power of the model, we computed a null distribution of the correlation coefficients by repeatedly shuffling the fine-scale orientation maps and then generating response patterns from these shuffled maps (Figure S5A; see Experimental Procedures). This shuffling procedure perturbed the relative spatial structure of the fine-scale map within a coarse grid location. It thus serves as a comparison against which to test whether contour preferences at a given location depend on the spatial arrangement of the local orientation map. Using this procedure, we calculated whether any of the model correlations (across all spatially significant locations) were significantly different from chance (p = 0.05) after correcting for multiple comparisons. The spatial locations where the model correlations are significant are demarcated with “x” for our example neurons (Figure 7A, lower left panels). Across the population, 80% of neurons showed a significant prediction (i.e., at least one RF location with significant p value; on average 40% of the RF locations had significant p values). The linear pooling model accounts for a substantial fraction of the response variance (see Experimental Procedures) across neurons with varied shape preferences. Figure 7B shows a scatterplot of the mean explained variance (averaged across RF locations) for the full model versus average shape preference. The marginal distribution of the mean explained variance has a median value of 0.25. Examining the histogram of explained variance for the full and reduced models (Figure 7C), we see that the orientation-only model plays a dominant role for the straight/low-curvature categories (linear Pearson correlation, r = −0.4, p < 0.001). Note that the local orientation significantly improved fits for medium-curvature neurons (p < 0.001), though not for high-curvature neurons. Thus, for medium curvature, local orientation plays a significant role. Meanwhile, the space-only model plays a key role across all shape categories (r = 0.09, p = 0.02). In general, the full model is the best predictor across the population. Note that the pooling model explored in our study does not in any way deemphasize the importance of nonlinearities in the neuronal response. Previous studies have found that nonlinear operations such as divisive normalization help explain the responses of extrastriate neurons to multiple oriented stimuli in their RFs (Heuer and Britten, 2002Heuer H.W. Britten K.H. Contrast dependence of response normalization in area MT of the rhesus macaque.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 3398-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; Lee and Maunsell, 2010Lee J. Maunsell J.H.R.

Competitive mechanisms subserve attention in macaque areas V2 and V4.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1736-1753PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that the simplest model, linear pooling of local oriented responses, can in fact explain much of the variation in V4 shape tuning across space, but we anticipate that more complete models incorporating nonlinearities would perform still better. To investigate whether some of our results were influenced by the spatial and temporal characteristics of our stimuli, we conducted several control experiments on subsets of cells in our neural population (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Neurons exhibit virtually identical tuning when stimuli were presented for longer durations (200 ms; Figure S6) and when the components of the curved shapes were changed to elongated Gabors (Figure S7A). Neurons did not exhibit tuning to spatially scrambled versions of the stimuli, indicating tuning for spatial structure (Figure S7B). This was consistent with the fact that spatial shuffling of the fine-scale orientation maps yields very poor prediction of shape selectivity, thus lending further support to the importance of local structure. One innovation of the current study is the use of fast reverse correlation procedures to map V4 RFs. Such techniques are common in earl"
https://openalex.org/W2079852022,"Early stages of visual processing must capture complex, dynamic inputs. While peripheral neurons often implement efficient encoding by exploiting natural stimulus statistics, downstream neurons are specialized to extract behaviorally relevant features. How do these specializations arise? We use two-photon imaging in Drosophila to characterize a first-order interneuron, L2, that provides input to a pathway specialized for detecting moving dark edges. GABAergic interactions, mediated in part presynaptically, create an antagonistic and anisotropic center-surround receptive field. This receptive field is spatiotemporally coupled, applying differential temporal processing to large and small dark objects, achieving significant specialization. GABAergic circuits also mediate OFF responses and balance these with responses to ON stimuli. Remarkably, the functional properties of L2 are strikingly similar to those of bipolar cells, yet emerge through different molecular and circuit mechanisms. Thus, evolution appears to have converged on a common strategy for processing visual information at the first synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2071055050,"Extrinsic cues activate intrinsic signaling mechanisms to pattern neuronal shape and connectivity. We showed previously that three cytoplasmic Ser/Thr kinases, LKB1, SAD-A, and SAD-B, control early axon-dendrite polarization in forebrain neurons. Here, we assess their role in other neuronal types. We found that all three kinases are dispensable for axon formation outside of the cortex but that SAD kinases are required for formation of central axonal arbors by subsets of sensory neurons. The requirement for SAD kinases is most prominent in NT-3 dependent neurons. SAD kinases transduce NT-3 signals in two ways through distinct pathways. First, sustained NT-3/TrkC signaling increases SAD protein levels. Second, short-duration NT-3/TrkC signals transiently activate SADs by inducing dephosphorylation of C-terminal domains, thereby allowing activating phosphorylation of the kinase domain. We propose that SAD kinases integrate long- and short-duration signals from extrinsic cues to sculpt axon arbors within the CNS."

Here, we identify the intracellular mSYD1A (mouse Synapse-Defective-1A) as a regulator of presynaptic function in mice. mSYD1A forms a complex with presynaptic receptor tyrosine phosphatases and controls tethering of synaptic vesicles at synapses. mSYD1A function relies on an intrinsically disordered domain that interacts with multiple structurally unrelated binding partners, including the active zone protein liprin-α2 and nsec1/munc18-1. In mSYD1A knockout mice, synapses assemble in normal numbers but there is a significant reduction in synaptic vesicle docking at the active zone and an impairment of synaptic transmission.

In this study, IQGAP1 (IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1), a new Nrf2 interaction partner that we have published previously, was found to modulate MEK-ERK-mediated Nrf2 activation and induction of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant genes. Nrf2 binds directly to the IQ domain (amino acids 699-905) of IQGAP1. Knockdown of IQGAP1 significantly attenuated phenethyl isothiocyanate- or MEK-mediated activation of the MEK-ERK-Nrf2 pathway. Knockdown of IQGAP1 also attenuated MEK-mediated increased stability of Nrf2, which in turn was associated with a decrease in the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and a decrease in the expression of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant genes. In the aggregate, these results suggest that IQGAP1 may play an important role in the MEK-ERK-Nrf2 signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1994517522,"The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that drive islet β-cell compensation and failure are not fully resolved. We have used in vitro and in vivo systems to show that FoxO1, an integrator of metabolic stimuli, inhibits PPARγ expression in β-cells, thus transcription of its target genes (Pdx1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, and pyruvate carboxylase) that are important regulators of β-cell function, survival, and compensation. FoxO1 inhibition of target gene transcription is normally relieved when upstream activation induces its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Attesting to the central importance of this pathway, islet expression of PPARγ and its target genes was enhanced in nondiabetic insulin-resistant rats and markedly reduced with diabetes induction. Insight into the impaired PPARγ signaling with hyperglycemia was obtained with confocal microscopy of pancreas sections that showed an intense nuclear FoxO1 immunostaining pattern in the β-cells of diabetic rats in contrast to the nuclear and cytoplasmic FoxO1 in nondiabetic rats. These findings suggest a FoxO1/PPARγ-mediated network acting as a core component of β-cell adaptation to metabolic stress, with failure of this response from impaired FoxO1 activation causing or exacerbating diabetes.Background: The molecular mechanisms for islet β-cell compensation and failure are not fully known.Results: FoxO1/PPARγ signaling regulates key β-cell genes, with this network being up-regulated in nondiabetic insulin-resistant rats and impaired in rodents with diabetes.Conclusion: We examine the potential for the FoxO1/PPARγ network as a feature of β-cell compensation and failure.Significance: We identify targets for prevention of type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that drive islet β-cell compensation and failure are not fully resolved. We have used in vitro and in vivo systems to show that FoxO1, an integrator of metabolic stimuli, inhibits PPARγ expression in β-cells, thus transcription of its target genes (Pdx1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor, and pyruvate carboxylase) that are important regulators of β-cell function, survival, and compensation. FoxO1 inhibition of target gene transcription is normally relieved when upstream activation induces its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

https://openalex.org/W2122954632,"Complement activation is implicated in the development of obesity and insulin resistance, and loss of signaling by the anaphylatoxin C3a prevents obesity-induced insulin resistance in mice. Here we have identified C1q in the classical pathway as required for activation of complement in response to high fat diets. After 8 weeks of high fat diet, wild-type mice became obese and developed glucose intolerance. This was associated with increased apoptotic cell death and accumulation of complement activation products (C3b/iC3b/C3c) in liver and adipose tissue. Previous studies have shown that high fat diet-induced apoptosis is dependent on Bid; here we report that Bid-mediated apoptosis was required for complement activation in adipose and liver. Although C1qa deficiency had no effect on high fat diet-induced apoptosis, accumulation of complement activation products and the metabolic complications of high fat diet-induced obesity were dependent on C1q. When wild-type mice were fed a high fat diet for only 3 days, hepatic insulin resistance was associated with the accumulation of C3b/iC3b/C3c in the liver. Mice deficient in C3a receptor were protected against this early high fat diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance, whereas mice deficient in the negative complement regulator CD55/DAF were more sensitive to the high fat diet. C1qa−/− mice were also protected from high fat diet-induced hepatic insulin resistance and complement activation. Evidence of complement activation was also detected in adipose tissue of obese women compared with lean women.

Chalasani N. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a component of the metabolic syndrome.Curr. Gastroenterol. Rep. 2008; 10: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The innate immune system is critical to the development of obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, including the development of insulin resistance (2.Gregor M.F. Hotamisligil G.S. Inflammatory mechanisms in obesity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 415-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar). Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes are associated with an inflammatory response in adipose tissue, characterized by macrophage accumulation and the production of inflammatory mediators, that contributes to the development of peripheral insulin resistance (3.Musso G. Gambino R. Cassader M. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from pathogenesis to management. An update.Obes. Rev. 2010; 11: 430-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 4.Boden G. Shulman G.I.

More recent data suggest that innate immunity and resident macrophages are also involved in the development of hepatic insulin resistance. For example, Lanthier et al. (4.Boden G. Shulman G.I. Free fatty acids in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Defining their role in the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction.Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 32: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) identified Kupffer cells, the resident macrophage in the liver, as critical to the development of hepatic insulin resistance in response to high fat diets. Although it is clear that innate immune responses and resident tissue macrophages are critical to the development of insulin resistance in both adipose tissue and liver, the mechanisms for the activation of resident macrophages and the innate immune response are not completely understood. The role of TLR4 in activation of tissue macrophages in models of obesity has been well explored. For example, free fatty acids interact with TLR4 to activate hepatic macrophages (7.Baffy G. Kupffer cells in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The emerging view.J. Hepatol. 2009; 51: 212-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and cholesterol may interfere with signaling processes regulating TLR signaling and innate immune function (7.Baffy G.

Dietary cholesterol, rather than liver steatosis, leads to hepatic inflammation in hyperlipidemic mouse models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). TLR4 signaling can also be activated in response to increased endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the circulation, the result of impaired barrier function in the intestine in response to high fat diets and/or obesity (9.Valenti L. Fracanzani A.L. Fargion S. The immunopathogenesis of alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Two triggers for one disease?.Semin. Immunopathol. 2009; 31: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Complement is another component of the innate immune system that may contribute to the activation of resident tissue macrophages and chronic inflammation in obesity. The complement cascade is a phylogenetically ancient part of the immune system critical to an organism's ability to ward off infection (10.Gasque P. Complement. A unique innate immune sensor for danger signals.Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Activation of the complement pathway can occur via the classical, lectin, or alternative pathway, all three pathways culminate in the activation of C3. These pathways leading to C3 cleavage are “triggered enzyme cascades,” analogous to the regulated activation of the coagulation pathway (11.Walport M.J. Complement. First of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). The cleavage products C3a and C5a, termed the anaphylatoxins, are important regulators of the inflammatory response. C3a and C5a stimulate the production of cytokines in a number of cell types (12.Monsinjon T. Gasque P. Chan P. Ischenko A. Brady J.J. Fontaine M.C.

Jungermann K. Götze O. Functions of anaphylatoxin C5a in rat liver. Direct and indirect actions on nonparenchymal and parenchymal cells.Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). C5a also has chemoattractant properties, recruiting neutrophils to the site of infection/injury by regulating the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules (14.Jauneau A.C. Ischenko A. Chan P. Fontaine M. Complement component anaphylatoxins upregulate chemokine expression by human astrocytes.FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15.DiScipio R.G.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although complement is classically associated with the protection from invading organisms, a growing body of evidence implicates complement in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as alcoholic (16.Pritchard M.T.

Although these studies indicate a role of complement in the innate immune response to high fat diets and obesity, the specific pathways of complement activation in response to high fat diets/obesity have not been investigated. Recent data in models of alcoholic liver disease have implicated C1q in the classical pathway as a critical mediator of both adipose and liver inflammation in response to alcohol exposure (16.Pritchard M.T.

The classical pathway of complement is activated upon the binding of C1q, the recognition subunit of first component (C1) in the classical pathway of activation, to immune complexes. The interaction of C1q with cell surface markers on apoptotic cells, including phosphatidylserine (22.Païdassi H. Tacnet-Delorme P. Garlatti V. Darnault C. Ghebrehiwet B. Gaboriaud C. Arlaud G.J.

Because adipocyte death via Bid-dependent apoptotic pathways is an important link between high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (26.Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. Adipocyte apoptosis, a link between obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), here we tested the hypothesis that Bid-mediated apoptosis would contribute to the activation of C1q in response to high fat diet-induced obesity and that C1q and complement are critical contributors in the development of adipose tissue inflammation and impaired glucose tolerance/insulin sensitivity in response to high fat diet-induced obesity. 5–8-week-old male mice of each of the following genotypes were used in the described studies. Wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C3aR−/− mice were generated on a mixed genetic background by R. Wetsel (27.Kildsgaard J. Hollmann T.J. Matthews K.W.

C57BL/6 Bid−/− mice were provided by Dr. Xiao-Ming Yin (University of Pittsburgh) (30.Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Bid-deficient mice are resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in pairs in standard microisolator cages and maintained on a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. All animals received humane care, and all procedures were approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C57BL/6 and the different strains of complement deficient mice used in the 8-week-diet studies were fed a high fat diet (D12331; 58% of calories from fat, 25% of calories from maltose dextrins/sucrose) or a micronutrient-matched low fat diet (D12329; 11% of calories from fat, 72% of calories from maltose dextrins/sucrose) (Research Diets, Brunswick, NJ). Mice were weighed weekly, and food intake per cage was measured twice weekly. C57BL/6 and Bid−/− were fed a high fat diet or low fat diet exactly as described previously (26.Alkhouri N. Gornicka A. Berk M.P. Thapaliya S. Dixon L.J. Kashyap S. Schauer P.R. Feldstein A.E. Adipocyte apoptosis, a link between obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3428-3438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mice used in 3-day diet studies were fed the high fat diet or standard Purina laboratory chow. Mice and food were weighed at the beginning and end of the 3-day protocol. All mice were fasted for 6 h prior to euthanasia. Portions of liver or epididymal adipose were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until Western blot analysis, preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and stored at −20 °C until RNA isolation or fixed in 10% formalin or frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) 2The abbreviations used are: OCT, optimal cutting temperature compound; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance; ALT, alanine transaminase; C3b, C3b/iC3b/C3c. (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Inc., Torrance, CA) for histology. Mice were anesthetized, blood was collected, and then mice were injected with insulin (I6634 or I9278; Sigma-Aldrich) via the portal vein (1 μg/g of body weight) or an equal volume of 0.09% saline. Liver and epididymal adipose were harvested 2 min after injection. Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mice were injected with clodronate-containing liposomes (purchased from ClodronateLiposomes.org; 5 mg/ml) or an equal volume of PBS-containing liposomes via tail vein (200 μl/mouse) 24 h prior to beginning the high fat diet for 3 days. Frozen liver or epididymal adipose was homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer, and lysates were used for Western blot analysis as described previously (21.Sebastian B.M. Roychowdhury S. Tang H. Hillian A.D. Feldstein A.E. Stahl G.L. Takahashi K. Nagy L.E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 35989-35997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from liver and adipose, cDNA was prepared, and quantitative RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (21.Sebastian B.M. Roychowdhury S. Tang H. Hillian A.D. Feldstein A.E.

Fasting blood glucose was measured from a tail nick using the OneTouch Ultra Blood Glucose Meter and test strips (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA) prior to administration of anesthetic, if applicable. Glucose tolerance tests were performed on fasted mice after 7 weeks of high fat diet feeding. For glucose tolerance tests, mice received 20% d-glucose solution (2 mg/kg of body weight) or an equal volume of saline by intraperitoneal injection; blood glucose was measured at base line and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Fasting insulin was measured in plasma samples using a commercially available ELISA kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). HOMA-IR was calculated using the formula, (fasting glucose (mg/dl) × fasting insulin (ng/ml))/405. Plasma samples were assayed for ALT using commercially available enzymatic assay kits (Diagnostic Chemicals, Ltd., Oxford, CT) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total liver triglycerides were measured using the Triglyceride Reagent Kit from Pointe Scientific Inc. (Lincoln Park, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For C3b/iC3b/C3c (C3b), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and TUNEL staining in liver, frozen sections were mounted on glass slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed three times in PBS. For C3b and TUNEL staining in epididymal adipose, paraffin-embedded tissue was deparaffinized, and then slides were processed for staining. Sections were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (diluted in PBS) or 10% normal goat serum containing 0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation with a 1:50 dilution of primary antibody against TNFα (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or C3b primary antibody (HM1065, Hycult Biotech, Plymouth Meeting, PA) at 4 °C. The C3b antibody recognized a neoepitope revealed only after cleavage of C3. Sections were washed in PBS, incubated with the fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugates goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:250 diluted in blocking buffer) for 2 h in the dark at room temperature, washed again in PBS, and mounted with VECTASHIELD with DAPI containing anti-fade reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were acquired using a LEICA confocal microscope. No specific immunostaining was seen in sections incubated without primary antibody. TUNEL was visualized using the ApopTag Plus In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (S7165 for rhodamine staining in adipose and S7111 for fluoroscein staining in liver; Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Human omental fat samples were obtained, as previously described, from women undergoing elective abdominal surgery (31.Kelly K.R. Kashyap S.R. O'Leary V.B. Major J. Schauer P.R. Kirwan J.P. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) protein expression is increased in omental adipose tissue of severely obese patients.Obesity. 2010; 18: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Cleveland Clinic. Samples were taken from the omental fat depot adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach and were immediately placed in saline prior to lysis. Tissues were lysed in 20 mm Tris, 1% Np-40, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm Na3VO4 and immediately stored at −80 °C. For Western analysis, 25 μg of total protein was loaded onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes via a semidry transfer technique. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, fraction V in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated overnight with a goat polyclonal antibody against human C3 (1:1000 in TBST) from MP Biomedicals (catalog no. 55033). The C3 cleavage product, C3d, identified based on apparent molecular weight, was detected using chemiluminescence, and images were captured with an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 4000R. Membranes were reprobed overnight with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human HSC70 (1:16,000 in TBST) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog no. sc-7298) and analyzed as above. Plasma from a control subject was incubated with or without zymosan (2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 36 °C and used as a positive control in the Western blot analysis. Values shown in all figures represent means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the general linear model procedure (SAS, Carey, IN).

C57BL/6J and C1qa−/− mice were allowed free access to a high fat diet (HFD) or low fat diet (LFD) for 8 weeks. Mice were fasted for 6 h prior to blood collection and euthanasia. A, fasting blood glucose was measured from a tail nick using a standard glucometer. B, fasting insulin was measured in plasma samples using a commercially available ELISA kit. C, HOMA-IR was calculated using the formula, (fasting glucose (mg/dl) × fasting insulin (ng/ml))/405. D, for glucose tolerance tests, mice received 20% d-glucose solution (2 mg/kg of bodyweight) by intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose was measured at base line and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. For all graphs, values represent means ± S.E. (error bars). A–C, results labeled with different lowercase letters are significantly different from one another (p < 0.05), n = 4–6.

C57BL/6J and C1qa−/− mice were allowed free access to a high fat diet (HFD) or low fat diet (LFD) for 8 weeks. A, paraffin-embedded sections of epididymal adipose tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Images are representative of 4–6 mice/group and are shown at ×20. B, TUNEL-positive nuclei (red) were detected in adipose tissue from wild-type and C1qa−/− mice. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue). TUNEL-positive nuclei were counted and expressed as a percentage of DAPI-positive nuclei. C, immunoreactive C3b was visualized by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded sections from epididymal adipose and semiquantified. Images are shown at ×40 magnification. B and C, values represent means ± S.E. (error bars). Results labeled with different lowercase letters are significantly different from one another (p < 0.05), n = 4–6 mice. D, relative expression of TNFα and MCP-1 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR in epididymal adipose and normalized to 18 S. Values represent means ± S.E. Results labeled with different lowercase letters are significantly different from one another (p < 0.05), n = 10–12 mice. E, relative protein expression of C3d was assessed in the omental adipose of lean and obese women by Western blotting and normalized to HSC70. Values represent means ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2068642473,"Recent studies have shown that the pyruvate-isocitrate cycling pathway, involving the mitochondrial citrate/isocitrate carrier and the cytosolic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDc), is involved in control of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Here we demonstrate that pyruvate-isocitrate cycling regulates expression of the voltage-gated potassium channel family member Kv2.2 in islet β-cells. siRNA-mediated suppression of ICDc, citrate/isocitrate carrier, or Kv2.2 expression impaired GSIS, and the effect of ICDc knockdown was rescued by re-expression of Kv2.2. Moreover, chronic exposure of β-cells to elevated fatty acids, which impairs GSIS, resulted in decreased expression of Kv2.2. Surprisingly, knockdown of ICDc or Kv2.2 increased rather than decreased outward K(+) current in the 832/13 β-cell line. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated interaction of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, and co-overexpression of the two channels reduced outward K(+) current compared with overexpression of Kv2.1 alone. Also, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ICDc enhanced the suppressive effect of the Kv2.1-selective inhibitor stromatoxin1 on K(+) currents. Our data support a model in which a key function of the pyruvate-isocitrate cycle is to maintain levels of Kv2.2 expression sufficient to allow it to serve as a negative regulator of Kv channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1999138524,"The C-type lectin DC-SIGNR (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin-related; also known as L-SIGN or CD299) is a promising drug target due to its ability to promote infection and/or within-host survival of several dangerous pathogens (e.g. HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS)) via interactions with their surface glycans. Crystallography has provided excellent insight into the mechanism by which DC-SIGNR interacts with small glycans, such as (GlcNAc)2Man3; however, direct observation of complexes with larger, physiological oligosaccharides, such as Man9GlcNAc2, remains elusive. We have utilized solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate DC-SIGNR binding and herein report the first backbone assignment of its active, calcium-bound carbohydrate recognition domain. Direct interactions with the small sugar fragments Man3, Man5, and (GlcNAc)2Man3 were investigated alongside Man9GlcNAc derived from recombinant gp120 (present on the HIV viral envelope), providing the first structural data for DC-SIGNR in complex with a virus-associated ligand, and unique binding modes were observed for each glycan. In particular, our data show that DC-SIGNR has a different binding mode for glycans on the HIV viral envelope compared with the smaller glycans previously observed in the crystalline state. This suggests that using the binding mode of Man9GlcNAc, instead of those of small glycans, may provide a platform for the design of DC-SIGNR inhibitors selective for high mannose glycans (like those on HIV). (15)N relaxation measurements provided the first information on the dynamics of the carbohydrate recognition domain, demonstrating that it is a highly flexible domain that undergoes ligand-induced conformational and dynamic changes that may explain the ability of DC-SIGNR to accommodate a range of glycans on viral surfaces."
