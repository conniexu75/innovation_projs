https://openalex.org/W2055590962,"THE hydrogen molecule ion H2+ has played a important part in theoretical chemistry, and its existence in the gaseous phase is well established. Some of our recent experimental work on the reactions of hydrogen atoms in aqueous solutions seems to suggest that a somewhat similar ion exists also in the aqueous phase, where one may have the equilibrium: One might be inclined to assume that this equilibrium is shifted very far towards the dissociation side because of the large heat of hydration of the proton. This, however, will be counteracted to some extent by the bond energy (2.65 eV.) of the H2+ molecule and also if this ion possesses a heat of hydration of considerable magnitude (its hydrated form is then perhaps better represented by H4O+.aq, similar to H3O+.aq)."
https://openalex.org/W2093743644,"PROF. N. FEATHER1 has suggested that, if the dineutron exists, it may be emitted in fission and therefore be present in pile radiations. Further, it is pointed out that bismuth-209 would be a suitable detector for the dineutron, in that it produces actinium C, which has an alpha activity of 2.16 min. half-life readily observable in the presence of other activities produced in the irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W1989092277,THE production of a high-titre anti-human globulin serum is a matter of importance to a laboratory engaged in the detection of incomplete antibodies. Our experience with the usual methods of production has been disappointing; but we have obtained good results with the following course of injections.

https://openalex.org/W2983769804,"THREE structures, namely, D4d, D4 and D2d have been proposed for this substance, the first having all C—C bonds equivalent and the other two having single and double C—C bonds. On the basis of the Raman spectra and electron diffraction studies, Langseth and co-workers1 favour the D4d structure. Lippincott and Lord2 are, however, inclined towards the D4 structure due to the presence of frequency 1655 in the Raman spectrum which has been considered as a C=C frequency, whereas Fleet and co-workers3 favour the D2d structure on the basis of the infra-red studies. Both Langseth and Maccoll4 have cited other evidence from the absorption and thermo-chemical data in favour of the resonating D4d structure, and Kaufman5 from X-ray studies in the solid and Coulson and Moffitt6 from theoretical quantum mechanical treatment favour the D2d structure."
https://openalex.org/W1975492171,"IN a pilot survey, still in progress, of the plankton of the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, Penilia avirostris Dana was found from December 1948 until April 1949. In December, Penilia was found in small quantities at some stations only; except in one case, the numbers were less than 1 per c.m., and Penilia was only recorded from stations of surface temperature 17.8° C. or above. In January, when apparently extensive multiplication occurred, as many as 1,250 per c.m. were recorded, more usual records being 300–400 per c.m. The modal recorded surface temperature for January was 20° C. In February, with a modal recorded surface temperature of 20.4° C., the numbers of Penilia declined to 50–150 per c.m., and continued to decline until April, when a sample with less than 1 per c.m. was recorded at a temperature of 18.7° C. This decline in numbers was reflected in other species. In both January and February, Penilia was frequently the dominant member of the plankton, sometimes forming more than 50 per cent of the planktonic animal population of coastal waters of depth 10–20 fathoms."
https://openalex.org/W2082623197,"THE use of spiral quartz springs in the McBain and Bakr1 balance for adsorption measurements is well known. In stability and chemical inertness they are satisfactory; but they have disadvantages in high initial cost and fragility. Spirals of ‘Pyrex’ glass are cheaper, easier to fabricate, and more robust, but do not seem to have been much used, probably on account of lack of dimensional stability."
https://openalex.org/W1977703130,JAMES1 described the use of potassium ferricyanide for the development of adrenaline in paper chromatograms. The purpose of this letter is to state that such development may also be achieved by fluorescence. In alkaline solution adrenaline produces an apple-green fluorescence when exposed to ultra-violet light2. The fluorescent substance is said to be leucoadrenochrome3.
https://openalex.org/W2031386722,"IN an earlier note1, a method of measuring microwave power by radiation pressure was described. Some experimental results have now been obtained. The power to be measured was fed through an uncompensated wave-guide T-junction to a matched water-load forming part of a balanced calorimeter power-measuring apparatus of the type described by L. B. Turner2. This provides a reliable independent measurement of the power."

https://openalex.org/W2065228840,THE difference between the longitudinal distribution of radioactive phosphorus in the sural nerve of rabbits at rest and in activity has been described in a previous communication1. It has now been shown that there is a similar redistribution of the total phosphorus in isolated nerves.
https://openalex.org/W2087130389,"CHROMATIN elimination at the end of each division from the macronucleus was reported by Kidder1 in Concophthirius mytili. Later, Kidder and Diller2 observed post-divisional chromatin elimination in Urocentrum turbo, Colpidium colpoda, Colpidium campylum and Glaucoma scintillans. Again, in 1936, Diller3 recorded a peculiar type of chromatin elimination in Paramecium aurelia which he termed ‘hemixis’. Seshachar4 confirmed this in three species of Epistylis. The present note embodies certain interesting features concerning the behaviour of the macronucleus during binary fission in Glaucoma pyriformis."

https://openalex.org/W1984818702,"DRYING in the frozen state has been reported as a method of preserving animal tissues, and the fact that the fleshy sporophores of the higher fungi are not visibly destroyed by frost, but only collapse with the ensuing thaw, suggested it might be possible to preserve their morphological characters by quick freezing followed by drying while still in the frozen condition. This has proved to be the case ; but the dried sporophores are so brittle as to require the greatest care in handling, and, unless kept in a desiccator, absorb moisture from the air and soon become shrunken and distorted. These drawbacks can be overcome by immersing the sporophore for a short period in melted wax (paraffin, carnauba, ‘Seekay’) or painting with a solution of wax in volatile solvent, immediately after removal from the desiccator."
https://openalex.org/W2048816396,WE have recently developed in these laboratories a recording manometer which has been employed with success in the measurement of intra-arterial and intra-cardiac pressure-cycles in man.

https://openalex.org/W1975199673,"IN recent years, many workers investigating the effect of different soil fumigants have enclosed their test organisms in cotton or cheese-cloth bags1–3, which were later buried in soil at varying distances from the point of application of the chemical. One advantage of such a method is that the experimental material is readily available for viability tests after treatment; also a number of bags can be buried at different lateral distances from the injection point as well as at different depths. It might therefore be of interest to record an apparent failure of this technique when it was applied to a pot experiment on the nematocidal effect of the soil fumigant ‘D-D’ against the potato-root eelworm, Heterodera rostochiensis. The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of different soil types on the efficacy of this chemical and is the subject of another paper."

I must, however, lay stress upon a point where Huxley is principally wrong."
