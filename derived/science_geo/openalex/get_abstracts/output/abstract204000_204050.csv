https://openalex.org/W2078140365,"In an operant-conditioning study, a bull shark responded to signals at frequencies between 100 and 1500 cy/sec. In its band of greatest sensitivity (400 to 600 cy/sec), it discriminated, from high-level ambient noise, signals of amplitudes which the apparatus could not measure."

https://openalex.org/W2057662793,"WHILE investigating the antifungal principle derived from cultures of a Bacillus subtilis strain, a crystalline substance was obtained as one of the byproducts. It was necessary to decide whether the crystals were a metabolite of the organism or originally contained in peptone used as a dietary essential. The same procedure succeeded in isolating the same crystals from peptone. The peptone was commercially available as ‘Mikuni peptone’ in Japan."

https://openalex.org/W1487386050,"Formic hydrogenlyase, but not foriric dehydrogenase or hydrogenase (hydrogen utilization), was partially inhibited by 33% D/sub 2/O or completely deuterated sodium formate. Thus hypothesis that one, but not two, of the atoms in the evolved hydrogen was in immediate equilibrium with the medium is supported. Mass spectrometric analyses of the hydrogen produced by growing cells showed a deuterium content of about 30 ppm (depleted by a factor of 4.4 to 5.1; theoretical factor = 3.87). The same was true whether glucose or formate was the substrate. The intracellular water and cellular hydrogen were not significantly depleted in deuterium. It is concluded that the fractionation takes place during formate utilization. (auth)"

3. The latter workers found that when the sodium-level of muscle fibres was increased to about 60 mM/l. fibre water, by overnight immersion in cold potassium-free Ringer–Conway fluid containing 120 mM/l. sodium, it was necessary to reduce the external sodium in the presence of 10 mM/1. potassium chloride before active extrusion of sodium would occur."

https://openalex.org/W1994767811,"ALTHOUGH many soil micro-organisms can decompose cellulose1, each group of organisms does so under its own set of conditions. For example, Cellvibrio and Cytophaga develop around soil crumbs placed on filter paper which covers a mineral silica-gel medium, as shown by Winogradsky2. Other workers have reported that cellulose-decomposing fungi were the first organisms to attack ‘Cellophane’ buried in the soil3."
https://openalex.org/W2052492565,"SPORES of Didymium nigripes, a true slime mould, germinate to liberate myxamœbæ which multiply by binary fission. After a period of exponential growth, the uninucleate myxamœbæ fuse to form macroscopic, multinucleate veins of rhythmically flowing protoplasm called plasmodia. Following an indefinite period of growth, the plasmodia differentiate into spore-containing fruiting bodies. Kerr and Sussman1 grew D. nigripes in monoxenic culture with Aerobacter aerogenes on a dilute glucose–peptone–yeast extract agar medium buffered with phosphate at pH 6.2 (hereafter called GPY/5). All stages of the life-cycle were regularly reproduced in less than 7 days. When 0.25 per cent (w/v) brucine was added to the GPY/5, plasmodia did not appear. Instead, the myxamœbæ remained indefinitely as such and could be sub-cultured as amœbæ The myxamœbæ quickly formed plasmodia when harvested from the GPY/5-brucine plates and washed by differential centrifugation."

The mutant was identical with the petite colonie mutant described by Ephrussi1 and Raut2. The argument was that, if oxygen acted directly on some enzyme involved in glucose degradation (for example, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase), it would decrease the rate of glucose catabolism even in the mutant lacking essential components of the cytochrome system."
