https://openalex.org/W2087404852,"Oncogenic ras can transform most immortal rodent cells to a tumorigenic state. However, transformation of primary cells by ras requires either a cooperating oncogene or the inactivation of tumor suppressors such as p53 or p16. Here we show that expression of oncogenic ras in primary human or rodent cells results in a permanent G1 arrest. The arrest induced by ras is accompanied by accumulation of p53 and p16, and is phenotypically indistinguishable from cellular senescence. Inactivation of either p53 or p16 prevents ras-induced arrest in rodent cells, and E1A achieves a similar effect in human cells. These observations suggest that the onset of cellular senescence does not simply reflect the accumulation of cell divisions, but can be prematurely activated in response to an oncogenic stimulus. Negation of ras-induced senescence may be relevant during multistep tumorigenesis."

In these R(AB) transgenic mice, hippocampal PKA activity was reduced, and L-LTP was significantly decreased in area CA1, without affecting basal synaptic transmission or the early phase of LTP. Moreover, the L-LTP deficit was paralleled by behavioral deficits in spatial memory and in long-term but not short-term memory for contextual fear conditioning. These deficits in long-term memory were similar to those produced by protein synthesis inhibition. Thus, PKA plays a critical role in the consolidation of long-term memory."

The rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis of glutathione is γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), a heterodimer consisting of heavy and light subunits expressing catalytic and regulatory functions, respectively. Exposure of HepG2 cells to β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in the steady-state mRNA levels for both subunits. In order to identify sequences mediating the constitutive and induced expression of the heavy subunit gene, a series of deletion mutants created from the 5′-flanking region (−3802 to +465) were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-Basic) and transfected into HepG2 cells. Constitutive expression was maximally directed by sequences between −202 and +22 as well as by elements between −3802 to −2752. The former sequence contains a consensus TATA box. Increased luciferase expression following exposure to 10 μMβ-NF was only detected in cells transfected with a reporter vector containing the full-length −3802:+465 fragment. Hence, elements directing constitutive and induced expression of the GCS heavy subunit are present in the distal portion of the 5′-flanking region, between positions −3802 and −2752. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of several putative consensus response elements in this region, including two potential antioxidant response elements (ARE3 and ARE4), separated by 34 base pairs. When cloned into the thymidine kinase-luciferase vector, pT81-luciferase, and transfected into HepG2 cells, both ARE3 and ARE4 increased basal luciferase expression approximately 20-fold. When cloned in tandem in their native arrangement the increase in luciferase activity was in excess of 100-fold, suggesting a strong interaction between the two sequences. Luciferase expression was elevated in β-NF-treated cells transfected with the ARE4-tk-luciferase vector and all DNA fragments containing ARE4. In contrast, ARE3 did not direct increased luciferase expression in response to β-NF nor did it significantly modify the magnitude of induction directed by ARE4. The influence of the ARE4 oligonucleotide on constitutive and induced expression was eliminated by introduction of a single base mutation, converting the core ARE sequence in ARE4 from 5′-GGACTCAGCG-3′ to 5′-GGACTCAGCG-3′. When introduced into the full-length −3802:+465 segment, the same single base mutation also eliminated both functions. Collectively the data indicate that the constitutive and β-NF-induced expression of the human GCS heavy subunit gene is mediated by a distal ARE sequence containing an embedded tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element.

Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSH is an effective oxygen radical scavenger and serves as a critical co-factor in peroxide detoxification via a reaction catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase. Furthermore, conjugation with GSH is an integral step in the detoxification and elimination of diverse classes of toxic chemical compounds. The formation of hydrophilic glutathionyl conjugates is catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases, a family of isozymes that mediate the conjugation reaction in a substrate-dependent fashion (3Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). Long the object of interest from a toxicology perspective, the protective properties of GSH have assumed even further significance since GSH not only plays a critical role in protection of normal cells, but it has recently been implicated in protection of neoplastic cells from a number of chemotherapeutic agents that exert their cytotoxic effects via generation of reactive oxygen species or production of electrophilic intermediates (4Tew K.D.

Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The augmentation of GSH and GSH-related detoxification systems has also engendered considerable interest as a possible approach for the chemoprevention of cancer. Many chemical chemopreventive agents have been shown to exert an effect on GSH homeostasis or on other elements of GSH detoxification pathways (6Neal G.E. Moss E.J. Manson M.M. Sies H. Ketterer B.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The GCS holoenzyme is a heterodimer that can be dissociated under nondenaturing conditions into light (GCSl) and heavy (GCSh) subunits of 28,000 Da and 73,000 Da, respectively (18Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic activity resides entirely with the heavy subunit, but it has recently been demonstrated that the kinetic properties of the heavy subunit can be profoundly influenced by association with the light, or regulatory, subunit and the redox state of a single disulfide linkage between the two subunits (19Huang C.-S. Chang L.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy and light subunits are encoded for by two distinct genes located on chromosomes 1 and 6, respectively (21Tsuchiya K. Mulcahy R.T. Reid L.L. Disteche C.M. Kavanagh T.J.

Commun. 1995; 209: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Northern analyses reveal that xenobiotic-induced GCS enzyme activity is frequently accompanied by an increase in the steady-state levels of GCSh-specific mRNA transcripts (10Woods J.S. Davis H.A.

Similar analyses for the light subunit have not yet been reported as cloning of the corresponding cDNA has only recently been completed. Exposure to the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (16Borroz K.I. Buetler T.M. Eaton D.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 126: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), tert-butyl hydroquinone (14Liu R.M. Hu H.P. Robison T.W. Forman H.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Biophys. 1992; 296: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) results in transcriptional up-regulation of the heavy subunit gene, suggesting that GCSh gene expression in response to these toxic insults is regulated via as yet unidentified specific cis- and trans-acting factors. Since several treatments that induce expression of key phase II detoxifying enzymes also result in elevated GCS activity as well as increased intracellular GSH levels, we hypothesized that the transcriptional regulation of the GCSh subunit gene and genes in the phase II battery are mediated by common regulatory elements. Regulation of several phase II enzymes in response to a wide array of chemically distinct classes of agents has been demonstrated to be mediated, at least in part, by the presence of an antioxidant response element (ARE) within the 5′-flanking region of the gene (27Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Daniel V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Recent evidence suggests that other cis-acting elements might also participate in concert with the ARE in transcriptional regulation of these genes (30Prestera T. Holtzclaw W.D. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We identified numerous potential response elements and/or enhancer sequences, including a putative ARE, in the 5′-flanking sequence of the human GCSh gene (26Mulcahy R.T. Gipp J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of any specific elements in constitutive or induced expression of the GCSh gene has not been established by functional analyses. In the present study, we utilized a deletion mutagenesis analysis strategy to identify those sequences that modulate constitutive expression of the human GCSh gene and to begin to decipher mechanisms involved in the induced expression of the gene. To this end, HepG2 cells transfected with a series of deletion mutant/reporter fusion genes were exposed to β-naphthoflavone, an inducing agent which activates phase II gene expression via AREs (31Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Xie T. Belinsky M. Xu Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and which we demonstrate also induces expression of both the endogenous heavy and light subunit genes. The results indicate that both constitutive and induced expression of the heavy subunit gene is mediated via a distal consensus ARE sequence. Genomic DNA containing the GCS heavy subunit gene was isolated by screening a human foreskin fibroblast P1 library (Genome Systems) as described previously (26Mulcahy R.T. Gipp J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and synthetic oligonucleotide (20-mers) primers corresponding to internal sequences. All sequence information was verified by multiple bi-directional sequencing reactions. Recombinant expression vectors were created by cloning restriction fragments isolated from the 5′-flanking sequence of the GCSh gene into pGL3-Basic (Promega) for determination of promoter activity or by introducing GCSh DNA or synthetic oligonucleotides into pT81 (ATCC 37584) for determination of enhancer activity. A 4.2-kb genomic DNA fragment was isolated from the 5′-flanking region of GCSh by HindIII/NcoI restriction digestion and cloned into the HindIII/NcoI sites of pGL3-Basic creating the recombinant plasmid −3802/GCSh5′-luc (Fig. 3). This plasmid was subjected to digestion with additional restriction enzymes to generate a series of deletion mutants as detailed in Fig. 3. The enhancer/reporter transgene, −3491:−2438/GCSh5′-luc, was created by cloning an ∼1-kb PpuMI fragment (−3491:−2438) containing AREs 2, 3, and 4 into pT81. Digestion of −3491:−2438/GCSh5′-luc with SacI generated two additional constructs, containing either ARE2 (−2754:−2438) or ARE3 and ARE4 (−3491:−2755). In addition, a series of enhancer/reporter transgenes was created by cloning specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 5) corresponding to ARE1, ARE3, ARE4, ARE3,4, NF-κB, and NQO1hARE sequences into pT81. To prepare the oligonucleotides, complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, phosphorylated, and then cloned into pT81. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 1 × Sequenase reaction buffer and annealed by heating to 90-100°C, cooled slowly to 35°C, extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, ethanol-precipitated, and finally resuspended in water. These double-stranded fragments were then phosphorylated, extracted, and precipitated as before and resuspended in water and ligated into pT81.Fig. 5Nucleotide sequence of oligonucleotides used to examine enhancer activity. Synthetic oligomers corresponding to the complementary strands for the positive control ARE, NQO1hARE, and the potential response elements in −3802/GCSh5′-luc were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated into the tk-luciferase enhancer vector, pT81. A single base mutation (lowercase letters) was introduced into the 76-mer GCShARE3,4 creating a SmaI restriction site which was then used to generate ARE3-tk-luc and ARE4-tk-luc from ARE3,4-tk-luc GCShARE4m was created by introducing a single base change (lowercase) in the corresponding oligomers, converting the consensus ARE sequence 5′-GGACTCAGC-3′ to 5′-GGACTCAGC-3′.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (complete medium). Cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids using a standard calcium phosphate-glycerol shock procedure. HepG2 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. Two to four hours later the cells were transfected by the addition of appropriate DNA expression vectors. Equimolar concentrations of plasmid DNA were used to compensate for variations in plasmid size. To correct for transfection efficiency, 1.25 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMVβ (33MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) containing the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/enhancer was cotransfected with each recombinant plasmid. Four hours after addition of DNA, cells were shocked with media containing 10% glycerol for 3 min at room temperature and then maintained at 37°C for an additional 24 h. At the conclusion of this incubation period, the medium was once again replaced with fresh complete medium containing Me2SO (0.1%) or 10 μMβ-NF (Sigma) dissolved at 1000 × in Me2SO. Sixteen hours later cells were harvested and prepared for determination of luciferase, β-galactosidase activity, and protein content. For cell harvest, transfectants were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Mg2+- and Ca2+-free) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 250 μl of reporter/lysis buffer (Promega). Cells were then scraped from the plates and the resulting lysates spun at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 4°C. The resultant supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and stored on ice pending assay. Total (oxidized and reduced) glutathione content was determined using the technique described by Tietze (34Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5517) Google Scholar) as modified by Bump et al. (35Bump E.A. Taylor Y.C. Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 997-1002PubMed Google Scholar). GCS activity was determined as described previously using a modification (36Bailey H.H. Mulcahy R.T. Tutsch K.D. Arzoomanian R.Z. Alberti D. Tombes M.B. Wilding G. Pomplun M. Spriggs D.R. J. Clin.

Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The rate of γ-glutamylcysteine formation was quantitated by comparison to γ-glutamylcysteine standards and normalized on the basis of protein concentration. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified as described by Rosenthal (38Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Briefly, this assay monitors cleavage of o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside and yields β-galactosidase units as (A420× 380)/t where t = time in min at 37°C and 380 is a conversion factor to convert absorbance to μmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside. To initiate the luciferase assay, cell lysate (1-5 μl) was added to reaction buffer (14 mM MgCl2, 14 mM glycylglycine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 18 mg/ml ATP, pH 7.8), vortexed, and placed in an Analytical Luminescence Laboratory luminometer (400-μl total volume). Following injection of 100 μl of luciferin (4 mg/ml in 10 mM Na2CO3, pH 6.0), luminescence was recorded as relative light units. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency on the basis of β-galactosidase activity and protein content of the lysate yielding a final value of (relative light units/β-galactosidase)/μg protein. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. For Northern analysis 25 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated in formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to a charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with a 764-bp or a 736-bp radiolabeled probe specific for GCSh or GCSl transcripts, respectively (24Gipp J.J. Chang C. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Gipp J.J. Bailey H.H. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled probe specific for 36B4 (40Boothman D.A. Meyers M. Fukunaga N. Lee S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7200-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used to normalize for RNA loading. RNA quantitation was accomplished using the RPAII (Ambion) ribonuclease protection assay. To generate single-stranded radiolabeled probes, the 764-bp PstI fragment isolated from the GCSh cDNA was cloned into the pAlter vector (Promega) and digested with NcoI. The GCSl-specific probe was prepared by cloning a 305-bp HindII fragment from GCSl cDNA into pSKII Bluescript (Stratagene) followed by digestion with DdeI. Using T7 RNA polymerase and [32P]UTP, these vectors yield 301- and 210-bp radiolabeled run-off transcripts and 250- and 179-bp protected fragments for GCSh and GCSl, respectively. To normalize for RNA content glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal standard. pTRI-GAPDH-Human (Ambion) yields a 404-bp transcript and a 316-bp protected fragment. Following hybridization with total cellular RNA and incubation with RNase, fragments were separated on a 5% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel, visualized, and quantitated by using the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). To examine regulation of GCSh induction, we first elected to investigate the effect of exposure of HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells to β-NF, a potent inducer of several phase II enzymes and an agent that exerts its effects, at least in part, through activation of AREs. The effect of β-NF exposure on GCS activity in exposed HepG2 cells is illustrated in Fig. 1A There was a gradual decrease in GCS activity over the 24-h incubation period in untreated and Me2SO-treated HepG2 cells. In contrast, exposure to 10 μMβ-NF resulted in a progressive increase in GCS activity, culminating in a moderate, although significant (p < 0.05), increase in enzyme activity by 24 h after addition of β-NF to the culture medium (Fig. 1A). Induction of GCS expression occurred sooner and was greater following exposure to 25 μMβ-NF. These changes in GCS expression were accompanied by a progressive increase in intracellular GSH levels at each β-NF dose over the 24-h observation period (Fig. 1B). By 24 h GSH levels had increased significantly, reaching in excess of 2- and 4-fold over controls for 10 and 25 μM exposures, respectively. In the case of 25 μM exposure, a significant increase was evident as early as 12 h after addition of β-NF. Exposure of HepG2 cells to increasing concentrations of β-NF also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in steady-state mRNA levels for both subunits of the GCS holoenzyme (Fig. 2, A and B). In all cases, the two heavy subunit transcripts increased proportionally (Fig. 2A). Changes in the relative abundance of the transcripts for the light and heavy subunits as a function of time after addition of β-NF or Me2SO was quantitated by a ribonuclease protection assay engineered to permit quantitation of both transcripts simultaneously. A representative radiograph is shown in Fig. 2C Quantitation by nuclease protection assay was particularly important in the case of the light subunit transcripts that are typically present at low abundance. Quantitative and temporal changes in transcript abundance in β-NF-treated cells are illustrated in Fig. 2, D and E These data confirm the dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels observed by Northern analysis. The β-NF-induced increase in steady-state mRNA levels for the GCSh and GCSl subunits displayed similar kinetic patterns, reaching a maximum at approximately 12 h after initiation of exposure. Interestingly, the increase in GCSl transcripts levels was consistently higher than that observed in the case of the GCSh mRNA. We recently reported (26Mulcahy R.T. Gipp J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) the cloning and partial sequence (−1460:+547) of a genomic clone, designated P1-GCS5′, containing approximately 4.7 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and 0.5 kb of exon I of the human GCS catalytic subunit gene. A 4.2-kb fragment from this clone, spanning the sequence −3802 to +465, was cloned into the pGL3-luciferase reporter vector to create the GCSh/luciferase fusion gene, −3802 GCSh5′-luc (Fig. 3). A series of deletion mutants was then generated from this parent chimeric gene and used to identify functional response elements directing constitutive and β-NF-induced expression of the GCSh gene. The various reporter constructs shown in Fig. 3 were transfected into HepG2 cells and luciferase expression examined 48 h later. Transfection of −3802/GCSh5′-luc increased the luciferase expression approximately 35-fold relative to the expression detected in cells transfected with pGL3-luciferase alone. Progressive deletions from −3802 to −510 resulted in significant reductions in luciferase expression when compared with that produced by −3802/GCSh5′-luc However, the differences in luciferase expression among these three intermediate constructs were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) from each other. Transfection of −202/GCSh5′-luc resulted in significantly increased luciferase activity, attaining levels comparable with those observed following transfection with the full-length f"

Mice with a mutation in the α8 gene do not express the integrin α8β1 and exhibit profound deficits in kidney morphogenesis. In wild-type animals, inductive interactions between the ureteric epithelium and metanephric mesenchyme are essential for kidney morphogenesis. In α8 mutant homozygotes, growth and branching of the ureteric bud and recruitment of mesenchymal cells into epithelial structures are defective. Consistent with these phenotypes, α8 expression is induced in mesenchymal cells upon contact with the ureter. Since none of its previously identified ligands appears likely to mediate the essential functions of α8β1 in kidney morphogenesis, we have used an α8β1–alkaline phosphatase chimera to localize novel ligand(s) in the growing ureter. The distribution of these ligand(s) makes them strong candidates for regulators of kidney morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2049215266,"Regulated signal transduction in discrete microdomains of the cell surface is an attractive hypothesis for achieving spatial and temporal specificity in signaling. A procedure for purifying caveolae separately from other similarly buoyant microdomains including those rich in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins has been developed (Schnitzer, J.

As signal transducing organelles, caveolae organize a distinct set of signaling molecules to permit direct regionalized signal transduction within their boundaries. INTRODUCTIONA fundamental question in signal transduction is how particular substrates are rapidly and specifically phosphorylated by select protein kinases. Because various signaling molecules can rather promiscuously activate a diverse group of effectors in different signaling pathways, a developing theme in signal transduction has been the importance of the intracellular location of signaling molecules, especially protein kinases, through regulated anchoring to membranes (1Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Restricted localization, for instance to the plasma membrane, of the kinases and substrates to their sites of action provides at least some of the specificity and efficiency in the effects mediated by each kinase. By extension, further compartmentalization of signaling mediators into specialized microdomains, for instance at the cell surface, may be required to direct a coordinated cascade that effectively creates a specific signal and effect on the cell. Here, we begin to investigate this hypothesis by examining cell surface signaling in endothelium and its caveolae.Caveolae are specialized microdomains that appear as flask-shaped invaginations on the surface of many cells. Based primarily on morphological studies providing evidence for agonist-induced clustering in caveolae of G-protein coupled receptors (β-adrenergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors), Strosberg (2Strosberg A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) hypothesized 6 years ago that caveolae may participate in cell surface signaling. Caveolae may contain the necessary molecular machinery for mediating compartmentalized signaling. They are reported to be resistant to Triton X-100 solubilization and can be found in Triton-insoluble membranes (TIM) 1The abbreviations used are: TIMTriton-insoluble membrane(s)MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorNRTKnonreceptor tyrosine kinasePKCprotein kinase CMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorPI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePIphosphatidylinositolPLCphospholipase CPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateRLMVECrat lung microvascular endothelial cell(s)SMsphingomyelinPplasma membraneHhomogenateTTriton-soluble phaseVvesicle.

Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) but not another (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar).

Although Triton-insolubility of a membrane protein has been considered a standard hallmark of cytoskeletal association over 2 decades (10Yu J. Fischman D.A. Steck T.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Boyles J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), some investigators have chosen to consider TIM as equivalent to purified caveolae, leading to their proposal that caveolae function in cell surface signaling (4Chang W.-J. Ying Y. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar).More recent work brings this presumed equivalence into serious doubt. Careful examination of the membrane topology and subcellular localization of caveolin/VIP-21, GPI-anchored proteins, and glycosphingolipids reveals that they are located both in the trans-Golgi network as well as in plasmalemmal microdomains (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 14Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K.

Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), indicating that at least two different domains can contribute to the caveolin-containing TIM isolated from whole cells or tissues. Even when starting with highly purified plasma membranes, at least two TIM microdomains, namely caveolae and GPI-anchored protein microdomains, exist distinctly and have been purified separately (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Caveolae not concentrated in GPI-anchored proteins have been purified both in the presence and absence of Triton X-100; they are highly enriched in all four caveolar markers previously identified by electron microscopy including caveolin, Ca2+ ATPase, inositol trisphosphate receptors, and the cholera toxin-binding glycolipid GM1 (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Colloidal gold localization by electron microscopy confirms that the TIM consist of many large vesicles (>200 nm) rich in GPI-anchored proteins along with smaller caveolar vesicles (<100 nm) lacking them (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Moreover, caveolae need not be present for TIM isolation; TIM from cells without caveolae consist of many large vesicles (>200 nm) containing multiple GPI-anchored proteins and NRTK but not caveolin (17Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TIM isolated from cell membranes with or without caveolae have very similar buoyant densities (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 18Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), thereby explaining the observed co-isolation of caveolae with GPI-anchored protein microdomains (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lipid anchoring of the GPI-linked proteins and the dual acylated NRTK appear in both cases to be critical for their existence in TIM (19Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5384-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Finally, it has become apparent that antibodies previously used to immunolocalize GPI-anchored proteins can actually cross-link them and artifactually induce sequestration into clusters associated with caveolae (21Mayor S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1948-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Antibody sequestration of GPI-anchored proteins can induce cell surface signaling in cells without apparent caveolae leading to cell activation apparently via NRTK located in the same microdomains (22Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Recently, another procedure for isolating caveolae has been developed using sonication in the absence of detergents to prepare vesicles that were presented as being quite similar to TIM and enriched not only in caveolin but also unfortunately GPI-anchored proteins (23Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). PDGF receptors and other signaling molecules are also found in these later vesicles (23Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 24Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).With this current knowledge, it is quite unclear where various signaling mediators reside on the cell surface and what essential role, if any, caveolae really play in signaling. Do all lipid-anchored proteins such as the NRTK partition on the cell surface similarly to the GPI-anchored proteins? Or are NRTK unlike GPI-anchored proteins and reside concentrated in caveolae? What about lipid signaling molecules found enriched in the TIM? Do they reside in caveolae? And finally, even if many of these molecules reside in caveolae, can it be demonstrated more directly that distinct signal transduction really can occur in caveolae? Here, we will try to address these questions by utilizing both dual immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and a very selective procedure for purifying caveolae separately from GPI-anchored protein domains in order to define not only which, if any, signaling molecules truly reside in caveolae but also regionalized signal transduction possibly relegated to caveolae.RESULTSHere, we attempted to examine the potential role of caveolae in compartmentalized signal transduction by utilizing two independent techniques: confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and plasmalemmal subfractionation analysis. A very selective subfractionation procedure was used for purifying caveolae from luminal plasma membranes of endothelium isolated directly from tissue. As shown in our past work (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), this procedure, unlike various other methods (3Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar–5Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J.

Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), avoided: (i) contamination from intracellular compartments by starting with highly purified plasma membranes, (ii) potential artifacts induced by isolating and growing cells in culture, and (iii) contamination from other detergent-resistant microdomains including those rich in cytoskeletal or GPI-anchored proteins. It did not require the use of detergents. Briefly, the plasma membrane was coated with polycationic colloidal silica particles so that a stable silica-coated membrane pellicle of increased density was formed that allowed rapid effective isolation to high purity by sedimentation. Equally important, the silica particles uniformly coated the extracellular side of the plasma membrane opposite to the attached caveolae so that other noninvaginated microdomains including those rich in GPI-anchored proteins were firmly adherent, thus preventing their detachment during the shear-mediated stripping and isolation of the caveolae (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This technique was used in situ by intravascular perfusion to allow the purification directly from tissue of endothelial cell caveolae to homogeneity with significant enrichment in known caveolar markers (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It clearly separates caveolae from GPI-anchored protein domains. Here, we first established that these purified caveolae were indeed rich in various key signaling molecules including, surprisingly, certain lipid and lipid-anchored molecules previously not detected in the TIM because of their detergent solubility. Next, we show that a specific ligand can initiate signaling selectively in caveolae as detected by protein-tyrosine phosphorylation regionalized in caveolae and that this signal cascade is inhibited when caveolae are disrupted.Lipid AnalysisWe first examined the effects of Triton X-100 on two kinds of lipid signaling molecules, sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphoinositides, in cell membranes in general. Rat lungs were prelabeled with either [3H]choline or [3H]inositol before homogenizing the rat lung tissue. The homogenates were treated with Triton X-100 and subjected to sucrose density centrifugation to isolate a visible band of low density TIM floating at 15-20% sucrose (fractions 4-6). Lipid analysis revealed that TIM contained abundant [3H]sphingomyelin, but very little, if any, [3H]phosphatidylinositol (PI). As shown in Fig. 1A, approximately 50% of sphingomyelin in rat lung homogenate was found in TIM with 30% in Triton-soluble phase (T) (T1-T5) and 20% in pellet. When normalized by protein concentration (to allow a meaningful comparison of approximately equal amounts of membrane), SM was enriched 20-fold in TIM over starting homogenate (H) (Fig. 1B). By comparison, little PI was found in TIM (<5% of H). The major portion of PI was found in the Triton-soluble phase, which accounted for 71% of H. Consistent with our past results (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), immunoblotting showed that caveolin was enriched 3-5-fold in the TIM relative to H and it was distributed similarly to SM in the fractions collected from the sucrose gradients (data not shown). Our results were consistent with a previous report that SM, but not PI (<5%), was concentrated in the TIM isolated from cultured MDCK cells (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar). When we used MDCK cells (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found about 60% of SM was recovered in TIM, with 20% each in the Triton-soluble phase and the pellet (data not shown). For PI >95% was in the Triton-soluble phase. These results confirm that TIM are rich in SM but not PI. In contrast to these findings, a recent study (7Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) shows PI in TIM at levels varying from about 10 to 25%. This discrepancy may be explained by methodological differences such as the use of a 40 to 5% sucrose step-gradient in 7Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, rather than a 40 to 5% continuous gradient, which may improve separation.To investigate whether SM is truly concentrated in caveolae, the lipid components were analyzed in highly purified caveolae. Rat lungs were radiolabeled as above with tritiated precursors and then processed for purification of the silica-coated luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) and then the caveolae (V). As reported previously (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 16Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 30Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), Western analysis showed that the purified caveolae were rich in caveolin with a 12-fold enrichment of caveolin in V over P (data not shown). Very little caveolin (about 3% of P) remained in P-V (the repelleted silica-coated plasma membranes after removing the caveolae). Lipid analysis showed that the major peak signal of [3H]SM radioactivity was recovered in the purified caveolae fractions. Fig. 1C shows the distribution of SM in each fraction of sucrose gradient. The amount of SM in fractions 4-5 (V) and P-V was approximately equal for each at 35-40% of P. Fig. 1D shows the signal for SM normalized to the protein content of the collected fractions. The enrichment of SM in caveolae (V) was 10-fold relative to P and 23-fold over P-V. In contrast to SM, PI was found mostly in the Triton-soluble phase (T1-T5), which accounted for 86% of P. Very little PI was detected in caveolae (approximately 2% of P). These results indicate that SM was concentrated in the caveolae of the plasma membrane.It is known that phospholipids including PI can be extracted from cell membranes by Triton X-100 (10Yu J. Fischman D.A. Steck T.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 36Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). To avoid this detergent effect, we also purified caveolae in the absence of Triton X-100. Fig. 1E shows that caveolae purified without detergent were indeed rich in PI. The lipid signal in caveolae fraction (V′) was enriched by 5-7-fold over both P and P-V′. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were also found enriched in purified caveolae (data not shown) along with caveolin as reported previously (15Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). By comparison, there was very little PI found in Triton-free 40% sucrose phase (S′) (approximately 2% of P). As expected, the signal for SM was enriched in V′, which was 11-fold more than P-V′ (Fig. 1E).To verify the Triton X-100 solubility of the caveolar PI, the radiolabeled purified caveolae were treated with cold Triton X-100 for 10 min before sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fig. 1F shows the analysis of PI in each fraction of the gradient. Clearly, the Triton X-100 extracted PI with the majority being recovered in detergent-soluble phases (T1-T5), which accounted for 65% of total radioactivity. Hence, our lipid analysis shows that two types of key lipid signaling molecules, SM and PI, can both reside concentrated in caveolae.NRTK Reside Concentrated in CaveolaeMany past studies report NRTK are enriched in TIM in some cases with GPI-anchored proteins (5Lisanti M.P.

It remains unclear whether NRTK are present in caveolae not concentrated in GPI-anchored proteins. Thus, we performed Western analysis on the rat lung tissue subfractions to attempt to detect Yes, Fyn, Lck, Lyn, and Src using monospecific antibodies. All of these NRTK were detected in the silica-coated luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes at levels quite enriched over the starting lung homogenate (Fig. 2). Because our preparations are not contaminated with blood cell components including lymphocytes, as assessed by immunoblotting for specific blood cell markers 2P. Oh, D. P. McIntosh, and J. E. Schnitzer, unpublished observations. and based on the apparent monospecificity of the antibodies (no cross-reaction with Syk, ZAP 70, Src and Fyn), 3R. Campos, personal communication. it appears that the endothelium expressed several different NRTK on its cell surface including Lck. Also the distinct differences in band pattern and Triton solubility (see below) for each of the NRTK suggested that the antibodies recognized different proteins and were not cross-reactive within this group of NRTK.Fig. 2Analysis of NRTK in purified caveolae. Proteins (5 μg) from the rat lung homogenate (H), silica-coated endothelial plasma membranes (P), purified endothelial caveolae (V or V′), Triton soluble fraction (T), and silica-coated plasma membranes stripped of caveolae (P-V or P-V′) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis with antibodies specific for Yes, Fyn, Lck, Lyn, and Src. Left panel shows data for subfractionation performed in the presence of Triton X-100, while the right panel is in the absence of the detergent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The caveolae purified in the presence of Triton X-100 showed that many of the NRTK were significantly solubilized by the detergent (Fig. 2). Yes and Lyn were the most resistant to solubilization and were easily detected in V. Lck and Fyn were detected in V but were primarily found in the Triton-soluble fraction (T). Only a very weak signal for Src was detected in V with much of Src being solubilized by the Triton X-100. Little of the NRTK remained behind in P-V except for Src, which, therefore, appeared to reside in a noncaveolar domain that was resistant, at least in part, to detergent extraction.When caveolae were purified in the absence of Triton X-100, all of these NRTK were found in the detergent-free purified caveolae (V′) at levels much greater than the plasma membrane stripped of the caveolae (P-V′) (Fig. 2). Table I shows the relative enrichment and percent distribution of these proteins in the plasma membranes and its subcomponents. On the endothelial cell surface, much of Lck, Fyn, Lyn, and Yes resided concentrated in caveolae. Src also was detected concentrated in caveolae but to a lesser extent. Src was present significantly in other noncaveolar plasmalemmal domains remaining in P-V′. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of Yes, Lck, Lyn, and Src in endothelial cells and their caveolae by showing significant co-localization of these NRTK with caveolin on the surface of cultured lung endothelial cells (data not shown). Unfortunately, the antibody to Fyn did not detect its antigens in this assay. Thus, it appears that unlike GPI-anchored proteins, various NRTK reside on the endothelial cell surface concentrated in caveolae.Table I.Enrichment and total recovery of signaling molecules detected in endothelial cell caveolaeProteinsEnrichment (V/P-V)% of total in P1V′P-VCaveolin2060.81.93PDGF-R5.746.612.9PI3-kinase7.2251.013.4PLCγ9.1551.611.4PKCα16.5NAaNA, not available.NAPKCβ1935.713.6Yes9.5NANAFyn5.536.53.37Lck8.4834.24.68Lyn7.040.48.81Src5.3823.510.2a NA, not available. Open table in a new tab Other Signaling Molecules Found in CaveolaeWe also have screened the endothelial caveolae purified from rat lung for the presence of other key signaling molecules. So far, we have found PDGF β-receptor, PI 3-kinase, PLCγ, and PKC α and β isoforms amply expressed on the silica-coated luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes and in their caveolae (Fig. 3A). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed on the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3B) to quantify the relative distribution of these molecules (Table I). Notably, many of the targets of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase including PI 3-kinase, PLCγ, and NRTK (37Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were in the caveolae (Fig. 2, Fig. 3A). By comparison, SHC and Ras-GAP were not found enriched in caveolae (data not shown). As expected, various kinases more downstream in the signaling pathway such as ERK1 and ERK2 were not detected in the purified plasma membrane with caveolae (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2048620835,"Interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) is a novel cysteine protease responsible for the cleavage of pre-interleukin-1β (pre-IL-1β) to the mature cytokine and a member of a family of related proteases (the caspases) that includes the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> cell death gene product, CED-3. In addition to their sequence homology, these cysteine proteases display an unusual substrate specificity for peptidyl sequences with a P<sub>1</sub> aspartate residue. We have examined the kinetics of processing pre-IL-1β to the mature form by ICE and three of its homologs, TX, CPP-32, and CMH-1. Of the ICE homologs, only TX processes pre-IL-1β, albeit with a catalytic efficiency 250-fold less than ICE itself. We also investigated the ability of these four proteases to process poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a DNA repair enzyme that is cleaved within minutes of the onset of apoptosis. Every caspase examined cleaves PARP, with catalytic efficiencies ranging from 2.3 × 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for CPP32 to 1.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for TX. In addition, we report kinetic constants for several reversible inhibitors and irreversible inactivators, which have been used to implicate one or more caspases in the apoptotic proteolysis cascade. Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) is a potent inhibitor of CPP-32 with a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> value of 0.5 nM, but is also potent as inhibitor of CMH-1 (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 35 nM) and ICE (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 15 nM). The x-ray crystal structure of DEVD-CHO complexed to ICE presented here reveals electrostatic interactions not present in the Ac-YVAD-CHO co-complex structure (Wilson, K. P., Black, J.-A. F., Thomson, J. A., Kim, E. E., Griffith, J. P., Navia, M. A., Murcko, M. A., Chambers, S. P., Aldape, R. A., Raybuck, S. A., and Livingston, D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2055837207,"We demonstrate that the mRNA levels of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), a mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing the initial step in glycerolipid synthesis, are induced during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes and following ectopic expression of rat adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), a protein with high homology to the human sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The increase in GPAT mRNA levels that occurs during differentiation is partially prevented by ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of ADD1.Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the proximal promoter of the murine mitochondrial GPAT gene (Jerkins, A.

In addition, GPAT promoter-luciferase reporter genes were stimulated by co-expression of SREBP-1a. This increase was attenuated when either a dominant negative form of NF-Y was co-transfected into the cells or when the GPAT promoter contained mutations in the putative binding sites for SREBP-1a or NF-Y. These studies demonstrate that the regulated expression of the mitochondrial GPAT gene requires both NF-Y and ADD1/SREBPs. Thus, SREBPs/ADD1 regulate not only genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid synthesis but also a key enzyme in glycerolipid synthesis.

SREBPs/ADD1 are unique transcription factors containing two transmembrane domains that anchor the proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope (9Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K.

Low cellular sterol levels stimulate a complex set of proteolytic cleavage events of the precursor form of SREBPs to release the mature 68-kDa amino-terminal domain from the endoplasmic reticulum (10Hua X.

This soluble, transcriptionally active form of SREBP is targeted to the nucleus where it binds to cis-elements in the promoters of SREBP-responsive genes (2Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R.

Three distinct cis-elements have been identified: SRE-1 in the promoters of genes encoding the LDL receptor and HMG-CoA synthase (12Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar), SRE-3 in the promoter of the gene encoding FPP synthase (13Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Motifs corresponding to SRE-1 and SRE-3 have been identified in the promoter of the squalene synthase gene (14Guan G. Jiang G. Koch R.L. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the functional roles of these elements in this latter gene have not been reported. Increased transcription of the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA synthase, and FPP synthase genes requires a second DNA-binding protein in addition to SREBP. Studies with FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase promoter-reporter genes identified NF-Y as the second crucial transcription factor (15Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The binding of NF-Y to an inverted CCAAT box motif in the proximal promoter of the FPP synthase gene stimulated the binding of SREBP to an adjacent SRE-3 and allowed active transcription of an FPP synthase promoter-reporter gene (16Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24359-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A different ubiquitous transcription factor, Sp1, is necessary for high expression of the LDL receptor gene (17Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The binding of SREBP to SRE-1 in the promoter of the latter gene stimulated the binding of Sp1 to an adjacent low affinity binding site for Sp1 (17Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that other SREBP/ADD1-responsive genes would require NF-Y or Sp1 in addition to SREBP/ADD1 for high transcription. Consequently, we searched a number of data bases to identify genes involved in lipid biosynthesis that contained potential NF-Y and SREBP/ADD1-binding sequences in their proximal promoters. This analysis identified a number of genes, including the one encoding glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). GPAT catalyzes the acylation of the sn-1 hydroxyl of glycerol-3-phosphate, the initial step of glycerolipid synthesis. The product, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate is a committed intermediate in the biosynthesis of both triglycerides and phospholipids (19Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 87-111Google Scholar). There are two major mammalian forms of GPAT that are localized to either the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria (19Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 87-111Google Scholar). In animal studies, the activities of both GPAT isoenzymes were regulated by changes in the nutritional and hormonal status of the animal (20Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 171-203Google Scholar). However, only the protein (21Yet S-F. Moon Y.K. Sul H.S.

In addition, reporter genes containing a minimum of 86 bp of the GPAT promoter were expressed at 2-fold higher levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as compared with preadipocytes (23Jerkins A.A. Liu W.R. Lee S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1416-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reason for the increased expression of the reporter gene in adipocytes was not determined. In the current study, we report the identification of distinct cis-elements in the GPAT proximal promoter that interact with either SREBP/ADD1 or NF-Y. We demonstrate that the expression of GPAT promoter-reporter genes in transiently transfected cells is increased by co-expression of mature SREBP-1a or SREBP-2. We also demonstrate that high levels of expression of GPAT promoter-reporter genes, in response to co-expressed SREBP-1a, are attenuated when the binding sites for either SREBP or NF-Y in the promoter are mutated or when cells are co-transfected with a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of NF-Y. Finally, we show that the endogenous GPAT mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 cells increase during differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes and in response to ectopic expression of ADD1.

Following transient transfection, the cells were incubated for 20 h in media supplemented with either 10% lipoprotein-deficient calf serum and 5 μM compactin in the absence (inducing media) or presence (repressing media) of sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) (13Ericsson J.

Differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes was achieved by allowing the cells to reach confluence before the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), 0.25 μM dexamethasone (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml insulin (Sigma). After 2 days, and every 2 days thereafter, fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum) was added to the cells. The pBabe retroviral vector (26Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) containing either ADD1 or ADD1-DN (7Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was used to transfect BOSC 23 cells (27Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 93: 8392-8396Crossref Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). The supernatant, containing the recombinant retrovirus, was used to infect 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. After 10-14 days, puromycin-resistant cells were pooled, replated and grown to confluence (day 0 of differentiation) (7Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were induced to differentiate by treatment with differentiation-permissive medium (7Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Subsequent media changes were as described (7Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The GPAT promoter was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using mouse genomic DNA as a template. The 3′-primer corresponded to nucleotides −12 to +17 of the published genomic sequence (Fig. 1) (23Jerkins A.A. Liu W.R. Lee S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1416-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and an additional 10 nucleotides that contained a BglII restriction site. The 5′-primer contained an SstI restriction site and nucleotides that corresponded to −200 to −176 of the published GPAT genomic sequence (Fig. 1) (23Jerkins A.A. Liu W.R. Lee S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1416-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned directionally into pGL2 basic luciferase vector (Promega) to produce pGPAT-A and sequenced to confirm the wild-type GPAT sequence. The subcloned 217-bp fragment of the GPAT promoter was used as a template in subsequent polymerase chain reactions using the same 3′-primer and 5′-primers corresponding to −176 to −160, −160 to −142, or −78 to −58 of the genomic sequence. The products were subcloned into pGL2 to produce pGPAT-B, pGPAT-C, and pGPAT-D, respectively. Two additional 5′-primers were also used, 5′-TACCGAGCTCCTTGGCTGATCAAGCTCAGCC-3′ and 5′-TACCGAGCTCATTGGCTGATCAAGCTAAACCTAGCAGACC-3′ that contained mutations (underlined) in the putative NF-Y or SREBP binding sites, respectively. The promoter-reporter constructs containing these mutations were pGPAT-Y and pGPAT-S, respectively. All polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced after subcloning into pGL2 in order to confirm the presence of wild-type or mutant sequences. Oligonucleotides were either synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc., or were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the GPAT promoter fragment subcloned into pGL2. Double-stranded DNA corresponding to GPAT cDNA was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction following the synthesis of cDNA from mouse liver mRNA using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a 3′-primer (CAGCACCACAAAACTCAGAA) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the mouse GPAT protein. The subsequent polymerase chain reaction was carried out with the same 3′-primer and a 5′-primer (TCCAGAAACCCAGCAGACGA) complementary to the mouse cDNA (22Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting oligonucleotide was cut with EcoRI and PstI, gel-purified, and subcloned into Bluescript SK (Stratagene). The construct was sequenced in order to confirm the sequence of the GPAT insert. The EcoRI/PstI restriction fragment was gel-purified and used in Northern blot analysis (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells, either before or after the initiation of differentiation, using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ten-μg aliquots of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes and cross-linked with UV light as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled cDNA probes were generated by random priming (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Hybridization and quantitation using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) were as described (29Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Metherall J.E. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1712-1721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were also hybridized to a 36B4 probe (7Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), analyzed on the phosphorImager, and the values used to correct for differences in RNA loading in each lane. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides used in these studies corresponded to −192 to −171 (5′-SRE), −176 to −155 (central SRE) or −85 to −65 (NF-Y) of the GPAT promoter. The 95-bp BglII/SstI restriction fragments of pGPAT-D and GPAT-S contain wild-type binding sites for both SREBP-1a and NF-Y or a wild-type binding site for NF-Y and two mutations in the putative SREBP-1a binding site, respectively. Crude HeLa nuclear extracts, provided by Dr. M. Carey (UCLA), were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 (Pharmacia) fast protein liquid chromatography column, and the fractions containing enriched NF-Y, as determined by Western blot analysis, were identified as described (15Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recombinant SREBP-1a, containing N-terminal T7 and polyhistidine (His6) tags was purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli extracts by nickel affinity chromatography as described by Sanchez et al. (17Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Complementary single-stranded DNA, corresponding to the indicated nucleotides of the GPAT promoter and containing either the wild-type sequence or the indicated mutations, were annealed, and the double-stranded probe was isolated from acrylamide gels (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were generated in the same manner following an initial radiolabeling of a single-stranded oligonucleotide with 32P (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The radiolabeled probes (20,000 cpm; 1.5 fmol) were used in gel mobility shift assays in the presence of nonfat milk (2.5 mg/ml) or in the presence of either partially purified NF-Y (5 μg) or recombinant SREBP-1a as described previously (13Ericsson J.

Where indicated, antibody (0.2 μg) to NF-YA, NF-YB, CBF-HSP, or the T7 tag (Novagen) on SREBP-1a were added to the incubations on ice for 30 min before gel electrophoresis was performed (13Ericsson J.

Details of the transient transfection of HepG2, CV-1, or Chinese hamster ovary cells with luciferase reporter genes, a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, pCMV-CSA10 (encoding SREBP-1a), and pCMV-CS2 (encoding SREBP-2) appear in previous publications (13Ericsson J.

Cells were then incubated for 20 h in the indicated media and lysed, and the activities of reporter genes were determined as described (13Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl.

Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Analysis of the published nucleotide sequence for the murine GPAT promoter (23Jerkins A.A. Liu W.R. Lee S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1416-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicated that it contained a number of potential binding sites for SREBP/ADD1 and NF-Y (Fig. 1). Consequently, we hypothesized that transcription of the endogenous GPAT gene might be enhanced under conditions in which the nuclear levels of NF-Y and/or ADD1/SREBP were increased. Previous studies have demonstrated that the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes is associated with an increase in the expression of ADD1 mRNA (3Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 7Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Differentiated adipocytes also accumulated large amounts of triglyceride, presumably as a result of increased synthesis of this lipid. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the mRNA levels for GPAT, an enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis (19Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 87-111Google Scholar), increased 7.5-fold during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes. Maximal GPAT mRNA levels were observed 6-8 days after differentiation was initiated (Fig. 2 and data not shown). 3T3-L1"

In the present study, three complementary techniques were utilized to follow caspase activation during the course of etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells. Immunoblotting revealed that levels of procaspase-2 did not change during etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas levels of procaspase-3 diminished markedly 2-3 h after etoposide addition. At the same time, cytosolic peptidase activities that cleaved DEVD-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin and VEID-aminomethylcoumarin increased 100- and 20-fold, respectively; but there was only a 1.5-fold increase in YVAD-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage activity. Affinity labeling with N-(Nα-benzyloxycarbonylglutamyl-Nε-biotinyllysyl)aspartic acid [(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone indicated that multiple active caspase species sequentially appeared in the cytosol during the first 6 h after the addition of etoposide. Analysis on one- and two-dimensional gels revealed that two species comigrated with caspase-6 and three comigrated with active caspase-3 species, suggesting that several splice or modification variants of these enzymes are active during apoptosis. Polypeptides that comigrate with the cytosolic caspases were also labeled in nuclei of apoptotic HL-60 cells. These results not only indicate that etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is accompanied by the selective activation of multiple caspases in cytosol and nuclei, but also suggest that other caspase precursors such as procaspase-2 are present but not activated during apoptosis.

Caspases are unusual in several respects. First, although they are cysteine-dependent proteases, the members that have been examined are insensitive to antipain and E64, two broad spectrum inhibitors of sulfhydryl proteases (16Black R.A.

Third, activation of caspases appears to require cleavage at Asp-X sequences in the proenzymes to yield the large and small subunits that are present in the active α2β2 tetramer (reviewed in 15Nicholson D.W.

Second, deletion of the genes for several of these proteases does not appear to alter the features of apoptosis induced by many stimuli, perhaps because of functional redundancy in the substrate recognition properties of these proteases (14Martin S.J.

After treatment of HL-60 human acute myelomonocytic leukemia cells with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, PARP and lamin B1 are cleaved just prior to or concomitant with the appearance of other apoptotic changes (30Kaufmann S.H.

Other polypeptides that appear to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis in various cell types include the DNA-activated protein kinase DNA-PK, the retinoblastoma gene product, the 70-kDa polypeptide subunit of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, steroid response element binding proteins, protein kinase Cδ, actin, and the intermediate filament-associated polypeptide Gas2 (reviewed in 5Kaufmann S.H.

In the present study, we have examined HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis after treatment with the topoisomerase II-directed agent etoposide (reviewed in 36Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These studies have focused on determining 1) the number of caspases that are activated during etoposide-induced apoptosis, 2) the subcellular distribution of these active caspases, and 3) the identity of the active caspases. In order to address these questions, a novel affinity label for active caspases was synthesized and characterized, and a new fluorogenic assay for caspase-6-like protease activity was developed. Reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: etoposide, leupeptin, pepstatin, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, PMSF, AMC, and AFC from Sigma; aprotinin from Mobay Pharmaceuticals (New York, NY); poly(A)+ RNA from HL-60 cells from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA); AmpliTaq polymerase from Perkin-Elmer; Superscript RT reverse transcriptase and the Bac-to-Bac™ system from Life Sciences, Inc.; rabbit anti-caspase-1 (PC84) from Calbiochem; murine monoclonal anti-caspase-2 and anti-caspase-3 from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD); 14C-labeled thymidine (57.8 mCi/mmol), Hybond-N membranes, and ECL enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham Corp.; N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin from Pierce; N-(Z)-aspartic acid β-t-butyl ester and YVAD-cmk from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA); DEVD-AFC, YVAD-AFC, and DEVD-fmk from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA); and Biolytes from Bio-Rad. HL-60 cells (a kind gift from Ron Schnaar, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine (medium A). THP.1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were propagated in medium A containing 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol. All cell lines were maintained at concentrations of <1 × 106 cells/ml to ensure logarithmic growth. At the start of each experiment, nonviable cells were removed by sedimentation at 200 × g for 20 min on Ficoll-Hypaque step gradients (density = 1.119 g/cm3). Cells harvested from the interface were diluted with RPMI 1640, sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, and resuspended in fresh growth medium. Etoposide (prepared as a 1000-fold concentrated stock in Me2SO) was added to HL-60 cells at a concentration of 68 μM, a high but clinically achievable concentration (37Creaven P.J. Issell B.F. Muggia F.M. Carter S.K. Etoposide (VP-16): Current Status and New Developments.Academic Press, Inc. 1984; : 103-115Google Scholar) that has previously been shown to induce apoptosis in >85% of HL-60 cells within 6 h (31Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). After drug treatment, all steps were performed at 4°C. Cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 or phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in buffer C (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5 at 4°C), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA supplemented immediately before use with 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After a 20-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed with 20-30 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. Following removal of nuclei by sedimentation at 800 × g for 10 min (see below) or 16,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA and sedimented at 280,000 × gmax for 60 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. After the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 2 mM, the supernatant (cytosol) was frozen in 50-μl aliquots at −70°C. Experiments revealed that aliquots of cytosol retained DEVD-AFC cleavage activity without noticeable decrement for at least 3 months. All experiments described in the present study were performed within 1 month of extract preparation. To isolate nuclei, the homogenates prepared above were sedimented at 800 × g The pellet was washed once with buffer C, resuspended in 1 ml of buffer C, and layered over 4 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2.1 M sucrose and 5 mM MgSO4. The nuclei were sedimented through the 2.1 M sucrose at 80,000 × gmax for 1 h and resuspended in storage buffer (39Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) consisting of 10 mM PIPES (pH 7.4), 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.2 mM spermine, 50% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. To assess purity of the nuclei, the activity of the cytosolic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was assayed as described (40Kaufmann S.H. Gibson W. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2710-2719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To synthesize VEID-AMC, the tetrapeptide portion (Z-VEID) was first synthesized from Fmoc-L-glutamic acid γ-t-butyl ester, Fmoc-L-isoleucine, Fmoc-L-aspartic acid β-t-butyl ester, and Z-L-valine on an acid-labile 2-chlorotrityl chloride polystyrene resin (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY). After assembly of the peptide on an ABI 431A peptide synthesizer using deprotection and coupling protocols provided by the instrument's manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer), the t-butyl-protected tetrapeptide was released by treatment of the peptidyl-resin with acetic acid:trifluoroethanol:dichloromethane (1:2:7) for 30 min at 20°C. Following dilution with 50 volumes of cold H2O, the protected peptide was lyophilized for 2 days to remove acetic acid and organic solvents, purified by gel filtration on LH-20 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 1:1 dichloromethane:n-propanol, and coupled to AMC through its free C-terminal end by a mixed anhydride method with isobutyl chloroformate. In brief, after gel filtration, 48 mg of protected tetrapeptide was dissolved in 2 ml of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and 50 μl of triethylamine, cooled to −5°C, and treated with 40 μl of isobutyl chloroformate for 35 min. A solution containing 13.1 mg of AMC in 1.5 ml of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone was then added dropwise, and the coupling was allowed to proceed for 18 h at 20°C. The protected peptide-AMC conjugate was precipitated by dilution of the reaction mixture with cold H2O, extracted with ethyl acetate, and evaporated to dryness. After treatment with trifluoroacetic acid:H2O (19:1) for 30 min to remove the t-butyl protecting groups, the resulting product was purified to homogeneity by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac Analytical C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; 10 μm; Hesperia, CA) with a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 70% acetonitrile. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry verified that the final product (1.2 mg) had the predicted molecular mass of 764.3. The synthesis of Z-EK(bio)D-aomk was initiated using the methodology described by Krantz (41Krantz A. Copp L.J. Coles P.J. Smith R.A. Heard S.B.

N-(Z)-aspartic acid β-t-butyl ester was activated as a mixed anhydride (1.4 equivalents of N-methylmorpholine, 1.3 equivalents of ethyl chloroformate in tetrahydrofuran at −15°C) and then treated with 2 equivalents of CH2N2 in Et2O to yield the corresponding diazoketone, which was treated with a 1:1 mixture of excess glacial acetic acid and 45% HBr at 0°C to generate the bromomethyl ketone. Treatment of the bromomethyl ketone with 1.2 equivalents of 2,6-dimethylbenzoic acid and 2.5 equivalents of KF in dimethylformamide yielded Z-Asp-(α-((arylacyl)oxy)methyl ketone). After removal of the Z- protecting group by catalytic hydrogenation (1 atmosphere, 10% Pd/C, 1 M solution of compound in ethanol) in the presence of 1.05 equivalents of HCl, the lysine residue was added using conventional amino acid coupling conditions (1 equivalent of Z-Lys(t-Boc)-OH, 1.6 equivalents of benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, 6 equivalents of N-methylmorpholine, dimethylformamide). After the Z- protecting group was again removed by catalytic hydrogenation, the glutamic acid residue was added using identical conditions to yield Z-Glu(OtBu)-Lys(t-Boc)-Asp(OtBu)-(α-((arylacyl)oxy)methyl ketone). The t-butanol and t-Boc protecting groups were removed with trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride to yield Z-Glu-Lys-Asp-(α-((arylacyl)oxy)methyl ketone), which was then reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin to derivatize the ε-amino group of lysine. The product Z-EK(bio)D-aomk was separated from unreacted aomk and excess reagents by reversed phase HPLC. Fractions containing active Z-EK(bio)D-aomk were identified using recombinant bacterial ICE, pooled, and concentrated. Aliquots containing 50 μg of cytosolic or nuclear protein (estimated by the bicinchoninic acid method (44Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1.225 ml of ice-cold buffer D. Fluorescence was measured in a Sequoia-Turner fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 475 nm. Reagent blanks containing 50 μl of buffer C and 225 μl of buffer D were incubated at 37°C for 2 h and then diluted with 1.225 ml of ice cold buffer D. Standards containing 0-3000 pmol of AMC or 0-1500 pmol of AFC were utilized to determine the amount of fluorochrome released. Control experiments (not shown) confirmed that the release of substrate was linear with time and with protein concentration under the conditions specified. To determine the effect of various protease inhibitors, aliquots containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with the indicated inhibitor for 5 min at 21°C and then diluted with substrate in buffer D and assayed as described above. Full-length cDNAs encoding P45 forms of caspase-1, −2, −3, −4, and −6 were cloned by RT-PCR from Jurkat or THP.1 cell RNA using primers flanking the respective open reading frames.

https://openalex.org/W2010645787,"Gelatinase A (GL-A) is a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) involved in both connective tissue remodeling and tumor invasion. GL-A activation is mediated by a membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) that cleaves the GL-A propeptide. In this study, we examined the role of the actin cytoskeleton in regulating GL-A activation and MT-MMP-1 expression. Human palmar fascia fibroblasts and human fetal lung fibroblasts were cultured on a planar substratum or within different types of collagen lattices. Fibroblasts that formed stress fibers, either on a planar substratum or within an attached collagen lattice, showed reduced GL-A activation compared with fibroblasts lacking stress fibers, within either floating or stress-released collagen lattices. To determine whether changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton could promote GL-A activation, fibroblasts with stress fibers were treated with cytochalasin D. Within 24 h after treatment, GL-A activation was dramatically increased. Associated with this GL-A activation was an increase in MT-MMP-1 mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. Treatment with nocodazole, which induced microtubule depolymerization and cell shape changes without affecting stress fibers, did not promote GL-A activation. These results suggest that the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton transduce signals that modulate GL-A activation and regulate tissue remodeling.

MMPs 1The abbreviations used are:MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseMT-MMPmembrane-type matrix metalloproteinasecyto Dcytochalasin DECMextracellular matrixF-actinfilamentous actinGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGL-Agelatinase A. are among the key extracellular enzymes involved in turnover of the ECM during normal and pathological processes. Changes in MMP expression by cells in vitro and in vivo occur in response to different environmental cues, but MMPs must become activated in order for them to exert their biochemical functions (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1994; 4: 197-250Crossref Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). The latency of MMPs, which are secreted as proenzymes, is conferred by the presence of propeptides which contain a free cysteine residue that is thought to associate with the active-site zinc molecule. Activation of MMPs occurs when this association is disrupted by cleavage of the propeptide or by disruption of the cysteine-zinc bond (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1994; 4: 197-250Crossref Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Recently, a sub-family of MMPs, the MT-MMPs, has been identified as having a potential role in activating GL-A (MMP-2, 72-kDa gelatinase), a MMP previously shown to be refractive to most proteolytic activation mechanisms (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). MT-MMPs are unique in that they possess a transmembrane domain that anchors them to the cell surface. In addition, MT-MMPs have a putative activation site cleavable by furin-like intracellular enzymes and may therefore appear on the cell surface already activated (2Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J.

Thus, GL-A, which is constitutively expressed by many cell types, may be regulated through its interaction with the MT-MMPs, which themselves may be regulated transcriptionally.

GL-A activation may be regulated, in part, by the physical properties of the ECM to which cells adhere. Previous studies have demonstrated that fibroblasts cultured on a planar substratum activate little, if any, of the secreted GL-A (5Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W.

Cellular activation of GL-A by cultured fibroblasts is promoted by agents which alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, including phorbol esters, concanavalin A, and cyto D (5Azzam H.S.

J. 1996; 313: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in regulating GL-A activation. In addition, the binding of type I collagen fibrils to the surfaces of fibroblasts, possibly through the α2β1 integrin, can promote GL-A activation (5Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seltzer J.L. Lee A.-Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the three-dimensional organization of the collagen lattice may be critical to this process, as only fibroblasts cultured within floating collagen lattices and not on a thin coating of collagen can promote cellular activation of GL-A (5Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seltzer J.L. Lee A.-Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MT-MMP-1, the best-characterized MT-MMP, is known to be up-regulated in cultured cells by agents which promote cellular activation of GL-A, including concanavalin A, phorbol esters, and cyto D, suggesting that MT-MMP-1 is involved in the cellular activation of GL-A (6Strongin A.Y.

Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has previously been demonstrated that the three-dimensional organization of collagen fibers influences the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (10Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar–15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts cultured in mechanically relaxed floating collagen lattices lack bundles of actin; rather, the actin is organized into a cortical meshwork (10Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, 11Tomasek J.J. Hay E.D. Fujiwara K. Dev.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In contrast, fibroblasts cultured on a thin coating of type I collagen or within mechanically stressed, stabilized collagen lattices organize actin into bundles, referred to as stress fibers, terminating at the cell surface into focal adhesions or fibronexus structures (12Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In this study, using collagen lattice models and cyto D treatment, we demonstrate an inter-relationship between the mechanical properties of the ECM and actin cytoskeleton organization in the regulation of GL-A activation and expression of MT-MMP-1. The mechanical forces which develop in the collagen lattice are demonstrated to be critical regulators of GL-A activation and MT-MMP-1 expression. These results suggest that the mechanical properties of the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton transduce the signals that regulate MT-MMP-1 expression and thereby the activation of GL-A. Human palmar fascia fibroblasts were obtained and cultured, as described previously (13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Pilcher B.K. Kim D.W. Carney D.H. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), in complete medium M-199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 2 mM glutamine, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). WI-38 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured as recommended. For experiments on planar substrata, fibroblasts were plated on 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) at 50% confluence and grown to 90% confluence. Cultures were briefly washed with serum-free medium and treated with 8 μM cyto D (Sigma), 2 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma), or 25 nM GM6001 for 24 h, after which conditioned medium or total RNA was collected. For experiments in collagen lattices, stabilized collagen lattices were cultured for 5 days, washed briefly with serum-free medium, and treated as described above. GM6001, a peptide hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor of MMPs (17Galardy R.E. Grobelny D. Foellmer H.G. Fernandez L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4715-4718PubMed Google Scholar), was a generous gift of Dr. Richard Galardy. Fibroblasts were cultured within type I collagen (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) lattices, as described previously (13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Pilcher B.K. Kim D.W. Carney D.H. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), such that the final collagen concentration was 0.65 mg/ml and the cell concentration 1.25 × 105 cells/ml. Floating collagen lattices were prepared by placing a 250-μl drop of the collagen-cell suspension on 35-mm Petri dishes (Falcon). After a 1-h incubation at 37°C to allow for polymerization of the collagen, 1.5 ml of complete medium was placed over the collagen lattice, which did not adhere to the Petri dishes, but floated freely in the medium. Stabilized collagen lattices were prepared by the identical protocol with the exception that the collagen/cell suspension was placed on a 35-mm tissue culture dish (Falcon). The collagen lattices remained attached to the underlying plastic substratum throughout the culture period. Released collagen lattices were obtained by mechanically releasing the stabilized collagen lattice from the underlying plastic substratum after 5 days in culture (13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Pilcher B.K. Kim D.W. Carney D.H. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thin layer collagen substrata were prepared by incubating 50 μg of collagen/0.25 ml per 24-well culture dish well for 1 h at 37°C, followed by a wash with phosphate-buffered saline. Fibroblasts were cultured within floating, stabilized, or released collagen lattices, as described above. Collagen lattices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the F-actin probe, BODIPY™ phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), as described previously (13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, lattices were permeabilized with ice-cold acetone, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with BODIPY™ phallacidin for 30 min at room temperature, and viewed and photographed as whole mounts using an Olympus Vanox microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Serum-free medium conditioned by cells was analyzed by gelatin zymography, as described previously (18Howard E.W. Bullen E.C. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13064-13069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were poured with 1 mg/ml gelatin, and non-reduced samples were electrophoresed as in standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoretic separation, gels were incubated with 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, then incubated with substrate buffer. After incubation, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Areas of non-staining correspond to gelatinolytic activity. Total RNA was isolated from cells according to published methods (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Samples representing equivalent amounts of total RNA, as determined by spectrophotometry, were separated by denaturing gels, and then RNA was transferred to MSI-NT nylon membranes by capillary action and cross-linked to membranes with UV light. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at 60°C with prehybridization buffer (500 mM NaPO4, pH 7.4, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA). Membranes were then hybridized overnight in prehybridization buffer plus labeled cDNA probe at 60°C. Probes were 32P-labeled by random priming using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), then separated from unincorporated label using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Following three low stringency washes (10 min in 40 mM NaPO4, pH 7.2, 5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature) and two high stringency washes (10 min with 40 mM NaPO4, pH 7.2, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) at room temperature and one 30-min high stringency wash at 60°C, membranes were exposed to x-ray film adjacent to an enhancing screen. Blots were scanned on a densitometer to detect relative changes in mRNA expression. Human GL-A probe was a 913-base pair PstI-EcoRI fragment derived from the full-length cDNA (p16SPT19-1, from W. Stetler-Stevenson, NCI). Human MT-MMP-1 probe was a 3.3-kilobase full-length cDNA isolated from a placental library (provided by S. Fisher, UCSF) by means of a polymerase chain reaction-derived cDNA fragment spanning the propeptide domain to the zinc-binding site. GAPDH cDNA was from the American Type Culture Collection. Fibroblasts were cultured within three-dimensional collagen lattices for 5 days in complete medium, after which they were allowed to condition serum-free medium for 24 h. Mechanically relaxed collagen lattices floated in the culture medium and maximally contracted over the initial 5-day period. Mechanically stressed collagen lattices remained attached to underlying culture dishes and developed maximum stress over this time period (12Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Parallel cultures of these mechanically stressed collagen lattices were released from the underlying substratum, leading to the rapid contraction of the collagen matrix and the dissipation of mechanical stress, a process termed stress-relaxation (12Mochitate K. Pawelek P. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Stress-relaxed collagen lattices were cultured for 24 h after release in complete medium to allow for lattice contraction, after which lattices were cultured for an additional 24 h in serum-free medium. Fig. 1 shows the levels of latent and activated GL-A after culture of human palmar fibroblasts or WI-38 fibroblasts within three-dimensional collagen lattices. Regardless of the type of collagen lattice, pro-GL-A was secreted by the fibroblasts, and a portion of this enzyme was activated, as detected by the appearance of a 60-kDa band in the zymogram (Fig. 1, Act GL-A). The only major bands observed by zymography of the conditioned medium were the latent and activated forms of GL-A. The zymographic ratio of active to latent GL-A in conditioned media from mechanically relaxed collagen lattices were higher than from mechanically stressed collagen lattices (Fig. 1). Stress-relaxation of collagen lattices resulted in a reversal of the levels of latent and activated GL-A from those observed in the mechanically stressed collagen lattice. This reversal resulted in a ratio of activated to latent GL-A similar to that observed in mechanically relaxed floating collagen lattices (Fig. 1). Similar changes in levels of latent and activated GL-A in response to the mechanical properties of the collagen lattices were observed in adult human palmar fibroblasts, as well as in human fetal lung fibroblasts. In all the following experiments, both types of fibroblasts were examined. The organization of the actin cytoskeleton of fibroblasts cultured within the different three-dimensional collagen lattices was examined by staining with the F-actin probe BODIPY™ phallacidin. Palmar fibroblasts cultured for 5 days within mechanically relaxed collagen lattices had very few stress fibers. Instead, F-actin was found predominantly in the cortical regions of the cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, palmar fibroblasts cultured for 5 days within mechanically stressed collagen lattices had prominent stress fibers present throughout the cell (Fig. 2B). Release of the mechanically stressed collagen lattices resulted in a loss of stress fibers within the first 10 min after release (not shown). By 24 h after release, the actin became organized into a F-actin cortex similar to that observed in the mechanically relaxed collagen lattice (Fig. 2C). Similar changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton were observed in WI-38 fibroblasts cultured in the different collagen lattices (not shown). To test the possible role of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in GL-A activation, fibroblasts in mechanically stressed collagen lattices were treated with either cyto D or nocodazole. Both of these treatments radically changed the shape of the fibroblasts within mechanically stressed collagen lattices. Treatment of human palmar fibroblasts with nocodazole resulted in a shortening of the cell processes and rounding of the cell body (Fig. 3B), in contrast to cyto D, which left the cells dendritic and which resulted in a rapid and persistent alteration in the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 3A) (20Tomasek J.J. Hay E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cyto D caused the loss of stress fibers, and the actin filaments appeared to collapse into aggregates near the cell periphery. In contrast, nocodazole promoted the loss of microtubules (not shown), but with no loss of stress fibers (Fig. 3B). Alteration of the actin cytoskeleton with cyto D resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of activated GL-A compared with control mechanically stressed collagen lattices. The levels of latent and activated GL-A in cyto D-treated lattices were similar to those observed in mechanically relaxed or stress-relaxed collagen lattices (compare Figs. 4 and 1). In contrast, nocodazole treatment did not alter GL-A activation levels from control lattices. A similar activation of gelatinase A in response to cyto D treatment was observed in WI-38 fibroblasts cultured with mechanically stressed collagen lattices (not shown). Fibroblasts cultured as a monolayer on plastic also developed prominent stress fibers (not shown) and did not activate GL-A (Fig. 5). Treatment with cyto D resulted in a dramatic activation of GL-A, while treatment with nocodazole had no effect (Fig. 5). Thus, alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and not cell shape, promoted activation of GL-A by fibroblasts. Because the activation of GL-A has been linked to its enzymatic cleavage by MT-MMPs, we evaluated whether inhibiting the enzymatic activity of MMPs in the fibroblast culture would inhibit activation of GL-A. Fibroblasts were cultured within mechanically stressed collagen lattices or in monolayer, then treated for 18 h with cyto D, both in the presence and absence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001. In both culture conditions, GM6001 completely blocked cyto D-promoted activation of GL-A (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). To control for the possibility that GM6001 present in the culture medium remained bound to GL-A during electrophoresis and subsequently blocked its enzymatic activity in zymographs, conditioned medium from cyto D-treated fibroblasts cultured in monolayer was incubated overnight with GM6001 and subsequently analyzed by gelatin zymography. No obvious reduction in the activated GL-A band occurred after incubation of conditioned medium with GM6001 (not shown). Activated GL-A was not observed in medium conditioned by fibroblasts cultured in a monolayer, similar to other reports (5Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ailenberg M. Silverman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, activated GL-A was observed in medium conditioned by fibroblasts cultured within the different collagen lattices. Because the activation of GL-A observed in the conditioned medium from fibroblasts cultured within the collagen lattices could be the result of integrin-mediated signaling through cell binding to the surrounding collagen matrix (5Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seltzer J.L. Lee A.-Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we tested whether binding to, and spreading on, collagen was sufficient to promote activation of GL-A. WI-38 fibroblasts cultured on type I collagen-coated tissue culture plates formed large stress fibers (not shown), but did not activate GL-A (Fig. 6). A similar response was observed in human palmar fibroblasts (not shown). These results suggest that the mechanical properties of the collagen are important in the promotion of gelatinase A activation. Recent studies have suggested that a new family of MMPs, the MT-MMPs, are responsible for activation of GL-A (2Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar–4Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether steady state levels of MT-MMP-1 mRNA were increased in collagen lattices which promoted activation of GL-A. MT-MMP-1 mRNA in human palmar fibroblasts increased in mechanically relaxed and stress-relaxed collagen lattices compared with mechanically stressed collagen lattices (Fig. 7). For comparative purposes the ratio of MT-MMP-1 to GAPDH message was analyzed and was found to be 2.5-fold higher and 3.5-fold higher in “floating” and “released” collagen lattices, as compared to “stabilized” lattices, respectively. The results obtained with gelatin zymography, a semi-quantitative technique, suggested that total amounts of latent and activated GL-A had increased under conditions that promoted GL-A activation (Figs. 1, 4, and 5). Northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether steady state levels of GL-A mRNA had increased under conditions which promoted its activation. GL-A mRNA in human palmar fibroblasts increased in mechanically relaxed and stress-relaxed collagen lattices compared with mechanically stressed collagen lattices (Fig. 8). The GL-A:GAPDH ratio was increased 1.3-fold in mechanically relaxed and 1.5-fold in stress-relaxed collagen lattices compared with mechanically stressed collagen lattices. Similar changes in MT-MMP-1 mRNA and GL-A mRNA levels were observed in WI-38 fibroblasts (not shown). Next we evaluated whether the steady state levels of MT-MMP-1 and GL-A mRNA increased after cyto D treatment, conditions which disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. The MT-MMP-1:GAPDH mRNA ratio increased 6.2-fold in cyto D-treated human palmar fibroblasts cultured in monolayer compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 9). Similarly, The GL-A:GAPDH mRNA ratio increased 3.2-fold in cyto D-treated human palmar fibroblasts cultured in monolayer compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 9). Similar changes in MT-MMP-1 and GL-A mRNA levels were observed in WI-38 fibroblasts (not shown). Using three-dimensional collagen lattices that differ only in their mechanical properties, we examined the effects of mechanical forces on the cellular activation of GL-A, which is thought to occur through its interaction with MT-MMPs (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts in mechanically relaxed or stress-relaxed collagen lattices had high levels of GL-A activation and MT-MMP-1 mRNA levels compared to fibroblasts in mechanically stressed collagen lattices. Treatment of mechanically stressed fibroblasts with cyto D, which causes the disruption of stress fibers and which models mechanical relaxation, also resulted in increased levels of GL-A activation and MT-MMP-1 mRNA. GL-A activation could be blocked by the peptide hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor GM6001 (17Galardy R.E. Grobelny D. Foellmer H.G. Fernandez L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4715-4718PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the proposal that GL-A activation is MMP-mediated. In addition, levels of GL-A mRNA increased in mechanically relaxed compared to mechanically stressed collagen lattices. These results suggest that as cells lose mechanical stress they regulate GL-A activation by increasing the expression of MT-MMP-1, as well as increasing the expression of GL-A. While it has been proposed that the three-dimensional organization of the collagen matrix, as well as cell binding to collagen, regulates GL-A activation (5Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 9Seltzer J.L. Lee A.-Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we found that mechanical stress, and not matrix organization, may regulate this activation. Mechanically stressed collagen lattices, when compared with mechanically relaxed lattices, showed a marked reduction in GL-A activation and MT-MMP-1 expression, even though fibroblasts were surrounded by a three-dimensional collagen matrix in both cases. Fibroblasts cultured on a thin layer of collagen or in a monolayer activate little or no GL-A. All cells in such cultures contain stress fibers. That virtually no activation of GL-A occurs on a thin layer of collagen suggests that more than just binding of collagen is required for GL-A activation. Fibroblasts in mechanically stressed collagen lattices always activate some GL-A, which may be accounted for by the presence of some cells which lack stress fibers (13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This suggests that it is not just the three-dimensional organization of the collagen lattice, but rather the mechanical forces present in the lattice, that regulate cellular activation of GL-A, presumably by regulating the expression of MT-MMP-1. The changes in activity and expression of GL-A and MT-MMP-1 observed in collagen lattices, while significant, are not as dramatic as those observed after treatment with cyto D. Fibroblasts in floating and released collagen lattices are heterologous with respect to the amount of mechanical stress they experience. For example, some of the fibroblasts at the periphery of floating or stress-relaxed collagen lattices contain stress fibers (14Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and would be expected to express less GL-A and MT-MMP-1 than cells in the center of the lattice. Treatment of cultures with cyto D models loss of mechanical stress and involves the entire cell population. Not surprisingly, cyto D treatment yields larger changes in GL-A and MT-MMP-1 levels (Fig. 9). Thus, while cyto D is not as relevant physiologically as are collagen lattices, it does provide an experimental model that may be useful for studying the role of the actin cytoskeleton in gene regulation. The mechanical forces in the ECM may transduce intracellular signals through integrin-mediated focal adhesion complexes (21Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). It is well known that integrins induce formation of a specialized focal adhesion complex at the site of cell-ECM binding due to specific binding interactions between integrins, actin-associated molecules, and actin (22Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). The assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes leads to the activation of signal transduction mediators such as pp125 focal adhesion kinase (23Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts in mechanically stressed collagen lattices form fibronexus-type focal adhesion complexes at their surfaces; in contrast, fibroblasts in mechanically relaxed or stress-relaxed collagen lattices lack these cell surface complexes (13Tomasek J.J. Haaksma C.J. Eddy R.J. Vaughan M.B. Anat. Rec. 1992; 232: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism remains to be elucidated, such matrix-mediated signaling could lead to regulation of MT-MMP-1 and GL-A expression observed in this study. In this study we have demonstrated that the lack or loss of stress fibers in response to altered mechanical forces in collagen lattices or to cyto D treatment is associated with increased activation of GL-A. Recently, cyto D treatment of rat mesangial cells cultured on a planar substratum was shown to increase GL-A activation and MT-MMP-1 mRNA (8Ailenberg M. Silverman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results suggest that signals generated by mechanical stress in the ECM are transduced by the actin cytoskeleton and play an important role in regulating GL-A activation. Interstitial collagenase levels have also been demonstrated to be regulated by the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (24Unemori E.N. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Reorganization of the polymerized actin cytoskeleton, either by release of collagen lattices or by cytochalasin B treatment, promoted increased levels of secreted interstitial collagenase in rabbit synovial fibroblasts. These increased levels of collagenase were not due to cell shape changes, since treatment with colchicine, which disrupted the microtubule organization and changed the cell shape but not the actin cytoskeleton, had no effect on collagenase levels (24Unemori E.N. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that disruption of microtubules and changes in cell shape by treatment with nocodazole had no effect on GL-A activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that both urokinase and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, are induced by cyto D promoted cytoskeletal reorganization (25Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar–27Higgins P.J. Staiano-Coico L. Ryan M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that urokinase induction follows the activation of c-Jun, which then participates in transcriptional activation through interactions with the AP-1 site within the urokinase promoter (25Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MT-MMP-1, which is induced by phorbol esters, may have an AP-1 site within its promoter, although no sequence data have been published (6Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Similarly, the collagenase gene has an AP-1 site within its promoter (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1994; 4: 197-250Crossref Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). These MMPs could be regulated by similar transcription factors responsive to mechanical stress and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The GL-A promoter has no AP-1 site within the published 1.6-kilobase sequence and is not responsive to phorbol esters or most cytokines or growth factors (28Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Frisch S.M. Morisaki J.H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Indeed, GL-A appears to be constitutively expressed in most tissues, and its promoter is TATA-less, similar to many so-called “housekeeping” genes. Thus, the mechanism by which mechanical stress and actin organization regulates transcription of GL-A may be different from that proposed for MT-MMP-1. Mechanical forces may play an important role in regulating the expression and assembly of ECM macromolecules (15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Mechanical stress will promote the assembly of fibronectin into fibrils at the cell surface (14Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), as well as an increase in the expression of type I collagen (31Lambert C.A. Soudant E.P. Nusgens B.V. Lapiere C.M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 444-451PubMed Google Scholar). These results have led to the proposal that mechanical stress induces a matrix-depositing fibroblast phenotype (15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrating that mechanical stress results in decreased activation of GL-A are consistent with this proposal. Interstitial collagenase, as well as plasminogen activators, may be similarly regulated by mechanical stress (25Lee J.S. von der Ahe D. Kiefer B. Nagamine Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Higgins P.J. Ryan M.P. Providence K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Higgins P.J. Staiano-Coico L. Ryan M.P. Biochem.

These results suggest that, opposite to the matrix-depositing phenotype promoted by mechanical stress, a mechanically relaxed environment may promote a “proteolytic” phenotype favoring matrix turnover. Thus, the mechanical forces described here in the in vitro collagen lattice models may also play an important role in vivo during wound healing and pathological contractures. Fibroblasts in granulation tissue exert tension on the ECM, develop stress, and contract the matrix, thereby bringing the wound margins closer together (15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 32Gabbiani G. Hirschel B.J. Ryan G.B. Statkov P.R. Majno G. J. Exp.

Once the wound defect is closed by a combination of contraction and new matrix synthesis, the fibroblast population regresses and ECM remodeling begins. Our studies suggest that, while the wound is under tension and depositing a new ECM, little MMP activity would be present. Once the new matrix replaces the wound and the tissue becomes mechanically relaxed, MMP expression and activation would occur, promoting ECM remodeling. Consistent with this proposal is the observation that increased skin tension contributes to increased scarring after surgery (34Burgess L.P.A. Morin G.V. Rand M. Vossoughi J. Hollinger J.O. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1990; 116: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as well as the presence of the contractile myofibroblast in many fibrotic conditions (15Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar).

CD59 is a cell surface glycoprotein that binds to the complement proteins C8 and/or C9 in the nascent membrane attack complex, thereby protecting host cells from lysis (1Walsh L.A. Tone M. Thiru S. Waldman H. Tissue Antigens. 1992; 40: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CD59 belongs to the Ly-6 superfamily (2Williams A.F. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is present on a wide variety of cell types, including leukocytes, platelets, epithelial and endothelial cells, placental cells, and erythrocytes, where it is present at 2.5-5 × 104 copies/cell (3Brooimans R.A. van der Ark A.A.J.

In addition to its role in protecting host tissues from homologous complement, it has been proposed that CD59 mediates T cell adhesive interactions by synergizing with CD58 via direct interactions with CD2 (4Deckert M.

This sequence is typical of signal peptides for GPI anchored proteins (9Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar).

There is one fully occupied N-glycosylation site (Asn18-Cys-Ser) (8Davies A. Simmons D.L. Hale G. Harrison R.A. Tighe H. Lachmann P.J. Waldman H. J. Exp.

Removal or modification of the N-glycans has been shown to reduce the co-stimulation of proliferation by CD59 and to eliminate its complement inhibitory properties (12Menu E. Tsai B. Bothwell A.

A recent mutational analysis 2D. L. Bodian, S. J. Davis, N. K. Rushmere, and B. P. Morgan, in press (Feb. issue) J. Exp. Med. has shown that the active site is centered on Trp40 of the exposed glycosylated face of CD59 and that this is equivalent to the “concave” face used by neurotoxins to bind to target nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and acetylcholinesterases. GPI membrane anchors are used by a wide variety of cell surface glycoproteins (reviewed in 1Walsh L.A. Tone M. Thiru S. Waldman H. Tissue Antigens. 1992; 40: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Low M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 427-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar–22McConville M.J.

Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In some cases, the inositol is substituted with a fatty acid (palmitate), rendering the structure resistant to the action of bacterial PI-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) (23Roberts W.L. Santikarn S.

The core glycan can be substituted with other sugars, and all GPI anchors from metazoan sources contain one or two additional ethanolamine phosphate groups attached to the conserved trimannosyl backbone (22McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In this study, the glycan component of the GPI anchor of human erythrocyte CD59 was characterized, enabling its structure to be compared with that of the glycan anchor attached to another human erythrocyte GPI-anchored glycoprotein, acetylcholinesterase (25Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18775-18784Google Scholar, 26Deeg M.A. Humphrey D.R. Yang S.H. Ferguson T.R. Reinhold V.N. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol.

Further, the N- and O-linked glycans covalently attached to human erythrocyte CD59 were characterized, and the full HPLC glycosylation profile compared with that of human platelet CD59 to explore the extent of cell-specific glycosylation. Molecular modeling, based on the solution structure of the protein (18Fletcher C.M. Harrison R.A. Lachman P.J. Neuhaus D. Curr. Biol. Structure. 1994; 2: 185-199Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was used to explore the spatial relationships between the lipid bilayer, the protein, and the N-and O-linked glycans. Several possible roles for the heterogeneous array of glycans attached to CD59 were proposed, including orientation of the active site, protection from protease cleavage, and limiting interactions with other CD59 molecules and with the cell surface. This work provides the most complete view of any cell surface glycoprotein studied to date. CD59 was purified from human erythrocytes and platelets by immunoaffinity chromatography of butanol-extracted erythrocyte membranes essentially as described previously (27Meri S. Morgan B.P. Davies R.H. Daniels M.G. Olavesen H. Waldman H. Lachman P.J. Immunology. 1990; 71: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morgan B.P. Biochem J. 1992; 282: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was confirmed by analysis on SDS-PAGE (15% gels) and by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce protein assay reagent. CD59 (200 μg) was dissolved in 10 μl of pH 4.0 buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate adjusted to pH 4 with acetic acid). A freshly prepared solution of NaNO2 (10 μl, 0.5 M) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature after which boric acid (5 μl, 0.8 M) was added. The amount of NaOH required to adjust the pH to about 10.5 (determined using buffer controls and typically 8-10 μl) was added to the reaction mixture. NaB3H4 (5 μl, 10-15 Ci/mmol, 36 mM in 0.1 M NaOH) was added immediately, followed 2 h later by freshly prepared NaBH4 (1 M aqueous) to give a final concentration of 0.2 M NaBD4. After a further 2 h, the reduction mixture was acidified with acetic acid (1 M). The reaction was carried out in the fume hood as tritium gas was evolved. The sample was dialyzed against water using a Spectra/Por membrane (Orme Scientific) with a 2,000 Da cut off and was freeze dried. Deaminated and reduced CD59 (40 μg), prepared as described above, was placed in a screw top Eppendorf tube and incubated with 50 μl of 48% aqueous HF at 0°C for 48 h. The aqueous HF was neutralized with saturated LiOH and the products re-N-acetylated (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach.IRL Press. 1993; : 349-383Google Scholar). The system was fitted with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 column. A calibration standard of mixed glucose oligomers was co-injected with the sample and detected by pulsed amperometric detection. The elution positions of the neutral glycans were defined in Dionex units (Du) by linear interpolation of their elution positions between two adjacent internal standards. These Du have no specific meaning but are a reliable chromatographic property that correlate with particular glycan structures. The radiolabeled glycans were detected on line by a Raytest Romana radioactive monitor and by scintillation counting of collected fractions. Filtration was performed using the Oxford GlycoSystems GlycoMap™ Instrument, which is based on a BioGel P4 gel permeation chromatography system (GPC). Aspergillus phoenicus (Saitoi) α1-2mannosidase digestions were performed in 10 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 0.01 milliunit (0.04 mg) of Aspergillus phoenicus (Saitoi) α1-2mannosidase (X-5009, Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd.) for 16-24 h at 37°C under a toluene atmosphere. The products were desalted by passage through 0.2 ml of Dowex AG50X12 (H+) and eluted with water (1 ml). The samples were evaporated to dryness, and any residual acetic acid was removed by co-evaporation with toluene. Jack bean α-mannosidase digestions were performed in 30 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5, containing 25 units/μl of Jack bean α-mannosidase (Boehringer Mannheim) under the same conditions. A sample of CD59 (200 μg) in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.02% sodium azide was extracted four times with an equal volume of butan-1-ol saturated with water to remove the CHAPS detergent and any non-covalently associated lipids. The aqueous phase was freeze dried and redissolved in 100 μl of 0.3 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0). The sample was deaminated by addition of 100 μl of freshly prepared 0.5 M NaNO2, sonication for 15 min, and incubation for 3 h at 37°C. The PI fraction, released by the deamination procedure, was recovered by two extractions with 200 μl and one extraction with 100 μl of butan-1-ol saturated with water. The combined butan-1-ol phases were washed with 300 μl of water, dried under a stream of N2 and redissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:3) containing 1 mM NH3. Aliquots (20 μl) were introduced into the electrospray source of a Micromass (Altringham, Cheshire, UK) mass spectrometer in a stream of the same solvent at 10 μl/min. Negative ion mass spectra were recorded over the mass range m/z 700-1500 and processed using MassLynx software. The source conditions were optimized using soybean PI from Sigma. For tandem mass spectrometry, mass resolution in mass spectrometer 1 was reduced to allow the simultaneous transmission of m/z 1135 and m/z 1137 into a hexapole collision cell containing argon (2.5 × 10−3 Torr) under an accelerating voltage of 60 V. Daughter ions were collected over the mass range m/z 200-450. A sample of CD59 (50 μg) was analyzed for monosaccharide content by GC-MS following methanolysis, re-N-acetylation, and trimethylsilylation (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach.IRL Press. 1993; : 349-383Google Scholar). 0.6 μg (31.6 nmol) of CD59 was dialyzed against 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. Glycans were released from CD59 by hydrazine at 95°C and re-N-acetylated using a GlycoPrep 1000 (Oxford GlycoSystems, Ltd.) optimized for maximum recovery (approximately 85%) of both N- and O-linked sugars. The recovery was assessed by desialylating and degalactosylating bi-antennary complex sugars and then incubating with UDP-[3H]Gal and galactosyl transferase. The free glycans associated with the anchor were also released under these conditions. However, since these glycans terminate in inositol, they cannot be reduced or 2-aminobenzamide-labeled and are therefore not detected in the oligosaccharide analyses. 2AB labeling was carried out using the Oxford GlycoSystems Signal labeling kit (30Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). WAX was performed on a GlycoSep-C column (Oxford GlycoSystems, Ltd.) (7 × 50 mm) attached to a Waters HPLC system as described previously (31Guile G.R. Wong S.Y.C. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Separations were performed on a GlycoSep-N HPLC column (Oxford GlycoSystems, Ltd.) (4.6 × 250 mm) as described previously (32Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Enzyme digests were performed at 37°C for 16-24 h in 100 mM citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.2 mM zinc acetate and 0.15 M sodium chloride. Conditions for the individual enzymes in the arrays were as follows: Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (Oxford GlycoSystems), 1-2 units/ml; almond meal (AM) fucosidase (Oxford GlycoSystems), 3 milliunits/ml; Charonia lampas α-fucosidase 9 miliunits/ml (Oxford Glycobiology Institute); bovine testes β-galactosidase (Oxford GlycoSystems), 1-2 units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Oxford Glycobiology Institute), 2 units/ml. Bacteroides fragilis endo-β-galactosidase (EBG) (Oxford GlycoSystems), 0.5 units/ml in 50 mM sodium actetate buffer, pH 5.8. No exogalactosidase activity was detected in this enzyme preparation (data not shown). MALDI data were acquired on a Micromass (Altringham, Cheshire, UK) AutoSpec-FPDQ magnetic sector instrument fitted with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm) and an array detector (33Bordoli R.S. Howes K. Vickers R.G. Bateman R.H. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 585-589Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared by adding the oligosaccharide sample (1 μl) in water to the matrix solution (3 μl of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile) on the mass spectrometer target and allowing it to dry at room temperature. The mixture was then recrystallized from 1 μl of ethanol (34Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The array detector was set to the high resolution position, and the mass range was set to be appropriate to the sample being examined. For data acquisition, the laser was operated at full power, and the laser beam was moved manually over the sample in order to compensate for sample depletion under the laser beam. Purified CD59 (10 μg) was run under reducing conditions on a 15% Tris/glycine gel-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and blotted onto Problott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). The blot was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the CD59 band was excised, and the protein was reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. For enzymatic digestion 60 μg of CD59 was precipitated with ice-cold acetone, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and boiled for 5 min. 10 mM iodoacetamide and 3 μg of endoproteinase Lys C (Promega, Southampton, UK) were added. Digestion was carried out for 16 h at 37°C. Fragments were separated under reducing conditions on a 15% Tris/Tricine gel (36Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) and blotted onto Problott™ membrane. The blot was stained with Amido black, and bands were excised. N-terminal sequence analysis of the excised bands was performed using an Applied Biosystems 476A protein sequencer and 610A data analysis software. CD59 was incubated for 16 h at 37°C with Flavobacterium meningoseptum peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (analytical grade) 7.5 units/100 μl in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM EDTA and 0.02% azide buffer to deglycosylate the protein. Molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics 4D/35 workstation using the program Insight II and Discover (Biosym Tech. Inc.). Coordinates for the CD59 solution structure were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory (37Bernstein F. Kaetzle T. Williams G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 122: 535-542Crossref Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). CD59 was purified from butanol-extracted erythrocyte membranes by affinity chromatography and gel-filtration as described previously (27Meri S. Morgan B.P. Davies R.H. Daniels M.G. Olavesen H. Waldman H. Lachman P.J. Immunology. 1990; 71: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 28Morgan B.P. Biochem J. 1992; 282: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On SDS-PAGE, the purified protein migrated as a broad band in the apparent molecular mass range 20-25 kDa. No other bands were detected even on overloaded gels. N-terminal sequencing indicated that no N-terminal residues other than that of CD59 (leucine) were detectable (data not shown). Together these data indicate that the preparation was at least 95% pure. The strategy for the subsequent analysis of the GPI anchor and the N- and O-glycans attached to CD59 is outlined in Fig. 1A, and the results of the study are correspondingly organized into sections A-H below. Fig. 1B shows a sialylated bi-antennary complex glycan with lactosamine extensions and some of the cleavage positions of the enzymes used in this study. The monosaccharide composition of the total CD59 oligosaccharides, following methanolysis, re-N-acetylation, and trimethylsilylation, was determined by GC-MS (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach.IRL Press. 1993; : 349-383Google Scholar) (Table I). A number of conclusions were drawn. First, the detection of 2.3 nmol of GalNAc/nmol of CD59 suggested the presence of O-linked glycans. Second, the high proportion of N-acetyl glucosamine (10.4 nmol) and galactose (9.5 nmol) compared with mannose (1.6 nmol) suggested that CD59 was associated with a high percentage of multi-antennary- and polylactosamine-type oligosaccharides. Third, the proportion of fucose (2.5 nmol) suggested that many structures contained outer arm as well as core fucose. Finally, the detection of 3 nmol of sialic acid residues indicated that many of the glycans were charged.Table IGC-MS monosaccharide composition analysis of the glycans associated with CD59Monosaccharide residuenmol/nmol of CD59N-acetyl galactosamine2.3N-acetyl glucosamine10.4Mannose1.6Galactose9.5Fucose2.5Sialic acid3 Open table in a new tab Intact CD59 was subjected to nitrous acid deamination which converted the non-N-acetylated GlcN residue, unique to the GPI anchor, to 2,5-anhydromannose and simultaneously released the PI moiety. Subsequent reduction with NaB3H4 converted the 2,5-anhydromannose to [1-3H]2,5-anhydromannitol (AHM), and the radiolabeled GPI glycan was released from the protein and ethanolamine substituents by dephosphorylation with cold 48% aqueous HF. The resulting GPI neutral fraction was fractionated by Dionex high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) into three species that eluted at 2.51 (91%), 3.07 (8%), and 3.72 (1%) Dionex units (Du) (Fig. 2). The major species eluted at 4.2 P4 glucose units (gu) on Bio-Gel P4 and the 3.07-Du species eluted at 5.6 gu. These Du and gu values are identical to those of authentic standards of Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4AHM and Manα1-2Manα1-6(GalNAcβ1,4)Manα1-4AHM, respectively (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach.IRL Press. 1993; : 349-383Google Scholar). The major 2.51 Du/4.2 gu species was subjected to A saitoi Manα1-2Man-specific α-mannosidase and produced a labeled glycan that eluted at 3.2 P4 gu on Bio-Gel P4, consistent with a structure Manα1-6Manα1-4AHM (29Ferguson M.A.J. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach.IRL Press. 1993; : 349-383Google Scholar). This material was further digested by Jack Bean α-mannosidase to a labeled component that eluted at 1.7 gu, consistent with free AHM. Taken together with the chromatographic data, these results confirm that the major GPI neutral glycan species is Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4AHM, derived from Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-GlcN by deamination and reduction. The assignment of the minor 3.07 Du/5.6 P4 gu species as Manα1-2Manα1-6(GalNAcβ1,4)Manα1-4AHM (derived from Manα1-2Manα1-6(GalNAcβ1,4)Manα1-GlcN) is based solely on the chromatographic data since insufficient material was available for exoglycosidase digestions. However, to date no GPI neutral glycans have been found to co-chromatograph on both Dionex HPAEC and BioGel P4. The very minor 3.72 Du species was not characterized, but this Du value would be consistent with the structure Manα1-2Manα1-2Manα1-6(GalNAcβ1,4)Manα1-4AHM. The PI moiety released by nitrous acid deamination of CD59 was recovered by extraction into butan-1-ol and analyzed by negative ion ES-MS. Pseudomolecular [M-H]− ions were observed at m/z 1135 and m/z 1137 (Fig. 3a). Simultaneous collision induced dissociation of the two ions resulted in a daughter ion spectrum (Fig. 3b) that showed the presence of ions at m/z 331 (consistent with a C22:4 fatty acid carboxylate ion) and at m/z 403 and m/z 405. The latter fragment ions are characteristic of alkyl-PI species which produce intense [alkyl-O-CH2-CHCH-HPO4]− fragments (38Serrano A.A. Schenkman S. Yoshida N. Mehlert A. Richardson J.M. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27244-27253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The m/z values of 403 and 405 suggest that the alkyl chains are C18:1 and C18:0, respectively. The m/z values of the parent ions are consistent with 1-O-(C18:1)alkyl-2-O-(C22:4)acyl-PI and 1-O-(C18:0)alkyl-2-O-(22:4)acyl-PI species that are further substituted with hydroxyester-linked palmitic acid (C16:0). The absence of a detectable palmitate carboxylate ion (m/uz 255) and of an [inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate]− ion (m/z 241) in the daughter ion spectrum is consistent with the attachment of the palmitoyl group to the 2-position of the inositol ring (24Treumann A.

https://openalex.org/W2054528125,"Abstract Holliday junctions in DNA are generated as a product of homologous recombination events. To test the hypothesis that human p53 may bind to Holliday junctions, synthetic junctions with four ∼75-base pair (Hol75) or ∼565-base pair (Hol565) arms were generated. As seen by electron microscopy, under conditions in which 50-61% of the Hol565 DNAs were bound by p53, 80-96% of the p53 was located specifically at the junction with, in the latter case, only 4% of the p53 visualized at the DNA ends or along the arms. Given the large number of potential binding sites, this represents very high specificity for the junctions. Gel retardation assays using the Hol75 DNA confirm these observations, and indicate that the tight junction complexes have a half-life of greater than 4 h. The binding of p53 to three-way junctions is severalfold less than to four-way junctions. Addition of p53 greatly increases the rate of resolution of the Hol75 DNA by T4 endonuclease VII and T7 endonuclease I, two enzymes known to cleave such junctions. This latter finding further confirms the interaction of p53 with Holliday junctions and suggests that p53 binding facilitates their resolution in vivo"

To determine whether these disparate effects are mediated by substrates of individual PKC isoenzymes, PKCα and PKCδ were overexpressed in rat microvascular EC. Basal and stimulated migration were enhanced in PKCα EC compared with either PKCδ or control EC. Serum-induced growth of PKCδ EC was decreased, while that of PKCα cells was similar to control EC. Phorbol ester markedly inhibited PKCδ EC growth but enhanced growth of PKCα and control EC. To determine possible causes for this altered proliferation, the effect of PKCδ on adhesion, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and cell cycle progression was measured. Adherence of PKCδ EC to vitronectin was significantly enhanced. Serum-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 activity was increased equally in both PKCα and PKCδ EC above that of control, while extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 activity was similar in all EC. Cell cycle analysis suggested that PKCδ EC entered S phase inappropriately and were delayed in passage through S phase.

Several external agents that promote or inhibit proliferation and migration have been identified (3Camussi G. Montrucchio G. Lupia E. De Martino A. Perona L. Arese M. Vercellone A. Toniolo A.

In addition, chemical inhibitors of PKC or the down-regulation of PKC by prolonged treatment with phorbol esters abrogates the proliferative effects induced by growth factors and mitogens (10Presta M.

In contrast, treatment of endothelial cells with direct activators of PKC alters some responses that are usually associated with stimulation by physiologic agonists (15Murphy H.S. Maroughi M. Till G.O. Ward P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L145-L151PubMed Google Scholar) and, under some conditions, can prevent growth factor-induced proliferation (16Ahmed A. Plevin R. Shoaibi M.A. Fountain S.A. Ferriani R.A. Smith S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C206-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent paradox might be explained by the fact that the PKC family is composed of related but structurally distinct isoenzymes, each a product of separate genes and with discrete cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, and tissue distribution (16Ahmed A. Plevin R. Shoaibi M.A. Fountain S.A. Ferriani R.A. Smith S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C206-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Since phorbol esters activate multiple isoenzymes of PKC, the possibility is raised that each PKC isoenzyme may selectively mediate separate, and perhaps opposing, effects within stimulated endothelial cells.Preliminary studies in our laboratory revealed that rat capillary endothelial cells expressed several isoenzymes of PKC, including PKCα, -δ, -η, -θ, and -ζ. Of these isoenzymes, previous investigations have found that overexpression of PKCα or PKCδ in various cultured cells could affect their proliferation (19Eldar H. Zisman Y. Ullrich A. Livneh E. J.

Thus, the possibility exists that activation of either of these isoenzymes mediates the inhibitory component of PKC activation on endothelial growth, while the other promotes one or more processes essential to endothelial repair and angiogenesis. Such an effect would be presumably mediated by isoenzyme-specific substrates, of which a few have been identified (e.g. elongation factor eEF-1α (26Kielbassa K. Muller H.-J. Meyer H.E. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). In the present study, we began by testing the effect of overexpression of PKCα and PKCδ on endothelial migration and proliferation, both of which are essential processes for angiogenesis and wound healing. When initial experiments revealed an inhibitory effect of PKCδ on endothelial proliferation, we then examined potential underlying causes.DISCUSSIONThe two major findings of this study are that overexpression of two different PKC isoenzymes normally expressed in microvascular endothelial cells exert distinct effects on endothelial proliferation, migration, and adhesion to extracellular matrix and that PKCδ-mediated inhibition of endothelial growth results from a defect in S phase of the endothelial cell cycle. The observation that overexpression of PKCδ, but not PKCα, prevents proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells, while PKCα enhances their migration in response to HGF (scatter factor), suggests that these isoenzymes phosphorylate different substrates in these cells with different physiologic effects. The disparity between the effects of overexpression of the two isoenzymes is heightened by PKC-activating phorbol esters in that treatment of PKCα EC exerts a mitogenic effect similar to that in control cells, while PKCδ EC were even more strongly inhibited by similar treatment. Thus, these data suggest that activation of each of these isoenzymes by angiogenic stimuli, such as HGF or those contained in serum, may mediate distinct aspects of several processes that are required for vascular repair and angiogenesis. Stimulation of endothelium with phorbol esters, which activate both PKCα and PKCδ, as well as several other isoenzymes expressed in endothelium (5Kent K.C. Mii S. Harrington E.O. Chang J.D.

The results from this study suggest that PKCδ might mediate those aspects of PKC activation that are inhibitory for endothelial repair and angiogenesis, while an important component of the proangiogenic effect, endothelial migration, might be mediated by PKCα.Repair of small defects in endothelium are accomplished largely by endothelial migration, rather than proliferation (3Camussi G.

Castronovo V. Liotta L.A. Madri J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Migration is an important component of angiogenesis as well (3Camussi G. Montrucchio G. Lupia E. De Martino A. Perona L. Arese M. Vercellone A. Toniolo A. Bussolino F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6492-6501PubMed Google Scholar). The present study's finding that endothelial migration is enhanced in PKCα EC might result from enhancement of cytoskeletal reorganization in response to stimuli, which is a necessary component of cell locomotion; overall PKC stimulation has been associated with promotion of cytoskeletal reorganization of endothelial cells (3Camussi G.

Prostaglandins. 1993; 45: 249-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PKCα, but not PKCδ, may be at least one mediator of migration response to HGF (scatter factor), a powerful angiogenic agent that is present along with its receptor in a substantial amount in the vasculature (4Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Goldberg I.D. Bhargava M.M. Nickoloff B.J. Kinsella J.L. Polverini P. Rosen E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1995; 215: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).We considered several possible explanations for the PKCδ-mediated inhibition of endothelial growth, including a reduction in endothelial adhesion to matrix, a failure to activate downstream mediators such as ERK-1 or ERK-2, and a defect in progression of endothelial cells through the cell cycle. Of these explanations, only the latter appears to be the case. Regarding adhesion, both endothelial cell growth and migration are thought to require attachment of the cell to matrix via its integrin surface receptors (42Basson C.T. Knowles W.J. Bell L.

Res. 1995; 77: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Blocking the vitronectin integrin receptors αvβ3 or αvβ5 inhibits neovascularization in the cornea or chick chorioallantoic membrane models (35Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of these two integrins for endothelial cell proliferation. In this study, microvascular endothelial cells in which PKCδ was overexpressed demonstrated markedly enhanced adhesion to vitronectin or fibrinogen matrices, and thus a decrease in integrin mediated adhesion was not the cause of the decrease in proliferation of PKCδ EC. This enhancement of adhesion could result from either a PKC-mediated alteration of the number of these receptors or an increase in avidity by either a direct effect on integrin conformation (so-called “inside-out” signaling) (48Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or as an amplification step following cell adhesion (“outside-in”) that prevents detachment (48Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overall PKC activation has been linked with promotion of integrin avidity for soluble fibrinogen and solid matrices in several cell types (49Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Saitoh M. Salzman E.W. Smith M. Ware J.A. Blood. 1989; 74: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither PKCα EC nor PKCδ EC demonstrated increased expression of these receptors when compared with control; thus, a PKCδ-mediated effect on affinity of these integrins for vitronectin is a likely explanation for our results.A cascade of signaling events merging at the MAP kinase family of proteins, ERK-1 and ERK-2, is involved in many of the intracellular signaling pathways that lead to endothelial cell growth, migration, and adhesion (51Sa G. Murugesan G. Jaye M. Ivashchenko Y. Fox P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2360-2366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activation of overall PKC leads to activation of MAP kinase; PKCα, at least, has been shown to phosphorylate Raf kinase (40Sozeri O. Vollmer K. Liyanage M. Frith D. Kour G. Mark G.E. d. Stabel S. Mark G.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar), an upstream mediator of MAP kinase (36Marquardt B. Frith D. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3213-3218PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, both PKCα and PKCδ enhance ERK-1 and ERK-2 kinase activity with a resultant prolongation of ERK-2 activity in stably transfected endothelial cells. The pathway by which PKCδ blocks proliferation and cell cycle progression, however, must be distal or parallel to that leading to ERK-2 or ERK-1. In addition, our results suggest that effective activation of ERK-2 activity by PKCδ is not sufficient for endothelial cell proliferation. This finding bolsters those of Hirai et al. (25Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), who found that PKCδ inhibited growth of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells despite activating AP-1, a component of the signaling pathway downstream from MAP kinase.Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by PKCδ appears to result from a specific defect in endothelial cell cycle progression, in which the cells enter S phase inappropriately and require additional time to complete this phase. Because of the distal nature of this defect and the intranuclear location of PKCδ, it seems likely that the isoenzyme interacts directly with one of the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase/inhibitor complexes that regulates entry and completion of S phase. Inappropriate S phase entry has been associated with apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells treated with basic fibroblast growth factor antisense oligonucleotides (52Fox J.C. Shanley J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12578-12584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but such apoptosis was not found in PKCδ EC. 2E. O. Harrington and J. A. Ware, unpublished observations. Manipulation of PKC activity has not been previously associated with this S phase defect and only rarely with any abnormality of cell cycle function. Overexpression of PKCδ, but not PKCα or PKCζ, in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts causes an arrest in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but only after activation with PMA (21Watanabe T. Ono Y. Taniyama Y. Hazama K. Igarashi K. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10159-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar); no defects were seen in S phase. In that study, inhibition of cell cycle progression by PKCδ was attributed to an isoenzyme-specific effect; since the PKC enzymatic activity was much higher in the PKCδ-transfected cells than in the other transfectants, however, it is possible that the observed effect merely reflected an increase in overall enzyme activity. In this study, however, the similarities of enzymatic activity make it likely that the defect in cell cycle progression, as well as differences in adhesion and migration, resulted from interaction of PKCδ with isoenzyme-specific substrates. Thus, in addition to its isoenzyme-specific character, this arrest in S phase appears to be somewhat specific for endothelial cells.Specific effects of individual PKC isoenzymes on proliferation are known to vary according to cell types. For example, overexpression of PKCα in murine fibroblast cells inhibits proliferation and does not lead to cell transformation (53Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Weinstein I.B. Imber R. Nature. 1991; 353: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 54Borner C. Ueffing M. Jaken S. Parker P.J. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 78-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but in NIH 3T3 and human breast cancer cell lines, increases in PKCα expression altered the cell morphology, enhanced proliferation, and increased tumorigenicity (23Persons D.A. Wilkison W.O. Bell R.M. Finn O.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 55Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Hug H. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the tissue-specific effects of individual PKC isoenzymes are likely to be mediated by substrates or effectors with restricted tissue or subcellular expression. Even within an individual cell type, the substrates with which each isoenzyme interacts differ. A full understanding of the mechanism by which these two individual PKC isoenzymes mediate either enhanced adhesion or migration or decrease proliferation of endothelial cells will require identification of their selective downstream targets. Such identification, together with the assignment of selective endothelial functions to individual PKC isoenzymes provided by this study, would provide essential details critical to our understanding of reendothelialization and angiogenesis. INTRODUCTIONThe formation of new blood vessels and the repair of those damaged by disease or injury depend upon endothelial migration and proliferation (1Yang E.Y. Moses H.L. J.

Several external agents that promote or inhibit proliferation and migration have been identified (3Camussi G. Montrucchio G. Lupia E. De Martino A. Perona L. Arese M. Vercellone A. Toniolo A. Bussolino F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6492-6501PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Goldberg I.D. Bhargava M.M. Nickoloff B.J. Kinsella J.L. Polverini P. Rosen E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, chemical inhibitors of PKC or the down-regulation of PKC by prolonged treatment with phorbol esters abrogates the proliferative effects induced by growth factors and mitogens (10Presta M. Tiberio L. Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Ragnotti G. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Daviet I. Herbert J.M. Maffrand J.P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and also enhances endothelial permeability (12Lynch J.J. Ferro T.J. Blumenstock F.A. Brockenauer A.M. Malik A.B. J. Clin.

Ahuja M. Klugherz B.D. Ivanics K.M. Hoxie J.A. Williams W.V. Liang B.T. Cines D.B. et al.Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of endothelial cells with direct activators of PKC alters some responses that are usually associated with stimulation by physiologic agonists (15Murphy H.S. Maroughi M. Till G.O. Ward P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L145-L151PubMed Google Scholar) and, under some conditions, can prevent growth factor-induced proliferation (16Ahmed A. Plevin R. Shoaibi M.A. Fountain S.A. Ferriani R.A. Smith S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C206-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent paradox might be explained by the fact that the PKC family is composed of related but structurally distinct isoenzymes, each a product of separate genes and with discrete cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, and tissue distribution (16Ahmed A. Plevin R. Shoaibi M.A. Fountain S.A. Ferriani R.A. Smith S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C206-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Since phorbol esters activate multiple isoenzymes of PKC, the possibility is raised that each PKC isoenzyme may selectively mediate separate, and perhaps opposing, effects within stimulated endothelial cells.Preliminary studies in our laboratory revealed that rat capillary endothelial cells expressed several isoenzymes of PKC, including PKCα, -δ, -η, -θ, and -ζ. Of these isoenzymes, previous investigations have found that overexpression of PKCα or PKCδ in various cultured cells could affect their proliferation (19Eldar H. Zisman Y. Ullrich A. Livneh E. J.

Thus, the possibility exists that activation of either of these isoenzymes mediates the inhibitory component of PKC activation on endothelial growth, while the other promotes one or more processes essential to endothelial repair and angiogenesis. Such an effect would be presumably mediated by isoenzyme-specific substrates, of which a few have been identified (e.g. elongation factor eEF-1α (26Kielbassa K. Muller H.-J. Meyer H.E. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). In the present study, we began by testing the effect of overexpression of PKCα and PKCδ on endothelial migration and proliferation, both of which are essential processes for angiogenesis and wound healing. When initial experiments revealed an inhibitory effect of PKCδ on endothelial proliferation, we then examined potential underlying causes."

This procedure involves the formation of a complex between DNA and a polycation (such as poly-L-lysine), which bears a covalently linked ligand moiety specific for a given receptor on the surface of cells in the target tissue. The gene is internalized by the tissue, transported to the nucleus, and expressed in the cell for varying lengths of time (1Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Beegen H. Ratnoff O.D. Hanson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The overall level of expression of the transgene in the target tissue is dependent on several factors, such as the stability of the DNA/ligand·poly-L-lysine complex, the presence and number of specific receptors on the surface of the targeted cell, the receptor-DNA/ligand interaction, endocytosis of the DNA complex and the efficiency of gene transcription in the nucleus of the target cells. DNA in the nucleus of a higher eukaryote is intimately associated with basic nuclear proteins rich in lysine (i.e. histones) or arginine (i.e. protamines). The interaction of DNA with these basic proteins is responsible for the control of the condensation process that occurs upon chromosome formation during metaphase and is thought to play a role in the regulation of gene expression. DNA condensation, which occurs naturally in viruses, bacteria, and eukaryote nuclei, has been extremely difficult to reproduce in the laboratory (13Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Cell. 1978; 13: 295-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Earnshaw W.C. Casjens S.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 319-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Due to the high negative charge of the DNA phosphate backbone, an increase in the degree of charge neutralization of the DNA theoretically results in extensive condensation and the separation of the DNA phase in the form of insoluble compact structures (15Olins D.E. Olins A.L. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 24: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We have found, however, that the structure and stoichiometry of DNA·polycation complexes in solution can be manipulated by means of the process by which DNA·cationic polypeptide complexes are formed. Specific complexes of DNA (Ψ-DNA) are formed with cationic homo-polypeptides (poly-L-lysine, poly-L-arginine, or poly-L-ornithine) after “annealing” both components in a step-down dialysis from NaCl concentrations of 3 to 0.010 M (11Wu G.Y.

Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, direct addition of basic polypeptides to DNA at physiological salt concentrations results in reversible molecular aggregation and the formation of precipitates (7Wagner E. Cotten M.

(16Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) elucidated changes in DNA secondary structure in DNA·poly-L-lysine complexes prepared by directly mixing poly-L-lysine and DNA. The physical properties of the resulting soluble complexes were investigated by circular dichroism (CD) and optical rotatory dispersion. A change in the magnitude of the molar residue rotation was found, with a characteristic red shift and a strong negative rotatory transition centered near 269 nm. The average diameter of the molecular complexes of DNA and polycation was 340 nm, with an estimated dry mass corresponding to 70 nucleic acid/polypeptide molecules per particle. The changes in optical activity noted in these studies probably arose from the formation of Ψ-DNA consisting of multiple DNA molecules in a higher order molecular complex (15Olins D.E.

(16Shapiro J.T. Leng M. Felsenfeld G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3219-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), with the significant distinction that the complexes had a unimolecular structure consisting of a single molecule of DNA condensed to a maximum diameter of about 50 nm. CD analysis indicated that there was no perturbation of the DNA helical conformation (B-DNA) nor was there aggregation of multiple molecules of DNA into higher order complexes. To be useful for gene therapy, the condensed DNA complex prepared in vitro must contain a relatively high concentration of DNA, be stable in the blood, and yet retain the critical structural features necessary for the interaction with the targeted receptor. In order to satisfy these conditions it is important that the DNA be condensed into complexes of a minimum size and not into large, multimolecular DNA complexes (aggregated DNA and Ψ-DNA), which are nonspecifically taken up in vivo by macrophages and degraded. We have previously described a procedure to generate DNA-cationic polypeptide complexes of defined size (12 nm) (1Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Beegen H. Ratnoff O.D. Hanson R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4086-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These complexes are capable of introducing functional genes into targeted cells both in vitro and in vivo by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the current report we have studied the process by which the DNA is condensed with galactosylated poly-L-lysine using absorption spectrophotometry, turbidity, circular dichroism (CD), and electron microscopy (EM) and correlated with the functional activity of the various DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complexes for receptor-mediated endocytosis into cells in vitro and in vivo High performance liquid chromatography grade water was used to prepare all solutions (Fisher). DNA-modifying enzymes, nucleotides and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All chemicals, including poly-L-lysine and α-D-galactopyranosyl phenylisothiocyanate, were obtained from Sigma. The luciferase assay system was obtained from Promega. All media, sera, and antibiotics were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The expression plasmid pGL2 contained the SV40 viral promoter and enhancer ligated to the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene, and inserted into the pUC19 vector (Promega). The plasmid pRSVlacZ (26Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

The plasmids were grown in E. coli DH5α, extracted, and purified by standard techniques (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1989; Google Scholar).

HepG2 human hepatoma cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% calf serum and 5% fetal calf serum. Hu-H7 hepatoma cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection was performed when the cells reached approximately 50% confluence. Fifty microliters of 1.0 M CaCl2 (to a final concentration of 3 mM) was added to the culture medium at the time of transfection. 60-mm plates were transfected using 5 μg of DNA added directly to 3 ml of culture medium. Primary cultures of mice hepatocytes were obtained as described (28Rojanasakul Y. Wang L.Y. Malanga C.J. Ma J.K. Liaw J. Pharmacol. Res. 1994; 11: 1731-1736Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum Waymouth's MB medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and plated in Type I collagen-coated 60-mm plates, and transfected with the DNA complexes containing the RSV-lacZ gene 3 days after plating. Calcium phosphate co-precipitation was performed according to the method of Chen and Okayama (29Biessen E.A. Beuting D.M. Vietsch H. Bijsterbosch M.K. van Berkel T.J. J. Hepatol. 1994; 21: 806-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats, weighing approximately 300 g, were anesthetized with ether. Using aseptic techniques, 0.3-0.5 ml of a solution containing 300 μg of DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complex was injected into the caudal vena cava. The rats were killed 2 days after infusion of the DNA and various organs were taken for analysis. The animal research protocol was reviewed and approved by the Case Western Reserve University Institutional Animal Care Committee. Poly-L-lysine was galactosylated as described previously (30Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 mg of poly-L-lysine-HBr (Sigma P-2636 with an average of 236 lysine residues per polypeptide) was reacted with 85 μg of α-D-galactopyranosyl phenylisothiocianate (Sigma G-3266) (5 mg/ml) in a 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, 50% water solution. The reaction was adjusted to pH 9 by the addition of one-tenth volume of 1 M sodium carbonate, pH 9, to make a final volume of 2 ml. The tube was shielded from light with aluminum foil and mixed for 16 h at room temperature, then dialyzed using Spectra-Por dialysis tubing (3500 Mr cutoff), against 500 ml of distilled water for 2 days with frequent changes of water (4 changes/day). The reaction is stoichiometric with respect to the limiting amounts of α-D-galactopyranosyl phenylisothiocianate, and resulted in the galactosylation of 0.8-1% of the NH4+ groups present in the solution. Ionic exchange chromatography confirmed that the reaction proceeds to completion, since all of the added α-D-galactopyranosyl phenylisothiocianate was conjugated to the poly-L-lysine moiety (data not shown). The amount of galactose derivative present in the galactosylated poly-L-lysine can be calculated from internal standard concentrations of galactose derivative by measuring their absorbance at 254 nm. Plasmid DNA was prepared using standard CsCl gradient centrifugation (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1989; Google Scholar). DNA was precipitated twice using one-tenth volume of (v/v) 3 M sodium acetate, pH 7, and 2.5 volumes of −40°C ethanol. The DNA was re-suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA and the concentration of the DNA determined spectrophotometrically. The DNA preparation was treated twice with RNase A + T1. DNA was resuspended to a final concentration of 1.5-2 mg/ml. Ψ-DNA was obtained essentially as described (17Li A.Z. Fan T.Y. Ding M. Sci. China B Chem. Life Sci. & Earth Sci. 1992; 35: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μg of DNA in HEPES, 1.5 M NaCl (pH 7.5) was mixed with galactosylated poly-L-lysine in HEPES, 1.5 M NaCl (pH 7.5) at a 1:1 ratio with respect to charge equivalents. Each component had a volume of 250 μl. Thirty minutes after mixing the DNA and poly-L-lysine, the DNA complex was dialyzed against HEPES, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) for 16 h at room temperature. For animal, electron microscopy and circular dichroism studies, the following basic protocol was used to generate DNA·poly-L-lysine complexes in the indicated structural states. Three hundred micrograms of DNA (200 μl final volume) adjusted to 0.75 M NaCl in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube was vortexed at medium speed, using a VIBRAX shaking apparatus (VIBRAX-VXR, IKA Works Inc., Wilmington, NC). One hundred and twenty microliters of galactosylated poly-L-lysine adjusted to 0.75 M NaCl (200 μl final volume) was added over a period of 1-1.5 h. Five-microliter aliquots were added dropwise every 5 min. This generates a molar ratio of 1 DNA PO4− group to 1 lysine NH4+ group in the final complex. The solution becomes turbid at the end of the addition process (aggregated DNA complex). Three-microliter aliquots of 5 M NaCl were then added dropwise to the vortexing solution until turbidity disappears as monitored by eye. The addition of NaCl is performed slowly, allowing 5 min between the addition of each aliquot. The structure of DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complexes was monitored either by CD or directly visualized using a JEOL-100C electron microscope. Stepwise addition of 5 M NaCl resulted in the structural changes to the complexes shown in Fig. 6. The formation of highly condensed DNA·poly-L-lysine complexes is complete when the diagnostic CD spectrum of condensed DNA·poly-L-lysine complex is observed (see Fig. 1D), and the appropriate structure visualized by EM (see Fig. 6D). Further addition of concentrated NaCl results in the formation of relaxed DNA complexes. For subsequent preparations of DNA·poly-L-lysine complex consisting of the same plasmid DNA at the same concentration, the NaCl addition protocol established during the initial condensation reaction can be repeated without CD or EM evaluation; the process is reproducible. However, if different concentrations of DNA or a different plasmid are used, the condensation process should be re-evaluated using CD and EM.Fig. 1Ellipticity versus wavelength spectra of DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complexes prepared using different conditions for the preparation of the complex. CD spectra were taken in a 0.1-cm path cuvette. The DNA was complexed with poly-L-lysine at identical molar ratios of amino to phosphate groups and various CD spectra compared: A, standard control for DNA in 1 M NaCl; B, Ψ-DNA as observed at a concentration of NaCl at which multimolecular condensation occurs (see Fig. 6); C, aggregated DNA shows turbidity and decreased ellipticity; D, condensed, unimolecular complexes of DNA; E, relaxed DNA complex spectrum. The spectra was taken at equal concentrations of polymer and the signal for the buffer was subtracted in each case. details of the assay are presented under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For absorbance and cell culture experiments, the following basic protocol was used to generate DNA·poly-L-lysine complexes. Sixty micrograms of DNA in 350 μl, adjusted to 0.4 M NaCl, is vortexed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube at medium speed, using a VIBRAX shaking apparatus. Twenty-four micrograms of galactosylated poly-L-lysine in 350 μl adjusted to 0.4 M NaCl from a 5 M NaCl stock solution is added dropwise over a period of 1-1.5 h in 15-μl aliquots; slowly mixing 15-μl aliquots every 5 min. This generates a molar ratio of 1 DNA PO4− group to 1 lysine NH4+ group in the final complex. The solution is clear to the eye at the end of the process. Three-microliter aliquots of 5 M NaCl are then added dropwise to the vortexing solution while monitored at 260 and 400 nm. The addition of salt is performed slowly, allowing 5 min between the addition of each aliquot. The circular dichroism spectra of the complexes were obtained on a JASCO spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path cell and the ellipticity values (θ) are given in terms of millidegrees. The ellipticity value for the non-buffered NaCl solutions was subtracted from the experimental values for the DNA·poly-L-lysine complexes. Aqueous 2% uranyl acetate was used in these studies as a contrast stain. DNA·poly-L-lysine complex preparations were diluted immediately prior to staining to 50 μg/ml in 150 mM NaCl. Samples were applied for 3 min to a copper electron microscope grid containing a carbon film, blotted, and allowed to dry for 30 s. A drop of the staining solution was then applied for 1 min, blotted, washed for 1 s in high performance liquid chromatography grade water and allowed to dry. The grids were examined in a JEOL-100C microscope and plates were exposed to the image at a magnification of × 50,000. The microscope was calibrated by the use of 87.5-Å spacing of catalase crystals (31Kupfer J.M. Ruan X.M. Liu G. Matloff J. Forrester J. Chaux A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rats injected with the DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complex and control animals were killed and the tissues of interest were perfused in situ with 50 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). The tissues were then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer (Promega) and incubated at 22°C for 10 min. The cells lysates were subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C, and the protein extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity following instructions of the manufacturer. The lysates were assayed for protein content and the measured integrated light units over a 10-s interval were standardized for protein content. All measurements were performed in triplicate and expressed as an average ± S.E. (S.E. of the mean). Individual cells expressing β-galactosidase were identified following incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside. Forty-eight hours after transfection with either the DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complexes or CaPO4 precipitates, the cells were fixed with a solution of 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and then incubated with a solution containing 0.5% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside for 8-12 h at 37°C. Blue-colored cells were identified by light microscopy. A minimum of 100 cells in tissue culture were counted to determine the percentage of cells expressing β-galactosidase. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for hFIX protein was utilized to quantitate hFIX protein in the incubation medium of Hu-H7 cells. Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4°C with 10 μg of the coating antibody (HFIXα-40, Hematologic Technologies Inc., Essex, VT) diluted in Tris-HCl-buffered saline. The next day the wells were washed twice with 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and nonspecific binding blocked for 2 h at room temperature using RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum. Media samples (50 μl) from Hu-H7 cultured cells were obtained after administration of the DNA complex solution and applied to the wells. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed 3 times with 200 μl of washing solution (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20). A 1:1,000 dilution in RPMI of a rabbit anti-hFIX polyclonal IgG (Calbiochem Inc., San Diego, CA) was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then washed 3 times with the washing buffer. One hundred microliters of a 1:2,000 dilution in RPMI of a goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed 5 times with the washing buffer. One hundred microliters of the substrate (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) was then added and 30 min later the reaction was stopped using 50 μl of 0.5 M H2SO4. Spectrophotometric readings were taken at 450 nm. Purified hFIX (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) diluted into RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum was used to generate standard curves for each experiment. Absorbance values were linear within the range of concentrations of hFIX obtained in these experiments. Electrostatic binding of polycations or basic polypeptides to the DNA phosphate backbone at a 1:1 stoichiometric charge ratio results in uncontrolled precipitation of the DNA when mixing of the DNA and polycation occurs rapidly (15Olins D.E.

This feature in the CD spectrum is characteristic of Ψ-DNA and indicates chiral packing of multiple DNA helices in solution under charge-neutralized conditions (32Maniatis T. Venable Jr., J.H. Lerman L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 37-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The aberrant optical spectrum is thought to be due to base stacking in the same optical plane, and is observed in solutions of DNA/poly-L-lysine in the absence of turbidity. To prepare a suitable ligand for the introduction of genes by receptor-mediated gene transfer targeting the asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor of hepatocytes, we have chemically coupled galactose molecules to the poly-L-lysine moiety by galactopyranosyl phenylisothiocianate derivation of 1% of the ε-amino groups present in the poly-L-lysine molecule. The structural features of DNA-galactosylated poly-L-lysine complexes prepared by direct mixing were investigated using EM; we observed condensed DNA particles with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 nm (Fig. 6B). Based on the previously described density of Ψ-DNA (32Maniatis T. Venable Jr., J.H. Lerman L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 37-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) we have calculated that these heterogeneous DNA particles contain from 5 to 20 plasmid DNA molecules in addition to the poly-L-lysine component. This result indicates that condensation of DNA un"

Apoptosis is detected morphologically by chromatin condensation. Concomitantly we noticed the accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. NO·-derived apoptosis was blocked by the NO·-synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Repetitive treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ, followed by subculturing viable cells, allowed us to select resistant macrophages which we called RES. RES cells still produced comparable amounts of nitrite/nitrate in response to agonist treatment but showed no apoptotic markers, i.e. chromatin condensation or p53 accumulation. However, RES macrophages undergo apoptosis in the presence of exogenously supplied NO·, released from the NO-donors S-nitrosoglutathione or spermine-NO. Assessment of cytochrome c reduction established that RES cells released twice the amount of superoxide compared to RAW 264.7 macrophages under both resting and stimulated conditions. We linked increased superoxide production to cellular macrophage resistance by demonstrating decreased apoptosis after simultaneous application of S-nitrosoglutathione or spermine-NO and the redox cycler 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone. Our results suggest that macrophage resistance toward NO·-mediated apoptosis is, at least in part, due to increased superoxide formation.

https://openalex.org/W2003040183,"Galactosylceramide (GalCer) is an alternative receptor allowing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 entry into CD4-negative cells of neural and colonic origin. Several lines of evidence suggest that this glycosphingolipid recognizes the V3 region of HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120. Since the V3 loop plays a key role in the fusion process driven by HIV-1, we decided to synthesize soluble analogs of GalCer with the aim to develop a new class of anti-HIV-1 agents that could neutralize HIV-1 infection through masking of the V3 loop. We describe a short route, in three steps, for the synthesis of soluble analogs of GalCer, using unprotected lactose as the starting sugar. The analogs were prescreened in an assay based on the interaction between a V3 loop-derived synthetic peptide and [3H]suramin, a polysulfonyl compound displaying high affinity for the V3 loop. One of the soluble analogs, i.e. CA52(n15), strongly inhibited the binding of [3H]suramin to the V3 peptide, with an IC50 of 1.2 μM. This molecule was also able to inhibit [3H]suramin binding to recombinant gp120 with similar activity. Using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with highly specific anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies, the region recognized by CA52(n15) could be mapped to amino acids 318-323, which corresponds to the highly conserved consensus motif GPGRAF. Interestingly, the region recognized by suramin, i.e. IQRGP-R-F, was partially overlapping this motif. CA52(n15) was able to inhibit HIV-1-induced cell fusion as well as HIV-1 entry into both CD4+ and CD4−/GalCer+ cells. A structure-activity relationship study showed that: (i) the antiviral activity of soluble analogs of GalCer correlates with V3 loop binding, and (ii) the hydrophobic moiety of the molecule plays an important role in this activity. Taken together, these data show that synthetic analogs of GalCer can inhibit HIV-1 entry into both CD4− and CD4+ cells through masking of the V3 loop.

This molecule was also able to inhibit [3H]suramin binding to recombinant gp120 with similar activity. Using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with highly specific anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies, the region recognized by CA52(n15) could be mapped to amino acids 318-323, which corresponds to the highly conserved consensus motif GPGRAF. Interestingly, the region recognized by suramin, i.e. IQRGP-R-F, was partially overlapping this motif. CA52(n15) was able to inhibit HIV-1-induced cell fusion as well as HIV-1 entry into both CD4+ and CD4−/GalCer+ cells. A structure-activity relationship study showed that: (i) the antiviral activity of soluble analogs of GalCer correlates with V3 loop binding, and (ii) the hydrophobic moiety of the molecule plays an important role in this activity. Taken together, these data show that synthetic analogs of GalCer can inhibit HIV-1 entry into both CD4− and CD4+ cells through masking of the V3 loop.

Due to the high variability of the V3 loop sequence, the neutralizing activity of anti-V3 antibodies is generally restricted to one or, in the best cases, to a few related HIV-1 isolates, which renders vaccinal strategies particularly puzzling (10Goudsmit J. Debouck C. Meloen R.H. Smith L. Bakker M. Asher D.M. Wolff A.V. Gibbs C.J. Gajdusek D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4478-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 11Palker T.J.

However, since the V3 domain of most HIV-1 strains contains several well conserved basic amino acid residues (12LaRosa G.J. Davide J.P. Weinhold K. Waterbury J.A. Profy A.T. Lewis J.A. Langlois A.J.

Moreover, the V3 loop is also involved in the recognition of galactosylceramide (GalCer), a glycosphingolipid allowing HIV-1 entry into CD4-negative cells of neural and colonic origin (16Harouse J.M.

These data prompted us to use soluble analogs of the GalCer receptor as potential inhibitors of HIV-1 infection. The synthetic scheme of these molecules was based on the original use of unprotected lactose, a low cost disaccharide, as the starting sugar (20Rico-Lattes I. Garigues J.C. Perez E. André-Barrès C. MadelaineDupuich C. Lattes A. New J.

We report here the synthesis and characterization of such soluble GalCer analogs that can block HIV-1-induced fusion as well as entry into both CD4− and CD4+ cells. These analogs have been first evaluated for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]suramin to SPC3, a synthetic peptide displaying eight V3 consensus motifs (GPGRAF) radially branched on uncharged poly-Lys core matrix (15Yahi N. Sabatier J.-M. Nickel P. Mabrouk K. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24349-24353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This prescreening assay proved useful to select those analogs that recognized the V3 loop, and a good correlation was found between the anti-HIV-1 activity of a given analog and its affinity for the V3 loop. These data show that synthetic soluble analogs of glycosphingolipids may represent a new class of anti-HIV-1 drugs that could be obtained at a large scale with a low cost. SPC3, i.e. (GPGRAF)8-(K)4-(K)2-K-βA, was generously provided by M. Mollard (Eurethics, Paris, France). The peptide was synthesized according to Tam (21Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) purified to homogeneity, and the amino acid analysis of the purified peptide agreed with the deduced amino acid ratios. The other peptides used in this study were obtained as described previously (22Yahi N. Fantini J. Mabrouk K. Tamalet C. De Micco P. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Sabatier J.-M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5714-5720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Suramin (49 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Isotopchim (Ganagobie-Peyruis, France). Polyvinyl chloride multiwell plates (number 3911) were from Falcon-Becton Dickinson (Le Pont de Claix, France). Immulon 1 multiwell plates were from Poly Labo (Strasbourg, France). Tissue culture media and fetal calf serum were from BioWhittaker (Gagny, France). Recombinant gp120 was from Intracel Corp. (London). Polyclonal sheep anti-gp120 directed to the C-terminal domain, amino acids 497-511 (reference D7326) were from Aalto Bioreagents (Dublin, Ireland). Mouse monoclonal anti-gp120 antibodies F5, 110-A, and 110-H were generously given by F. Traincard and J. C. Mazié (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The synthetic scheme of analog CA52(n15) is illustrated in Fig. 4. The intermediate 2 is obtained in two stages from lactose and the corresponding ω-amino acid, after reduction with sodium borohydride according to a procedure described elsewhere (20Rico-Lattes I. Garigues J.C. Perez E. André-Barrès C. MadelaineDupuich C. Lattes A. New J. Chem. 1995; 19: 341-344Google Scholar, 23Madelaine-Dupuich C. Escoula B. Rico I. Lattes A. Synth. Commun. 1993; 23: 949Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, to a solution of 11-aminoundecanoic sodium carboxylate (22 mmol) in methanol (60 ml) is added 13.7 mmol of lactose monohydrate dissolved in 30 ml of water. The mixture is stirred 12 h at room temperature, then heated at 55°C for 6 h. Product 1 is not isolated. Sodium borohydride (15 mmol) is immediately added at room temperature by little portions to the reaction mixture and stirred for 12 h. The residual solution is evaporated in vacuo The crude mixture is purified by chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh) eluting with chloroform/methanol/ammoniac (5/3.5/1.5). After lyophilization pure product is obtained (3.4 g, 45% on two steps). The soluble analog of GalCer is then obtained by the following procedure. To a solution of compound 2 (3.28 mmol) in 250 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, and 3.28 mmol of triethylamine is added the acylating agent 3,3-hexadecanoylthiazolidine-2-thione (6.40 mmol) prepared as described previously (20Rico-Lattes I. Garigues J.C. Perez E. André-Barrès C. MadelaineDupuich C. Lattes A. New J. Chem. 1995; 19: 341-344Google Scholar, 23Madelaine-Dupuich C. Escoula B. Rico I. Lattes A. Synth. Commun. 1993; 23: 949Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The mixture is stirred for 4 days at 60°C. After evaporation to dryness, the crude product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (CHCl3/MeOH/NH3,H2O = 6/3/1). 1.2 g of pure product CA52(n15) is obtained (50% yield). The structures of compounds and purities were checked by 1H,13C NMR, mass spectroscopy (fast atom bombardment), and microanalysis. 100 μl of SPC3 at the indicated concentration were incubated in polyvinyl chloride 96-well plates overnight at 4°C. The wells were washed three times with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently treated with PBS containing 1% gelatin for 90 min at 37°C to reduce nonspecific binding. The plates were then incubated with 100 μl of [3H]suramin (1 μCi/ml). After 1 h at 37°C, the plates were washed five times with 200 μl of PBS, each well was individualized, and the radioactivity was determined in a β scintillation counter (Beckman, Marseille, France). In some experiments, nonrelevant multibranched peptides (15Yahi N. Sabatier J.-M. Nickel P. Mabrouk K. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24349-24353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used as negative controls. The prescreening assay is based on the potential ability of synthetic GalCer analogs to compete with [3H]suramin for binding to SPC3. In this assay, 100 μl of SPC3 (5 μM) were deposed in polyvinyl chloride 96-well plates as described above. The indicated concentration of each drug was added in competition during [3H]suramin incubation. The plates were then washed and processed for radioactivity measurements exactly as for the [3H]suramin solid phase assay. 100 μl of recombinant gp120 (2.5 μg/ml) were incubated in polyvinyl chloride 96-well plates overnight at 4°C. After three washes in PBS, the plates were saturated with PBS 1% gelatin for 90 min at 37°C. [3H]Suramin (1 μCi/ml) was then added in either the absence or presence of synthetic GalCer analogs. The binding of [3H]suramin to recombinant gp120 was measured by counting the radioactivity as described above. 100 μl of anti-gp120 polyclonal sheep antibodies directed to the C-terminal domain of gp120 (10 μg/ml in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) were incubated in Immulon 1 multiwell plates overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed three times with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 144 mM NaCl and saturated with 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, low fat dry milk 2% (saturation buffer) for 120 min at room temperature. Recombinant gp120 (0.2 μg/ml) was then added to the wells and incubated for 120 min at room temperature. The plates were washed three times and then incubated with the indicated anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in the saturation buffer for 120 min at room temperature. After three washes, the plates were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 60 min at room temperature. The plates were then rinsed and incubated with o-phenylenediamine. The reaction was stopped by addition of 4 N H2SO4, and the optical density was read at 490 nm with a Biotek EL311 (OSI, Les Ulis, France) spectrophotometer. When indicated, the inhibitors (suramin and CA52) were present 15 min before and during the incubation with anti-V3 mAbs. The V3 peptides were coated on Immulon 1 multiwell plates for 1 h at 37°C. Nonspecific binding sites were saturated with PBS, containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37°C. After washing, the peptides were incubated with the anti-gp120 mAb F5 (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. The wells were then washed, and the bound mAb was revealed with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000) using o-phenylenediamine as substrate. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm as described above. Stock solution of lipids were prepared in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The indicated amounts of lipids were then resuspended in chloroform/ethanol (1:20, v/v) and allowed to adsorb on Immulon 1 multiwell plates by evaporation of the solvent under a chemical hood. After saturation of the plates with PBS, containing 2% bovine serum albumin (1 h at 37°C), the lipids were probed with the anti-GalCer R-mAb (18Yahi N. Baghdiguian S. Moreau H. Fantini J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4848-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and processed for ELISA as described above. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from healthy donors, activated with phytohemagglutinin, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and interleukin 2 as described (22Yahi N. Fantini J. Mabrouk K. Tamalet C. De Micco P. Van Rietschoten J. Rochat H. Sabatier J.-M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5714-5720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human T-lymphoblastoid C8166 cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The human colon epithelial cell line HT-29 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum. Syncytia formation was observed in C8166 cell cultures at day 7 postinfection with HIV-1(LAI) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.001 tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) per cell. Synthetic GalCer analogs were preincubated with the virus in 96-well culture plates in a total volume of 100 μl. After 30 min at 37°C, 100 μl of C8166 cells (106 cells/ml) were added to the wells. After 7 days of culture, the presence of syncytia was observed under a phase contrast Leica inverted microscope equipped with an integrated camera exposure system (OSI). The synthetic analogs of GalCer were tested for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection in two cell targets: the CD4−/GalCer+ human colon epithelial cell line HT-29 and normal human PBMC. In both cases, HIV-1 was preincubated with the indicated concentration of the synthetic analog for 30 min at 37°C. The mixture was then either deposed in six-well plates onto exponentially growing HT-29 cells (m.o.i. of 0.1 TCID50 per cell) or used to resuspend a cell pellet of PBMC (m.o.i. of 0.01 TCID50 per cell). The level of infection was analyzed 7 days postinfection by measuring the concentration of p24 antigen in the cell-free culture supernatants as described elsewhere (15Yahi N. Sabatier J.-M. Nickel P. Mabrouk K. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24349-24353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yahi N. Sabatier J.M. Baghdiguian S. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 320-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An antigen capture assay (DuPont, Les Ulis, France) was used for p24 determinations. The viruses used in these experiments were the prototype HIV-1(LAI) or the african HIV-1(NDK) isolates, as described previously (18Yahi N. Baghdiguian S. Moreau H. Fantini J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4848-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fantini J. Cook D.G. Nathanson N. Spitalnik S.L. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The effects of synthetic analogs of GalCer on the proliferation and viability of PBMC were studied in a colorimetric assay utilizing the tetrazolium salt XTT, i.e. sodium 3′-[-1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate (25Roehm N.W. Rodgers G.H. Hatfield S.M. Glasebrook A.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 142: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 to reduce the blank values. Briefly, XTT was dissolved in prewarmed medium at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Immediately before use, phenazine methosulfate (PMS) was added to the XTT solution (final concentration of PMS, 125 μM). 25 μl of XTT/PMS solution was added to 100 μl of culture giving a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml XTT and 25 μM PMS. After incubation at 37°C for 4-8 h, the optical density was determined using a test wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 650 nm, subtracting blank control values with medium alone. A first set of experiments was designed with the aim to assess that the multibranched peptide SPC3 was representative of the tip of the V3 loop as exposed in native gp120. Using an ELISA detection method, we analyzed the reactivity of SPC3 with F5, an anti-gp120 mAb directed to the GPGRAFVT motif of the HIV-1(LAI) isolate (15Yahi N. Sabatier J.-M. Nickel P. Mabrouk K. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24349-24353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, this anti-V3 mAb bound to SPC3 with high specificity. In contrast, the F5 mAb did not recognize the monomeric GPGRAF motif nor SPC3 derivatives with lower valencies, i.e. the four-branched (GPGRAF)4-(K)2-K-βA and the 2-branched (GPGRAF)2-K-βA synthetic peptides. These data suggested that the presentation of the GPGRAF motif in the eight-branched peptide SPC3, but not in its derivatives with lower valencies, was reminiscent of the physiological situation. Thus, SPC3 was used throughout this study as a model for the tip of the V3 loop. The binding of [3H]suramin to the multibranched V3 peptide SPC3 was analyzed in a solid phase radioassay. In this assay, the peptide was coated on polyvinyl chloride 96-well plates, and [3H]suramin was used as a revealing agent. As shown in Fig. 2, the binding of [3H]suramin to SPC3 was dose-dependent and saturable. The binding specificity was further demonstrated by using SPC3 derivatives with either a shorter or a different motif (GPGR, GPGRA, GPGKTL, or GPGQAF). [3H]Suramin did not bind to any of these peptides (15Yahi N. Sabatier J.-M. Nickel P. Mabrouk K. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24349-24353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), indicating that [3H]suramin recognized the entire V3 consensus motif GPGRAF, with special emphasis to the Arg (R) and Phe (F) residues. Moreover, [3H]suramin could not detect SPC3 derivatives with lower valencies, in agreement with the data of Fig. 1. This raised the interesting possibility to use the [3H]suramin solid phase radioassay as a prescreening test for a rapid and low-cost identification of a new class of anti-HIV drugs susceptible to bind to the consensus V3 loop motif. Among the myriad of potential V3-binding compounds (heparin, sulfated sugars, neutralizing antibodies, etc…), we decided to focus on soluble analogs of GalCer, an alternative receptor recognized by the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120 (15Yahi N. Sabatier J.-M. Nickel P. Mabrouk K. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24349-24353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yahi N. Sabatier J.M. Baghdiguian S. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 320-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cook D.G. Fantini J. Spitalnik S.L. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Virology. 1994; 201: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The synthetic analogs of GalCer developed in this study were obtained in only three stages from lactose. The chemical structure of CA52(n15), the prototype of this new series of analogs, is shown in Fig. 3. Other analogs were obtained by varying the number of carbon atoms in the lateral hydrophobic chain (n = 15 for CA52(n15)). The synthetic scheme of CA52(n15) is illustrated in Fig. 4. The feature of note is the use of unprotected lactose as starting sugar, a low cost disaccharide consisting of a galactose and glucose units linked by a 1-4 junction in the β configuration. Thus, opening of the glucose ring by reductive amination in the first two stages of the synthesis leads to the GalCer-like unit. Another point is the terminal carboxylate function of this new compound leading to the good solubility of the substrate in aqueous media. For this reason, the molecules synthesized according to this scheme can be considered as true soluble analogs of GalCer. Indeed, the synthetic analog CA52(n15) was fully recognized by the anti-GalCer R-mAb in an ELISA assay (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Recognition of CA52(n15) by an anti-GalCer mAb. The following molecules were coated on 96-well multiplates as described under “Experimental Procedures”: ceramide (open circles), glucosylceramide (closed circles), GalCer (closed squares), and CA52(n15) (open squares). The binding of the anti-GalCer R-mAb was revealed by ELISA. This mAb bound specifically to GalCer and CA52(n15), while ceramide and glucosylceramide, used as controls, were not recognized. The results are expressed as the mean of two separate experiments (±S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A series of synthetic analogs of GalCer differing in the length of their hydrophobic moiety were tested as potential inhibitors of the SPC3-suramin interaction. In this experiment, the synthetic analogs of GalCer were present in competition during the incubation of SPC3-coated 96-well plates with [3H]suramin. As shown in Fig. 6, CA52(n15) (the prototype GalCer analog with 15 carbon atoms in the hydrophobic chain) was the only analog able to totally prevent the binding of [3H]suramin. This derivative interfered with SPC3 recognition in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.7 μM (0.6 μg/ml). The activity of CA52(n15) was highly specific, since a more polar derivative with only 8 carbon atoms in the hydrophobic chain, i.e. CA50(n8) did not affect the binding of [3H]suramin to SPC3. Moreover, when the length of the carbon chain was intermediary between the fully active CA52(n15) and the nonactive CA50(n8) analogs, the corresponding molecule (i.e. CA49(n11), with 11 carbon atoms) showed a weak, yet nonnegligible activity, with an IC50 of 9.4 μM (7 μg/ml). These data underscored the high specificity of the [3H]suramin solid phase assay, which could discriminate between closely related GalCer analogs. Two experiments were conducted in order to ensure that CA52(n15) actually recognized the V3 loop motif GPGRAF. In the first one, CA52(n15) was preincubated with SPC3 before the plate was rinsed and then exposed to [3H]suramin. Under these conditions, the IC50 of CA52(n15) was not changed, which strongly suggests that the analog binds to SPC3 and not to [3H]suramin (data not shown). In the second one, CA52(n15) was tested for its ability to interfere with the binding of [3H]suramin to recombinant gp120. In this case, the plates were coated with gp120, and the binding of [3H]suramin was done in the presence of various concentrations of CA52(n15). The results in Fig. 7 show that CA52(n15) was indeed able to inhibit the binding of [3H]suramin to the V3 domain of recombinant gp120 in a dose-dependent fashion, with an IC50 of 2.4 μM (2 μg/ml). Taken together, these data strongly suggested that CA52(n15) recognized a region of the gp120 V3 loop closely related to the consensus motif GPGRAF. In order to further define the region of the V3 loop involved in CA52(n15) binding, we used two anti-gp120 mAbs that recognize two overlapping epitopes at the tip of the V3 loop: IQRGP, recognized by mAb 110-A, and GPGRAFVTI, recognized by mAb 110-H. In these mapping experiments, gp120 was oriented on Immulon 1 microplates precoated with sheep polyclonal antibodies directed to the C-terminal part of gp120. Under these conditions, anti-V3 mAbs had their epitope readily accessible on the recombinant glycoprotein (27Moore J.P. McKeating J.A. Jones I.M. Stephens G. Thompson S. Weiss R.A. AIDS. 1990; 4: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The soluble GalCer analog CA52(n15) inhibited the binding of both 110-A and 110-H mAbs, with an IC50 of 61.7 and 49.3 μM, respectively (Table I). In contrast, suramin did not affect the binding of mAb 110-H (IC50 > 500 μM), while it inhibited the binding of mAb 110-A with an IC50 of 106 μM; Table I).

As assessed by microwell substrate binding assays and by column affinity chromatography, the matrix proteins laminin, denatured type I collagen, elastin, SPARC (secreted protein that is acidic and rich in cysteine), tenascin, and Matrigel™ were not bound by the rC domain. Unlike the hemopexin-like domains of collagenase and stromelysin, the rC domain also did not bind native type I collagen. Nor were native or denatured types II, IV, V, and X collagen, or the NC1 domain of type VII collagen bound. However, binding to heparin and fibronectin (Kd, 1.1 × 10−6M) could be disrupted by 0.58-0.76 and 0.3 M NaCl, respectively. Using nonoverlapping chymotrypsin-generated fragments of fibronectin, binding sites for the rC domain were found on both the 40-kDa heparin binding and the 120-kDa cell binding fibronectin domains (Kd values, ∼4-6 × 10−7M). The Ca2+ ion, but not the potential structural Zn2+ ion, were found to be essential for maintaining the binding properties of the protein. The apo-form of the rC domain did not bind heparin, and both ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and the specific Ca2+ ion chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, but not the Zn2+ ion chelator 1,10-phenanthroline, eluted the holo form of the rC domain from both heparin-Sepharose and fibronectin. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry also did not detect a Zn2+ ion in the rC domain. In contrast, reduction with 65 mM dithiothreitol did not interfere with heparin binding, further emphasizing the crucial structural role played by the Ca2+ ion.

LCAT deficiency resulted in significant reductions in the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and apoA-I in both LCAT −/− mice (25, 7, and 12%; p < 0.001 of normal) and LCAT +/− mice (65 and 59%; p < 0.001 and 81%; not significant, p = 0.17 of normal). In addition, plasma triglycerides were significantly higher (212% of normal; p < 0.01) in male homozygous knockout mice compared with wild-type animals but remained normal in female knockout LCAT mice. Analyses of plasma lipoproteins by fast protein liquid chromatography and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of heterogenous preβ-migrating HDL, as well as triglyceride-enriched very low density lipoprotein. After 3 weeks on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet, LCAT −/− mice had significantly lower plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, reflecting reduced levels of both proatherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins as well as HDL, compared with controls. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that the absence of LCAT attenuates the rise of apoB-containing lipoproteins in response to dietary cholesterol. No evidence of corneal opacities or renal insufficiency was detected in 4-month-old homozygous knockout mice. The availability of a homozygous animal model for human LCAT deficiency states will permit further evaluation of the role that LCAT plays in atherosclerosis as well as the feasibility of performing gene transfer in human LCAT deficiency states.

USF was first identified by its ability to bind to the upstream stimulatory element of the adenovirus major late promoter (34Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 35Sawadogo M. Roeder R. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using hepatic nuclear extracts produced one major shifted complex that bound specifically to the S14 and L-PK ChoREs and which was “supershifted” by the addition of an antibody against USF (21Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the USF binding site from the adenovirus major late promoter was unable to substitute for the ChoRE in either the L-PK or the S14 gene, indicating that USF alone is not capable of mediating the response (21Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the ubiquitous nature of USF (36Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), coupled with its ability to interact with sequences in other genes that are not regulated by glucose (37Potter J.J.

Science. 1987; 238: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), raised the question as to how the specificity of the response is achieved. We thus set out to determine whether or not USF is involved in the regulatory pathway induced by carbohydrate.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrimary Hepatocyte Culture and TransfectionThe procedure previously described was followed (20Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague Dawley rats (180-240 g) maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to normal chow. Following a 3-6-h attachment period, cells were transfected using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in modified Williams E medium (lacking methyl linoleate and glucose) supplemented with 23 mM HEPES, 0.01 μM dexamethasone, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, 1 unit/ml penicillin, 1 μg/ml streptomycin, and 11 mM glucose for 12-14 h. Cells were subsequently incubated for 48 h in medium containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mM glucose and harvested for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. For studies using dominant negative forms of USF, Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products) was added to the cells at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml after the overnight transfection. This treatment has been shown to increase the time that cultured hepatocytes remain responsive to elevated glucose concentrations (40Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 813-816PubMed Google Scholar). After the addition of Matrigel, plates were incubated in low glucose medium for 24 h before the 48-h incubation with low or high glucose. Percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms was determined by thin layer chromatography followed by phosphor screen autoradiography, with subsequent scanning and quantitation (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.)Plasmid Constructs and OligonucleotidesS14 MutantsThe pS14CAT(An)-4316-mut1, -mut2, and -mut3 constructs were prepared using PCR mutagenesis to engineer mutations at the ChoRE E boxes and the accessory factor site (41Seal S.N. Davis D.L. Burch J.B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2704-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The exact location of each mutation is shown in Fig. 1A (Mut1, Mut2, and Mut3). Two primers were used for each construct, one directed upstream from the mutation site and one directed downstream. These primer pairs contained either an XbaI site or a BamHI site in place of the motif to be mutated. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out using pS14CAT(An)-4316 (9Jacoby D.B. Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. PCR products were digested with HindIII and XbaI/BamHI or XbaI/BamHI and SfiI to generate fragments extending from −2111 through the mutation and from the mutation to −767, respectively. These fragments were then ligated into the HindIII and SfiI sites of pS14CAT(An)-4316. Sequences of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.USF Expression VectorsPlasmids psvUSF2 and psvUSF2ΔB, which encode mouse USF2 and USF2Δb (39Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Morgan C.J. Crabtree G.R. Sharp P.A. Science. 1987; 238: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Michéle Sawadogo (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas). USF2 coding regions were transferred into the CMV4 plasmid (42Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was accomplished by ligating a BglII linker to the EcoRI site and inserting the desired USF2 fragment into the BglII site of CMV4. A similar construct containing USF2ΔNΔb was prepared by carrying out the polymerase chain reaction on the USF2 construct using primers with appended MluI or XbaI sites to generate a product encoding USF2 amino acids 1-6 and 249-346. The PCR product was cleaved with MluI and XbaI and ligated into CMV4. A CMV/USF1 expression plasmid was provided by Drs. Philippe Pognonec and Robert Roeder (Rockefeller University). The bAP4/USF1 construct was prepared by using PCR to amplify the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of USF1 separately. Internal primers were directed upstream and downstream from either side of the basic region; each had an extended overhang encoding the AP4 basic region containing an NspV site. The external primers contained appended HindIII or XbaI sites. PCR products were digested with HindIII and NspV or NspV and XbaI and inserted into the HindIII and XbaI sites of CMV4 by triple ligation. The USF2/VP16 construct was made by first amplifying the entire USF2 sequence to eliminate the stop codon and replace it with a BglII site. The PCR product was cleaved with HindIII and BglII and inserted into pSJT1193, a plasmid containing the C-terminal activation domain of VP16, which was kindly donated by Dr. Steve Triezenberg (Michigan State University). The USF2/VP16 fusion was then removed from this plasmid by digestion with KpnI and HindIII and inserted into CMV4.ChoRE MutationsThe parental PK(−96)CAT plasmid into which altered ChoRE sequences were inserted has been described (18Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8679-8682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized containing the sequences shown in Fig. 4 flanked on each side by a HindIII site. These fragments were cloned into the unique HindIII site in PK(−96)CAT just upstream of the L-PK basal promoter. Plasmids were subjected to sequence analysis to determine the orientation and copy number of the insert.Fig. 4Palindromic ChoRE mutants. Oligonucleotides were synthesized containing the sequences shown. The positions of the E box motifs are underlined and in boldface type Lowercase letters represent differences from the consensus CACGTG motif in each mutant. These sequences were inserted into pL-PK(−96)CAT (18Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8679-8682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) just upstream of the L-PK basal promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nuclear Extract Preparation and EMSAsRats were fasted overnight and refed a high carbohydrate, low fat diet (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) for 4 h before sacrifice. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the procedure of Lavery et al. (43Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed essentially as described (20Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction contained 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (0.5-1 ng) and 3 μg of nuclear extract. After 45 min at 23°C, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in a Tris-glycine buffering system (20Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the radiolabeled probe prior to the addition of nuclear extract.DISCUSSIONWe have previously identified by deletional mutagenesis a carbohydrate response element between positions −1448 and −1422 in the 5′-flanking region of the S14 gene (23Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This sequence is similar to the ChoRE of the L-PK gene (also called the glucose/insulin response element (19Bergot M.-O. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)). In either case, two CACGTG-like E boxes separated by 5 base pairs are present. In the case of the S14 ChoRE, however, the 3′ CCTGTG motif has only a 4/6 match with the consensus sequence. Two lines of evidence support the importance of this motif. First, mutations introduced into the 3′ E box that make it a better fit to the consensus CACGTG resulted in stronger responses to glucose (23Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Second, we have now shown that specific mutagenesis of the 3′ E box in the context of the natural S14 gene largely abolished the ability of the S14 promoter to respond to glucose. Likewise, mutation of the 5′ E box eliminated the response. Previous work has shown that both E boxes of the L-PK gene are also critical for control (19Bergot M.-O. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of two E box motifs is a critical feature for mediating the glucose response of these two members of the lipogenic enzyme family.The S14 and L-PK ChoREs are sufficient to support a response to glucose when linked in multiple copies to a basal promoter or mutated to give an optimal binding site. However, in either case an adjacent accessory factor site is required for the full extent of the response in the context of the natural gene. For the L-PK promoter, the hepatic-enriched factor HNF-4 is capable of binding just 3′ to the ChoRE and greatly enhancing its activity (22Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Diaz Guerra M.-J.M. Bergot M.-O. Martinez A. Cuif M.-H. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the case of the S14 gene, the accessory site located immediately 5′ to the ChoRE binds an as yet unidentified nuclear factor (23Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mutating this element in the context of the natural S14 gene greatly diminished the glucose response. Hence, this site appears to play an important role in supporting regulation. A similar situation has been found in several other genes subject to transcriptional regulation by hormonal and metabolic factors. For example, the gene encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor is activated when sterol levels are low by the action of the transcriptional factor SREBP (52Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The action of SREBP by itself is weak, but it is greatly enhanced by binding of the ubiquitous factor Sp1 to adjacent sites within this gene (53Freake H.C. Oppenheimer J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 54Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Sp1 also synergizes with SREBP in the activation of the fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase promoters (55Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 56Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Daniel and Kim (57Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have recently reported that Sp1 binding is also required for glucose activation of the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase promoter. Whether this Sp1 binding site is serving as an accessory factor to an undetected ChoRE or whether it is the binding site for the actual carbohydrate-responsive factor remains to be determined. Neither the S14 nor the L-PK promoter appears to contain binding sites for Sp1.The presence of CACGTG-type E boxes within the ChoRE strongly suggests that a member of the b/HLH/LZ family of transcription factors is involved in control. In particular, USF has emerged from this family as a candidate for the carbohydrate-responsive factor, based largely on its ability to bind to the S14 or L-PK ChoREs in vitro (22Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, we have found no evidence that USF is involved in the glucose regulation of the L-PK or S14 genes in vivo The expression of three different dominant negative forms of USF did not affect the carbohydrate response of either ChoRE in primary hepatocytes, although the same proteins were able to block the action of cotransfected USF2/VP16. This finding is in direct contradiction with that of Lefrançois-Martinez et al. (50Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This group found that a dominant negative form of USF1 similar to USF2ΔNΔb could block the L-PK glucose response in the glucose-responsive, hepatocyte-derived cell line mhAT3F. It is difficult at present to reconcile this contradiction. Several differences in the experimental strategies might be important. The use of the mhAT3F cell line versus primary hepatocytes constitutes a significant dissimilarity. While the extent of the differences between these two cells is unclear, they are certainly not identical. For example, as opposed to the primary hepatocyte, the glucose response in the mhAT3F cell is insulin-independent. This is apparently due to the fact that a hexokinase other than glucokinase is responsible for initiating the glycolytic process. Although not specifically known, it is also possible that the mhAT3F cells could contain less endogenous USF than the primary hepatocyte. If this were true, less dominant negative USF would be needed to inhibit the endogenous USF. Another significant difference in the experimental protocols is the time between transfection of the dominant negative USF forms and initiation of the glucose induction period. While we used 24 h in the present study, Lefrançois-Martinez et al. allowed a 72-h period. It may be that 72 h is needed to effectively sequester the endogenous USF pool and thus inhibit USF action. On the other hand, it is also conceivable that over 72 h the effective suppression of USF could lead to reduced expression of another transcription factor (e.g. HNF-1 or HNF-4) that is required for transcription of the L-PK promoter. In this way, the action of the dominant negative form of USF on the glucose response would be secondary rather than direct.Given these conflicting results, we sought an additional way in which the role of USF in the glucose response could be addressed. The correlation between USF binding and glucose responsiveness was examined in a set of ChoRE mutations. The identification of mutations that discriminate between USF binding and function argues against a role for USF. In particular, mutation of the fifth position of the CACGTG motifs to give CACGgG resulted in an increased response to glucose when tested in the context of S14 ChoRE sequences. This mutation was not activated by USF2/VP16 in cotransfection experiments and bound USF less tightly than the element containing CACGTG motifs by EMSA. This decreased binding was observed both for nuclear extract, which predominantly consists of USF1/USF2 heterodimers (36Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 47Viollet B. Lefrançois-Martinez A.-M. Henrion A. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Martinez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and recombinant USF1, which should be present as homodimers. Even more strikingly, alteration of each E box motif to CAtGcG resulted in a ChoRE that responded nearly as well as the CACGTG-containing ChoRE. As reported by Blackwell et al. (51Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), this sequence did not effectively bind USF either in cotransfection assays or by EMSA. Thus, a role of USF homodimers or heterodimers in glucose activation appears unlikely.It is worth noting that previous work from both our laboratory and others has shown that USF can bind to the PK ChoRE sequence (22Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the demonstration that USF activated expression of L-PK promoter constructs when cotransfected into mhAT3F cells. Our competition studies show, however, that this binding is of significantly lower affinity than that to the CACGTG motif. It is hard to reconcile a reduced binding affinity with a higher potential to activate transcription if USF is indeed"

G protein-coupled membrane receptors transduce the effects of TxA2. However, although a single thromboxane receptor (TP) gene has been identified, two splice variants have been cloned from human placenta and megakaryocytic lines (TPα) and from human endothelial cells (TPβ). These differ in the length of their carboxyl-terminal extensions (15 versus 79 residues), which contain multiple potential sites for receptor phosphorylation. Given that TP agonists activate protein kinase C (PKC), it would seem possible that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of TPs might play a central role in homologous desensitization of these receptors.To determine if the TP isoforms were differentially phosphorylated in response to agonist in vivo, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were stably transfected with TPα and TPβ. Isoform-specific anti-peptide antibodies were developed and used to immunoprecipitate the phosphorylated receptors. U46619, a PGH2/TxA2 mimetic, induced specific phosphorylation of both isoforms. Phosphorylation of the two isoforms was similar in dose and time dependence, reaching a plateau at around 100 nM U46619. Inhibition of PKC with either GF 109203X (5 μM) or RO 31-8220 (5 μM) or of protein kinase A with H-89 (50 μM) marginally influenced agonist-dependent phosphorylation of either isoform and failed to modulate homologous desensitization of agonist-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate formation. Similar results were obtained when PKC was down-regulated by long term incubation with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate. Although short term stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate caused PKC-dependent phosphorylation of TPs in vivo, thrombin stimulation of the TP-transfected HEK cells in vivo failed to phosphorylate either of the TP isoforms. Thus, despite the capacity of PKC to phosphorylate TPs in HEK 293 cells and the likely activation of PKC by TP stimulation, this enzyme, like protein kinase A, contributes marginally to rapid, agonist-induced phosphorylation of either TP isoform.

https://openalex.org/W2089344348,"The principal mechanism of homologous desensitization of the β-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is phosphorylation of the receptor by the βAR kinase (βARK) or other closely related G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). However, within a single organ such as the lung where many cell types express the receptor, the presence or extent of β2AR desensitization in different cells has been noted to be highly variable. We hypothesized that such variability in desensitization is due to significant cell-type differences in βARK expression and/or function. To approach this, in situ hybridization was carried out in the lung and indeed revealed heterogeneity in βARK gene expression. Quantitative studies using ribonuclease protection assays with cell lines revealed that the level of βARK mRNA in airway smooth muscle cells was ∼20% of that in bronchial epithelial cells and ∼11% of that in mast cells (6.65 ± 0.96 versus 32.6 ± 4.0 and 60.7 ± 1.5 relative units, respectively, p < 0.001). βARK2 gene expression was not detected in any of these cells. At the protein level, βARK expression in airway smooth muscle cells was nearly undetectable, being ∼10-fold less than that expressed on mast cells. The activities of the GRKs in cell extracts were assessed in vitro by quantitating their ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin in the presence of light. Consistent with the gene and protein expression results, a marked discrepancy in activities was observed between extracts derived from mast cells (90.7 ± 0.5 relative units) as compared to airway smooth muscle cells (9.28 ± 0.6 relative units, p < 0.001). In contrast, the activities of protein kinase A (the other kinase that phosphorylates β2AR) in these extracts were not different. We predicted, then, that airway smooth muscle β2AR would undergo minimal short-term (5 min) agonist-promoted desensitization as compared to the β2AR expressed on mast cells. Mast cell cAMP reached maximal levels after 90 s and did not further increase over time, indicative of receptor desensitization in this cell. In contrast, cAMP levels of airway smooth muscle cells did not plateau, increasing at a rate of 103 ± 9% per min, consistent with little desensitization over the study period. We conclude that there is significant cell-type variation in expression of βARK and that such variation is directly related to the extent of short-term agonist-promoted desensitization of the β2AR.

Many G protein-coupled receptors display a waning of signal transduction during continuous activation. This phenomenon, termed desensitization, is an important component in maintaining homeostasis under normal physiologic conditions, may contribute to or act to compensate in pathologic states, and may limit the effectiveness of therapeutic agonists (1Dohlman H.G.

Of the G protein-coupled receptors, desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) 1The abbreviations are: βARβ-adrenergic receptorβARKβAR kinaseGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseROSrod outer segments125I-CYP125I-cyanopindololPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPKAprotein kinase AMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidHASMhuman airway smooth muscle. has been one of the most extensively studied (2Liggett S.B.

Crystal R. West J.B. Weibel E.R. Barnes P.J. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Raven Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Agonist-promoted desensitization of β2AR has been demonstrated in in vitro reconstituted systems, a variety of naturally and recombinantly expressing cell lines, and in intact animals. The earliest component of agonist-promoted desensitization of the β2AR is phosphorylation of the receptor by a cAMP independent kinase, termed the βAR kinase (βARK). 2In this report, βARK refers to EC 2.7.1.126, which has also been termed βARK1 and GRK2 (7Benovic J.L. Deblasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 51Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski E. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). βARK2 refers to a related isoform which is also known as GRK3 (8Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14939-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such phosphorylation ultimately results in partial uncoupling of the agonist-occupied form of the receptor from the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, thereby limiting receptor function. Over the past few years, it has become clear that βARK is one of several related kinases that serve to phosphorylate the agonist-occupied forms of a number of G protein-coupled receptors (4Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 5Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This family of kinases, termed G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) consist of the following mammalian isoforms: rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), βARK (GRK2), βARK2 (GRK3), GRK4 (initially termed IT-11), and two kinases denoted as GRK5 and GRK6 (6Lorenz W.

The potential for these other kinases to phosphorylate β2AR has only been explored to a limited extent and their roles in agonist-promoted desensitization of the receptor at the cellular level are not well established. On the other hand, multiple lines of evidence (see “Discussion”) have definitively shown that βARK mediated phosphorylation represents a key process in homologous desensitization of the receptor. β-adrenergic receptor βAR kinase G protein-coupled receptor kinase rod outer segments 125I-cyanopindolol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein kinase A 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid human airway smooth muscle. While desensitization in the aforementioned model systems has been largely internally consistent, physiologic studies evaluating a variety of responses suggest that desensitization of β2AR may not occur at all, or to the same extent, in different organs or tissues. For example, repetitive administration of β2AR agonists to asthmatics appears to result in desensitization of responses thought to be mediated by the pulmonary mast cell β2AR, but not the bronchodilatory response of β2AR expressed on bronchial smooth muscle (12O'Connor B.J. Aikman S. Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1204-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and reviewed in 13Barnes P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 838-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for the apparent cell-type differences in β2AR desensitization is a heterogeneity in the expression of GRKs, such as βARK, which play critical roles in the desensitization process. The possibility of cell-specific expression of βARK within an organ has been largely unexplored, except for a single report in brain (14Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That differences in βARK expression can indeed alter βAR signal transduction has been demonstrated in recombinant cells overexpressing βARK (15Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in transgenic mice overexpressing βARK in the heart (16Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In the current study, we initially examined βARK gene expression in the lung and found significant differences in expression among different cell types. This was then further explored by quantitating βARK mRNA and protein expression in three human cell lines representing physiologically relevant functions in the lung: bronchial epithelial cells, mast cells, and airway smooth muscle cells. The BEAS-2B cell line was derived from normal human bronchial epithelial cells transformed by infection with Ad12-SV40 virus (17Reddel K.Y. Gerwin B.I. Miyashita M. McMenamin M. Lechner J.F. Harris C.C. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). BEAS-2B cells have the characteristics of epithelial cells by light and electron microscopy and stain positively for keratin (17Reddel K.Y. Gerwin B.I. Miyashita M. McMenamin M. Lechner J.F. Harris C.C. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BEAS-2B cells have a physiologic number of β2AR comparable to that of freshly dissociated human bronchial epithelial cells (18Penn R.B. Kelsen S.G. Benovic J.L. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The human mast cell line HMC-1 was derived from a patient with mast cell leukemia (19Butterfield J.H. Weiler D. Dewald G. Gleich G.J. Leuk. Res. 1988; 12: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and is the only established cell line that is phenotypically similar to normal human mast cells. On the basis of neutral protease contents (HMC-1 cells contain tryptase but not chymase) and other markers, HMC-1 cells resemble the MCT subset of human mast cells (20Nilsson G. Blom T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen I. Butterfield J.H. Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Hellman L. Scand. J. Immun. 1994; 39: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) which corresponds to the lung mast cell (21Irani A.A. Schechter N.M. Craig S.S. DeBlois G. Schwartz L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4464-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The airway smooth muscle line is a primary culture of smooth muscle obtained at autopsy from an individual without lung disease. These cells maintain their morphologic characteristics over several passages (22Green S.A. Turki J. Bejarano P. Hall I.P. Liggett S.B. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Marked differences in expression and activity of βARK were indeed observed, particularly between mast cells and airway smooth muscle, which was correlated to the extent of agonist-promoted desensitization. BEAS-2B cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 25 ng/ml epidermal cell growth factor, 5 μg/ml human transferrin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2. Primary cultures of human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, prepared as described previously (22Green S.A. Turki J. Bejarano P. Hall I.P. Liggett S.B. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2. HMC-1 cells were maintained as suspension cultures in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mML-glutamine at 37°C, 5% CO2. A template for the synthesis of βARK riboprobes was prepared by subcloning a 295-base pair EcoRI-SacI restriction fragment from the human βARK cDNA (23Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14924-14930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pGEM 4Z (Promega). For βARK2, an AvaI-HindIII restriction fragment from the bovine cDNA (8Benovic J.L. Onorato J.J. Arriza J.L. Stone W.C. Lohse M. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14939-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the same sites of pGEM 4Z. Orientation of subcloned fragments was confirmed by restriction analysis and dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with the appropriate restriction enzyme, and in vitro transcription reactions were carried out with either T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase to generate antisense or sense RNA probes. The probes were labeled with 35S-UTP for in situ hybridization experiments and [32P]UTP for ribonuclease protection assays. Frozen sections from cryoprotected, paraformaldehyde-fixed monkey lungs were subjected to in situ hybridization (24Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cryosections were rehydrated, treated with proteinase K, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated with acetic anhydride, and dehydrated. Sections were then incubated overnight at 52°C with hybridization solution that contained 5-7 × 104 cpm/μl of sense or antisense βARK riboprobe labeled with 35S-UTP. The sections were washed under high stringency conditions, treated with RNase A, subjected to a second high stringency wash, and dehydrated. Dried slides were dipped in Kodak NTB-2 autoradiographic emulsion and exposed at 4°C for 8 weeks. Expression of βARK and βARK2 mRNA was measured by ribonuclease protection assays (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Ockler M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: 7.71-7.78Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from BEAS-2B, HASM, and HMC-1 cells by the rapid acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed as previously reported (27McGraw D.W. Chai S.E. Hiller C. Cornett L.E. Exp. Lung Res. 1995; 21: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of total RNA and the riboprobes described above. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. Radiographic bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and conventional autoradiography. Quantitation of the phosphorimage was performed with the ImageQuant software package (Molecular Dynamics). The detection of βARK protein in whole cell lysates was carried out by standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting techniques as described previously (28Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), benzamidine (5 μg/ml), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 μg/ml)). The homogenates were diluted with 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schull). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris saline buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween, and then incubated with a monoclonal antibody raised against purified βARK diluted 1:200 in the blocking buffer. After washing with Tris saline/Tween buffer, the filters were incubated with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN). The radiographic film was scanned and quantitated using Scan Analysis (Biosoft). Cytosolic βARK activity was measured by phosphorylation of rhodopsin derived from rod outer segments (7Benovic J.L. Deblasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 246: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Urea-treated ROS were prepared from dark-adapted calf retinas by stepwise sucrose gradient centrifugation (29Wilden U. Kuhn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The ROS consisted of ∼90% rhodopsin as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining and had no significant endogenous kinase activity. To prepare cell lysates, HASM and HMC-1 cells were homogenized in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA buffer containing the aforementioned protease inhibitors. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were concentrated with a Centricon 10 cartridge (Amicon). For each phosphorylation reaction, 15 μg of cytosolic proteins were incubated with 85 pmol of rhodopsin in buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 6 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (∼2,000 cpm/pmol). Incubations were carried out in the presence of light for 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of cold 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mM EDTA buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in Lammeli sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed on a PhosphorImager for quantitation. Light dependence of the phosphorylation reaction was confirmed using purified βARK as a control (data not shown). One micromolar of the βARK inhibitor heparin (30Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1 μM of a protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (31Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or 1 μM of a protein kinase C inhibitor peptide (32Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were added to some reactions to confirm that rhodopsin phosphorylation was βARK-dependent. An assay that measures the phosphorylation of Kemptide (33Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a peptide substrate for PKA, was used to determine the phosphotransferase activity of PKA in extracts from HASM and HMC-1 cells. Cell lysates, prepared as described above, were incubated in a reaction mixture that contained 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mMβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 15 mM MgCl2, 125 μM [γ-32P]ATP (∼4,000 cpm/pmol), and 125 μM Kemptide for 10 min at 30°C. The reactions were stopped by spotting the assay mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose paper. The filters were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. Bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. PKA activity was defined as the amount of phosphate incorporated in the presence of 5 μM PKC inhibitor peptide (32Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes from HASM and HMC-1 cells were prepared and radioligand binding carried out as described previously (22Green S.A. Turki J. Bejarano P. Hall I.P. Liggett S.B. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 34Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) containing the aforementioned protease inhibitors, disrupted with a Polytron (Brinkman) homogenizer, and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of lysis buffer, centrifuged again, and resuspended in assay buffer (75 mM Tris, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). To determine total receptor density, membranes were incubated in a total volume of 250 μl at room temperature for 120 min with concentrations of 125I-CYP ranging from 3.125 to 400 pM. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μM propranolol. Assays were stopped by dilution with cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and vacuum filtration through Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters. The bound radioactivity was measured with a γ-counter. Competition experiments with 40 pM125I-CYP and varying concentrations of ICI 118,551 or CGP 20712A were also performed using the conditions described above to determine the proportion β2AR as compared to other βAR subtypes expressed on the membranes. Protein concentration was determined by the copper-bicinchoninic acid method (35Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin used as the standard. Data from the saturation binding and competition experiments were analyzed by nonlinear least squares techniques using the Prism software program (GraphPad). Curves were modeled to a one-site fit unless the two-site fit was significantly better (p < 0.5 by F test). cAMP content of HASM and HMC-1 cells was measured by an acetylated radioimmunoassay method. All cells were treated with 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min at 37°C, washed, and incubated in 500 μl of serum-free media at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1 μM isoproterenol or 100 μM forskolin for the indicated times. Reactions were stopped every 30 s by the addition of 50 μl of 1.0 M HCl. The cAMP formed was acetylated and measured by radioimmunoassay using a polyclonal anti-cAMP antibody as described (36Liggett S.B. Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. O'Dowd B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 641-646PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as a percentage of the nonstimulated values. Tissue culture supplies were purchased from JRH Biosciences. Radioisotopes were from DuPont NEN. ICI 118,551 was purchased from Research Biochemicals Int. CGP 20712A was a gift from Ciba Geigy. Heparin was from Sigma. PKA and PKC inhibitor peptides and Kemptide were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. HMC-1 cells were obtained from J. Butterfield, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. BEAS-2B cells were provided by C. Harris, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. GRK cDNAs, purified βARK, and the βARK antibody were provided by J. Benovic, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA. To examine the possibility that βARK is differentially expressed among different cell types within the lung, we performed in situ hybridization experiments using cryosections of monkey lung (Fig. 1). Panel A, a phase-contrast micrograph depicts the cellular architecture in a region of a moderate sized bronchus of the lung with some adjacent alveoli. Hybridization with the antisense βARK probe gave a specific signal that was greatest over bronchial epithelial cells and cells lining the alveolar space (Fig. 1B). A minimal signal was also present over bronchial smooth muscle. No specific signal was detected when sections were hybridized with the sense probe (data not shown). To assess βARK expression in a more quantitative fashion, we performed ribonuclease protection assays using RNA from three human cell types that are physiologically relevant to lung function and are targets for therapeutic β-agonists: airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), airway smooth muscle cells (HASM), and mast cells (HMC-1). Although a band corresponding to the 295-base pair fragment expected for βARK mRNA could be detected in all three cell types, there was a substantial difference in the level of expression among the different cell types (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the gels showed that βARK mRNA content in HASM cells (6.65 ± 0.96 relative units) was only ∼11% of that in HMC-1 cells (60.7 ± 1.5 relative units, n = 4, p < 0.001) and ∼17% of that in epithelial cells (32.6 ± 4.1 relative units, n = 4, p < 0.001). We also used ribonuclease protection assays to assess βARK2 gene expression in these cell lines. Although a strong band was observed in the positive control, no significant signal for βARK2 was detected in BEAS-2B, HASM, or HMC-1 cells (Fig. 2B). We subsequently focused our experiments on the role of βARK in regulating β2AR desensitization in these cell types. We next measured βARK protein content by Western blotting. A distinct band with a molecular mass of ∼80 kDa corresponding to βARK was detected in BEAS-2B, HASM, and HMC-1 cell extracts (Fig. 3). βARK levels were lowest in HASM cells (6.2 ± 1.3 relative units), as compared to that of HMC-1 cells (56.5 ± 3.5 relative units, n = 3, p < 0.001) and that of BEAS-2B cells (37.3 ± 5.0 relative units, n = 3, p < 0.001). Thus βARK protein expression closely paralled mRNA levels in the three subtypes, with HASM cells expressing about one-tenth the level of βARK as compared to HMC-1 cells and one-fifth of that of BEAS-2B cells. To confirm the above observations and to determine if increased βARK content resulted in increased kinase activity in vitro, we measured the ability of extracts from HASM and HMC-1 cells to phosphorylate ROS (Fig. 4). Initial studies were carried out to assure the specificity of the reactions for assessing GRK-mediated phosphorylation by the use of purified bovine βARK and various inhibitors. Using purified βARK, light dependence of ROS phosphorylation was demonstrated (data not shown). βARK-dependent phosphorylation was then assessed by carrying out reactions in the presence of heparin (1 μM), a PKA inhibitor peptide (1 μM), or a PKC inhibitor peptide (1 μM). ROS phosphorylation was blocked by the βARK inhibitor heparin in both cell types, whereas inhibitors of PKC and PKA had no effect (Fig. 4A). Using this in vitro assay, we determined the activities of extracts from both cell types (Fig. 4B). As can be seen, there were marked differences in activities, with the kinase activity of HMC-1 cells being nearly 10-fold greater (90.7 ± 0.6 relative units) than that of HASM cells (9.2 ± 0.6 relative units, n = 4, p < 0.001). We also assessed protein kinase A activities in these extracts since this kinase also phosphorylates β2AR in response to elevated cAMP, and any cell-type differences might confound interpretation of functional desensitization studies. In contrast to the marked differences in βARK activities between the two cell types, PKA activities from extracts of HASM and HMC-1 cells were not different (Fig. 5).Fig. 5PKA activity in HASM and HMC-1 cells. PKA activity was defined as the phosphorylation of Kemptide in the presence of a PKC inhibitor peptide. Results are reported as the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. PKA ac"

In all three cases, the major component of the extracellular debris is the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) that is derived from the proteolytic processing of the large membrane-anchored amyloid precursor protein (APP) encoded by a single gene located on chromosome 21 (1Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyruther K. Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of these amyloid deposits has been extensively debated as to whether they are a causative factor of each disease or merely a metabolically inert end product lacking in biological activity. Evidence in support of a causative role for Aβ in neuropathology comes from genetic analysis of the APP gene where several autosomal dominant mutations have been linked with AD and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with the Dutch type (2Selkoe D.J. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 3Schellenberg G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8552-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In a recent in vitro study, the β-APP717 mutation consistently caused a significant increase in the percentage of the longer and more amyloidogenic Aβ1-42 over the shorter Aβ1-40 (4Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos L.J. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Incorporation of this same mutation into a transgenic mouse model yields Aβ deposition and neuropathology that closely parallels that observed in AD (5Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). Additional in vivo evidence suggesting that the Aβ peptide itself may be biologically active comes from a transgenic model overexpressing Aβ1-42, in which Aβ transgene expression was detected in a variety of peripheral tissues but histopathological changes were restricted to the brain. Moreover, the neurodegeneration was largely limited to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, all areas affected in AD, and was essentially undetectable in the cerebellum, which is typically not affected in AD (6LaFerla F.M. Tinkle B.T. Bieberich C.J. Haudenschild C.C. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Finally, the amount of β-amyloid that accumulates in the brain appears to correlate well with the decline of brain function (7Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W. Lancet. 1995; 346: 1524-1528Abstract PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).

Insights into the inherent biological activity associated with Aβ have come from in vitro studies that show synthetic Aβ can spontaneously assemble into β-sheet-containing fibrils (8Kirschner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 9Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that this fibrillar-Aβ can induce neuritic dystrophy in neuronal cultures similar to that seen in the AD brain, and that the mechanism of Aβ-triggered degeneration is via programmed cell death (PCD) (10Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the general hypothesis that the biological activity of Aβ is dependent on its transformation into a highly stable protease-resistant antiparallel β-sheet conformation and higher order quaternary assemblies (11Cotman C.W. Anderson A.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 19-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) similar to those found in senile plaques. This is of fundamental importance because it suggests that the biological activity of Aβ is dependent on protein conformation and the transition into this conformation. The consequences of such a relationship between biological activity and protein conformation are critical to understanding the role of Aβ and other β-pleated sheet protein assemblies such as prion protein in disease. In order to understand the degenerative processes induced by Aβ, it is essential to define the characteristics of Aβ salient to its function as a neurotoxic stimulus. In a previous study, we used a series of synthetic Aβ peptides with progressively truncated C-termini to demonstrate that the length of this hydrophobic region is a crucial determinant of peptide ability to both aggregate and induce neurotoxicity in vitro (12Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also synthesized a series of truncated Aβ peptides to examine the effects of N-terminal heterogeneity, which occurs in vivo on the assembly and biological activity of Aβ. The N-terminal truncated isoforms produced enhanced aggregation into neurotoxic β-sheet fibrils, which suggests that these truncated peptides may initiate the pathological neurodegeneration in AD by acting as a nucleation site for Aβ deposition (13Pike C.J. Overman M.J. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23895-23898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus far, we have observed that assembled, bioactive Aβ peptides exhibit β-sheet structure and that amino acid substitutions that disrupt Aβ assembly also prevent β-sheet structure and abolish toxicity (14Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Further analysis of peptides will be useful in elucidating the specific requirements for both the assembly and bioactivity of Aβ. Since numerous ligand-target interactions are stereospecific, one means to both examine the nature of the Aβ-cellular interactions and assess the validity of several proposed mechanisms of Aβ-induced cell death is to determine whether Aβ bioactivity exhibits stereospecificity. Similar issues of ligand stereospecificity have been investigated in several recent studies by comparing the binding and or activities of D- and L-enantiomers of small peptide ligands (15Nomizu M. Utani A. Shiraishi N. Kibbey M.C. Yamada Y. Roller P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14118-14121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fisher P.J. Prendergast F.G. Ehrhardt M.R. Urbauer J.L. Wand A.J. Sedarous S.S. McCormick D.J. Buckley P.J. Nature. 1994; 368: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have utilized a comparable paradigm, synthesizing the all-D- and all-L-amino acid stereoisomers of the truncated biologically active Aβ25-35 and the full-length Aβ1-42 peptide, and compared their physical and biological properties to determine whether the interaction of Aβ with biologically relevant cells is stereospecific. Aβ1-42, Aβ25-35 (GSNKGAIIGLM), and scrambled sequence Aβ25-35 (12Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized from either all-D- or all-L- amino acids using solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid chemistry and purified by reverse phase HPLC, as described previously (9Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified peptides were then routinely analyzed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (9Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The all-D-Aβ25-35 and -Aβ1-42 enantiomers gave mass values of 1060.4 and 4513.9, respectively. HPLC analysis of the all-D-enantiomers produced identical elution times to the all-L-Aβ peptides, and mixtures of all-D-Aβ1-42 and all-L-Aβ25-35 produced a single peak by HPLC. Peptides were solubilized in sterile double deionized water as 2.5 mM stock solutions and allowed to aggregate at room temperature for at least 1 h before using. Aliquots of the peptide stocks were then diluted with an equal volume of 2× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and then with DMEM supplemented with N-2 (17Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) just prior to treating the cultures. The mean residue ellipticity of Aβ25-35 peptides (25 μM in 5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.3) was determined using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a computerized data processor, as described previously (14Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded into a 1.0-cm path length quartz cell and measured over a 190-250-nm wavelength range at 0.5 nm increments. Data from eight scans were averaged and subtracted from base-line values but otherwise are unsmoothed. The instrument was calibrated with a 0.06% (w/v) solution of d-camphorsulfonate. For ultrastructural analysis, 25 μM samples of Aβ peptides (20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.4) were adsorbed onto 200 mesh formvar grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate prior to viewing with a Zeiss 10CR transmission electron microscope at 80 kV transmission (14Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Levels of peptide aggregation were quantitatively determined using a sedimentation assay previously described (14Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ25-35 peptides (25 μM in 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.3) were ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g Supernatant peptide concentrations between centrifuged and non-centrifuged samples were compared by fluorescamine assay. Decreased supernatant peptide concentration in centrifuged samples was used as a measure of the aggregated peptide fraction. Analyses were conducted in quadruplicate samples. Cultures of hippocampal neurons from gestational day 18 rat pups were prepared as described previously (12Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 on poly-L-lysine-treated multiwell plates and maintained in serum-free DMEM supplemented with N-2 components. After two days in vitro, cultures were exposed to the various Aβ peptides for 24 h, after which cell viability was determined on the basis of trypan blue exclusion (12Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Raw data were statistically compared by analysis of variance followed by Scheffé f-test. The initial experiments to investigate whether an all-D-enantiomer of an amyloidogenic peptide retains biological activity were performed with all-D-Aβ25-35. This is the smallest commonly studied fragment of Aβ that retains both the ability to form β-sheet-containing fibrils and neurotoxicity (19Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). An additional advantage of Aβ25-35 is that it can be modeled relatively easily, and information on the alignment of the antiparallel strands as well as the importance of various side chain interactions in formation of the Aβ fibrils and in defining the surface topography necessary for neurotoxicity can be investigated. In the antiparallel β-sheet conformation, the surface topography is determined by the amino acid sequence and the alignment of adjacent strands in the β-sheet. In a computer-generated model of Aβ25-35 in which the two peptides are maximally overlapped, a cluster of positively charged lysine residues is observed on one face of the β-sheet while the other face of the β-sheet contains primarily hydrophobic residues. Previous studies with Aβ25-35 containing single amino acid substitutions have confirmed the importance of the sequence for retaining the properties of Aβ (14Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Two separate lots of the all-D-Aβ25-35 were synthesized to control for lot to lot variability in the biological activity of the peptides. Comparison of the all-D and all-L forms of Aβ25-35 by electrospray mass spectroscopy gave essentialy identical mass values, and HPLC analysis showed that the two enantiomers had similar elution times. Mixed samples of both enantiomers eluted as a single peak from the HPLC (Fig. 1A). All-D-Aβ25-35 was allowed to assemble in parallel with the all-L-Aβ25-35, and then both peptides were subjected to a series of commonly used assays to monitor the properties of fibrillar Aβ. Both enantiomers rapidly produced visible aggregates in aqueous solution (Fig. 2, A-D), and analysis of negatively stained specimens by electron microscopy showed similar fibrillar structures (Fig. 1, B and C). Sedimentation analysis was then used to compare the extent of peptide assembly for both enantiomers. Three different lots of the all-L-Aβ25-35 and two lots of the all-D-Aβ25-35 were used, and both forms gave similar results (data not shown). The above results show that both peptides have similar physical properties and can only be distinguished by CD analysis where mirror image spectra are generated (data not shown).Fig. 2Comparison of the cellular association and neurotoxic activities of the all-L- and all-D-enantiomers of Aβ25-35. Primary cultures of rat neurons were treated with pre-assembled forms of the enantiomers of Aβ25-35. Numerous visible fibrillar aggregates (arrows) of the all-L-Aβ25-35 (A and B) and all-D-Aβ25-35 (C and D) can been seen associated with the neurites at 6 h post-treatment with 6 μM Aβ25-35. At higher magnification (B and D), the fuzzy appearing fibrillar aggregates can been seen decorating the swollen degenerating neurites. Dose response curves were generated to compare the relative neurotoxic activities of the two Aβ25-35 enantiomers (E). The all-L- and all-D-Aβ25-35 produced similar dose response curves. Scrambled sequences of all-L- and all-D-peptides were not neurotoxic even at 50 μM (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The biological properties of the two enantiomers were then tested by applying the enantiomers to primary cultures of rat hippocampal and cortical neurons that have previously been used to assay the neurotoxic activity of Aβ (12Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pike C.J. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1991; 563: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The all-D-Aβ25-35 produced visible aggregates in the tissue culture wells and appeared to bind to the surface of neurons equally as well as the all-L-Aβ25-35 (Fig. 2, A-D). Noticeable neuronal degeneration was apparent at 12 h, and extensive cell death was observed at 24 h for both enantiomers. In order to compare the levels of neurotoxicity between the two enantiomers, a dose response curve was generated. As can be seen in Fig. 2E, the all-D-Aβ25-35 produced similar toxicity to the all-L-Aβ25-35 over the entire range of concentrations tested. The specificity of the neurotoxicity was determined by analyzing peptides with scrambled sequences of both the all-L and the all-D enantiomers. Neither scrambled sequence produced detectable neurotoxicity over the entire range of concentrations utilized for the dose response curve (data not shown). During the comparison of computer-generated models of Aβ25-35 in antiparallel β-sheet conformation, we discovered, that with perfect alignment of the individual strands of peptide, that a pseudo-axis of symmetry was generated do to the planar nature of the β-sheet such that the distribution of the surface groups produced topochemically similar enantiomers. Other cases of topochemically similar peptides that bind to stereoselective receptors and posses similar activities have been reported (20Shemyakin M.M. Ovchinnikov Yu.A. Ivanov V.T. Evstratov A.V. Nature. 1967; 213: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Blanc J.P. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9549-9556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the high level of bioactivity associated with the all-D-Aβ25-35, we next determined whether the all-D-enantiomer of the full-length Aβ1-42 peptide would also bind to cells and produce similar neurotoxicity to the all-L-Aβ1-42. Although the β-sheet-containing fibrils of the Aβ1-42 are predicted to form planar sheets, the longer length of the Aβ1-42 peptide would reduce the probability of formation of topochemically similar enantiomers since the surface topography of Aβ1-42 would be far more complex than with Aβ25-35. Highly purified all-D-Aβ1-42 was subjected to CD, and the spectra were compared with the all-L-Aβ1-42 (Fig. 3A). The all-D-enantiomer produced the expected mirror image spectra, indicating similar secondary structure for the enantiomers. The peptides were then examined by electron microscopy, and, while the filamentous structures were different from those observed with Aβ25-35, the Aβ1-42 enantiomers produced fibrils that were indistinguishable from each other (Fig. 3, B and C). The ability to bind certain dyes, such as Congo red and thioflavine T, is a characteristic property of amyloidogenic peptides (22Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 23Naiki H. Higuchi K. Matsushima K. Shimada A. Chen W.H. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 768-773PubMed Google Scholar, 24Naiki H. Higuchi K. Nakakuki K. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 104-110PubMed Google Scholar) and can be used to measure the amount of peptide in β-sheet-containing fibrils (25Levine III, H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Analysis of assembled peptides of both enantiomers indicates that the all-D-Aβ1-42 binds thioflavine with intensity equal to that of the all-L-Aβ1-42 (data not shown). The biological response to the full-length all-D-Aβ1-42 by neurons was assayed as described above for Aβ25-35. The all-D-enantiomer clearly binds to the neurons since clusters of the fibrillar Aβ1-42 can be seen over much of the cell surface within 6 h of adding the peptide to the cultures (Fig. 4, C and D). Perhaps more importantly, the fibrillar clusters induce extensive neurodegeneration over a 24-h time course. It should be noted that not all neurons respond equally to fibrillar forms of Aβ, as previous studies have shown that neurons that are immunopositive for GABA are resistant to the neurotoxic activity of Aβ (26Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Neuroscience. 1993; 56: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A comparison of the relative neurotoxicity of the two Aβ1-42 enantiomers is shown in the dose response curves in Fig. 4E Both enantiomers produce noticeable neurotoxic activity at 5 μM, and at 25 μM, approximately half of the neurons are dead within 24 h. This study was designed to probe the stereospecificity of the interaction between Aβ and the plasma membrane of cultured neurons that in vitro leads to programmed cell death (10Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 27Forloni G. Chiesa R. Smiroldo S. Verga L.

Brain Res. 1994; 661: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). According to classic receptor pharmacology, a D-stereoisomer of an amino acid or peptide would not be predicted to exhibit bioactivity comparable with the native L-peptide. For example, glutamate receptors readily discriminate L- versus D-antagonistic agents (29Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). We have analyzed both the physical and biological properties of the all-D-enantiomers of Aβ25-35 and Aβ1-42 and have compared them with their corresponding all-L-enantiomers. With the exception of the CD spectropolarimetry study, which produced mirror image spectrums, both all-D-enantiomers exhibited essentially identical physical and biological properties to their all-L-enantiomers. A number of studies have been done utilizing D-enantiomers of various ligands to investigate the stereospecific requirements for binding to their respective receptor proteins. In the cases of three peptide hormones, bradykinin (30Stewart J.M. Woolley D.W. Nature. 1965; 206: 619-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), oxytocin (31Flouret G. Du Vigneaud V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 3775-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and angiotensin (32Vogler K. Lanz P. Lergier W. Haefely W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1966; 49: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), that must interact with chiral receptors on the plasma membrane, the all-D-forms of the ligands were inactive. However, different results were obtained in the case of a synthetic β-endorphin analog that contained 18 D-amino acid residues in the C-terminal portion of the peptide but 5 L-residues within the actual binding site. The all-D-containing region was designed to form a left-handed amphiphilic helical segment that was topochemically similar to the native right-handed amphiphilic helix. The D/L chimeric peptide retained equal ability to bind and to activate the opiate receptor (21Blanc J.P. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9549-9556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the all-D-peptide enantiomers can still resemble the parent compound, both in the overall spatial arrangements and with respect to the electronic nature of the functional groups. In the case of the antibiotic enniatin B, the topochemically similar enantio-enniatin B possessed similar antimicrobial activity (20Shemyakin M.M. Ovchinnikov Yu.A. Ivanov V.T. Evstratov A.V. Nature. 1967; 213: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In two recent studies for example, the all-D-peptide analogs were found to bind with similar affinities to their respective receptors. In the first one, two all-D-amphiphilic helical peptides were shown to interact with calmodulin in a sterically malleable fashion (16Fisher P.J. Prendergast F.G. Ehrhardt M.R. Urbauer J.L. Wand A.J. Sedarous S.S. McCormick D.J. Buckley P.J. Nature. 1994; 368: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and the second example reported that the laminin segment containing the IKVAV amino acid sequence, which is responsible for cell attachment and tumor-promoting activities, was retained in the all-D-peptide. Peptide analogs with either alternating D-L-substitutions or randomized IKVAV sequence were inactive, indicating that the sequence and conformational status of the domain contribute to the biological activity but that no stereospecific requirement exists (15Nomizu M. Utani A. Shiraishi N. Kibbey M.C. Yamada Y. Roller P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14118-14121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although bilayer lipids and membranes are also chiral and contain numerous asymmetric centers, the partitioning of chiral channel-forming antibiotic peptides into membranes does not require a specific chirality. The all-D-analogs of cecropin, magainin II amide, and melittin were equally effective when tested on achiral synthetic planar bilayers and as antibiotics against bacteria containing chiral membranes (34Wade D. Boman A. Wahlin B. Drain C.M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4761-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The reports that Aβ1-40 forms giant multivalent cation channels when incorporated into synthetic bilayers (35Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 36Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and our findings that the neurotoxic activity associated with both Aβ25-35 and Aβ1-42 are not chirally dependent are consistent with the results obtained with the channel-forming antibiotic peptides. Unfortunately, after many years of extensive study on Aβ, there is no definitive evidence that Aβ forms channels in neurons. Another more likely possibility is that Aβ is active as a membrane perturbant, which may alter the microenvironment between the bilayer and membrane-bound enzymes or receptors. We currently favor a mechanism dependent on the interaction of Aβ with membrane receptor proteins on the surface of neurons, and other cell types such as astrocytes, because assembled fibrillar forms of the amyloidogenic peptides are required for activity (12Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G.

Pharmacol. 1991; 207: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It is possible, for example, that Aβ acts as a ligand to cross-link receptors at the cell surface and activates cell death pathways via activation-induced cell death similar to Fas (38Cotman C.W. Cribbs D.H. Anderson A.J. Tanzi R. Wasco W.M. The Molecular Mechanisms for Dementia.The Humana Press. 1997; : 73-90Google Scholar). Consistent with a mechanism involving membrane receptors, we have shown that the lectin ConA, which forms clusters of membrane glycoproteins on the cell surface, also causes neurodegeneration and apoptotic death in cultured neurons similar to that observed with Aβ while succinyl ConA, which binds but does not cross-link, is inactive (39Cribbs D.H. Kreng V.M. Anderson A.J. Cotman C.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, Burdick, et al. (40Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Knauer M.F. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a substantial portion of the Aβ that binds to cells can be removed by treatment with trypsin and several receptors that appear to bind Aβ peptides have been identifed (41Boland K.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6021-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), some evidence has been presented that it may be directly involved in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (45Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H. Roher A. Slattery T. Zhao L. Nagashima M. Morser J. Migheli A. Nawroth P. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar). Experiments with all-D-Aβ and these putative Aβ receptors are in progress and should provide information on the specificity of these receptors for Aβ. Thus, we suggest that extracellular macromolecular assemblies such as Aβ can serve as stimuli or agonists that trigger a particular sequence of cellular reactions in neurons that initiate an apoptotic program of cell death. These PCD agonists are characterized in part by β-sheet fibrillar structure but, in addition, have the common ability to access critical signal transduction and downstream mechanisms that drive PCD. Other amyloidogenic proteins, which do not share sequence homology with Aβ (e.g. prion and amylin), do form structurally similar extracellular deposits and have been found to have similar neurotoxic activity in vitro (47Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 48May P.C. Boggs L.N. Fuson K.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2330-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism that could explain the common biological activity seen with different amyloidogenic peptides is β-sheet augmentation, whereby a peptide forms a “peptide-surface association” (49Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) either by inserting itself into a β-sheet-containing domain (50Banzon J.A. Kelly J.W. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which has been proposed for other diseases involving protein conformational changes (51Carrell R.W. Whisstock J. Lomas D.A. Amer. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 171-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar–54Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), or by adding to the edge of an anti-parallel β-strand, as has been implicated in regulating protein associations governing signal transduction pathways and assembly interactions in certain viral capsids (49Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The β-sheet augmentation mechanism provides much greater flexibility than classical domain-domain association because the peptide is not constrained by a rigidly folded domain. The specificity in this model is dependent on the ability of the peptide to augment an appropriate β-strand on a protein. Consistent with this model, Aβ has shown a pronounced ability to bind to other proteins, such as α-1-antichymotrypsin, and transthyretin which are rich in β-sheet. Finally, the cell surface contains numerous proteins with Ig superfamily homology with extensive β-sheet content, which include receptors (55Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) and cell adhesion molecules (i.e. NCAM and N-cadherin) (56Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in several reports, the cell surface appears to be able to actually nucleate Aβ assembly (40Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Knauer M.F. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 57Busciglio J. Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 58Davis-Salinas J. Saporito-Irwin S.M. Cotman C.W. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which is also consistent with the model (49Harrison S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The fact that the all-D analogs of Aβ retain bioactivity may present new avenues for therapeutic intervention by allowing the D-enantiomers of inhibitory peptides to be utilized. An approach similar to this has recently been used to identify an all-D-amino acid opioid peptide with analgesic activity capable of crossing the blood brain barrier using a synthetic combinatorial library made up of D-amino acid hexapeptides (59Dooley C.T. Chung N.N. Wilkes B.C. Schiller P.W. Bidlack J.M. Pasternak G.W. Houghten R.A. Science. 1994; 266: 2019-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, the identification of D-peptide ligands through mirror image phage display using genetically encoded libraries (60Schumacher T.N.M. Mayr L.M. Minor Jr., D.L. Milhollen M.A. Burgess M.W. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) offers the promise of rapidly screening for D-peptide ligands that can block assembly and or neurotoxicity of the Aβ peptide. All-D-ligands are generally resistant to proteolysis and D-amino acid proteins are reported to have low immunogenicity, thus making them useful for pharmacological applications (61Dintzis H.M. Symer D.E. Dintzis R.Z. Zawadzke L.E. Berg J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study suggest that the neurotoxic activity of Aβ is independent of the classical stereoisomer-specific ligand-receptor interaction. Rather, Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is dependent on the primary sequence of the peptide that regulates both the ability of the peptides to assemble into active conformations and bind to cellular surfaces. While mechanisms dependent on the perturbation of cellular membranes or the formation of calcium ion channels cannot be excluded, the requirement for higher order protein assemblies by amyloidogenic peptides for biological activity does not readily support these mechanisms. Further investigation of the mechanism of Aβ-induced toxicity will likely benefit attempts to understand the neurodegeneration that occurs in AD and perhaps other amyloid-related disorders. We thank Virany Kreng for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Charles Glabe for synthesis and characterization of the amyloid peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2064167816,"The stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in L6 cultured skeletal muscle cells is inhibited by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of dexamethasone action by determining its effects on the expression of the p85α and p85β regulatory subunit isoforms of PI 3-kinase, their coupling with the p110 catalytic subunit, and their association with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in response to IGF-I stimulation. Dexamethasone induced a 300% increase in p85α protein content in the L6 cultured myoblast cell line, whereas it increased p110 content by only 38% and had no effect on p85β. The increase in p85α protein was associated with a coordinate increase in p85α mRNA. Stimulation with IGF-I induced the association of p85α and p85β with IRS-1, and this was accompanied by increased amounts of the p110 catalytic subunit and markedly increased PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. In cells treated with dexamethasone, greater amounts of p85α and lower amounts of p85β, respectively, were found in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, such that the α/β ratio was markedly higher than in control cells. In spite of the increase in both total and IRS-1-associated p85α following dexamethasone treatment, IRS-1-associated p110 catalytic subunit and PI 3-kinase activity were decreased by approximately 50%. Thus, dexamethasone induces a specific increase in expression of the p85α regulatory subunit that is not associated with a coordinate increase in the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. As a consequence, in dexamethasone-treated cells, p85α that is not coupled with p110 competes with both p85α·p110 and p85β·p110 complexes for association with IRS-1, leading to increased p85α but decreased p85β, p110, and PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates."

Despite its compromised ability to extend mispairs, the Y766S polymerase and a Y766A mutant both have elevated base substitution error rates. The magnitude of the mutator effect is mispair-specific, from no effect for some mispairs to rates elevated by 60-fold for misincorporation of TMP opposite template G. The results with the Y766S mutant are remarkably consistent with the earlier kinetic analysis of misinsertion, demonstrating that either approach can be used to identify and characterize mutator polymerases. Both the Y766S and Y766A mutant polymerases are also frameshift mutators, having elevated rates for two-base deletions and a 276-base deletion between a direct repeat sequence. However, neither mutant polymerase has an increased error rate for single-base frameshifts in repetitive sequences. This error specificity suggests that the deletions generated by the mutator polymerases are initiated by misinsertion rather than by strand slippage.

This dominant-negative effect of kinase-deficient PKCδ can be explained by the titration of an effector, substrate, or receptor molecule(s) that binds stably to PKCδ. The stable interaction of PKC and its substrate has been demonstrated by using MARCKS, a well characterized PKC substrate (10Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A.C. Jaken S.

Here we describe a clone encoding as sdr-related gene product named SRBC, which serves as a substrate for PKCδ and whose expression is induced by serum starvation of NIH3T3 cells or differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. PKCδ was purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells as described elsewhere (11Fujise A. Mizuno K. Ueda Y. Osada S. Hirai S. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Owada M.K. Nakajima H. Ohno S. J.

Briefly, 3 days after infection, Sf21 cells were lysed, and PKCδ was purified by a series of chromatographic steps on DEAE-cellulose (Tosoh), hydroxyapatite (Koken), and MonoQ (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) columns. No additional proteins were obvious in the final PKCδ fraction as judged by SDS-PAGE, and the specific activity was 380 units/mg. One unit of PKCδ activity was defined as 1 nmol of 32P incorporated into a myelin basic protein (MBP4-14) peptide per min in a reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 50 ng/ml TPA, 20 μM ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.). Purified PKCδ (400 ng) was labeled with 32P by autophosphorylation in 155 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.6 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 40 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 400 ng/ml TPA at 30°C for 2 h. After the reaction, 32P-labeled PKCδ was separated from unreacted ATP by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and used as a probe for screening a λEXlox cDNA expression library. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells, and randomly primed cDNA was synthesized using HindIII primer adapter (Novagen). cDNA was ligated to λEXlox vector arm (Novagen) and packaged in phage particles using a Phage Marker System (Novagen). This library contains approximately 0.95 × 106 independent clones. Approximately 2 × 105 clones were plated at 10,000 phages per plate using Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysE as host cells. After incubation for 6 h at 37°C, the plaques were covered with Hybond-C extra (Amersham Corp.) impregnated with 10 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for an additional 3.5 h at 37°C. The filters were then washed with TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl), blocked with 5% skim milk at 4°C overnight, and incubated with 1 mM ATP solution (TBS buffer containing 1 mM ATP) at room temperature for 2 h to saturate any auto-phosphorylation sites or ATP-binding sites of the proteins. The filters were then incubated with 32P-labeled PKCδ (106 cpm/ml) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 h at room temperature. After washing in TBS buffer, the filters were exposed for autoradiography. Positive phage clones were converted to plasmids (pEXlox + cDNA insert) using E. coli strain BM25.5 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A cDNA insert was used as a probe to screen a 3Y1-λZAP II cDNA library to obtain cDNA clones encoding the full SRBC coding sequence. Plaque hybridization with a λZAP II cDNA library and the isolation of positive phage clones were performed according to standard procedures. PKCδ-binding proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes, and treated with a 5% skim milk solution. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out by incubating the PVDF membranes with phosphorylation buffer (83 ng/ml PKCδ, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 400 ng/ml TPA, and 2.4 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with TBS containing 1% SDS buffer, the membranes were exposed for autoradiography. Overlay assay was performed based on the procedure of Wolf and Sahyoun (23Wolf M. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13327-13332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKCδ-binding proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. After treatment with a 5% skim milk solution, the PVDF membrane was incubated with 32P-labeled PKCδ (106 cpm/ml) diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 5 h. Excess ligand was removed by washing the PVDF membrane with TBS buffer, and the membrane was exposed for autoradiography. Protein-blotted PVDF membrane was overlaid with 20 μg/ml [14C]phosphatidylserine (specific activity = 1 μCi/15 μg, Amersham Corp.) diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Membrane was washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed for autoradiography. cDNAs encoding mouse PKCδ and its deletion mutant (lacking amino acid residues 299-654, 209-654, and 111-654) were subcloned into E. coli expression vector pMAL-c2 (New England BioLabs) for expression of these proteins as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein (MBP-PKCδ, MCD299, MCD209, and MCD111). The proteins were purified on amylose resin (New England BioLabs) and used as probes for the overlay assay. The protein-transferred PVDF membrane was incubated with 0.7 μM MBP-PKCδ or 1 μM MCD299, MCD209, or MCD111 in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane with TBS buffer, bound protein was fixed by incubation with 0.5% formaldehyde. Excess formaldehyde was removed by washing with 2% glycine, and MBP fusion proteins were detected using anti-MBP antibody (New England BioLabs), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody (TAGO, Inc.), and artificial substrate for alkaline phosphatase (VECTOR). An E. coli expression vector for GST-SRBC was constructed using expression vector pGEX-3X (Pharmacia) and cDNA encoding SRBC, and the fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The reaction mixture contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 ng/ml TPA, 25 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 3.74 ng of PKCδ, and various concentrations of GST-SRBC proteins in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μM ATP and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32 P]ATP and incubated at 30°C. After 5 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5 × Laemmli's SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE, and the 32P incorporated in the GST-SRBC protein was quantified using a Bio-Image analyzer (BAS 2000 FUJI). An expression vector for tag-SRBCδ15 (SRHis-SRBC) encodes a SRBC protein whose N-terminal 15 amino acids are replaced by six histidine residues and a 12-amino acid sequence from the T7 gene 10 leader sequence derived from pBLUE Bac (Invitrogen). The PKCδ expression plasmid (M241) was described previously (6Mizuno K. Kubo K. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Osada S. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). COS1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and seeded 24 h before transfection at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/6-cm dish. Transfection by calcium phosphate co-precipitation was carried out for 6 h using the appropriate expression vectors, as described in the figure legends. The culture medium was then changed to serum-deprived DMEM to starve the cells. After 48 h, the medium was changed to phosphate-free DMEM, and the cells were further incubated for 2 h. The cells were then incubated in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (125 μCi/ml) for 4 h prior to stimulation. After treatment for 10 min with TPA (50 ng/ml) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) alone, the cells (in 6-cm dishes) were harvested and suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. After 30 min incubation on ice, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and incubated with anti-T7-tag antibodies (Novagen) preabsorbed with Protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia), for 1 h at 4°C. The immunocomplexes on Sepharose were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and 2 times with final wash buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with anti-T7 antibody to estimate the amount of tag-SRBC precipitated. The amount of 32P incorporated into tag-SRBC was measured by a Bio-Image analyzer (BAS 2000 FUJI). NIH3T3 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For serum starvation, the medium was changed to 0.5% FCS when the cells were still subconfluent. For serum stimulation, fresh medium containing 20% FCS was added to the starved cells. Cells were harvested at the desired times for RNA isolation. Differentiation of P19 cells was performed following a standard procedure (24Scheibe R.J. Moeller-Runge I. Mueller W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21300-21305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Akimoto K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Hirai S. Tanuma S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12677-12683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia), and Northern blot analysis was performed according to the standard protocol. A mouse NIH3T3-λEXlox expression library was screened for proteins that bind to PKCδ in the presence of phosphatidylserine. Using 32P-labeled PKCδ as a probe, two clones, clone 53 and 91, that appeared to originate from the same mRNA were isolated. To isolate full-length cDNAs, a rat 3Y1-λZAPII cDNA library was screened using clone 53 as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of a rat homologue of clone 53/91, and the structural features of the protein are shown in Fig. 1A The ATG at position 1 is most likely an initiation codon because 1) the surrounding nucleotide sequence fulfills Kozak's criteria (26Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), and 2) there is an in-frame TAG codon in the 5′ non-coding sequence. The open reading frame starting with this initiation codon encodes a protein with 263 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular mass of the protein, named SRBC, is 27,879. Mouse clone 53 encodes 105 amino acid residues corresponding to the C-terminal part of rat SRBC (Fig. 1A, lower panel), and the amino acid sequence identity in this region is 86%. SRBC contains a leucine zipper-like motif in the N-terminal part and two PEST regions, which are commonly found in short-lived proteins (27Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 28Rechsteiner M. Rogers S. Rote K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 390-394Google Scholar), in the C-terminal part (Fig. 1A). A comparison of the SRBC nucleotide sequence with the GenBank data base revealed high homologies to mouse sdr (29Gustincich S. Schneider C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar) and a chicken mRNA for the expressed sequence tag (CHKESTFLLE) (Fig. 1B). The overall amino acid sequence identities for SRBC to Sdr and CHKESTFLLE are 43.3 and 25.9%, respectively. Amino acid residues conserved among the proteins are clustered in two regions, SRBC conserved region 1 (SCR1) and SRBC conserved region 2 (SCR2). SCR1 contains the leucine zipper-like motif in its N-terminal part, and SCR2 contains one or two PKC phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1B). Amino acid identity in SCR1 is 43.8% between SRBC and Sdr and 29.0% between SRBC and CHKESTFLLE. In SCR2, it is 60.9% between SRBC and Sdr and 52.2% between SRBC and CHKESTFLLE. In addition, all of these proteins contain PEST regions even though their primary structures are not conserved. It is noteworthy that the sequence from 1 to 185 amino acids of SRBC shows 90% identity with the sequence from 1 to 185 amino acids of the human 7N-1 clone, identified as a gene fused to c-RAF-1 that results in the constitutive activation of the c-RAF-1 gene (30Tahira T. Ochiai M. Hayashi K. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4809-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this clone, the N-terminal regulatory domain of c-RAF-1 is replaced by the human SRBC homologue.Fig. 1Primary structure of SRBC.

The overlay assay showed that PKCδ binds to the product of the T7 gene 10 fused clone 53 product in the presence of phosphatidylserine, a common activator of PKCs (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5). On the other hand, no such interaction was observed with the T7 gene 10 product itself (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, the fusion protein but not the T7 gene 10 product itself can be phosphorylated by PKCδ on the membrane (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8), in agreement with the presence of putative PKC-phosphorylation sites in the clone 53 product (Fig. 1A). To test whether full-length SRBC binds to PKCδ, SRBC was expressed as a GST-fusion protein in E. coli and tested for PKCδ binding by overlay assay. MARCKS, a known binding protein/substrate for PKC, and GST alone were also tested for PKCδ binding. GST-SRBC appeared as a 65.4-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, and MARCKS and GST appeared as 80- and 26-kDa bands, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). The positions of GST and GST-SRBC were confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-GST antibody (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). PKCδ bound to GST-SRBC to the same extent as to MARCKS (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7) but did not bind to GST (Fig. 3A, lane 8). Again, the binding depends entirely on the presence of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10). When PKCα instead of PKCδ was used as a probe, essentially the same results were obtained, whereas the signal was barely detectable when PKCζ was used as the probe (data not shown). Previous studies showed that most of the PKC-binding proteins are phosphatidylserine-binding proteins (10Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A.C. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Wolf M. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13327-13332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphatidylserine may form a bridge between PKC and PKC-binding proteins and stabilize the binding. Since binding of SRBC to PKCδ also depends on phosphatidylserine, we next tested whether SRBC binds to phosphatidylserine by using [14C]phosphatidylserine overlay assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, GST-SRBC binds to phosphatidylserine, and clone 53 encoding only C-terminal part of SRBC also binds to phosphatidylserine. Note that the C-terminal part of SRBC was sufficient for the binding to PKCδ. These results suggest that the binding of SRBC and PKCδ depends on phosphatidylserine-bridging as suggested for other PKC-binding proteins. Since the binding of PKCδ to SRBC depends on the presence of phosphatidylserine, the co-factor binding site of PKCδ located in its N-terminal regulatory domain might be involved in the interaction with SRBC. It has been reported that the pseudosubstrate region, in the regulatory domain, directly mediated phosphatidylserine-dependent PKC binding to some PKC-binding proteins (16Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test whether the N-terminal regulatory domain is sufficient for this interaction, whole PKCδ and its regulatory domain were expressed as MBP (maltose-binding protein) fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig. 4A) and used as probes for the overlay assay. In these experiments, bound PKCδ was detected by anti-MBP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, MBP-PKCδ bound to GST-SRBC or MARCKS similarly to intact PKCδ (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, MBP fused to the regulatory domain of PKCδ (MCD299) also bound to GST-SRBC and MARCKS to the same extent (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). The regulatory domain of PKCδ includes a cysteine-rich domain conserved among all cPKC and nPKC members. When the cysteine-rich domain was totally deleted (MCD111), no binding to SRBC or MARCKS was observed (Fig. 4B, lanes 10 and 11), whereas the C-terminal half of the cysteine-rich domain was dispensable for binding (MCD209 in Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that amino acid residues 111-209 on PKCδ, a region that includes a pseudosubstrate and half of the cysteine-rich domain, are essential for the binding to GST-SRBC and MARCKS. The binding of SRBC to the regulatory domain of PKCδ raises the possibility that GST-SRBC modulates the activity of PKCδ. However, we could not detect any effect of GST-SRBC on the myelin basic protein kinase activity of PKCδ in vitro (data not shown). As already shown in Fig. 2, the C-terminal part of mouse SRBC, the clone 53 product, can be phosphorylated by PKCδ in vitro Full-length rat SRBC fused to GST is also phosphorylated by PKCδ, whereas GST alone is barely phosphorylated (Fig. 5A). We next examined the kinetics for SRBC phosphorylation by PKCδ in vitro GST-SRBC (5-150 nM) was incubated with PKCδ (0.7 nM), in the presence of phosphatidylserine, TPA, and [γ-32P] ATP, and the phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by quantitative autoradiography (Fig. 5B). The Km and Vmax values estimated from the saturation curve are 60 nM and 0.69 nmol of ATP/min/nmol, respectively. The Km value is roughly comparable with that for MARCKS (20.7 nM) obtained by similar experiments (11Fujise A. Mizuno K. Ueda Y. Osada S. Hirai S. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Owada M.K. Nakajima H. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31642-31648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Vmax is considerably lower than MARCKS (5.2 nmol of ATP/min/nmol). GST-SRBC is also phosphorylated by PKCα, with Km and Vmax values similar to those for PKCδ, but GST-SRBC is a poor substrate for PKCζ with a Vmax value one-eighth that for PKCδ (data not shown). The maximum incorporation of phosphate into SRBC by PKCδ was 0.78 mol per 1 mol of GST-SRBC. To monitor the phosphorylation of SRBC in vivo, we designed an epitope-tagged SRBCδ15 expression vector. In this construction, the N-terminal 15 amino acids of SRBC are replaced by a T7 gene 10 epitope tag. The apparent molecular mass of this protein is 43 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The SRBCδ15 was spontaneously phosphorylated in serum-starved COS1 cells, and TPA stimulation caused a ∼2-fold increase in the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 6). We next examined the effect of the co-expression of PKCδ in the presence or absence of TPA. No significant effect of PKCδ over-expression was observed in the absence of TPA. But a more enhanced induction of phosphorylation by TPA (2.5-3-fold) was observed when PKCδ was over-expressed. These results are consistent with the idea that SRBC is phosphorylated in vivo as a consequence of PKC activation. Northern blot analysis showed that SRBC is ubiquitously expressed in almost all tissues tested except liver, and higher levels of expression are observed in uterus and ovary (Fig. 7A). In cultured cell lines, SRBC mRNA was detected in NIH3T3 cells and 3Y1 cells but not in COS1 cells or mouse embryonal carcinoma cell lines including F9 and P19 (Fig. 7B). It has been reported that the expression of sdr mRNA is strongly induced by serum starvation in NIH3T3 cells and down-regulated within 6 h after the addition of serum to starved cells (29Gustincich S. Schneider C. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar). The considerable structural similarity between SRBC and Sdr allowed us to test whether SRBC mRNA is also induced upon serum starvation. The level of SRBC mRNA was relatively low in growing NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 7C, time 0), and was induced by serum deprivation reaching a maximum level within 12 h. The induced mRNA expression level was retained at least for 48 h (Fig. 7C). The amount of SRBC mRNA in starved cells (Fig. 7D, time 0) decreased rapidly after the addition of serum, reaching a minimum level after 3 h (Fig. 7D). When the amount of mRNA was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, the SRBC mRNA level was ∼eight times higher in serum-starved cells compared with serum-stimulated or exponentially growing cells. The induction of SRBC mRNA was also observed upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells to neuron-like cells (Fig. 7B). Taken together, these results show that the level of SRBC mRNA expression correlates with cell growth suppression. We cloned a cDNA encoding a PKC-binding protein by West-Western screening using 32P-labeled, autophosphorylated PKCδ as a probe. This protein, called SRBC, binds to and is phosphorylated by PKCδ in vitro In COS1 cells, the phosphorylation of over-expressed SRBC is stimulated by TPA and is further enhanced by the over-expression of PKCδ. The Km value for the phosphorylation of SRBC by PKCδ is quite low (60 nM), which may reflect a strong interaction between the two molecules. On the other hand, the Vmax value is quite low indicating that SRBC is not a good substrate for PKCδ. However, 1 mol of SRBC incorporates nearly 1 mol of phosphate after prolonged phosphorylation reaction (data not shown). Therefore, the low Vmax value could reflect the low exchange rate of the substrate, SRBC, as a result of stable binding to PKCδ. These features of the PKC-SRBC interaction are very similar to those for the interactions between PKC isozymes (α, δ, and ε) and MARCKS (11Fujise A. Mizuno K. Ueda Y. Osada S. Hirai S. Takayanagi A. Shimizu N. Owada M.K. Nakajima H. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31642-31648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of SRBC to PKCδ depends on the presence of phosphatidylserine; therefore, the active conformation of PKCδ might be necessary for the interaction. In addition, the fact that SRBC binds to phosphatidylserine suggests that phosphatidylserine mediates or stabilizes the interaction between SRBC and PKCδ through its bridging. Interaction with SRBC was also observed for MCD209, a deletion mutant of PKCδ lacking the kinase domain and the C-terminal half of the cysteine-rich domain that is responsible for the binding to phorbol ester or diacylglycerol (32Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 33Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). This indicates that these functional domains are dispensable for the interaction with SRBC. Since MCD111 cannot bind to SRBC, the N-terminal half of the cysteine-rich domain and the pseudosubstrate region may be essential for binding. Previous studies demonstrated that the pseudosubstrate region is one of several motifs that mediate PKC binding (16Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, from our results, we cannot conclude whether the pseudosubstrate region is important to the binding to PKCδ and SRBC or not. We need further experiments to determine the SRBC binding region on the PKCδ. SRBC binds to PKCα, a cPKC family member, to the same extent as PKCδ. And it barely binds to PKCζ, an aPKC family member (data not shown). Thus, the binding of PKC to SRBC does not clearly show isotype specificity. We identified several PKCδ-binding proteins in addition to SRBC by subsequent screening of the cDNA expression library using PKCδ as a probe. These include MARCKS and several other proteins that do not include any of previously reported PKC-binding proteins. 2Y. Tamai, Y. Izumi, S. Hirai, and S. Ohno, manuscript in preparation. Among these novel PKC-binding proteins, we could find a PKCδ-specific binding protein. 3Y. Izumi, Y. Tamai, S. Hirai, and S. Ohno, manuscript in preparation. The primary structure of SRBC shows considerable similarity to Sdr and one of the chicken expression sequence tags (CHKESTFLLE). sdr has been identified as a gene induced in NIH3T3 cells by serum starvation but whose function remains unknown. Most of the conserved amino acids in these proteins are clustered in the N-terminal region named SCR1, which includes a “leucine zipper”-like motif. Although this region is not required for the binding of SRBC to PKCδ, it might be involved in the formation of complexes with themselves or other proteins. The rest of the conserved amino acids are clustered in a small region called SCR2. This region in SRBC includes two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, one of which is conserved among the three proteins. Since only the C-terminal half of SRBC was encoded by the cDNA clones first identified in the expression library, SCR1 must be dispensable for the binding to PKCδ. No striking sequence homology is found among known PKC-binding proteins, AKAP79 (21Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), MARCKS (10Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A.C. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar), and the C-terminal part of SRBC including SCR2. However, it is noteworthy that SCR2 as well as the PKC-binding region in AKAP79 and MARCKS show a high content of basic amino acids and both SRBC and MARCKS show similar binding patterns to PKCδ (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Therefore, SCR2 could be responsible for the binding to PKC in the same way as the basic amino acid region of MARCKS. The expression pattern of the srbc gene shares some common features with that of sdr; both srbc and sdr are induced by serum starvation of NIH3T3 cells and down-regulated by the addition of serum. This suggests that sdr and srbc form a family of genes that play a role in cell-growth control. In addition, other genes induced by growth arrest of cells have been identified in different systems (34Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L.

Noteworthy, the N-terminal 185 amino acids of SRBC, including SCR1, have been found in the N-terminal part of the oncogenic c-RAF-1 gene, replacing the N-terminal regulatory domain of c-RAF-1 (30Tahira T. Ochiai M. Hayashi K. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4809-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The significance of the SRBC sequence fused to c-RAF-1 is unclear since a variety of genes can activate the c-RAF-1 gene by similar gene fusion (36Ishikawa F. Takaku F. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1226-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, since the SRBC-RAF fusion gene seems to be under the control of the srbc promoter, the fusion gene is most likely expressed at high levels in quiescent cells, and this could explain some of the oncogenic properties of the fusion gene. The ubiquitous expression of srbc in different tissues and its induction upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells suggest the involvement of SRBC in a variety of the cellular events that accompany growth arrest. A mutant PKCδ lacking kinase activity shows a dominant-negative effect on the TPA-induced activation of the TRE-tk-CAT reporter gene in NIH3T3 cells (9Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2231-2340Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same dominant negative mutant suppresses TRE-tk-CAT expression caused by the ectopic expression of a PKCδ-active mutant (9Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2231-2340Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of SRBC on TRE-tk-CAT expression in NIH3T3 cells. However, we failed to detect any significant effect (data not shown). Another series of preliminary experiments to examine the effect of SRBC overexpression on the growth of NIH3T3 cells demonstrated the inhibition of DNA synthesis and colony formation, 4Y. Izumi, S. Hirai, and S. Ohno, manuscript in preparation. supporting the idea that SRBC is involved in the regulation of cell growth. We cannot conclude that PKC is involved in these events; however, the further characterization of SRBC might provide a clue to understanding the signaling pathway by which PKC controls cell growth and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2017147250,"The EMS1 gene, located at the chromosome 11q13 region, is the human homologue of p80/p85 cortactin, a chicken pp60src tyrosine kinase substrate. In cells derived from breast carcinomas and squamous carcinomas of the head and neck, DNA amplification of this region results in overexpression of cortactin. Overexpression is accompanied by a partial redistribution of cortactin from the cytoplasm into cell-matrix contact sites. To investigate whether overexpression only is sufficient for this redistribution, we performed biochemical analysis of human cortactin derived from carcinoma cell lines with either normal levels (UMSCC8) or with excessive levels of cortactin due to chromosome 11q13 amplification (UMSCC2). Pulse-chase experiments performed with UMSCC2 cells revealed that p85 originated from p80 by post-translational modifications. However, the conversion of p80 into p85 was hardly observed in UMSCC8 cells, indicating a different processing of the two isoforms in cells with a normal expression level of cortactin. Western blot analysis showed that treatment of UMSCC2 cells with cycloheximide, serum, epidermal growth factor, or vanadate resulted in the disappearance of the p80 form and conversion into p85. Conversion of p80 into p85 was accompanied by a redistribution of cortactin from cytoplasm to cell-matrix contact sites. In UMSCC8 cells, these treatments had no effect on the p80/p85 ratio, and cortactin remained in the cytoplasm. Conversion into p85 therefore is correlated with a relocalization of cortactin to the cell periphery. In addition, p85 from epidermal growth factor- or vanadate-treated UMSCC2 cells showed a significant enhancement in phosphorylation compared with p85 in UMSCC8 cells.

In this study, reporter constructs transfected into neonatal rat ventricular myocytes showed that in the context of 2.5 kilobase pairs of native BNP 5′-flanking sequences, a 2-base pair mutation in a promoter-proximal M-CAT site (CATTCT) disrupted basal and PE-inducible transcription by more than 98%.

While the precise function of this recapitulation of embryonic cardiac gene expression is unclear, it can be speculated that increased NP production represents a compensatory endocrine response to stimuli that often increased blood pressure. Accordingly, a knowledge of the mechanisms by which the NPs are induced during the hypertrophic growth program will provide a better framework upon which to understand how the expression levels of the hormones are regulated under less severe, but nonetheless hemodynamically challenging physiological conditions. natriuretic peptide A-type NP B-type NP protein kinase C mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase serum response element kilobase(s) base pair(s) phenylephrine cytomegalovirus binding protein major histocompatibility complex polymerase chain reaction flanking sequence electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Physiol. 1993; 55: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of serum response elements (SREs) (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as well as SP-1-like elements (16Ardati A. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in the transcriptional activation of ANP in response to α1-adrenergic agonists. Earlier reports have also indicated the probable involvement of AP-1-binding cis-sequences, also known as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements (TREs), in regulating transcription of human ANP (19Kovacic-Milivojevic B. Gardner D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is believed that α1-adrenergic agonists, and perhaps other ANP inducers, stimulate myocardial cell signaling pathways, which eventually lead to the activation of serum response factor, an Sp1-like protein, and perhaps AP-1, each of which converge on the transcriptional enhancement of ANP. Relatively little is known about the regulation of BNP expression. Phorbol esters and diacylglycerol increase BNP mRNA and peptide levels (20Suzuki E. Hirata Y. Kohmoto O. Sugimoto T. Hayakawa H. Matsuoka H. Suigomoto T. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21LaPointe M.C. Sitkins J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1284-1296PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of PKC. Additionally, BNP promoter activity, measured using constructs containing approximately 2.5 kb of the rat BNP 5′-FS upstream of a luciferase reporter, is inducible by phorbol esters, serum, or the α-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE) (22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that in part the coordinated induction of ANP and BNP involves the convergence of intracellular signaling mechanisms upon cis-elements that are conserved between the genes. The present study was undertaken to test this hypothesis by mapping and identifying regions of the BNP 5′-FS that are critical for basal and inducible transcription in rat cardiac myocytes. A 2.5-kb portion of the rat BNP 5′-FS was inserted into a luciferase reporter construct (pGL2; Promega, Madison, WI), as described previously (22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated versions of BNP/luciferase were created either by using native restriction sites, by synthesizing specific PCR primers, or by unidirectional deletion (Erase-a-Base, Promega), starting with BNP-2501GL, as described previously (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A series of 6-bp cluster mutations covering the BNP 5′-FS between −103 bp and −42 bp was created in full-length BNP-2501 by site-directed mutagenesis using Altered Sites (Promega), as described previously for ANP (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment of the BNP 5′-FS from −116 to +80 bp was inserted into the pAlter vector and used as a template. Oligonucleotides containing the desired 6-bp mutation (mutants A-H in Fig. 1) flanked by 12 nucleotides of native BNP sequence on either side, were synthesized and used to prepare the mutant constructs using methods described by the manufacturer. Point mutations in the M-CAT site (ΔM-CAT) were prepared beginning with oligonucleotides containing the changed nucleotides flanked on either side by native BNP sequences, extending on the 5′ side to BNP-116, where there is a SacI site. Using these oligonucleotides as sense primers, and an oligonucleotide complementary to sequences in the 5′-region of the luciferase gene as a common antisense primer, PCR was carried out using BNP-116GL as the template. PCR products were then digested with SacI (BNP-116) and BamHI (BNP+80), and then cloned into pGL2 to create BNP-116GL possessing cluster mutations A-H and the ΔM-CAT mutation shown in Fig. 1. To create multiple mutations (e.g. ΔM-CAT/GATA(−95)), a BNP-116GL construct possessing the appropriate GATA-directed point mutation(s), prepared previously (22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the template and the sense primer, possessing the 2-nucleotide M-CAT mutation (see above), was coupled with the luciferase primer to prepare the appropriate PCR-generated product. As above, PCR products were then digested with SacI (BNP-116) and BamHI (BNP+80), and then cloned into pGL2 to create BNP-116GL possessing various combinations of mutations in the M-CAT and GATA sites (see Fig. 3, top, for M-CAT/GATA mutations). To prepare the cluster and point mutations in the 2.5-kb BNP 5′-FS, we utilized the SacI sites located 5′ of −2501 in the pGL2 multiple cloning site and at −116 in the BNP 5′-FS. Wild type BNP-2501GL was digested with SacI, and the fragment from −2501 to −116 was purified. This fragment was then cloned into SacI-digested BNP-116GL constructs possessing the mutations described above to restore the full-length BNP-2501. Two synthetic oligonucleotides (see below) were designed so that after hybridization there is a tandem repeat of two canonical BNP M-CAT core elements (boxed) separated by 5 bp (see Sequence 1). Some flanking BNP sequences were included such that the repeats represent BNP(−112 to −97)/BNP(−109 to −97). The lowercase nucleotides at the ends are not native to the rat BNP 5′-FS and were added to provide PspA1 sites. The double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide was ligated into the PspA1 site on the 5′ boundary of the rat BNP sequences in BNP-81GL. Positive clones were sequenced and some clones contained one insert (i.e. 2XM-CAT/BNP-81GL), and others contained two inserts (i.e. 4XM-CAT/BNP-81GL). All plasmid constructions were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Myocardial cells were prepared as described (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transfections, freshly dissociated cells were resuspended at a density of 30 million cells/ml of minimal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For each transfection, 300 μl, or 9 million cells, were mixed with 15 or 30 μg of BNP/luciferase (test reporter), and 9 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase (normalization reporter), and in some experiments, 45 μg of a PKC, Ras, or Raf-1 expression construct (see below). Each 300-μl aliquot was then electroporated in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 700 V, 25 microfarads, 100 ohms in a 0.2-cm gap cuvette. This procedure results in an approximate 30% viability (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); accordingly, the 3 million viable cells were plated into fibronectin-coated 35-mm wells, at 1 × 106 cells/well, or into 24-mm wells at 0.5 × 106 cells/well. Thus, the plasmid concentrations per 106 viable cells were 5 μg of BNP/luciferase (10 μg in some experiments), 3 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase, and in some experiments, 15 μg of PKC, Ras, or Raf-1 test construct. Transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for approximately 14 h after electroporation. The cells were then washed thoroughly, and the medium was replaced with minimal medium. Unless otherwise stated, 24 h later, the medium was again replaced with minimal medium ± 50 μM phenylephrine with 1 μM propranolol added to block β-adrenergic receptors. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured for 30 s on a Bio Orbit 1251 Luminometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Data are expressed as “relative luciferase” = arbitrary integrated luciferase units/β-gal units, representative of at least three independent experiments performed with two different plasmid preparations, and represent the mean and S.E. of triplicate 35- or 24-mm wells. To assess the effects of PKC on BNP/luciferase reporter expression, PKCβΔOP, which codes for the production of a catalytically inactive form of PKC (23Kaibuchi K. Fukumoto Y. Oku N. Takai Y. Arai K.

To assess the effects of Raf-1 kinase on BNP/luciferase reporter expression, pCEP4 ΔRaf-1:ER, an expression plasmid coding for an estrogen-activated form of Raf-1 kinase (29Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was used and pCEP4 was used as the empty control vector. As a second test of the effects of Raf-1 kinase, Raf BXB, which encodes a constitutively active form of c-Raf-1 (30Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R.

Each experiment was replicated at least three times, and the average of three experiments is shown. EMSA was carried out using nuclei from neonatal rat ventricular tissue obtained as described (18Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ.

Briefly, probes were prepared by Klenow fragment-mediated filling of the sticky ends of double-stranded oligonucleotides. A typical binding assay contained 20,000 cpm double-stranded probe and 10 μg of nuclear extract protein in 1 × binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 70 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). After a 10-min preincubation of extract with 0.1 μg of nonspecific competitor (poly(dI-dC), Pharmacia) ± competitor, the probe was added. Binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min prior to separation of bound and free probe on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (29:1 bis/acrylamide) in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 4°C at 150 V. DNA-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. The autoradiograms of some gels in this report were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer, and the resulting image was imported to Adobe Photoshop and Claris MacDraw Pro II for final figure preparation. In a previous study we cloned and sequenced approximately 2.5 kilobase pairs of the rat BNP 5′-FS (22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A search of this sequence revealed the presence of various putative regulatory cis-elements in this region of the rat BNP gene (Fig. 1, top). To begin mapping areas of the gene involved in regulating BNP transcription, a series of reporter constructs was prepared with various lengths of the BNP 5′-FS driving luciferase expression. When primary ventricular cardiac myocytes were transfected with these constructs, it was apparent that the removal of about 1.5 kb of 5′-FS, down to BNP-535GL, had very little effect on basal or PE-inducible reporter activity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the removal of 137 bp between −535 and −398 appeared to result in greater basal and inducible promoter activity, suggesting the presence of repressor elements in this region of the gene. While the physiological role of such repressor elements is unknown, this result is similar to that recently observed in similar truncation analyses of the human BNP gene (33LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.-P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further truncation resulted in a gradual decline of promoter activity such that BNP-140GL displayed about 75% of the basal and inducible activities as the full-length construct. Truncation beyond this point seemed to have a more severe effect, such that BNP-116GL possessed only about 15% of the promoter activity observed with BNP-2501GL, while BNP-81GL and BNP-58GL possessed only 8% and 1% of original activity. A series of 6-bp cluster mutations (see Fig. 1) targeted at promoter proximal regions within the full-length, BNP-2501GL was prepared. Mutants B, C, G, and H each decreased basal and PE-inducible promoter activity by about 30-50%, mutant D had no effect, while mutants E and F increased PE-inducible promoter activity by as much as 25% (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, however, mutant A, which spans the BNP 5′-FS between −103 to −98, resulted in a drastic, 98% reduction of reporter activity, implying the presence of a critical regulatory sequence in this region. A CATTCT, or M-CAT, consensus sequence lies between −109 and −102 nucleotides in the rat BNP gene (Fig. 1). CATTCT elements bind a family of skeletal- and cardiac muscle-derived proteins originally named M (muscle)-CAT-binding proteins (see Fig. 1; 34Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). M-CAT-binding proteins, which are present in high levels in cardiac myocytes, are related to a family of proteins called transcription enhancement factors (e.g. TEF-1), also known as enhancers of SV40 transcriptional activity, GT-IIC (34Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, M-CAT-binding proteins have been implicated in the transcription of other cardiac muscle genes, such as those for cardiac troponin C, α-skeletal actin and α-myosin heavy chain, and β-myosin heavy chain (34Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accordingly, in the context of 2.5 kb of the BNP 5′-FS, a 2-bp double-point mutation was prepared (ΔM-CAT), which was predicted from previous studies to specifically disrupt the binding of M-CAT-binding protein (39Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basal and PE-inducible promoter activity from ΔM-CAT were reduced by at least 98%, as seen for mutation A (Fig. 2C), emphasizing the absolute requirement for an intact M-CAT element in the promoter-proximal region of the BNP gene. The GATA family of transcription factors, which have been implicated as regulators of myocardial cell BNP gene expression (22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Since the cluster mutations B and C displayed somewhat reduced basal and PE-inducible promoter activity (Fig. 2B), and since these mutations were located over GATA-binding protein consensus sequences (Fig. 1, lower), point mutations known to disrupt GATA binding were prepared in the context of BNP-2501GL. In agreement with our previous study, which tested similar mutations in reporter constructs possessing only 116 bp of BNP 5′-FS (i.e. BNP-116GL) (22Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17772-17775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mutation at GATA(−95) was of little consequence, while the mutation at GATA(−84) resulted in an approximate 20% decline in PE-inducibility (Fig. 3). However, when the mutations were combined (i.e. GATA(−95,−84)), there was a much greater than expected, 60% reduction in basal and PE-inducible reporter activity (Fig. 3). One explanation for this unexpected reduction is the possibility that these two GATA sites, and perhaps the protein(s) that bind there, are interactive, either with each other, or with other elements. For example, perhaps a GATA-binding protein (BP) must bind to the BNP gene somewhere between about −100 and −80 to confer optimal promoter activity. If a GATA-BP binds to the native BNP gene primarily at GATA(−84), which would leave enough room for an M-CAT-binding protein to bind at −106, one would expect the −95 mutation to be of little consequence. However, the −84 mutation might be expected to disrupt GATA-BP binding there, perhaps promoting GATA-BP binding to the alternate, and apparently less effective GATA site at −95. Then, mutating both −84 and −95 would completely disrupt all GATA binding, resulting in the unexpectedly low activity observed in the GATA(−95,−84) double mutant. To test for possible interactions between the GATA and M-CAT elements, the various GATA-directed mutations were combined with the ΔM-CAT point mutation. As expected, overall promoter activities of the constructs harboring the ΔM-CAT mutation were severely decreased, probably due to the disruption of the consensus M-CAT site. Additionally, the GATA(−95) mutation had no additional effect when combined with the ΔM-CAT mutation; however, the GATA(−84) and GATA(−95,−84) mutations further decreased promoter activity. The abilities of the GATA-directed mutations to decrease promoter activity in the ΔM-CAT constructs, as well as those possessing the native M-CAT site, suggests that the GATA sites behave independently of the M-CAT site. Due to its absolute requirement for basal and inducible BNP promoter activity, the properties of the M-CAT element in the BNP 5′-FS were studied further. To evaluate whether cardiac nuclear proteins could bind to the promoter-proximal M-CAT site in a manner consistent with the functional consequences of the mutations in the reporter genes, EMSA were carried out. A variety of oligonucleotides were prepared either synthetically or by restriction digestion of the appropriate BNP/luciferase reporters (Fig. 4); the BNP(−113/(−95) oligomer was used as a labeled probe and a competitor, while the others were used as competitors. In the absence of any competitor, cardiac nuclear proteins and the BNP probe formed a single, major complex observed by EMSA (Fig. 5, lane 2). While this complex was disrupted effectively using the unlabeled probe (Fig. 5, lane 3), or an oligonucleotide containing a canonical M-CAT element modeled after that in the chicken troponin gene (Fig. 5, lane 4), the BNP(−113/(−95) mutant, which mimics the double point mutation, ΔM-CAT, was an ineffective competitor (Fig. 5, lane 5). Oligonucleotides mimicking larger stretches of the promoter-proximal region of the BNP 5′-FS and containing the M-CAT site (e.g. BNP(−116/(−52) and BNP(−116/(−71)), were also effective competitors (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 8). However, when these larger oligonucleotides contained either the double-point mutation in the putative M-CAT site (i.e. BNP(−116/(−52) ΔM-CAT), or cluster mutation A (i.e. BNP(−116/(−52) mutant A) (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 9), they served as ineffective competitors, consistent with a requirement for the binding of an M-CAT/TEF-1-related protein to this region of the gene. Oligonucleotides mimicking mutants B and D, which harbored 6-bp clustered changes in regions outside the putative M-CAT region, were effective competitors (Fig. 5, lanes 10 and 11), consistent with the relatively minor roles of these mutations on BNP promoter function. As further controls, it was shown that neither the human c-fos serum response element (SRE), the collagense 12-O-tetrad"

S., and Osheroff, N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1148-1155). To determine whether other major forms of spontaneous DNA damage also act as topoisomerase II poisons, the effects of position-specific apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines (i.e. uracil:guanine mismatches) on the type II enzyme were determined. Both of these lesions stimulated topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission with the same positional specificity as apurinic sites but were less efficacious. Moreover, apurinic sites dominated the effects of apyrimidinic sites in substrates that contained multiple lesions. The differential ability of spontaneous lesions to enhance DNA cleavage did not correlate with either a decreased stability of the double helix or the size of the gap formed by base loss. Rather, it appears to be due (at least in part) to increased rates of religation for substrates containing apyrimidinic sites or deaminated cytosines. These results suggest that several forms of spontaneous DNA damage are capable of acting as endogenous poisons of topoisomerase II. Apurinic sites are position-specific poisons of topoisomerase II and stimulate DNA scission ∼10-18-fold when they are located within the 4-base overhang generated by enzyme-mediated cleavage (Kingma, P.

These results suggest that several forms of spontaneous DNA damage are capable of acting as endogenous poisons of topoisomerase II. The integrity of the genetic material is constantly challenged by events that generate damage in DNA (1Lindahl T.

C.1995Google Scholar). An important source of this damage originates from spontaneous alterations within the double helix such as the loss of bases (i.e. generation of apurinic or apyrimidinic sites) and the deamination of cytosine residues (i.e. conversion of cytosine to uracil) (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4294) Google Scholar, 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). It is estimated that ∼10,000 apurinic sites are created per mammalian cell on a daily basis (4Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Although rates of spontaneous pyrimidine hydrolysis and cytosine deamination in duplex DNA are ∼20- and 70-fold lower than that of purine loss (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.

These cleavage complexes are normally short-lived intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme and are tolerated by the cell (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C.

These agents convert this essential enzyme to a cellular toxin by increasing levels of enzyme-mediated DNA breaks. Thus, the same deleterious aspects of topoisomerase II that lead to genomic damage can also be used to cure human disease. Since the most prevalent DNA lesions induced by heat-acid treatment are apurinic sites (26Neto J.B.C. Gentil A. Cabral R.E.C. Sarasin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19718-19723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a previous study examined the effects of purine loss on DNA cleavage mediated by Drosophilia melanogaster topoisomerase II (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Apurinic sites were found to be position-specific poisons of the type II enzyme, stimulating DNA scission as much as ∼10-18-fold, but only when located within the 4-base overhang generated by enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. To determine whether other forms of spontaneous DNA damage also act as topoisomerase II poisons, the effects of position-specific apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines (i.e. uracil:guanine mismatches) on the type II enzyme were examined. Both of these lesions stimulated topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage with the same positional specificity as apurinic sites. However, the level of stimulation was lower than that induced by purine loss. Differences in lesion efficacy appear to be due, at least in part, to increased rates of religation for substrates containing apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines. Topoisomerase II was purified from D. melanogaster embryonic Kc cells as described by Shelton et al. (28Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepes was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim; proteinase K and SDS were from Merck; bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and Klenow DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs, Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase and [γ-32P]ATP (∼6000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham; etoposide was from Sigma (stored at 4°C, as a 10 mM stock solution in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide); deoxyuridine phosphoramidite was from Glen Research; [α-32P]dGTP was from DuPont NEN. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade. A 40-base single-stranded oligonucleotide that corresponds to residues 87-126 of pBR322 (see Fig. 2) (29Sutcliffe J.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 43: 77-90Crossref Google Scholar) and its complementary oligonucleotide were prepared on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. The sequence of the top and bottom oligonucleotides were 5′-TGAAATCTAACAATG↓CGCTCATCGTCATCCTCGGCACCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGGTGCCGAGGATGACGATG↓AGCGCATTGTTAGATTTCA-3′, respectively. The points of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are denoted by the arrows (30Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded uracil-containing oligonucleotides were prepared in a similar manner utilizing a deoxyuridine phosphoramidite. When appropriate, single-stranded oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled on their 5′ termini in reaction mixtures that contained 10 pmol of oligonucleotide, 5 units of polynucleotide kinase, and 75 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in a total of 30 μl of kinase buffer (supplied by the manufacturer). Labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides were isolated by electrophoresis in 7 M urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels. DNA bands were excised from gels and purified using the Qiagen gel extraction protocol. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed as described by Corbett et al. (31Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to use, uracil bases were removed by incubating 2 pmol (100 nM) of double-stranded oligonucleotide/reaction with 0.2 units (1.7 nM final concentration) of uracil DNA glycosylase in 17 μl of 10 mM Hepes-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol for 30 min at 37°C (32Kunkel T.A.

Following treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase, samples were prepared for topoisomerase II assays by the addition of 1 μl of 1 M NaCl, 1 M KCl and 1 μl of 100 mM MgCl2. Wild type oligonucleotide was treated by an identical procedure to control for the potential effects of this process on topoisomerase II activity. Oligonucleotides that contained a uracil:guanine mismatch were treated in a similar manner in the absence of uracil DNA glycosylase. In order to confirm the presence of apyrimidinic sites in DNA substrates treated with uracil DNA glycosylase, selected oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled and subjected to hydrolysis in 0.1 N NaOH for 30 min at 37°C. Products were resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing gels as described below. For substrates that contained two apyrimidinic sites, selected oligonucleotides were labeled on their 3′-termini using Klenow DNA polymerase, [α-32P]dGTP, and a template oligonucleotide that contained a 5-base 5′-overhang (5′-GATCC-3′) in addition to the 40-base sequence of the bottom strand. These 3′-labeled oligonucleotides were subjected to hydrolysis as described above. As determined by conversion of full-length substrates to the appropriately sized hydrolysis products, >95% of incorporated uracil residues were converted to apyrimidinic sites by uracil DNA glycosylase. Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage reactions contained 100 nM oligonucleotide in 19 μl of 10 mM Hepes-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol and were initiated by the addition of 1 μl of topoisomerase II (100 nM final concentration). Reactions were incubated for 3 min at 30°C and were stopped with 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by 1.5 μl of 250 mM EDTA. Cleavage products were digested with proteinase K (2 μl of a 0.8 mg/ml solution) for 20 min at 37°C, precipitated with ethanol twice, and resuspended in 5 μl of 40% formamide, 8.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanole FF. Products were resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing 7 M urea, 14% polyacrylamide sequencing gels in 100 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mM NaEDTA. Alternatively, reaction products were resolved under nondenaturing conditions at 10°C in 20% polyacrylamide gels in 100 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mM NaEDTA. Gels were fixed by soaking for 10 min in a 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution and dried. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Levels of cleavage were calculated from the amount of cleavage product that was produced (i.e. counts in the 15- or 21-mer band) or from the percentage of total substrate that was cleaved (i.e. counts in the 15- or 21-mer band/counts in the total substrate). Similar results were obtained using either method. Religation assays were carried out by a modification of the procedure of Robinson and Osheroff (34Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described under “Topoisomerase II-mediated DNA Cleavage.” Religation was initiated by shifting the reaction temperature from 30 to 4°C and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS at the indicated times. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis and resolved on denaturing gels as described above. The apparent first order rate of religation was determined by quantifying the loss of the 21-mer cleavage product. Melting studies utilized a 12-base oligonucleotide that included the central 4-base cleavage overhang and the neighboring 4 residues on either side of the topoisomerase II cleavage site (see Fig. 2). After annealing, 150 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with 2.5 units of uracil DNA glycosylase in 300 μl of 10 mM Hepes-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol for 30 min at 37°C (32Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4892) Google Scholar, 33Purmal A.A. Lampman G.W. Pourmal E.I. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22046-22053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase (as appropriate), samples were cooled to 4°C and prepared for assays by the addition of 15 μl of 1 M NaCl, 1 M KCl and 15 μl of 100 mM MgCl2. Wild type oligonucleotides were treated by an identical procedure to control for the potential effects of this process on stability. Oligonucleotides containing a uracil:guanine mismatch were treated in a similar manner but in the absence of uracil DNA glycosylase. Ultraviolet absorbance measurements were recorded using a modified Cary-14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems). Reaction temperatures were controlled by a jacketed cell holder connected to a water bath. Oligonucleotide melting was determined by monitoring changes in A260 as a function of temperature over a range of 10-65°C. Melting curves were derivatized incrementally and smoothed with the software provided by the manufacturer. The melting temperature was defined as the temperature at which the first order derivative of the melting curve reached its maximum. Recent evidence indicates that the most prevalent form of spontaneous DNA damage, apurinic sites (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4294) Google Scholar, 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), acts as a position-specific topoisomerase II poison (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When located within the 4-base stagger generated by enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage in the sequence shown in Fig. 2, these lesions enhanced the DNA scission event of Drosophila topoisomerase II ∼10-18-fold (see Fig. 1). In contrast, when located immediately outside the points of cleavage, they abolished DNA scission. To determine whether two other major forms of spontaneous DNA damage also poison the type II enzyme, the effects of apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines (i.e. uracil:guanine mismatches) on the DNA cleavage reaction of Drosophila topoisomerase II were examined. A double-stranded 40-mer substrate that contained a single, centrally located topoisomerase II cleavage site was employed for this study (30Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 683-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Position-specific deaminated cytosine residues were incorporated during oligonucleotide synthesis by replacing single nucleosides with deoxyuridine. Apyrimidinic sites were generated by treating uracil containing oligonucleotides with uracil DNA glycosylase. 1Alternatively, abasic sites were generated in the absence of uracil DNA glycosylase treatment by chemical incorporation of a tetrahydrofuran abasic site analogue during oligonucleotide synthesis. In all cases, similar levels of cleavage were obtained. This indicates that residual uracil DNA glycosylase present in cleavage assays did not affect topoisomerase II activity. To ensure that DNA cleavage was due to enzyme-mediated scission rather than spontaneous degradation of apyrimidinic sites, cleavage of lesion-containing oligonucleotides was monitored on the complementary wild type strand. The positions of DNA lesions are designated relative to the point of cleavage on that strand. Bases 5′ to the point of cleavage are designated with negative numbers and those 3′ are designated with positive numbers (35Capranico G. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6611-6619Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The points of cleavage on both the top and bottom strands are located between the −1 and +1 bases. To characterize the effects of apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines on topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission, the effects of lesions located within the cleavage stagger (i.e. internal sites) and immediately outside (i.e. external sites) this region were determined. As seen in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, apyrimidinic sites located between the scissile bonds stimulated DNA cleavage ∼2-5-fold, while those 1 or 2 bases outside these bonds inhibited cleavage ∼50%. The effects of deaminated cytosines on DNA cleavage were less pronounced (Fig. 2). When the 3 internal cytosines were converted to uracil residues, cleavage was enhanced at most ∼2-fold. Moreover, the deamination of an external cytosine decreased cleavage only 25%. Since topoisomerase II does not release its DNA cleavage product, scission reactions can be reversed by the addition of high salt or chelation of the required divalent cation (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, ≥90% of cleavage observed with oligonucleotides containing a stimulatory apyrimidinic site or a deaminated cytosine was reversed by either treatment. Furthermore, no oligonucleotide cleavage was observed when topoisomerase II was omitted from reaction mixtures. Taken together, these results indicate that enhanced cleavage of lesion-containing oligonucleotides was mediated by topoisomerase II. In addition, they demonstrate that lesions were not being degraded to nicks during the cleavage assay, since this would have resulted in the formation of nonreversible “suicide” cleavage intermediates (36Andersen A.H.

To establish the preference of the enzyme for spontaneous DNA lesions, the ability of topoisomerase II to generate double-stranded breaks (as analyzed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels) in oligonucleotides that contained both an apurinic site and an apyrimidinic site was determined (Fig. 3). Comparisons between apurinic sites and deaminated cytosines could not be carried out because treatment of oligonucleotides with uracil DNA glycosylase cannot selectively generate an apurinic site while leaving a second uracil intact. The underlying premise for the apurinic/apyrimidinic site preference experiments stems from the finding that DNA lesions located immediately outside the topoisomerase II cleavage stagger diminish the ability of lesions located within the stagger to stimulate cleavage. As seen in Fig. 3, an external apurinic site decreased cleavage stimulation by an internal apurinic site ∼6-fold, and an external apyrimidinic site decreased cleavage stimulation by an internal apyrimidinic site ∼5-fold. Since the relative reductions in DNA scission for homologous internal/external lesions were similar, a second set of oligonucleotides that contained heterologous lesions was employed to determine whether the enzyme interacts preferentially with apurinic over apyrimidinic sites. When an external apyrimidinic site was placed in an oligonucleotide that contained an internal apurinic site, levels of cleavage dropped only 35% (<1.6-fold). In marked contrast, when an external apurinic site was placed in an oligonucleotide that contained an internal apyrimidinic site, levels of cleavage dropped nearly 15-fold. These findings demonstrate that the effects of apurinic sites dominate those of apyrimidinic sites and suggest that the enzyme interacts preferentially with the dominant lesion. The basis for the increased activity of apurinic sites (versus apyrimidinic sites or deaminated cytosines) against topoisomerase II is unknown. Although structural alterations in lesion-containing DNA are complex (38Raap J. Dreef C.E. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Hilbers C.W. J. Biomol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22980-22987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), one simple difference that distinguishes apurinic sites from either apyrimidinic sites or deaminated cytosines is the relatively large gap that is left in the double helix upon removal of a purine base. Therefore, to model larger gap sizes, oligonucleotides containing adjacent abasic sites were constructed (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, initial attempts to model larger gap sizes that were perpendicular to the DNA axis were not informative, since construction of a duplex oligonucleotide containing abasic sites directly opposite each other (i.e. complementary postitions) abolished cleavage. This finding, however, is consistent with structural data that indicates that the double helix collapses at such a double lesion (44Gelfand C.A. Plum G.E. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when two adjacent apyrimidinic sites were incorporated parallel to the DNA axis at the +3 and +4 positions on the top strand, levels of topoisomerase II-mediated double-stranded DNA cleavage increased slightly (as compared with either single lesion). However, levels of cleavage did not approach that induced by a single apurinic lesion at the +2 position. A similar enhancement of cleavage was seen in an oligonucleotide containing an adjacent apurinic (+2) and apyrimidinic (+3) site. Thus, relative levels of DNA cleavage do not correlate with the size of the gap formed by base loss. Previous studies indicate that apurinic sites, apyrimidinic sites, and base mismatches all destabilize the double helix (45Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46Vesnaver G. Chang C.N. Eisenberg M. Grollman A.P. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, to further explore the structural basis for enhancement of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage by spontaneous lesions, their effects on the stability of a topoisomerase II cleavage site were examined. To this end, melting temperatures (Tm) were determined for double-stranded 12-mer oligonucleotides containing selected DNA lesions (Table II).Table IIMelting temperatures of oligonucleotides containing spontaneous lesionsPosition of DNA lesionTmΔTmRelative cleavage°C°CBottom strandNone4601+3 guanine48+20.5+2 AP(R)28−2018.3−1 AP(R)32−160.1Top strand+3 AP(Y)28−205.6+3/+4 AP(Y)21−257.0+3 uracil36−101.7 Open table in a new tab No correlation between Tm values and relative DNA cleavage enhancement (as assessed by levels of DNA cleavage monitored on denaturing polyacrylamide gels) was apparent for internal lesions that stimulated cleavage or for an external apurinic site that abolished cleavage. For example, even though the +3 deaminated cytosine (that enhanced cleavage the least) showed the smallest decrease in Tm, the +2 apurinic and +3 apyrimidinic sites (that differed in cleavage enhancement >3-fold) had identical Tm values. Furthermore, the +3/+4 double apyrimidinic site (that enhanced cleavage ∼7-fold) decreased the Tm of the oligonucleotide by 25°C, while the single +2 apurinic site (that enhanced cleavage ∼18-fold) decreased the Tm by only 18°C. Finally, the Tm of an oligonucleotide in which the guanine:cytosine base pair at the +2 bottom/+3 top position was inverted was similar to that of the parent DNA substrate. Since cleavage of this latter oligonucleotide is diminished ∼50% as compared with the parent substrate, it appears that the enzyme does not require local regions of DNA destabilization for cleavage activity. The DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of topoisomerase II is established by the competing rates of enzyme-DNA cleavage complex formation versus DNA religation (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Berger J.M.

Thus, levels of DNA cleavage can be profoundly influenced by factors that affect either of these rates (13Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). For example, anticancer drugs such as etoposide (see Fig. 5, inset) and amsacrine enhance topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission primarily by inhibiting DNA religation (48Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 49Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2511-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 50Sørensen B.S. Sinding J. Andersen A.H. Alsner J. Jensen P.B. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), while other agents such as quinolones and ellipticine act primarily by increasing the rate of cleavage complex formation (51Robinson M.J. Martin B.A. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Moynihan M. Sutcliffe J.A. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Froelich-Ammon S.J. Burden D.A.

Finally, cleavage-enhancing apurinic sites have essentially no effect on rates of DNA religation and presumably act by stimulating the rate of cleavage complex formation (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To address the mechanistic basis of cleavage enhancement by other spontaneous DNA lesions, rates of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA religation were determined for oligonucleotides that contained either an apyrimidinic site or a deaminated cytosine at the +3 position on the top strand. As seen in Fig. 5, both the apyrimidinic site and the deaminated cytosine increased rates of religation ∼3-fold over that of either the wild-type or apurinic (see inset) oligonucleotide. Thus, they probably stimulate DNA cleavage by enhancing cleavage complex formation. In addition, the unexpected increase in religation rates suggests a mechanistic basis that accounts (at least in part) for the relatively modest cleavage enhancement induced by apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines compared with apurinic sites. Spontaneous events within the double helix generate thousands of lesions in the mammalian genome on a daily basis (4Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Despite their prevalence, the cellular and genetic impact of these damaging lesions has not been fully characterized. Recent evidence indicates that some forms of spontaneous DNA damage, in addition to their effects on replication fidelity (2Christians F.C. Newcomb T.G. Loeb L.A. Prevent. Med. 1995; 24: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 5Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), enhance double-stranded DNA cleavage mediated by topoisomerase II (8Kingma P.S. Corbett A.H. Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, by poisoning this enzyme, spontaneous DNA damage can be converted from strand-specific lesions to potentially lethal double-stranded DNA breaks. Apurinic sites, which are the most frequently induced spontaneous DNA lesions (4Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), show the most activity against topoisomerase II and stimulate DNA cleavage ∼10-18-fold (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Results of the present study indicate that two other major forms of spontaneous DNA damage, apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines, are also topoisomerase II poisons and enhance DNA cleavage ∼2-5-fold. The decreased ability of these lesions to stimulate DNA scission (relative to apurinic sites) may result, at least in part, from increased rates of religation. While the efficacy of apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines is less pronounced than that of apurinic sites, it is notable that a 2000:1 molar excess (i.e. 200 μM) of etoposide is required to achieve a similar level of cleavage enhancement at the DNA site utilized (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), as compared with a 1:1 ratio of these lesions to oligonucleotides. The structural alterations in DNA that underlie the differential ability of spontaneous lesions to enhance topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage are not known. Although apurinic sites generally induce greater distortion in the double helix than do apyrimidinic sites or deaminated cytosines, structural features of spontaneous lesions have not been consistently examined within similar nucleic acid sequences (38Raap J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22980-22987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, it is tempting to speculate that a common structural alteration exists in these spontaneous DNA lesions but does so to a greater extent or frequency in apurinic sites. To this point, the base opposite an apurinic site is more likely to adopt an extrahelical “melted” state than the base opposite the other two lesions (39Kalnik M.W. Chang C.N. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. J. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22980-22987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ultimately, it will be necessary to analyze the structure of these lesions within the context of a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage site to determine the credence of this hypothesis. Previous studies on apurinic sites (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and some non-uracil-containing base pair mismatches (similar to those generated by DNA polymerase infidelity) (53Bigioni M. Zunino F. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Willmore E. Capranico G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicate that these lesions stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission only when they are located in the 4 base pairs that are internal to the points of DNA cleavage. On the basis of these findings as well as drug specificity and cross-linking studies (22Pommier Y. Fesen M.R. Goldwasser F. Chabner B.A. Longo D.L.

A. 1994; 91: 11007-11011Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a model, which is called the positional poison model, was proposed to describe the mechanistic basis for topoisomerase II cleavage enhancement (27Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1148-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This model states that 1) topoisomerase II poisons (both anticancer drugs and DNA lesions) induce similar alterations in the structure of DNA and 2) these structural alterations are responsible for enhancing topoisomerase II-mediated DNA scission but must be positioned within the 4-base cleavage overhang in order to stimulate this enzyme activity. The present study indicates that the positional specificity of apyrimidinic sites and deaminated cytosines is identical to that observed for apurinic sites. Therefore, the positional poison model appears to be consistent with the actions of every cleavage-enhancing DNA lesion thus far reported. The DNA cleavage reaction of topoisomerase II is fundamental to all of the essential catalytic activities of the enzyme (9Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 10Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Berger J.M. Wang J.C.

While low steady-state levels of DNA cleavage are necessary for enzymatic function, considerable circumstantial evidence suggests that increased levels of topoisomerase II-mediated scission cause mutagenic and potentially lethal damage within the genome (13Corbett A.H.

Results of the present study indicate that several different forms of spontaneous DNA damage stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and may act as endogenous poisons of the type II enzyme. This ability of spontaneous lesions to induce DNA scission may contribute to their mutagenic properties or may allow topoisomerase II to selectively remove cells with genomic damage from a population.

Gre factors are presumed to have two biologically important and evolutionarily conserved functions: the suppression of elongation arrest and the enhancement of transcription fidelity. A three-dimensional structure of GreB was generated by homology modeling on the basis of the known crystal structure of GreA. Both factors display similar overall architecture and surface charge distribution, with characteristic C-terminal globular and N-terminal coiled-coil domains. One major difference between the two factors is the “basic patch” on the surface of the coiled-coil domain, which is much larger in GreB than in GreA. In both proteins, a site near the basic patch cross-links to the 3′ terminus of RNA in the ternary transcription complex. GreA/GreB hybrid molecules were constructed by genetic engineering in which the N-terminal domain of one protein was fused to the C-terminal domain of the other. In the hybrid molecules, both the coiled-coil and the globular domains contribute to specific binding of Gre factors to RNA polymerase, whereas the antiarrest activity and the GreA or GreB specificity of transcript cleavage is determined by the N-terminal domain. These results implicate the basic patch of the N-terminal coiled-coil domain as an important functional element responsible for the interactions with nascent transcript and determining the size of the RNA fragment to be excised during the course of the cleavage reaction.

Two closely related Escherichia coli proteins, GreA and GreB, participate in RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymerase8-N3-ATP8-azidoadenosine triphosphateTECternary elongation complexBSAbovine serum albuminNTCB2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acidWTwild typePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. transcription elongation by preventing and/or suppressing the condition of elongation arrest (1Borukhov S.

Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition, both factors have been shown to facilitate the transition of RNAP from the stage of abortive initiation to productive elongation (3Hsu M.H. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). GreA and GreB may also have a proofreading role in transcription (4Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is thought that the Gre activity is accomplished by endonucleolytic cleavage of RNAs within the ternary elongation complexes (TECs) (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The cleavage is followed by dissociation of the 3′-terminal fragment and restart of elongation from a newly generated 3′-OH terminus (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Similar reactions are induced in eukaryotic TECs of RNA polymerase II by transcription elongation factor TFIIS (5Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol.

GreA and GreB have almost the same molecular mass and share substantial amino acid sequence homology (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, there are several differences in their functional and biochemical properties in vitro First, in all studied TECs that are susceptible for cleavage reactions, GreA induces hydrolysis of short RNAs 2 or 3 nucleotides long from the RNA 3′ terminus (“type A” cleavage activity), whereas GreB stimulates hydrolysis of RNAs that are 2-18 nucleotides long, depending on the stage of transcription elongation (“type B” cleavage activity) (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Lee D.N. Feng G. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22295-22303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, GreA can only prevent the formation of arrested TEC (read-through activity), whereas GreB, besides displaying read-through activity, can convert the preformed arrested TEC to a productive complex by a cleavage and restart mechanism (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Finally, we have recently shown that Gre factors form reversible complexes with RNAP core or holoenzyme with apparent Kd values that differ by at least 2 orders of magnitude: 2-3 × 10−5M (GreA) and 1-2 × 10−7M (GreB). These values were estimated by size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography of RNAP complexes with 35S-labeled Gre proteins and were further supported by affinity chromatography of 35S-labeled Gre factors on immobilized His-tagged RNAP (10Orlova M. Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage Activity of RNA Polymerase..Ph.D. thesis, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow. 1995; Google Scholar). Similar Kd values were obtained for the complexes of Gre proteins with purified TECs (prepared on a ribosomal rrnB P1 promoter DNA) carrying 6-mer and 12-mer transcripts (10Orlova M. Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage Activity of RNA Polymerase..Ph.D. thesis, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow. 1995; Google Scholar). TFIIS and Gre factors do not cleave free RNA or RNA·DNA duplexes (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 10Orlova M. Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage Activity of RNA Polymerase..Ph.D. thesis, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow. 1995; Google Scholar) and require the formation of a ternary complex between RNAP, DNA, and RNA transcript for their activity (10Orlova M. Intrinsic Transcript Cleavage Activity of RNA Polymerase..Ph.D. thesis, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow. 1995; Google Scholar) or a specific binary complex between RNAP and RNA (11Altmann C.R. Solow-Cordero D.E. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both E. coli RNAP and eukaryotic RNAP II show a weak ability to cleave RNA in the absence of factors, and this activity is stimulated by mild alkaline pH (12Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or pyrophosphate (13Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the transcript cleavage factors are not nucleases per se but cofactors that stimulate an intrinsic nucleolytic activity of RNAP. A working model that emerged from these data envisages the RNAP catalytic center as the performer of the cleavage reaction (12Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this model, the catalytic center disengages from the RNA 3′ terminus, slips back along the transcript, hydrolyzes or pyrophosphorolizes an internal phosphodiester bond and reengages with the newly generated 3′ terminus. The model is consistent with the notion of conformational flexibility of the TEC that is central to the discontinuous mechanism of RNA polymerization (14Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1994; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 15Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism by which Gre proteins induce these perturbations within the TEC and stimulate cleavage would help unravel the mechanism of elongation. In a previous paper, we reported the 2.2-Å resolution crystal structure of GreA (16Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which suggested a way this protein might interact with the TEC. The GreA structure consists of the C-terminal globular and N-terminal extended coiled-coil domains, resembling a fist with an outstretched index finger. One surface of the molecule is uniformly negatively charged, while the opposite surface is essentially hydrophobic with a small basic patch near the tip of the finger. We suggested that during interaction with the TEC, GreA's acidic side is oriented away from the acidic surface of RNAP, while the basic patch contacts RNA in the complex. In the present work, this model was further explored through comparative analysis of GreA and GreB domain organization and function. To this end, we sought to relate the similarities and differences between biochemical functions of the two factors to the common and divergent features of their structures. Nucleoside triphosphates, RNase-free BSA, sequencing grade endoproteinases ArgC, AspN, and thrombin were from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]CTP and [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN. 8-N3ATP, 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB), and BNPS-skatole were from Sigma. Prestained protein molecular weight markers were from Amersham Corp. E. coli greA−greB− strain AD8571 (12Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression of wild type (WT) and mutant Gre factors and for preparation of GreA/GreB-free RNAP. E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used for selection of all plasmids after ligation. pTRC99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used as an expression vector for construction of plasmids overproducing WT and mutant Gre proteins. Plasmid pCF3 is a derivative of pUC19 containing an insertion of the cloned greB gene (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). All sequences of WT and mutant gre genes described in this work were verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing of the double-stranded plasmid DNA. The following oligonucleotides were used for construction of overexpressing plasmids and PCR mutagenesis (italicized nucleotides correspond to greA and greB genes, as indicated in parentheses; underlined nucleotides define the restriction sites of the enzymes, shown in parentheses; boldface nucleotides correspond to the region coding the His6 tag): 1) 5′-pCAAGCTATTCCGATGACCTTA-3′ (GreA 5′ terminus); 2) 5′-CGCGC TTACAGGTATTCCACCTTAATTAC-3′ (GreA 3′ terminus,:); 3) 5′-GCGCG AAACGCCCCTGGTTACC-3′ (GreB 5′ terminus); 4) 5′-CGCGC TTACGGTTTCACGTACTCGATAGC-3′ (GreB 3′ terminus); 5) 5′-CGCGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCAGGTATTCCACCTTAATTAC-3′ (GreA 3′ terminus); 6) 5′-CGCGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGGTTTCACGTACTCGATAGC-3′ (GreB 3′-terminus). Oligonucleotides 1 and 2, synthesized according to the DNA sequence of the greA gene (17Sparkowski J. Das A. Nucl. Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were used for PCR amplification of greA from E. coli DNA. The PCR product was purified by electrophoresis and digested with BamHI. The expression vector pTRC99A was digested with NcoI, filled in by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and then cleaved by BamHI. The greA fragment was inserted into the expression vector pTRC99A between the blunt end and BamHI sites. Ligation of these fragments yielded plasmid pMO1.1, which contained the greA gene under the control of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-inducible trc promoter. For engineering of the plasmid overproducing GreB, oligonucleotides 3 and 4 were used for PCR amplification of the greB gene from the plasmid pCF3. The purified PCR product was digested with BspHI and BamHI and inserted into linearized pTRC99A between the NcoI and BamHI sites. Ligation of these fragments yielded pMO1.4, which contained the greB gene under the control of the trc promoter. Plasmids overproducing His6-tagged GreA (pMO1.1His) and GreB (pMO1.4His) were obtained similarly, except that oligonucleotides 5 and 6 carrying His6 codons at the end of each gre gene were used for PCR. We engineered a set of 10 chimeric GreA/GreB molecules that carry N-terminal polypeptide fragments of one Gre protein fused to the C-terminal part of the other at amino acid positions 6, 12, 31, 81, and 107 of GreA. Ten hybrid primers were synthesized: the 5′-proximal half of each primer corresponded to the DNA fragment of one gre gene immediately upstream of the fusion and the 3′-proximal half corresponded to the fragment of the other gre gene immediately downstream of the fusion. All greA/greB hybrids were obtained by a conventional two-step PCR procedure. WT GreA and GreB were purified to apparent homogeneity as described (18Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274B: 315-326Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For isolation of His6-tagged GreA, greA−greB− E. coli (AD8571) cells transformed with pMO1.1His were grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as described (18Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274B: 315-326Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, homogenized in 5 ml of buffer A (7 M guanidine HCl, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was added to 0.8 ml of Ni2+-chelating NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) preequilibrated in buffer A. The suspension was incubated for 20 min at 25°C on a rotary shaker, and the beads were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and washed with 3 × 10 ml of buffer A. The adsorbed GreA was renatured by five subsequent washings of the beads with 5 ml of buffer B (the same as buffer A but without guanidine HCl) and eluted with 2 ml of buffer B, containing 0.6 M imidazole. The eluate was desalted and concentrated in Centricon-10 (Amicon). The resulting electrophoretically homogeneous His6-tagged GreA (1.2 mg in 200 μl) was stored at −20°C in buffer B containing 50% glycerol. His6-tagged GreB and GreA/GreB hybrids were purified essentially as described above. GreA/GreB-free RNAP holoenzyme (α,ββ′σ) was isolated from E. coli AD8571 strain, and RNAP carrying an insertion of 130 amino acids in β-subunit (βinsRNAP) was isolated from E. coli MKDC747 strain as described (12Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The read-through, antiarrest, and transcript cleavage assays were performed using a 202-base pair E. coli rrnB P1 DNA fragment as described previously (1Borukhov S. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V.

The beads were then washed in 3 × 500 μl of the same buffer. The yield of immobilized Gre factors was ∼95% for all proteins. 5 μg of RNAP holoenzyme in 20 μl of buffer C containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml of BSA were added to the beads and incubated with gentle shaking for 15 min. Free RNAP was removed by centrifugation, and the beads were washed twice with 100 μl of the same buffer.

An aliquot of each eluate (5 μl for all samples except 0.5 μl for WT GreB) was analyzed by denaturing 23% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by autoradiography and quantitation by PhosphorImager. In the control experiment, 6C-TEC was prepared as above but in the absence of beads, and His6-tagged GreA or GreB (100 μg/ml) were mixed with 2 μg of RNAP in 20 μl of transcription buffer. The resulting 6C-TEC was purified by gel filtration using Quick-Spin G-50, and an aliquot (1/200 of the total material) from each reaction was analyzed by PAGE. Photocross-linking experiments were performed using radioactively labeled 9A*-TEC carrying 8-N3AMP at the RNA 3′ terminus essentially as described previously for the cross-linking of GreA (16Stebbins C.E.

The mixture was diluted with 200 μl of buffer D containing 0.15 μg of thrombin and incubated at 37°C for 5 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 10 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate and analyzed by Tris-glycine SDS-14% PAGE followed by autoradiography. For proteolytic cleavage of GreB, the reaction mixture containing cross-linked GreB (1 × 105 cpm) was mixed with 4 μg of unlabeled GreB and incubated with 0.1 μg of AspN protease in 50 μl of buffer D containing 5 mM CaCl2 for 1 h at 30°C. Under these conditions, the cross-linked β′ was resistant to proteolysis by AspN (data not shown). The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (20 mM final concentration) and analyzed by Tris-Tricine SDS-14% PAGE and autoradiography. The 16-kDa proteolytic fragment carrying cross-linked RNA was purified as described above for β′ and digested with 1 μg of endoproteinase ArgC in buffer D containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 37°C. The reaction was terminated and analyzed as described above for AspN. The purified cross-linked species were mixed with 5 μg of the same purified unlabeled protein prior to chemical degradation. For cleavage at Cys, the proteins were treated with NTCB for 4 h at 37°C as described (20Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cleavage at Trp, the proteins were incubated with BNPS-skatole (10 mg/ml) in 70% acetic acid for 2 h, at 37°C according to 21Hunziker P.E. Hughes G.J. Wilson K.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 575-579Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar. CD spectra were obtained using an AVIV circular dichroism DS-62 spectrophotometer at 4°C. The buffers were 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 50 mM NaCl for GreA and 250 mM NaCl for GreB. Protein concentrations used for experiments were in the range of 15-40 μM. The path length of the cuvette was 0.1 cm. Data were collected every 1 nm with a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and the CD signal was averaged over 2 s. Each spectrum was averaged over four scans from 190 to 300 nm. The temperature dependence of the CD profiles was studied at 222 nm using a cuvette with the path length of 0.1 cm, and the temperature was varied from 5 to 60°C in 2°C increments. The samples were equilibrated for 2 min at each temperature point, and the CD signal was averaged over 30 s. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford's protein assay (22Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Tris-glycine and Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and Schagger et al. (24Schagger H.

Diffraction quality crystals of GreB have not been obtained yet. However, the high degree of functional (2Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and sequence homology (35% sequence identity) between E. coli GreA and GreB suggests that they have similar structures (25Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Moreover, examination of the sequence alignment reveals that key features of the GreA structure are conserved in GreB (16Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These features include hydrophobic residues that participate in forming the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil domain; charged residues that form interhelical salt bridges that stabilize the coiled-coil structure; all of the residues involved in interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains; and the helical bulge at position 24, causing a skip in the coiled-coil heptad repeat pattern.

Among them, paxillin is one of the important molecules interacting with a variety of signaling molecules and cytoskeletal building blocks.

These isoforms have distinct amino acid insertions; each consists of a distinct exon, at the same site of previously reported paxillin (paxillin α). Several proteins were co-precipitated with paxillin, and we found that β bound to focal adhesion kinase but weakly to vinculin, and γ bound to vinculin but only weakly to focal adhesion kinase, although both bound equally to talin. No additional proteins were found to bind to β and γ over those binding to α. Unlike the α isoform, β and γ mRNAs were not detected in normal tissues, but several cancer cells expressed both α and β proteins simultaneously. All three isoform proteins were expressed in promonocytic cells with ratios comparable with each other, and the expression patterns were altered during differentiation of floating promonocytic cells into adherent macrophage-like cells.

Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a critical role in directing cell motility, growth, differentiation, survival, and invasion through intracellular regulation of a variety of signals, such as protein tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium ion mobilization, inositol lipid metabolism, and proton efflux (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hynes R.O.

Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar).Integrins themselves have no intrinsic enzymatic activity; integrins appear to function by interacting with other proteins possessing cytoskeletal as well as catalytic signaling properties, primarily with their cytoplasmic domains (for reviews, see 4Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar and 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Otey C.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 205: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified as able to associate with the cytoplasmic domains of integrins or are localized to focal adhesion plaques where integrins interact with the ECM to connect the extracellular environment with intracellular effectors, resulting in the organization of the actin-containing cytoskeleton (for reviews, see 7Clark E.A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Conversely, intracellular events also affect integrin conformation and affinity to the ECM (for reviews, see 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar and 16Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that triggering of an integrin fibronectin receptor response involves hierarchies of protein interactions that assemble with the integrin (13Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 14Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind S.J. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin signaling pathways vary with integrin isoforms even within a single cell type (17Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus, to achieve a high diversity of integrin-mediated signals, different cytoskeletal building blocks and signal transducers may be engaged to each distinct integrin and focal assembly. Based on our current knowledge of the biochemical properties of protein-protein interactions among focal adhesion proteins, several possible architectures of complexes formed at focal adhesions or connecting integrins to actin stress fibers can be drawn. In this regard, α-actinin, talin, vinculin, and tensin have been shown to bind directly to actin; and α-actinin, talin, and focal adhesion kinase (Fak) (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 (for review, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Paxillin is also associated with the cytoplasmic peptide of integrin β1 (15; also see below). These proteins may interact with each other to connect integrin and actin. For example, vinculin binds to talin, tensin, and α-actinin (for review, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar); Fak binds to paxillin (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 20Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which binds to vinculin (18, 21; also see below). Different combinations of these actin- and integrin-binding proteins may then form different architectures of focal assembly frameworks. Protein modification such as tyrosine (and perhaps serine and threonine) phosphorylation, which mediates protein binding to the src homology 2 (SH2) domains could also participate in the alteration of the organization of the focal adhesion assembly (for review, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Moreover, a variety of alternative splicing products exist not only for integrins and ECM proteins but also for focal adhesion proteins, such as vinculin (22Glukhova M.A. Kabakov A.E. Frid M.G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Paxillin was originally identified as a substrate for the v-Src tyrosine kinase (27Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and shown to be highly localized at focal adhesion plaques (21Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning of human and chicken paxillins has revealed their primary structure (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). At its COOH terminus, paxillin contains four repeats of the LIM domain, which may mediate protein-protein interactions, as in the case of zyxin (29Schmeichel K.L. Beckerie M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Proteins interacting with these LIM domains are unknown. Besides putative LIM-mediated binding, paxillin has been shown to bind to vinculin (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Turner C.E.

Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and Fak (18- 20). In addition, paxillin binds to the SH3 domain of c-Src (31Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin can also be recovered within a complex of proteins binding to the cytoplasmic domain peptide of integrin β1 (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether this binding is direct, Fak is not essential for this binding (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is accompanied by cell adhesion to the ECM and disappears when the cell adhesions are not maintained (32Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin creates binding sites for the SH2 domains of COOH-terminal Src kinase (33Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and v-Crk, an adapter molecule that consists only of SH2 and SH3 domains (34Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell adhesion-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to affect the formation of focal adhesions and cell cycle progression to S phase (32Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of paxillin to cytoskeletal building blocks, which may result in connection of integrin with actin, and interaction of paxillin with a variety of signaling molecules highlight the important role of paxillin in focal adhesions. Paxillin and its modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, appear to be crucial in regulating focal adhesion assemblies, as well as integrin-mediated signal transduction.When we analyzed paxillin on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, we detected at least eight different spots cross-reacting with the anti-paxillin antibody. 2H. Sabe and H. Hanafusa, submitted for publication. Several seemed to be generated by tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (27Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 33Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31219-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that paxillin consists of several isoforms of primary protein structure. Thus, we were sensitive to this possibility when we isolated paxillin cDNAs. Moreover, we chose U937 human promonocyte cells as a source of mRNA for potential isolation of paxillin isoforms, the expression of which might be restricted to floating cells or change during the differentiation of the cells into macrophage-like cells, accompanied with altered cell adhesion (37Gidlund M. Orn A. Pattengale P.K. Jansson M. Wigzell H. Nilsson K. Nature. 1981; 292: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here, we report two different isoforms of paxillin, β and γ, generated by insertion of distinct exons. These two novel isoforms, along with the isoform previously reported (isoform α; 28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), were expressed simultaneously in monocyte cells. Several cancer cells expressed both α and β isoforms, but not the γ isoform. Biochemical analysis revealed that these isoforms exhibit different binding properties to several proteins, including Fak and vinculin. Moreover, during the maturation of monocyte cells, the protein level of the γ isoform was increased severalfold. The pattern of the expression of the β isoform was also changed during this process. Thus each isoform of paxillin appears to have distinct physiological functions, possibly through formation and maintenance of different architectures and signaling complexes of focal adhesions.DISCUSSIONWe characterized two novel isoforms of human paxillin generated by exon insertion. These novel isoforms exhibited different expression, and the patterns of the expression were altered during monocyte maturation. Moreover, biochemical analysis using recombinant proteins revealed differences in binding to several proteins, including focal adhesion proteins.Sequence analysis of the novel paxillin cDNAs revealed that both the β and γ isoforms have distinct insertions just after Lys277 of human paxillin α. Both of these insertions are followed by Phe278 and the remainder of the isoform α sequence. Analysis of the genomic structure revealed that there is indeed an exon breakpoint just after the codon for Lys277. After this codon begins an intron, and the exon encoding the sequence inserted in isoform β lies about 6 kb 3′ of this junction. This β-specific exon is followed by a short intron and then by an exon encoding the sequence inserted in isoform γ. The γ-specific exon connects directly to the sequence encoding Phe278. All of these introns have consensus 5′-GT and 3′-AG splice sites. The γ-specific exon ends with AG, followed by the TTC codon for Phe278 of isoform α. This kind of intronless exon-exon junction is found in other genes, such as caldesmon (44Hayashi K. Yano H. Hashida T. Takeuchi R. Takeda O. Asada K. Takahashi E. Kato I. Sobue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12122-12126Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 45Haruna M. Hayashi K. Yano H. Takeuchi O. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There may be additional exons, other than β- and γ-specific exons, within this 6.4-kb DNA fragment. So far, however, we have not detected other transcripts by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of cellular mRNAs using the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (primers 742-768 and 889-915) of the 6.4-kb DNA fragments as primers.We showed that each GST fusion form of paxillin isoforms co-precipitates focal adhesion proteins with a different affinity. Our experiments using radiolabeled cell lysates suggested that no additional proteins are bound to the β and γ isoforms over those binding to paxillin isoform α, and the γ isoform exhibits much decreased affinity toward cellular proteins. The β and γ isoforms bind to talin with affinities comparable to that of isoform α. However, binding to Fak and vinculin is altered greatly; β binds to Fak strongly but quite weakly to vinculin, whereas γ binds to vinculin but only weakly to Fak. Moreover, several proteins, such as Fak, vinculin, and bands D, F, and G in Fig. 4, appear to bind selectively to either β or γ isoforms. Deletion analysis of paxillin α has suggested that amino acids 56-100 are responsible for Fak and vinculin binding, and amino acids 100-277 bind to talin (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our β and γ isoforms contained inserts between Lys277 and Phe278 of isoform α. Thus, structures governing the binding sites for Fak and vinculin appear to be much more complicated in isoforms β and γ than those expected from the analysis of isoform α, and primary binding sites for Fak and vinculin may be distinct from each other in both β and γ isoforms. Moreover, one of our stocks of U937 cells lacked Fak expression. With cell lysates prepared from this cell line, each paxillin isoform showed essentially the same patterns of binding to vinculin and talin as in Fak-positive cell lysates (data not shown). Thus, Fak is not essential for the binding of paxillin isoforms to vinculin and talin.The architecture of the focal adhesion assembly may not be unique. It has not yet been established which focal adhesion proteins are used with which integrins or focal adhesions. The different and selective binding of γ isoforms to Fak and vinculin, for example, may involve localization of vinculin to certain types of focal adhesions independent of Fak. Indeed, the fact that focal adhesions are present in Fak-deficient fibroblasts indicates that Fak is not essential for certain types of adhesions (46Illic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). We also showed that the binding of the β isoform to vinculin is weak compared with those of isoforms α and γ. However, it should be noted that the amounts of vinculin as well as talin that bound to paxillin were quite low, compared with Fak binding to paxillin (see Fig. 3). Thus, it should be studied further whether the weak interaction of paxillin with vinculin and talin, detected in vitro, could have certain physiological relevance.Northern blotting analysis showed that mRNAs for both the β and γ isoforms were undetectable in normal tissues, whereas paxillin mRNA was clearly detected in most of normal tissues using a DNA probe encompassing nucleotides 1-1072 of the α isoform. This result indicates that isoform α is indeed expressed in normal tissues, as reported previously (28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Since DNA probes specific for the β and γ exons were relatively short (102 and 144 nucleotides in length, respectively), it may have been difficult to detect any low levels of the β and γ mRNA. However, a DNA probe of similar length prepared from isoform α cDNA using primers 742-768 and 889-915 (see Fig. 1B) did detect paxillin mRNA expression clearly in normal tissues as well as several cancer cells (data not shown).Although the β isoform mRNA is not detected in normal tissues, it is expressed in several cancer cells, such as SW480, HeLa, K562, and K549 cells. These β mRNA expression results recall the similar results of the increased levels of Fak mRNA observed only in metastatic and invasive cancers with no detectable expression in normal adult tissues or most benign tumors (47Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1024-1025Abstract PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although the cancer cells expressing the β isoform are highly tumorigenic in vivo, SW480 cells, in which the β isoform was detected at the highest level among cancer cells examined, do not exhibit the highest metastatic and invasive activity in vitro (for example, see 48Zucker S. Lysik R.M. Malik M. Bauer B.A. Caamano J. Klein-Szanto A.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and 49de Vries J.E. Dinjens W.N. De Bruyne G.K. Verspaget H.W. van der Linden E.P. de Bruine A.P. Mareel M.M. Bosman F.T. ten Kate J. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the correlation between the expression of the paxillin isoforms and tumorigenesis, metastasis, and invasiveness, processes in which integrins are deeply involved (50-52; for review, see 53Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), is interesting but should be studied in more detail.Expression of the γ isoform is much restricted. The γ isoform was not detected in any of samples we examined, except in U937 promonocytic cells. Since other cells with hematopoietc lineages, such as Jurkat, HPB-ALL, Raji, HL-60, Molt 4, and K562, were negative in its expression, expression of the γ isoform seems not to be specific for every hematopoietic lineage but more restricted for certain differentiation stages, including that of monocyte maturation.All three isoform proteins were expressed in U937 cells at levels comparable with each other. We found that the protein level of the γ isoform was markedly increased when U937 cells were differentiated into adherent monocyte- and macrophage-like cells by TPA. Modification of the β isoform was also accompanied by this process. In undifferentiated U937 cells, the amount of the γ isoform was smallest among the three isoforms. On the other hand, the amount of the γ isoform appeared to become higher than that of the β isoform after the differentiation and adherence of cells onto culture dishes. Human monocyte precursor cells express several families of integrins, and patterns of their expression are greatly altered during the monocyte differentiation that accompanies the changes in the binding properties of the cell toward different ECMs (54Van de Water L. Aronson D.A. Braman V. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5730-5737PubMed Google Scholar, 55Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). These properties are important in the homing and positioning of monocytic cells at the sites of inflammation. Indeed, in U937 cells, TPA treatment, which mimics most of the effects of tumor growth factor β1, enhances the expression of integrins α2 and αv, with a concomitant decrease in integrin α4 expression (42Ferreira O. Garcia-Pardo A. Bianco C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 43Bauvois B. Rouillard D. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar). Although the expression of integrin types varies greatly during the monocyte maturation, altered expression of integrins per se does not seem to be enough to account for the changes of cell adherence and motility (56Bauvois B. Van Weyenbergh J. Rouillard D. Wietzerbin J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is, thus, quite important to examine how much the changes in the expression of paxillin isoforms contribute to this process. Also, it would be quite interesting to see whether each isoform of paxillin assembles selectively with different types of integrins in monocyte cells.In conclusion, these paxillin isoform clones are useful tools with which to explore possible differences in the components, regulatory mechanisms, and signaling cascades of different types of focal adhesions within a single cell as well as among different types of integrins and cells. Although paxillin expression in brains of day 10 or day 12 chicken embryos, as well as in the human brain, is quite low (21Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R.

Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have detected high levels of paxillin mRNA in neural tubes during the early stages (stages 15-20, 50-72 h) of chicken embryogenesis, 3Y. Mazaki and H. Sabe, unpublished data. when neural crest cells actively migrate along their ECMs. Although the β and γ isoforms were undetectable in normal tissues, they may have been expressed at embryonic stages, at which cell movements and differentiation actively take place for morphogenesis. More precise analysis of the differences in the expression and localization of each paxillin isoform will contribute to clarifying our understanding of the role of paxillin and focal adhesions during embryogenesis, cell adhesion, movement and invasion, and cancer metastasis. INTRODUCTIONIntegrin αβ heterodimers mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrixes (ECMs) 1The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixFakfocal adhesion kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseSHsrc homologyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFCSfetal calf serumTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetatePCRpolymerase chain reactionAbantibodykbkilobase. and to other cells. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a critical role in directing cell motility, growth, differentiation, survival, and invasion through intracellular regulation of a variety of signals, such as protein tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium ion mobilization, inositol lipid metabolism, and proton efflux (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hynes R.O.

Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar).Integrins themselves have no intrinsic enzymatic activity; integrins appear to function by interacting with other proteins possessing cytoskeletal as well as catalytic signaling properties, primarily with their cytoplasmic domains (for reviews, see 4Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar and 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Otey C.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 205: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified as able to associate with the cytoplasmic domains of integrins or are localized to focal adhesion plaques where integrins interact with the ECM to connect the extracellular environment with intracellular effectors, resulting in the organization of the actin-containing cytoskeleton (for reviews, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar and 10Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Conversely, intracellular events also affect integrin conformation and affinity to the ECM (for reviews, see 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar and 16Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that triggering of an integrin fibronectin receptor response involves hierarchies of protein interactions that assemble with the integrin (13Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 14Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind S.J. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin signaling pathways vary with integrin isoforms even within a single cell type (17Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus, to achieve a high diversity of integrin-mediated signals, different cytoskeletal building blocks and signal transducers may be engaged to each distinct integrin and focal assembly. Based on our current knowledge of the biochemical properties of protein-protein interactions among focal adhesion proteins, several possible architectures of complexes formed at focal adhesions or connecting integrins to actin stress fibers can be drawn. In this regard, α-actinin, talin, vinculin, and tensin have been shown to bind directly to actin; and α-actinin, talin, and focal adhesion kinase (Fak) (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 (for review, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Paxillin is also associated with the cytoplasmic peptide of integrin β1 (15; also see below). These proteins may interact with each other to connect integrin and actin. For example, vinculin binds to talin, tensin, and α-actinin (for review, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar); Fak binds to paxillin (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 20Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which binds to vinculin (18, 21; also see below). Different combinations of these actin- and integrin-binding proteins may then form different architectures of focal assembly frameworks. Protein modification such as tyrosine (and perhaps serine and threonine) phosphorylation, which mediates protein binding to the src homology 2 (SH2) domains could also participate in the alteration of the organization of the focal adhesion assembly (for review, see 7Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Moreover, a variety of alternative splicing products exist not only for integrins and ECM proteins but also for focal adhesion proteins, such as vinculin (22Glukhova M.A. Kabakov A.E. Frid M.G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Paxillin was originally identified as a substrate for the v-Src tyrosine kinase (27Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and shown to be highly localized at focal adhesion plaques (21Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). cDNA cloning of human and chicken paxillins has revealed their primary structure (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). At its COOH terminus, paxillin contains four repeats of the LIM domain, which may mediate protein-protein interactions, as in the case of zyxin (29Schmeichel K.L. Beckerie M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Proteins interacting with these LIM domains are unknown. Besides putative LIM-mediated binding, paxillin has been shown to bind to vinculin (18Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Turner C.E.

Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and Fak (18- 20). In addition, paxillin binds to the SH3 domain of c-Src (31Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin can also be recovered within a complex of proteins binding to the cytoplasmic domain peptide of integrin β1 (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether this binding is direct, Fak is not essential for this binding (15Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is accompanied by cell adhesion to the ECM and disappears when the cell adhesions are not maintained (32Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin creates binding sites for the SH2 domains of COOH-terminal Src kinase (33Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and v-Crk, an adapter molecule that consists only of SH2 and SH3 domains (34Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C.

Inhibition of cell adhesion-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to affect the formation of focal adhesions and cell cycle progression to S phase (32Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of paxillin to cytoskeletal building blocks, which may result in connection of integrin with actin, and interaction of paxillin with a variety of signaling molecules highlight the important role of paxillin in focal adhesions. Paxillin and its modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, appear to be crucial in regulating focal adhesion assemblies, as well as integrin-mediated signal transduction.When we analyzed paxillin on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, we detected at least eight different spots cross-reacting with the anti-paxillin antibody. 2H. Sabe and H. Hanafusa, submitted for publication. Several seemed to be generated by tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (27Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 33Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31219-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that paxillin consists of several isoforms of primary protein structure. Thus, we were sensitive to this possibility when we isolated paxillin cDNAs. Moreover, we chose U937 human promonocyte cells as a source of mRNA for potential isolation of paxillin isoforms, the expression of which might be restricted to floating cells or change during the differentiation of the cells into macrophage-like cells, accompanied with altered cell adhesion (37Gidlund M. Orn A. Pattengale P.K. Jansson M. Wigzell H. Nilsson K. Nature. 1981; 292: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Here, we report two different isoforms of paxillin, β and γ, generated by insertion of distinct exons. These two novel isoforms, along with the isoform previously reported (isoform α; 28Salgia R. Lin J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), were expressed simultaneously in monocyte cells. Several cancer cells expressed both α and β isoforms, but not the γ isoform. Biochemical analysis revealed that these isoforms exhibit different binding properties to several proteins, including Fak and vinculin. Moreover, during the maturation of monocyte cells, the protein level of the γ isoform was increased severalfold. The pattern of the expression of the β isoform was also changed during this process. Thus each isoform of paxillin appears to have distinct physiological functions, possibly through formation and maintenance of different architectures and signaling complexes of focal adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2021892283,"Recent evidence suggests that the rate of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) translocation may be a key regulatory point in the production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. We have developed an in vitro system to measure the translocation rate of apoB in HepG2 cells. Intact cells were initially pretreated with oleate and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal to maximize the translocation rate while minimizing degradation. Cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine, chased (5-30 min), and then permeabilized with digitonin (75 μg/ml). Permeabilized cells were incubated with or without trypsin (200 μg/ml) for 10 min, and digestion was halted with soybean trypsin inhibitor (2 mg/ml). The rate of translocation was determined by comparing the amount of immunoprecipitable intact apoB in trypsin-treated cells with that in control cells at each time point. Under these conditions, two control proteins, α1-antitrypsin and transferrin, were fully protected from trypsin digestion, confirming the integrity of the secretory pathway in permeabilized cells.The percentage of apoB translocated steadily increased from 36% after 5 min to 71% after a 30-min chase (mean percentage, n = 3). A characteristic apoB fragmentation pattern resulted from trypsin digestion, and protected fragments of various size including N-terminal 60-70-kDa fragments were identified. Subcellular fractionation of the cells confirmed that the apoB pool protected from trypsin digestion was luminal in nature, confirming its translocation. ApoB translocation was significantly increased in oleate-treated cells compared with untreated cells. Inhibition of peptidylprolyl isomerase through the use of cyclosporin A and disruption of disulfide bond formation using dithiothreitol reduced the percentage of translocated apoB by 37 and 63%, respectively. Dithiothreitol induced specific changes in the pattern of protected apoB fragments, suggesting a conformational change in apoB that may hinder its translocation. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin did not significantly alter the rate of apoB translocation but appeared to stimulate its degradation. Together, the data suggest that the rate of apoB translocation across the membrane of the ER is determined by both lipid availability as well as the correct conformation of nascent apoB molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2038028591,"Myosin light chain kinase binds to the actomyosin-containing filaments in smooth and nonmuscle cells. However, the region of the kinase necessary for this high affinity binding in vivo is not known, although it has been proposed that the N and C termini bind to actin and myosin in vitro, respectively. Truncated myosin light chain kinases containing the catalytic core and calmodulin-binding domain but lacking N (amino acids 1-655) and/or C (amino acids 1004-1147) termini were expressed in the baculovirus system and purified. All enzymes were catalytically active and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent. The C-terminal truncated myosin light chain kinase bound to detergent-washed smooth muscle contractile proteins similar to recombinant full-length myosin light chain kinase or enzyme purified from smooth muscle. The apparent affinity of the full-length kinase was greater for the actomyosin-containing filaments with associated proteins than for purified smooth muscle F-actin or actomyosin filaments from skeletal muscle. In contrast, truncations at the N terminus alone or at both N and C termini resulted in no significant binding. Similar effects were observed by two other assays: binding of fluorescently labeled myosin light chain kinases to actin-containing stress fibers in detergent-treated fibroblasts and localization of fluorescently labeled kinases after microinjection into primary smooth muscle cells in culture. The full-length and the C-terminal truncated myosin light chain kinases, but not myosin light chain kinases truncated at the N terminus or both N and C termini, associated with filaments in cells. Thus, the N terminus and not the C terminus of myosin light chain kinase is necessary for high affinity binding to actomyosin-containing filaments in smooth and nonmuscle cells. Myosin light chain kinase binds to the actomyosin-containing filaments in smooth and nonmuscle cells. However, the region of the kinase necessary for this high affinity binding in vivo is not known, although it has been proposed that the N and C termini bind to actin and myosin in vitro, respectively. Truncated myosin light chain kinases containing the catalytic core and calmodulin-binding domain but lacking N (amino acids 1-655) and/or C (amino acids 1004-1147) termini were expressed in the baculovirus system and purified. All enzymes were catalytically active and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent. The C-terminal truncated myosin light chain kinase bound to detergent-washed smooth muscle contractile proteins similar to recombinant full-length myosin light chain kinase or enzyme purified from smooth muscle. The apparent affinity of the full-length kinase was greater for the actomyosin-containing filaments with associated proteins than for purified smooth muscle F-actin or actomyosin filaments from skeletal muscle. In contrast, truncations at the N terminus alone or at both N and C termini resulted in no significant binding.

https://openalex.org/W2046127182,"Apolipoprotein A-I contains eight 22-amino acid and two 11-amino acid tandem repeats that comprise 80% of the mature protein. These repeating units are believed to be the basic motif responsible for lipid binding and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activation. Computer analysis indicates that despite a fairly high degree of compositional similarity among the tandem repeats, significant differences in hydrophobic and amphipathic character exist. Our previous studies demonstrated that deletion of repeat 6 (143-164) or repeat 7 (165-186) resulted in a 98-99% reduction of LCAT activation as compared with wild-type apoA-I. To determine the effects of substituting one of these repeats with a more hydrophobic repeat we constructed a mutant apoA-I protein in which residues 143-164 (repeat 6) were replaced with repeat 10 (residues 220-241). The cloned mutant protein, 10F6 apoA-I, was expressed and purified from an Sf-9 cell baculoviral system and then analyzed using a number of biophysical and biochemical techniques. Recombinant complexes prepared at a 100:5:1 molar ratio of L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:wild-type or 10F6 apoA-I showed a doublet corresponding to Stokes diameters of 114 and 108 Å on nondenaturing 4-30% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. L-α-Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine 10F6 apoA-I complexes had a 5-6-fold lower apparent Vmax/apparent Km as compared with wild-type apoA-I containing particles. As expected, monoclonal antibody epitope mapping of the lipid-free and lipid-bound 10F6 apoA-I confirmed that a domain expressed between residues 143 and 165 normally found in wild-type apoA-I was absent. The region between residues 119 and 144 in 10F6 apoA-I showed a marked reduction in monoclonal antibody binding capacity. Therefore, we speculate that the 5-6-fold lower LCAT reactivity in 10F6 compared with wild-type apoA-I recombinant particles results from increased stabilization within the 121-165 amino acid domain due to more stable apoprotein helix phospholipid interactions as well as from conformational alterations among adjacent amphipathic helix repeats.

The predominant protein constituent of HDL, apoA-I, solubilizes and organizes phospholipid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester in plasma and facilitates the distribution of cholesteryl ester between hepatic and extrahepatic tissue. Conversion of nascent HDLs or discoidal complexes into mature HDL particles is mediated by the plasma enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). When activated by apoA-I, LCAT catalyzes the conversion of HDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesteryl esters (4Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys.

ApoA-I contains 10 tandem repeats, each having substantial α-helical character that typically begin with a proline residue, a feature that is shared within the entire apolipoprotein supergene family. These repeats comprise approximately 80% of the total protein and are divided into two 11-mer units and eight 22-mer units (15Luo C.C. Li W.H. Moore M.N. Chan L. J. Mol.

When displayed on an Edmunson wheel, the α-helices show a distinctive amphipathic character with separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces. The amphipathic nature of these repeating units is believed to be responsible for the ability of apoA-I to organize lipid and to activate LCAT (17Segrest J.P. Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D.

Progress toward obtaining crystals of either lipid-free or lipid-bound apoA-I has been slow, and a three-dimensional crystal structure is not available to reconcile the different models. We have continued our investigation into the structure-function relationships of apoA-I by constructing a 22-mer substitution mutant in a region previously shown to be necessary for LCAT activation. Sequential deletion of any one of the 10 tandem repeats results in a modest (30%) or dramatic (99%) reduction in LCAT reactivity compared with wild-type apoA-I (25Sorci-Thomas M. Kearns M.W. Lee J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21403-21409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several studies (26Minnich A. Collet X. Roghani A. Cladaras C. Hamilton R.L. Fielding C.J. Zannis V.I. J.

In this paper, we report the properties of a mutant apoA-I protein in which repeat 6 (residues 143-164) was replaced with a copy of repeat 10 (residues 220-241). The cloned mutant protein, called 10F6 apoA-I, was expressed and purified from an Sf-9 cell baculoviral system and used for biophysical characterization, monoclonal antibody epitope mapping, and LCAT reactivity measurements. In this report, we describe those structural features of the residue 121-186 domain that are important for optimal LCAT activation. HPLC grade organic solvents were purchased from Fisher. All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. [3H]Cholesterol was purchased from DuPont NEN. Tissue culture reagents, restriction endonucleases, and other DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I cDNA:pBlueBac III constructs were used in conjunction with the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus linear viral DNA for co-transfection into Sf-9 cells, as described previously (28Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type and mutant baculoviral clones were purified and used for the generation of high titer viral stocks as described previously (28Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent degradation of the expressed protein, pepstatin A and leupeptin (at a final concentration of 700 μg/liter and 500 μg/liter) were added to the culture medium 36 h postinfection (29Pyle L.E. Fujiwara Y. Mitchell A. Fidge N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2355-2361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation and purification of recombinant wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I protein were carried out as previously reported (28Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at the time of harvest (50-72 h), Sf-9 medium was spun at 4°C, 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was adjusted to 10% acetonitrile (v/v). The adjusted medium was loaded onto a C-18 reverse phase (50 × 5-cm) HPLC column and washed with 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. ApoA-I was eluted from the column in 1 h at a flow rate of 10 ml/min using a linear gradient of 10-95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at ambient temperature. The partially purified apoA-I was adjusted to 5 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 8 M urea and then applied to a DEAE-Fast-Sepharose anionic exchange column (16 × 3 cm). ApoA-I eluted at approximately 9 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 8 M urea using a linear gradient (200 ml each) that went from 5 mM Tris, pH 8.0, to 150 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 8 M urea at a flow rate of 144 ml/h. The final purified protein was dissolved in 1 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, and its concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the proteins was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Quattro II mass spectrometer. A molar ratio of 100:5:1 phospholipid to cholesterol to apoA-I protein was used for making discoidal complexes as described previously (28Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.1 mg of L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in chloroform (30 mg/ml) was added to 60 μg of cholesterol in ethanol (10 mg/ml) and 10 μl of radiolabeled cholesterol (1,2-3H) (50 Ci/mmol) in ethanol. Organic solvent was removed under a stream of argon, and the tubes were placed under vacuum for 30 min. 2.7 mg of sodium cholate was added, and the solution was vortexed and then incubated for 30 min at 39°C. The mixture was briefly vortexed three times during the 30-min incubation. To this mixture was added 0.9 mg of wild-type or mutant apoA-I, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h at 39°C. Sodium cholate was removed by dialysis against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, and 0.15 mM sodium azide at 39°C. Recombinant discoidal complexes were purified by passage through a Superose 12 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (55 × 1.8 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Phospholipid, protein, and cholesterol assays were performed to determine the final molar composition of the recombinant discoidal complexes (28Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Discoidal complex size was determined using nondenaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. Briefly, gels were run for 3,000 V-h and then fixed in 10% sulfosalicylic acid (31Rainwater D.L. Andres D.W. Ford A.L. Lowe W.F. Blanche P.J. Krauss R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1876-1881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following fixation, gels were stained in Coomassie G-250 overnight and then destained in 7.5% acetic acid for 1-2 days. Gels were scanned using a Zeineh scanning densitometer model SL-504-XL. Discoidal particle size was determined by comparison with protein standards of known Stokes radii. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at 25°C using a 0.1-cm path length cell. Ellipticity was measured at 222 nm. Five scans were recorded and averaged, and the background was subtracted. Mean molar residue ellipticity (Θ) is reported as degrees·cm 2L. Curtiss and M. G. Sorci-Thomas, unpublished observations.·dmol−1 and calculated from the equation, [Θ] = Θobs·115/10·l·c, where Θobs is the observed ellipticity at 222 nm in degrees, 115 is the mean residue molecular weight of the protein, l is the optical path length in centimeters, and c is the protein concentration in g/ml. The percentage of α-helix was calculated from the formula of Chen et al. (32Chen Y.-H. Yang Y.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), [Θ]222 = −30,300fh− 2,340. Stability of the discoidal 10F6 and wild-type DMPC complexes was determined by plotting the mean residue ellipticity versus guanidine HCl concentration and expressed as the concentration of guanidine HCl (D1/2) that reduced the ellipticity by 50%. Competitive solid phase immunoassays were used to assess the binding of monoclonal antibodies to lipid-free apoA-I and recombinant DMPC phospholipid complexes containing apoA-I. With two exceptions (antibodies AI-17 and AI-141.7), each antibody used in this study has been described, and its epitopes on wild-type apoA-I have been documented (32Chen Y.-H. Yang Y.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). The epitopes of antibodies AI-17 and AI-147.7 were localized to residues 143-165 and 220-242, respectively, on the basis of their binding to numerous apoA-I mutant proteins described previously.2Castelli W.P.

Assoc. 1986; 256: 2835-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar The immunoassays were performed as described (33Curtiss L.K. Banka C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 884-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated human plasma apoA-I or plasma HDL (0.05 ml of 5 μg/ml) was immobilized onto 96-well Falcon 3911 Microtest III flexible assay plates. After coating the plates, increasing amounts of purified apoA-I or recombinant A-I discs (0.025 ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% normal goat serum were added to wells in the presence of 0.025 ml of ascites fluid containing a limiting amount of monoclonal antibody (typically dilutions of 10−4 to 10−6). Competitor concentrations listed in the figures represent the final concentrations (μg/ml) in the 0.05-ml reaction mixture. The plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing the wells, mouse antibody binding to the immobilized antigen was detected by a second 1-h incubation at 37°C with 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. All data were expressed as B/Bo, where B is the cpm bound in the presence of competitor, and Bo is the cpm bound in the absence of competitor. To compare the affinity of the antibodies for DMPC discs containing wild-type or mutant apoA-I's competitor, the slopes of logit-transformed B/Bo ratios were obtained by linear regression and subjected to tests of equality. The LCAT reaction was monitored by following the cholesterol to cholesteryl ester conversion using recombinant discoidal complexes containing either wild-type or 10F6 apoA-I. The complexes were assayed in duplicate using 0-3.0 μg of substrate cholesterol in a final concentration of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, and 0.15 mM sodium azide, 0.6% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 25 ng of purified human plasma LCAT (kindly provided by Dr. J. S. Parks). The reactions were carried out for 60 min at 37°C, and the conversion of [3H]cholesterol to [3H]cholesteryl ester was determined by lipid extraction of the incubation mixture followed by thin layer chromatography (28Sorci-Thomas M. Parks J.S. Kearns M.W. Pate G.N. Zhang C. Thomas M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 673-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of cholesterol esterification was kept below 15% to maintain first order kinetics. Background values were determined by omitting LCAT from the reaction tube. The fractional cholesterol esterification rate was multiplied by the nmol of substrate cholesterol in the assay tube, corrected for the background, and converted to nmol of cholesterol ester formed/h/ml of LCAT. Apparent Vmax and Km values were determined from Hanes-Woolf plots (34Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 233-245Google Scholar) of discoidal cholesterol substrate concentration (μM) divided by the cholesterol ester formation rate (nmol/h/ml of LCAT) versus discoidal cholesterol concentration (μM). The activation energy (Ea) for cholesterol ester formation was derived from Arrhenius plots of the LCAT reactivity of wild-type and 10F6 discoidal substrates. Reactions were performed at 37, 34, 31, 28, and 25°C using 0.55 μg of discoidal cholesterol substrate and 25 ng of purified human LCAT. Arrhenius plots were constructed as the reciprocal of incubation temperature in Kelvin versus the log of cholesteryl ester formed (nmol/h) (34Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 233-245Google Scholar). Linear regression analysis was used to determine the activation energy according to the formula, Ea(cal/mol) = −2.3R(slope), where R is the gas constant (1.987 cal/deg−1/mol−1). Values are given as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test. To test whether substitution of a single 22-mer repeat located at 143-164 (repeat 6) would alter apoA-I's ability to bind lipid or to activate LCAT, we replaced repeat 6 of wild-type apoA-I with repeat 10 (corresponding to amino acids 220-241). The boxed region in Fig. 1 shows the primary amino acid sequence of wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I within the residue 143-164 domain. The mutant protein 10F6 apoA-I contains one copy of repeat 10 inserted in the region normally occupied by repeat 6 and another copy of repeat 10 in its native position, 220-241. Also shown in Fig. 1 is the calculated hydrophobic moment (<μH>) and the average hydrophobicity (H) for the entire boxed 22-mer amphipathic helix. The calculated values, <μH> and H, for this region in wild type and 10F6 are <μH> = 0.37, H = −0.30 and <μH> = 0.24, H = +0.24, respectively (35Rose G.D. Dworkin J.E. Fasman G.D.

Fasman G.D. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation: Hydrophobic Moments as Tools for Analyzing Protein Sequences and Structures. Plenum Press, New York1989: 635-646Crossref Google Scholar). Replacing repeat 6 with repeat 10 increases the hydrophobicity of the 143-164 region in 10F6 apoA-I from −0.30 to +0.24, reflecting the greater proportion of nonpolar and uncharged amino acids in this 22-mer. Recombinant HDL complexes were prepared using a molar ratio of 100:5:1, DMPC:cholesterol:apoA-I, respectively. Fig. 2 shows a Coomassie-stained 4-30% nondenaturing gradient gel of 10F6, wild-type, and plasma apoA-I containing recombinant discoidal complexes. The gel shows doublets corresponding to Stokes diameters of 114 and 108 Å for each of the recombinant apoA-I complexes prepared. The final DMPC:cholesterol:apoA-I ratio of the three discoidal preparations was 98.1:4.1:1, 90.7:4.8:1, and 104:4.0:1 for 10F6, wild-type, and plasma apoA-I-containing particles, respectively. The effect of the 10F6 apoA-I replacement mutation on the overall secondary structure of wild-type apoA-I protein was first examined by determining the percentage of α-helix content. Both lipid-free and lipid-bound wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. As shown in Table I, a trend toward a higher α-helix content for both the lipid-free and lipid-bound 10F6 apoA-I compared with wild-type apoA-I was noted. However, these differences did not reach statistical significance at the level of p < 0.05. When examined in the lipid-bound state, the α-helix content for each of the apoA-Is studied increased compared to its lipid-free state (Table I).Table IPercentage α-helix content of wild-type and 10F6 apoA-IWithout DMPCWith DMPCWild-type apoA-I42.8 ± 7.167.2 ± 4.0Plasma apoA-I47.0 ± 7.865.3 ± 8.710F6 apoA-I49.1 ± 4.872.5 ± 4.4 Open table in a new tab Although the 10F6 apoA-I substitution did not show a statistically significant change in its α-helix content compared with lipid-free or lipid-bound wild-type apoA-I, the DMPC 10F6 apoA-I recombinant complexes were found to be less susceptible to guanidine HCl denaturation than DMPC wild-type apoA-I complexes. Guanidine HCl denaturation of DMPC 10F6 apoA-I complexes gave a D1/2 = 2.8 M, while DMPC wild-type complexes gave a D1/2 = 2.1 M (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the lipid-protein interaction in DMPC 10F6 complexes was more stable than that for DMPC wild-type apoA-I complexes. In the next set of experiments the effects of substituting apoA-I's repeat 6 with repeat 10 were evaluated with respect to the protein's ability to activate LCAT. Kinetic studies were conducted, and the Km and Vmax of the reactions are summarized in Table II. The apparent Km values are 1.2 and 6.0 μM and the apparent Vmax values are 51.0 and 48.0 nmol/ml·h for DMPC wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I complexes, respectively (Table II). The overall efficiency for the LCAT reaction, referred to as the apparent Vmax/apparent Km, was calculated to be 42.5 and 8.0 nmol/ml·h·/μM for DMPC wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I complexes, respectively. To probe the mechanistic basis for the lower LCAT efficiency observed with the 10F6 apoA-I-containing particles, the energy of activation was measured as a function of temperature. The Arrhenius plots shown in Fig. 3 produced activation energies of 16.0 and 25.3 kcal/mol for DMPC wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I complexes, respectively.Table II.Reaction kinetics of recombinant HDL particles with LCATDiscoidal substrateApparent KmApparent VmaxApparent Vmax/KmμMnmol/ml · hnmol/ml · h/μMDMPC-wild-type apoA-I1.2aKinetic constants for wild-type versus 10F6 apoA-I were significantly different at p < 0.001.± 0.3651.0 ± 17.8042.5aKinetic constants for wild-type versus 10F6 apoA-I were significantly different at p < 0.001.± 14.42DMPC-10F6 apoA-I6.0 ± 1.9848.0 ± 13.917.9 ± 2.52a Kinetic constants for wild-type versus 10F6 apoA-I were significantly different at p < 0.001.

First, the binding capacity of each antibody for lipid-free wild-type or 10F6 apoA-I were compared in competitive immunoassays. The results are tabulated in Table III. Six antibodies that identify N-terminal epitopes between residues 1 and 126 and three antibodies that identify C-terminal epitopes between residues 178 and 242 bound well to both apoproteins. These antibodies gave binding ratios (10F6 to wild type) of 5 or less, indicating that these particular epitopes were expressed by both apoproteins and that there were only minimal differences in the extent of epitope expression between the two apoA-I proteins.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In comparison with the thrombin receptor, little is known regarding how other signaling molecules are involved in the PAR2-mediated pathway. In this report, we demonstrate that SHP2 acts as a positive regulator in PAR2-mediated mitogenic signal transduction through a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating G protein-coupled receptors. PAR2 is a newly identified G protein-coupled receptor, which, like the thrombin receptor, is activated by a proteolytic mechanism. Upon stimulation with its ligand, PAR2, expressed either endogenously or exogenously, activates a mitogenic pathway, resulting in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and an increase of early gene transcription through the activation of the c-fos promoter. Vanadate, a potent inhibitor of PTPs, completely blocked the stimulatory activation of the c-fos promoter, suggesting that PTP(s) may have been involved in modulating the PAR2-mediated pathway. Of several SLIGRL-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected, we have identified one as the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing PTP, SHP2. Once tyrosine-phosphorylated, SHP2 rapidly underwent dephosphorylation (Fig. 5).Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin resulted in inhibition of both the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and the activation of the c-fos promoter by ligand stimulation, indicating that PAR2 is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein. However, while pertussis toxin completely blocked the ligand-activated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2, this drug could not entirely suppress the ligand-induced activation of the c-fos promoter. Approximate 40% of the ligand-stimulated early gene transcription was not inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig. 7), indicating that the remaining activation (40%) of the c-fos promoter in the drug-treated cells was produced in PAR2-mediated mitogenic pathways through functional coupling to other G proteins insensitive to pertussis toxin in 293 cells.SHP1, a structurally related PTP, was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in the thrombin receptor mediated-pathway (20Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 21Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), but its potential function in the signaling is still unknown. In this report, we found that in addition to being tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to SLIGRL-mediated stimulation, SHP2 also appears to actively regulate PAR2-mediated signaling. Overexpression of wild-type SHP2 slightly increased the ligand-stimulated activation of the c-fos promoter and DNA synthesis, whereas expression of its catalytically inactive mutant strongly suppressed both the ligand-stimulated activation of early gene transcription and DNA synthesis, suggesting that the intrinsic phosphatase activity of SHP2 can function as a positive regulator in a G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling. In a number of growth factor-activated pathways in which SHP2 has been reported as a positive regulator, the catalytically inactive mutant of SHP2 displayed a similar suppressive effect on mitogen activated-pathways (22Rivard N.

Upon activation of the growth factor receptors, SHP2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and its SH2 domains bound to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sites of the ligand-activated receptors, such as Tyr-954 of the EGF receptor, Tyr-1009 of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Tyr-546/Tyr-895/Tyr-1172/Tyr-1222 of insulin receptor substrate-1 (32Kazlauskas A.

However, in the PAR2-mediated pathway, we were unable to detect an association of SHP2 with the activated PAR2 by co-immunoprecipitation. Consistent with this, we were also unable to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of PAR2 with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Therefore, in contrast to receptor-PTK-mediated signaling, in the PAR2-activated pathway, SHP2 does not appear to interact directly with PAR2. It may interact with other signaling proteins, which are recruited by the activated PAR2 during its functional coupling to G protein(s). A PTK is likely activated in response to the ligand stimulation, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and other proteins. The nature of this specific tyrosine kinase is yet to be identified.Although our data suggest that SHP2 functions as a positive regulator in PAR2-mediated signaling, the precise mechanism by which the inactive mutant SHP2 is capable of attenuating SLIGRL ligand-activated mitogenic signaling is presently unknown. It is known that the c-fos promoter is activated by various signals primarily through a kinase cascade linked to Ras-dependent pathways. It is also known that PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C, induces mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in a Ras-independent manner (38Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Since the mutant SHP2 strongly suppressed the ligand-stimulated c-fos promoter activity and DNA synthesis, but the inactive phosphatase did not interfere with PMA activation of the gene, it appears that the mutant SHP2 targets an upstream molecule in the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, rather than downstream effector(s). One possible target for SHP2 is a potent regulator in signaling, which is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. This regulator protein may be dephosphorylated by SHP2 on phosphotyrosine site(s) which negatively regulate(s) its function, resulting in its activation, such as the Src family of kinases. Identification of such physiological substrate(s) of SHP2 in cells would lead to the elucidation of how the phosphatase positively regulates these signal transduction pathways.

In this report, we demonstrate that SHP2 acts as a positive regulator in PAR2-mediated mitogenic signal transduction through a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein. Many extracellular signals are transmitted to the interior of the cell by seven transmembrane-spanning receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G protein; subunits, αβγ). G protein-mediated signaling is perhaps the most conserved evolutionary mechanism by which eukaryotic cells respond to a wide variety of information reaching the cell surface. Thus, G protein-coupled receptors constitute the largest family of plasma membrane receptors. In contrast to the conventional model for receptor-ligand interaction, the thrombin receptor (1Vu T.-K.H.

In comparison with the thrombin receptor, little is known regarding how other signaling molecules are involved in the PAR2-mediated pathway. In this report, we demonstrate that SHP2 acts as a positive regulator in PAR2-mediated mitogenic signal transduction through a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein. DISCUSSIONRecent studies have suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating G protein-coupled receptors. PAR2 is a newly identified G protein-coupled receptor, which, like the thrombin receptor, is activated by a proteolytic mechanism. Upon stimulation with its ligand, PAR2, expressed either endogenously or exogenously, activates a mitogenic pathway, resulting in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and an increase of early gene transcription through the activation of the c-fos promoter. Vanadate, a potent inhibitor of PTPs, completely blocked the stimulatory activation of the c-fos promoter, suggesting that PTP(s) may have been involved in modulating the PAR2-mediated pathway. Of several SLIGRL-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected, we have identified one as the Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing PTP, SHP2. Once tyrosine-phosphorylated, SHP2 rapidly underwent dephosphorylation (Fig. 5).Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin resulted in inhibition of both the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and the activation of the c-fos promoter by ligand stimulation, indicating that PAR2 is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein. However, while pertussis toxin completely blocked the ligand-activated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2, this drug could not entirely suppress the ligand-induced activation of the c-fos promoter. Approximate 40% of the ligand-stimulated early gene transcription was not inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig. 7), indicating that the remaining activation (40%) of the c-fos promoter in the drug-treated cells was produced in PAR2-mediated mitogenic pathways through functional coupling to other G proteins insensitive to pertussis toxin in 293 cells.SHP1, a structurally related PTP, was also tyrosine-phosphorylated in the thrombin receptor mediated-pathway (20Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 21Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), but its potential function in the signaling is still unknown. In this report, we found that in addition to being tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to SLIGRL-mediated stimulation, SHP2 also appears to actively regulate PAR2-mediated signaling. Overexpression of wild-type SHP2 slightly increased the ligand-stimulated activation of the c-fos promoter and DNA synthesis, whereas expression of its catalytically inactive mutant strongly suppressed both the ligand-stimulated activation of early gene transcription and DNA synthesis, suggesting that the intrinsic phosphatase activity of SHP2 can function as a positive regulator in a G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signaling. In a number of growth factor-activated pathways in which SHP2 has been reported as a positive regulator, the catalytically inactive mutant of SHP2 displayed a similar suppressive effect on mitogen activated-pathways (22Rivard N.

Upon activation of the growth factor receptors, SHP2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and its SH2 domains bound to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sites of the ligand-activated receptors, such as Tyr-954 of the EGF receptor, Tyr-1009 of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Tyr-546/Tyr-895/Tyr-1172/Tyr-1222 of insulin receptor substrate-1 (32Kazlauskas A.

However, in the PAR2-mediated pathway, we were unable to detect an association of SHP2 with the activated PAR2 by co-immunoprecipitation. Consistent with this, we were also unable to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of PAR2 with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Therefore, in contrast to receptor-PTK-mediated signaling, in the PAR2-activated pathway, SHP2 does not appear to interact directly with PAR2. It may interact with other signaling proteins, which are recruited by the activated PAR2 during its functional coupling to G protein(s). A PTK is likely activated in response to the ligand stimulation, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and other proteins. The nature of this specific tyrosine kinase is yet to be identified.Although our data suggest that SHP2 functions as a positive regulator in PAR2-mediated signaling, the precise mechanism by which the inactive mutant SHP2 is capable of attenuating SLIGRL ligand-activated mitogenic signaling is presently unknown. It is known that the c-fos promoter is activated by various signals primarily through a kinase cascade linked to Ras-dependent pathways. It is also known that PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C, induces mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in a Ras-independent manner (38Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Since the mutant SHP2 strongly suppressed the ligand-stimulated c-fos promoter activity and DNA synthesis, but the inactive phosphatase did not interfere with PMA activation of the gene, it appears that the mutant SHP2 targets an upstream molecule in the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, rather than downstream effector(s). One possible target for SHP2 is a potent regulator in signaling, which is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. This regulator protein may be dephosphorylated by SHP2 on phosphotyrosine site(s) which negatively regulate(s) its function, resulting in its activation, such as the Src family of kinases. Identification of such physiological substrate(s) of SHP2 in cells would lead to the elucidation of how the phosphatase positively regulates these signal transduction pathways. Recent studies have suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating G protein-coupled receptors. PAR2 is a newly identified G protein-coupled receptor, which, like the thrombin receptor, is activated by a proteolytic mechanism. Upon stimulation with its ligand, PAR2, expressed either endogenously or exogenously, activates a mitogenic pathway, resulting in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and an increase of early gene transcription through the activation of the c-fos promoter.

Therefore, in contrast to receptor-PTK-mediated signaling, in the PAR2-activated pathway, SHP2 does not appear to interact directly with PAR2. It may interact with other signaling proteins, which are recruited by the activated PAR2 during its functional coupling to G protein(s). A PTK is likely activated in response to the ligand stimulation, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and other proteins. The nature of this specific tyrosine kinase is yet to be identified. Although our data suggest that SHP2 functions as a positive regulator in PAR2-mediated signaling, the precise mechanism by which the inactive mutant SHP2 is capable of attenuating SLIGRL ligand-activated mitogenic signaling is presently unknown. It is known that the c-fos promoter is activated by various signals primarily through a kinase cascade linked to Ras-dependent pathways. It is also known that PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C, induces mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in a Ras-independent manner (38Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Since the mutant SHP2 strongly suppressed the ligand-stimulated c-fos promoter activity and DNA synthesis, but the inactive phosphatase did not interfere with PMA activation of the gene, it appears that the mutant SHP2 targets an upstream molecule in the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, rather than downstream effector(s). One possible target for SHP2 is a potent regulator in signaling, which is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. This regulator protein may be dephosphorylated by SHP2 on phosphotyrosine site(s) which negatively regulate(s) its function, resulting in its activation, such as the Src family of kinases. Identification of such physiological substrate(s) of SHP2 in cells would lead to the elucidation of how the phosphatase positively regulates these signal transduction pathways.

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify by polymerase chain reaction 500-base pair fragments of alcohol dehydrogenase cDNAs from chick embryo limb buds and heart. cDNA fragments that encode an unknown putative alcohol dehydrogenase as well as the class III alcohol dehydrogenase were identified. The new cDNA hybridized with two messages of ∼2 and 3 kilobase pairs in the adult chicken liver but not in the adult heart, muscle, testis, or brain. The corresponding complete cDNA clones with a total length of 1390 base pairs were isolated from a chicken liver λgt11 cDNA library. The open reading frame encoded a 375-amino acid polypeptide that exhibited 67 and 68% sequence identity with chicken class I and III alcohol dehydrogenases, respectively, and had lower identity with mammalian class II (55-58%) and IV (62%) isozymes. Expression of the new cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded an active alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-F) with subunit molecular mass of ∼40 kDa. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme, calculated from active site titration of NADH binding, was 3.4 min−1 for ethanol at pH 7.4 and 25°C. ADH-F was stereospecific for the 3β,5α- versus 3β,5β-hydroxysteroids. The Km value for ethanol at pH 7.4 was 17 mM compared with 56 μM for all-trans-retinol and 31 μM for epiandrosterone. Antiserum against ADH-F recognized corresponding protein in the chicken liver homogenate.

In this report, we characterize the fundamental biochemical properties of Ho. Using an assay that monitors cleavage of a MAT plasmid, we define an optimal in vitro reaction, showing in particular that the enzyme has a stringent requirement for zinc ions. This suggests that zinc finger motifs present in Ho are important for cleavage. The most unexpected feature of Ho, however, is its extreme inefficiency. Maximal cleavage occurs when Ho is present at a concentration of 1 molecule/3 base pairs of substrate DNA. Even under these conditions, complete digestion requires >2 h. This inefficiency results from two characteristics of Ho. First, Ho recycles slowly from cleaved product to new substrate, in part because the enzyme has an affinity for one end of its double strand break product. Second, high levels of cleavage in the in vitro reaction correlate with the appearance of large protein-DNA aggregates.

Genetic recombination is the intracellular process that moves DNA sequence information from one genomic location to another. A plethora of genetic and biochemical experiments, conducted primarily in prokaryotic and fungal systems, has led to a detailed understanding of the DNA intermediates that arise during this process. Examples of such intermediates include broken duplexes, heteroduplex DNA joints, and Holliday junctions. The first of these intermediates (broken duplexes or double-stranded breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSBsdouble-stranded breaksbpbase pair(s)DTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.) are thought to initiate recombination. Thus, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism in which DSB formation has been intensively analyzed, the following lines of evidence indicate that DSBs initiate meiotic recombination. First, DSBs are repaired using gene products required for meiotic recombination (reviewed in 1Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 406-521Google Scholar). Second, certain meiotic segregation patterns of yeast genes are consistent with molecular models of recombination that posit a DSB initiation event (2Szostak J. Orr-Weaver T. Rothstein R. Stahl F. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Third, DSBs occur at regions of the genome defined genetically as initiators of recombination (3Cao L. Alani E.

Cell. 1986; 46: 733-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, meiotic DSBs precede and are independent of pairing between homologs, implying that DSBs initiate chromosomal pairing (13de Massy B. Baudat F. Nicolas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, despite the intensive analysis of DSB formation in yeast, the endonuclease(s) that generates DSBs during meiotic recombination remains unidentified. double-stranded breaks base pair(s) dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DSBs have also been shown to initiate yeast mating type switching, a mitotic recombination reaction (for a review of yeast mating type, see 15Herskowitz I. Rine J. Strathern J. Jones E.W.

Haploid yeast cells come in two mating types, designated a and α These mating types are determined by a master regulatory locus on chromosome III called MAT MAT contains five sequence blocks: W, X, Y (Ya or Yα), Z1, and Z2 (Fig. 1A). The W, X, Z1, and Z2 blocks are identical in a and α cells, but each mating type contains a unique MAT Y sequence: Ya in a cells and Yα in α cells. Roughly once per cell generation, new Ya or Yα information transposes into MAT from two unlinked and transcriptionally inactive loci known as HMLα and HMRa, thereby switching the cell's mating type. Mating type switching initiates when an endogenous, site-specific endonuclease known as Ho makes a DSB at the MAT YZ border (16Kostriken R. Strathern J.N. Klar A.J.S. Heffron F.

Ho cleaves in Z1 between Z3 and Z4 on one strand and between Z7 and Z8 on the other to produce 3′-overhangs that are four nucleotides long (base pairs are numbered going away from the YZ junction) (Fig. 1B). A 16-bp region spanning the YZ border (Y6-Z10) can be cleaved in vitro by purified Ho endonuclease (Fig. 1B). Eight noncontiguous base pairs located within this region are necessary for cleavage. One located in Y (Y4) is an AT base pair conserved in both Ya and Yα The other seven are located in Z1 (Z1-Z4, Z6, Z7, and Z9). Surprisingly, however, the 16-bp region sufficient for in vitro cleavage (Y6-Z10) and a larger, inclusive 20-bp region (Y8-Z12) are insufficient for in vivo cleavage (19Nickoloff J.A. Chen E.Y.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1174-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Instead, a 24-bp fragment (Y11-Z13) is required for cleavage inside cells (Fig. 1B). An analysis of Ho site recognition distinguishes Ho endonuclease from typical prokaryotic type II restriction endonucleases (19Nickoloff J.A. Chen E.Y. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These properties indicate that the Ho recognition site should not be thought of as a highly defined “restriction” site. In this respect, Ho would bind to DNA in a manner similar to transcription factors, an intriguing idea given that Ho contains several putative zinc fingers, structural motifs common to certain classes of transcription factors (21Russell D.W. Jensen R. Zoller M.J. Burke J. Errede B. Smith M. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4281-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). While its recognition sequence has been analyzed in great detail, Ho endonuclease itself has been the subject of little biochemical analysis. In this report, we characterize the fundamental biochemical parameters of the enzyme. This study has two purposes. The first is to increase our understanding of the mechanism by which Ho generates a DSB at MAT Given the similar genetic requirements for mating type switching and “standard” meiotic recombination, this information should increase our understanding of DSB formation in other types of recombination reactions. The second purpose is to identify biochemical parameters of Ho that can be used as base lines in future experiments on accessory factors that may be required for in vivo cleavage. Our results indicate that Ho is not merely the yeast version of a bacterial restriction enzyme. In fact, Ho has some very unusual characteristics that may indicate that the enzyme has other roles in mating type switching subsequent to DSB formation.

Terminated reactions were loaded on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel made up in 0.04 M Tris acetate and 1 mM EDTA and electrophoresed at 7 V/cm for 2 h. Gels were stained in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and digitized pictures were generated on a GDS 7500 gel documentation system (UVP). Quantitation of digitized pictures was carried out using the IP Lab gel software package (Signal Analytics Corp.). One unit of activity is defined as the amount that cleaves 1 μg of EcoRI-linearized pDC283 in 1 h at 30°C. To test the effects of pH on Ho activity, the Tris-HCl in the standard reaction was replaced with 20 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 for the pH range from 6.4 to 8.1 or with 40 mM Tris maleate/NaOH for the pH range from 8.6 to 9.2. All other reaction components were the same. The HO bacterial strain was grown at 30°C in 3.6 liters of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin.

The pellet was redissolved in 60 ml Buffer C (100 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgSO4, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mM benzamidine HCl, and 0.2 mM PMSF). The resulting solution was centrifuged to remove precipitated MgNH4PO4, and the supernatant was collected (Fraction II; 10.17 mg/ml, 60 ml). Fraction II was applied at 25 ml/h to a phosphocellulose column (2.0 cm2× 6.0 cm) equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer C, and proteins were eluted with a 240-ml linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in Buffer C. Fractions containing Ho endonuclease activity were pooled (Fraction III; 0.29 mg/ml, 69 ml). Fraction III was brought to 1 M NaCl with a 5 M NaCl solution and loaded at 6 ml/h on a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (0.64 cm2× 3.8 cm) equilibrated with Buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mM benzamidine HCl, and 0.2 mM PMSF). After washing with 4 ml of Buffer D, the column was eluted at 6 ml/h with a 10-ml linear gradient of 10-50% ethylene glycol in Buffer E (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM benzamidine HCl, and 0.2 mM PMSF), followed by a 5-ml wash with 50% ethylene glycol and 2% Triton X-100 in Buffer E. Fractions containing Ho endonuclease were pooled to generate Fraction IV (0.8 mg/ml, 6 ml). Fraction IV was diluted with 18 ml of Buffer F (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgSO4, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM benzamidine HCl, and 0.2 mM PMSF) and loaded at 6 ml/h on a DEAE-Sephacel column (0.64 cm2× 0.5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer G (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgSO4, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 mM benzamidine HCl, and 0.2 mM PMSF). The flow-through fraction was collected (Fraction V; 0.22 mg/ml, 18 ml). Fraction V was loaded at 6 ml/h on a Bio-Rex 70 column (0.64 cm2× 1 cm) equilibrated with Buffer G. The column was washed with Buffer G until the ultraviolet absorption of the effluent was 0 and then eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in Buffer G. Fractions containing Ho endonuclease activity and showing only one band by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were pooled (Fraction VI; 0.1 mg/ml, 0.4 ml). Fraction VI was concentrated to 50 μl in a Microcon-10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.), made 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at –20°C. The Stokes radius of Ho was determined by gel filtration according to the method of Laurent and Killander (23Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). Typically, 50 μl of Fraction III were loaded at 0.2 ml/min on a Sephadex 200 HR 5/20 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with Buffer C. Eluted fractions (0.027 ml) were collected and analyzed for Ho by the standard cleavage assay. A calibration curve was generated using ribonuclease A, chymotrypsinogen A, ovalbumin, albumin, aldolase, catalase, and ferritin, with Stokes radii of 16.4, 20.9, 30.5, 35.5, 48.1, 52.2, and 61.0 Å, respectively. Blue dextran 2000 (Pharmacia) was used to mark the void volume. All dialysis and reaction buffers were pretreated with Chelex 100 chelating resin to remove zinc ions. Zinc ions were subsequently removed from Ho fractions by dialysis against buffer containing the Zn2+-specific chelator 1,10-phenanthroline. Typically, 100 μl of Fraction III were dialyzed at 4°C for 2 h against 100 ml of Buffer C containing 2 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. This procedure was repeated two more times using fresh dialysate. In control experiments, 100 μl of Fraction III were dialyzed under the same conditions, with the exception that the 1,10-phenanthroline was omitted from the dialysate. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified fractions was performed on 10% gels (24Garfin D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electron microscopy of Ho-DNA complexes was carried out according to the method of Inman and Schnös (26Inman R.B. Schnös M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After adsorption of DNA and protein-DNA complexes, the grids were positively stained by brief immersion in 95% ethanol containing 3% uranyl acetate. A thin film of platinum-palladium was subsequently evaporated at low angle onto the grid to make the DNA and protein-DNA complexes clearly visible. To isolate biochemically homogeneous Ho endonuclease, we used the bacterial overexpression system of Kostriken and Heffron (17Kostriken R. Heffron F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This system utilizes a plasmid containing the yeast HO gene driven by the PR promoter of bacteriophage λ. Also carried on the plasmid is the gene for the thermolabile repressor cI857, which represses the PR promoter at low but not high temperatures. Ho endonuclease was induced by heat shock, and the enzyme was purified by the method of Kostriken and Heffron (17Kostriken R. Heffron F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications (see “Materials and Methods”). The assay for Ho monitored the cleavage of a linear DNA molecule that contained the MATa locus and flanking sequences; 1 unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that cleaves 1 μg of substrate in 1 h at 30°C (see “Materials and Methods”). The results of a typical purification are summarized in Table I and Fig. 2. The purified protein migrated as a single band of Mr = 65,000 on an SDS gel, in close agreement with the predicted molecular weight of the Ho polypeptide (Mr = 65,940). The final fraction retained >85% of its activity after 12 months of storage at –20°C. We used the homogeneous protein to characterize the fundamental biochemical properties of Ho. The first step in this process was to determine the optimal in vitro conditions for the enzyme. Cleavage reactions were carried out under varying conditions, and the activity of Ho under these conditions was determined by the standard agarose gel assay. Several conclusions were drawn from these data. First, Mg2+ ions were absolutely required for Ho activity, as no cleavage was observable in the absence of the ion (Fig. 3A). The optimal concentration of MgCl2 was 5-30 mM (Fig. 3A). Second, NaCl was not required for activity, as reasonable cleavage was seen in its absence (Fig. 3B). Cleavage, however, was stimulated 2.5-fold when NaCl was present at concentrations between 50 and 100 mM (Fig. 3B). Third, the activity of Ho exhibited a relatively broad pH range, with optimal cleavage occurring between pH 7.5 and 9.0 (Fig. 3C). Fourth, a reduced sulfhydryl group(s) on the enzyme may be involved in Ho activity, as the addition of N-ethylmaleimide to the cleavage reaction at a concentration of 50 mM eliminated product formation (data not shown). Finally, the enzyme appeared relatively stable, as the addition of protein stabilizers had no effect on cleavage (data not shown). These parameters are similar to those of standard type II restriction endonucleases. One interesting feature of the amino acid sequence of Ho is that the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids contain five putative zinc finger motifs (21Russell D.W. Jensen R. Zoller M.J. Burke J. Errede B. Smith M. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4281-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, a mutation in the HO gene product that eliminates activity was mapped to one of these potential zinc fingers, providing genetic evidence for the importance of these motifs (27Meiron H. Nahon E. Raveh D. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To provide further biochemical evidence that these fingers are important for Ho activity, we asked whether zinc ions were required in the in vitro cleavage reaction. This was determined by carrying out two experiments (see “Materials and Methods”). In the first, an aliquot of Fraction III was dialyzed for 6 h against a buffer containing 1,10-phenanthroline, a Zn2+-specific chelating agent. In the second, an identical aliquot was dialyzed for the same time against a buffer lacking 1,10-phenanthroline. The two samples were then added back to reaction mixtures containing Mg2+ ions, but no Zn2+ ions, and the activities of the dialyzed proteins were determined by the standard agarose gel assay. The results showed that the aliquot dialyzed against 1,10-phenanthroline retained only 0.4% of its activity, as predicted for a protein that requires zinc. By comparison, the aliquot dialyzed against buffer lacking 1,10-phenanthroline retained 95.5% of its activity, indicating that dialysis per se was not responsible for the inactivation of the first aliquot. These results argue that the removal of zinc ions from the Ho preparation inactivates the enzyme. However, another interpretation is that the 1,10-phenanthroline inactivated the protein through some other nonspecific mechanism. To rule out this possibility, the enzyme that had been dialyzed against 1,10-phenanthroline was added to a standard reaction supplemented with 10–5M ZnCl2. Under these conditions, cleavage was stimulated 40-fold, i.e. the inactivated aliquot went from 0.4 to 16% wild-type activity. Thus, a large part of the inactivation was directly attributable to the loss of zinc ions. Further experiments showed that optimal activity required a final Zn2+ concentration between 10–6 and 10–4M. Even under optimal conditions, the reconstituted activity was 6-fold lower than the original wild-type activity. The reason for this partial reactivation remains unclear. However, it is possible that refolding a zinc finger after removal of the Zn2+ ion is a kinetically unfavorable reaction. Alternatively, the 1,10-phenanthroline might have inactivated a fraction of Ho by other nonspecific means. We next determined whether Ho existed in solution as a monomer or some higher order multimer. (Given the asymmetry of the Ho recognition sequence, there was no a priori reason to expect that the enzyme would exist as a dimer like many type II restriction endonucleases.) Purified Ho was subjected to high-resolution gel-filtration chromatography (see “Materials and Methods”), and the elution of Ho activity was compared with the elution of known molecular weight standards. From these data, the apparent molecular weight of Ho was calculated using the method of Laurent and Killander (23Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). Ho endonuclease activity eluted as a symmetrical peak that corresponded to a native molecular weight of 81,000 (Fig. 4). Ho therefore appears to be a slightly elongated monomer in solution. We defined 1 unit of activity for Ho as the amount of enzyme necessary to cleave 1 μg of MAT vector in 1 h. According to this definition, Fraction VI, which appeared to be electrophoretically pure, had a specific activity of 350 units/mg of protein. By comparison, using 1 unit defined in an analogous fashion, a purified fraction of EcoRI had a specific activity of ∼1.5 × 106 units/mg of protein (28Modrich P. Zabel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5866-5874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the specific activity of our purified Ho fraction was >4000-fold lower than that of a typical EcoRI preparation. We also observed that many of our in vitro reactions never went to completion at lower enzyme concentrations, even when the digestion period extended over several hours (data not shown). These data indicated that Ho was extremely inefficient in the in vitro reaction. To better understand this property, we further characterized the stoichiometry requirements of Ho. Different amounts of enzyme were incubated with a fixed amount of DNA; aliquots were removed at various times; and the extent of cleavage was determined by the standard agarose gel assay (Fig. 5). Full cleavage occurred in the reaction when Ho was present at 3.45 μM (2 units/25 μl), i.e. 1 Ho molecule/2.6 bp of substrate DNA. For the 8100-bp MAT vector, this translated into ∼3000 Ho molecules/recognition sequence. When Ho was present at a concentration of 1 molecule/6.5 bp (0.8 units/25 μl), ∼10% of the molecules remained uncleaved. Moreover, product formation plateaued after 2-3 h of i"

B cells derived from patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) are deficient in γc and provide a useful model in which to dissect the role of this subunit in IL-4-mediated signaling. We found that although IL-4 stimulation of X-SCID B cells did not result in Janus tyrosine kinase-3 (JAK3) phosphorylation, other IL-4 substrates including JAK1 and IRS-1 were phosphorylated. Additionally, we detected signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity in X-SCID B cells with a wide range of γc mutations. However, reconstitution of these X-SCID B cells with γc enhanced IL-4-mediated responses including STAT6 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity and resulted in increased CD23 expression. Thus, γc is not necessary to trigger IL-4-mediated responses in B cells, but its presence is important for optimal IL-4-signaling.

Immunodefic. Rev. 1992; 3: 195-236Google Scholar). Although B cells are present, immunoglobulin levels are low, and specific antibody production is lacking. The combination of these defects is fatal by 1-2 years of age unless the immune system is reconstituted by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. These clinical manifestations are due to a wide range of mutations in the common gamma chain (γc) gene that result in either a lack of γc message, unstable γc proteins that are poorly expressed, or defective γc receptor subunits that are expressed but nonfunctional (2Noguchi M.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-4 regulates B lymphocyte function, it is important to determine the response of X-SCID B cells to this cytokine. The functional IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) consists of at least two components, IL-4Rα and γc subunits (6Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Friedmann M.C. Miyajima A.

Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Signal transduction through the IL-4R, as well as through other hematopoietic receptors, is initiated by activation of Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAKs) (12Ihle J.

IL-4 elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK family members JAK1 and JAK3, which interact with the IL-4Rα and γc subunits, respectively (14Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y.

Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The current model of cytokine signaling proposes that upon cytokine binding, members of the JAK family are rapidly activated and subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylate the receptor, forming a docking site for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that are also phosphorylated by JAKs (12Ihle J.

The STAT proteins then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind DNA sequences on target genes. One important STAT that is activated in response to IL-4, STAT6 (IL-4 STAT), has been shown to bind to promoter sequences of IL-4-inducible genes (18Kotanides H. Reich N.C.

Indeed, two groups have reported that neither JAK1 phosphorylation nor STAT6 DNA binding activity is induced upon IL-4 stimulation of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (B-LCL) derived from X-SCID patients (25Izuhara K.

However, Matthews and colleagues (27Matthews D.J. Clark P.A. Herbert J. Morgan G. Armitage R.J. Kinnon C. Minty A. Grabstein K.H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Callard R.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that although X-SCID B cells cannot undergo immunoglobulin class switching, they can proliferate in vitro in response to IL-4 when co-stimulated with CD40 ligand or anti-IgM. Although the underlying biochemical mechanisms are not clear, these data suggest that IL-4-mediated signaling in X-SCID B cells can occur.It was therefore important to analyze IL-4-signaling in a panel of B-LCL derived from X-SCID patients with a wide range of γc mutations in order to clarify these discrepancies. IL-4 failed to stimulate JAK3 tyrosine phosphorylation in X-SCID B cells, but we found that JAK1 and IRS-1 were phosphorylated. IL-4 also induced STAT6 phosphorylation as well as DNA binding activity in these cells. However, STAT6 activation and CD23 expression were significantly enhanced in X-SCID B-LCL reconstituted with wild type γc. Thus, we have demonstrated a γc-JAK3-independent pathway through which IL-4 activates JAK1 and STAT6 in B cells derived from X-SCID patients. These results have important implications for the understanding of IL-4 signal transduction and the lack of mature B cell function in patients with X-SCID.DISCUSSIONStimulation of B cells with IL-4 results in proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, and regulation of cell surface proteins such as major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and the CD23 receptor. Previous reports have concluded that the JAK-STAT pathway is not activated by IL-4 in the absence of γc (25Izuhara K. Heike T. Otsuka T. Yamaoka K. Mayumi M. Imamura T. Niho Y. Harada N. J. Biol.

However, IL-4 can induce functional, although suboptimal, responses in X-SCID B cells (27Matthews D.J. Clark P.A. Herbert J. Morgan G. Armitage R.J. Kinnon C. Minty A. Grabstein K.H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Callard R.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that the IL-4 signal transduction pathway is conserved in these cells. X-SCID B cells, therefore, provide an important model in which to examine the generation of γc-independent IL-4 responses. In this study, we determined that JAK1, IRS-1, and STAT6 were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 in B cell lines derived from X-SCID patients with a wide diversity of γc mutations and that IL-4 induced detectable levels of STAT6 DNA binding activity in these cells.The finding that JAK3 was not phosphorylated in X-SCID B-LCL stimulated with either IL-2 or IL-4 was not surprising as a number of recent studies have demonstrated a physical association between γc and JAK3 (14Miyazaki T.

The data described here show that IL-4-induced JAK1 and IRS-1 phosphorylation as well as STAT6 activation can occur via mechanisms that are independent of γc and JAK3. IRS-1 is thought to be important for mediating IL-4 proliferative effects, but the mechanism by which IL-4 stimulates IRS-1 phosphorylation is unclear (44Wang L.M. Keegan A.D. Frankel M. Paul W.E. Pierce J.H. Stem Cells. 1995; 13: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Janus kinases likely play an important role (45Johnston J.A. Wang L.-M. Hanson E.P. Sun X.-J. White M.F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and our data suggest that in the absence of JAK3, JAK1 may mediate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-4. It remains to be determined whether other tyrosine kinases known to be induced by IL-4, including JAK2, Tyk2, and Fes (46Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

Blood. 1995; 85: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that functional responses such as proliferation, IgE secretion, and CD23 expression could occur in X-SCID B cells when co-stimulated in vitro by IL-4 or IL-13 together with CD40L or IgM. However, in our studies, we did not detect an increase in CD23 expression in X-SCID B-LCL even though CD23 expression did increase in normal and γc/reconstituted X-SCID B-LCL following stimulation with IL-4. Because of the already high level of CD23 expression on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, slight increases in CD23 expression may be difficult to detect. Nevertheless, even in the studies performed by Matthews et al. (27Matthews D.J. Clark P.A. Herbert J. Morgan G. Armitage R.J. Kinnon C. Minty A. Grabstein K.H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Callard R.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in primary B cells, the increase in CD23 in X-SCID B cells was significantly lower than that detected in control B cells (27Matthews D.J. Clark P.A. Herbert J. Morgan G. Armitage R.J. Kinnon C. Minty A. Grabstein K.H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Callard R.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Suboptimal CD23 activation in response to IL-4 suggests that the observed humoral deficiency in X-SCID patients may result, at least in part, from the inability to transduce the full set of IL-4-induced signals through non-γc containing receptors. Our finding that IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation and CD23 expression were restored to wild type levels following introduction of γc into these cells indicates that γc potentiates the IL-4 signal transduction pathway. The importance of JAK3 in this γc-dependent pathway is further supported by the recent observation that IL-4-induced CD23 expression and STAT6 activation are also suboptimal in B cells that express γc but are deficient in JAK3 (49Oakes S.A.

The γc-independent pathway in these cells has been suggested to function through a receptor that is shared by IL-4 and IL-13 since antibodies to the IL-4Rα chain can block the binding and function of IL-4 as well as IL-13 (53Lefort S.

Moreover, IL-13 receptor subunits that have varied capacities to bind IL-4 have recently been identified (61Hilton D.J. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Our data support common signaling mechanisms as IL-4-activated JAK1 and STAT6 but not JAK3 in X-SCID B cells, and this concurs with what has been reported for IL-13 (47, 51 58, 60). Thus, an IL-4-mediated signal transduction pathway in γc-deficient X-SCID cells may occur via the same mechanisms utilized by IL-13.In contrast to other forms of SCID that present with a complete absence of both T and B lymphocytes, X-SCID patients have normal to elevated numbers of nonfunctional B cells. However, it is clear that the IL-4 signaling that we have detected is not sufficient for normal B cell function. The findings presented here provide insight into IL-4 signal transduction pathways and B cell function in X-SCID patients. The physiological role of the described γc/JAK3 independent IL-4R pathway in normal individuals as well as in patients with X-SCID awaits further investigation. INTRODUCTIONPatients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) 1The abbreviations used are: X-SCIDX-linked severe combined immunodeficiencyILinterleukinJAKJanus tyrosine kinaseSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionB-LCLB cell lymphoblastoid cell linesGASinterferon-γ activation siteRreceptorIRSinsulin receptor substrate. present with very few T cells and absent mitogenic responses (1WHO Scientific Group on Immunodeficiency. Immunodefic. Rev. 1992; 3: 195-236Google Scholar). Although B cells are present, immunoglobulin levels are low, and specific antibody production is lacking. The combination of these defects is fatal by 1-2 years of age unless the immune system is reconstituted by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. These clinical manifestations are due to a wide range of mutations in the common gamma chain (γc) gene that result in either a lack of γc message, unstable γc proteins that are poorly expressed, or defective γc receptor subunits that are expressed but nonfunctional (2Noguchi M.

Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-4 regulates B lymphocyte function, it is important to determine the response of X-SCID B cells to this cytokine. The functional IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) consists of at least two components, IL-4Rα and γc subunits (6Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Friedmann M.C. Miyajima A.

Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Signal transduction through the IL-4R, as well as through other hematopoietic receptors, is initiated by activation of Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAKs) (12Ihle J. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 13Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). IL-4 elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK family members JAK1 and JAK3, which interact with the IL-4Rα and γc subunits, respectively (14Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y.

Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The current model of cytokine signaling proposes that upon cytokine binding, members of the JAK family are rapidly activated and subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylate the receptor, forming a docking site for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that are also phosphorylated by JAKs (12Ihle J.

The STAT proteins then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind DNA sequences on target genes. One important STAT that is activated in response to IL-4, STAT6 (IL-4 STAT), has been shown to bind to promoter sequences of IL-4-inducible genes (18Kotanides H. Reich N.C.

Indeed, two groups have reported that neither JAK1 phosphorylation nor STAT6 DNA binding activity is induced upon IL-4 stimulation of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (B-LCL) derived from X-SCID patients (25Izuhara K.

Although the underlying biochemical mechanisms are not clear, these data suggest that IL-4-mediated signaling in X-SCID B cells can occur.It was therefore important to analyze IL-4-signaling in a panel of B-LCL derived from X-SCID patients with a wide range of γc mutations in order to clarify these discrepancies.

However, insulin treatment decreased glucose consumption of the mutant cells by 20% while increasing that of the L6(WT) by 30%. In the L6(WT), insulin elicited a significant increase in glucose transport and GLUT1 and GLUT4 plasma membrane expression, while in the L6(1152), all of these functions were constitutively activated and not further stimulated by insulin. Similarly, glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity were increased by 80 and 125%, respectively, in the L6(1152 )versus the L6(WT) and unaffected by insulin (while a 2-fold increase was measured in insulin-exposed L6(WT)). Glucose oxidation and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity were also 25% higher in the mutant compared with the L6(WT). However, in the L6(1152), both functions decreased by 35% in response to insulin (while increasing by 60 and 80%, respectively, in the L6(WT)). Similarly as in the L6(1152), in vivo, forearm glucose uptake in IR1152 patients was 2-fold higher than in control subjects. This difference was not accounted for by higher plasma glucose levels. We conclude that, in skeletal muscle, glucose storage and oxidation are differentially impaired by the expression of IR1152, suggesting that their regulation by insulin involves divergent signaling pathways. Muscle expression of IR1152 may contribute to impairing glucose tolerance in IR1152 individuals."

TPO induced the proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation of UT-7/EPO expressing wild type c-Mpl, as evidenced by increased levels of the CD41 antigen specific for cells of the megakaryocytic lineage and by changes in morphology. Mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of c-Mpl identified four functional regions: (a) two C-terminal regions (amino acids 575-586 and 615-630) containing a domain essential for cell proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation but not for DNA synthesis; (b) a region (amino acids 587-614) containing a negative domain for TPO-induced cell proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation; and (c) a region (amino acids 565-574) including a box2 motif that is required for DNA synthesis. These deletion mutants will provide useful materials for analyzing the signals specific for TPO-induced proliferation and megakaryocytic differentiation."

INTRODUCTIONCells respond to a variety of stresses by activating the transcription of a battery of “acute phase” or “stress response” genes (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, MA1990Google Scholar). The nature of this response is tailored to the nature of the stress. For example, serum- and nutrient-deprived cells usually enter a quiescent state (G0) that requires both the up-regulation and down-regulation of genes involved in growth control. In contrast, the initial response to DNA-damaging agents includes arrest of cell cycle progression, presumably to facilitate the transcription of a battery of genes involved in the DNA repair process (3Fornace Jr., A.J.

The extent to which physiologically and pathophysiologically induced growth arrest share common genomic responses is unclear and is the focus of the present studies.The conjugation of ortho-, or para-quinones with GSH results in the formation of conjugates that frequently exhibit more potent toxicological activity than the parent quinone (4Monks T.J.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar), and the induction of the growth arrest and DNA Damage-inducible gene, gadd153 (10Jeong J.K. Stevens J.L. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar). Quinone-thioethers therefore provide a useful model with which to investigate chemically induced growth arrest and the consequences of chemically induced chromatin disruption. We have therefore compared physiologically induced (serum and nutrient depletion) and chemically induced (2-Br-bis-(GSyl)HQ and 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ) growth arrest in renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) and determined some of the factors involved in regulating gene expression in response to the chemically induced stress. We report that the response to physiological stress (serum deprivation) involves growth arrest characterized by an inhibition of DNA synthesis in the absence of changes in histone or gadd153 mRNA. In contrast, the chemically induced stress involves growth arrest accompanied by a decrease in histone mRNA, particularly core histone H2A and H2B mRNA, and the induction of gadd153DISCUSSIONDNA synthesis is rapidly inhibited in serum-deprived subconfluent cultures of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) (Fig. 1), but this physiological mode of growth arrest is insufficient to induce gadd153 expression (Fig. 2). However, removal of serum and nutrients, including glucose, from the culture medium is sufficient to induce the expression of gadd153 (Fig. 2). Chen et al (16Chen Q. Yu K. Holbrook N.J. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8207-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also noted that culturing LLC-PK1 cells in EBSS induces the expression of gadd153 The addition of glucose to serum- and nutrient-deprived LLC-PK1 cells did not overcome the induction of gadd153 (Fig. 1). Glucose is not essential for energy production in cultured cells (17Wice B.M. Reitzer L.J. Kennel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7812-7819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and glutamine, not glucose, is the major energy source in HeLa cells (18Reitzer L.J. Wice B.M. Kennel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2669-2676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial glutamine to α-ketoglutarate pathway is also the major regulatory site of ammoniagenesis in LLC-PK1 cells (19Cole L.A. Scheid J.M. Tannen R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C293-C298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of gadd153 occurs in H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells grown in a limited amino acid medium (20Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Glutamine can also serve as a precursor for pyrimidine nucleotides, via the glutamate-aspartate transamination reaction, and cells grow readily in sugar-free medium supplemented with uridine or cytidine (17Wice B.M. Reitzer L.J. Kennel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7812-7819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of glutamine, rather than glucose, probably initiates gadd153 expression in LLC-PK1 cells, and changes in the nucleotide pool may be a signal for gadd153 expression. Gadd153 is induced by growth arrest and DNA Damage (3Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and the nucleotide pool will also decline as DNA repair is initiated in cells experiencing DNA damage, again signaling gadd153 expression. The p53-dependent G0-G1 cell cycle arrest is induced by ribonucleotide depletion (21Linke S.P. Clarkin K.C. Leonardo A.D. Tsou A. Wahl G.M. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), suggesting that p53 may serve as a ribonucleotide sensor. However, although p53 lies upstream of gadd45 (22Zhan Q. Bae I. Kastan M.B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2755-2760PubMed Google Scholar), it does not appear to control gadd153 expression (23Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1994; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2923) Google Scholar).The expression of histone genes is tightly coupled to DNA replication, but the levels of histone mRNA were unchanged in both serum-, and nutrient-deprived LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 3), despite significant reductions in DNA synthesis (Fig. 2). Although changes in the level of histone mRNA occur between G1 and S phase cells, the signal for rapid histone mRNA degradation appears to be confined to the S-G2 border (24Harris M.E. Bohni R. Schneiderman M.H. Ramamurthy L. Schumperli D. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2416-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Morris T.D. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and histone mRNA levels only decline rapidly as cells exit the S phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, the half-life of histone mRNA is comparatively long during S phase, ranging from 110 min (25Morris T.D. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) to 4-5 h (26DeLisle A.J. Graves R.A. Marzluff W.F. Johnson L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1920-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).In contrast to the lack of effects of serum and nutrient deprivation on gadd153 and histone mRNA, chemical-induced growth arrest of LLC-PK1 cells causes a decrease in both core and linker histone mRNAs (Figs. 4, 5, 6) and an increase in gadd153 mRNA (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Differences in the cellular response to nutrient deprivation and chemical challenge might simply reflect different points on a continuum of a single stress response. We therefore compared the effects of a chemical stress (2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ exposure in DMEM) and the combination of chemical stress under conditions of nutrient depletion (2-Br-6-[GSyl]HQ exposure in EBSS). However, not only are the two stresses not additive, but decreases in H2B expression are attenuated when the chemical and nutrient stress are combined (Fig. 7). In addition, nutrient deprivation for 2 h causes a 6-fold increase in gadd153 mRNA, and the combination of nutrient deprivation and 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ actually decreases the gadd153 response (Fig. 8). The ability of 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ to attenuate the gadd153 response is not simply a consequence of a delay in the stress response. Nutrient depletion causes a continual increase in gadd153 mRNA, whereas the combination of nutrient depletion and 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ blunts the gadd153 response by 60% (Fig. 9). The chemical challenge, therefore, appears to interfere with pathways utilized by the cell to signal the physiological stress to the nucleus. Whether the same, albeit compromised, pathways are utilized to signal the chemical stress response is unclear, but likely involves the recruitment of alternative signaling pathways. Nonetheless, the genomic response to nutrient depletion and chemically induced growth arrest in LLC-PK1 cells is clearly not additive.Chromatin structure plays an important role in regulating gene expression (27Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 28van Holde K.E. Lohr D.E. Robert C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2837-2840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stein G.S. van Wijen A.J. Stein J. Lian J.B. Montecino M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 251-278PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wolffe A.P. Regulation of Chromatin Structure and Function. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994Google Scholar). For example, histones play an important role in maintaining chromatin structure and are intimately involved in the regulation of gene transcription (31Grunstein M. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms regulating gene expression in eukaryotes, therefore, include specific roles for the histone proteins. For example, when core histone H2A or H2B synthesis is repressed, the promoter elements of several inducible genes, which are normally repressed because of their incorporation into nucleosomes, become accessible to the basal transcriptional machinery (33Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Tremethick D. Zucker K. Worcel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5014-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histones are therefore essential for nucleosomal structure and function. Interestingly, core histone H2A and H2B mRNAs are more sensitive to quinone-thioether-induced DNA damage than core histone H3 and H4 mRNA (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Because the H3/H4 histone tetramer forms the central core of the nucleosome, with H2A/H2B heterodimers capping each end of the core, H2A/H2B dimers are more readily displaced from the nucleosomal core than H3 and H4 (35Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Histone mRNAs are rapidly degraded via the activation of a specific mRNA destabilization process (36Marzluff W.F. Hanson R.J. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 267-290Crossref Google Scholar) that is autoregulated by histone proteins and initiated by increases in cytoplasmic histones (37Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4345-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both core and linker histones induce the destabilization of histone H4 mRNA (38McLaren R.S. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14637-14644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of histones from nucleosomes during quinone-thioether-mediated nuclear disruption may therefore contribute to decreases in histone mRNA levels. Alternatively, quinones have been shown to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase (39Mau B.L. Powis G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1621-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the first step in DNA synthesis. Such an effect may lead to a down-regulation in histone gene expression. However, this mechanism would not explain the differential effects of 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ on H2A/H2B and H3/H4 mRNA. Moreover, the activity of ribonucleotide reductase is reduced in serum-starved hamster kidney 21/C13 cells (40Cohen E.A. Filion M. Suh M. Langlier Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and serum deprivation does not decrease histone mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 3). Chemically induced changes to chromatin structure might therefore provide an important mechanism by which so called “non-genotoxic” carcinogens influence gene expression and cell growth. Indeed, a variety of chemicals, including sodium butyrate, trichostatin A, and staurosporine, are known to alter the post-translational modification of histones, with corresponding changes in nucleosomal structure and function (41Bradbury E.M.

Cell Res. 1991; 192: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The compaction of nucleosomal templates containing histones H2A and H2B is more extensive than templates containing only H3/H4 tetramers, and removal of H2A and H2B from nucleosomal arrays enhances gene activity (54Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 64-68PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, under conditions of efficient chromatin assembly, the hsp70 promoter is transcriptionally silent in Xenopus oocytes, and a role for chromatin structure in regulating the hsp70 promoter has been proposed (14Landsberger N. Ranjan M. Almouzni G. Stump D. Wolffe A.P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Thompson E.M. Legouy E. Christians E. Renard J.P. Development. 1995; 121: 3425-3437PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this scenario, levels of histone H2B mRNA in LLC-PK1 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ were inversely correlated with hsp70 mRNA (Fig. 10). Perhaps the increase in cytotoxicity at higher concentrations of 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ leads to an inhibition of protein synthesis with a complementary increase in histone mRNA stability by mechanisms described above. Alternatively, disruption to chromatin structure at higher concentrations of 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ may be sufficient to suppress the expression of hsp70, which appears to require precise assembly of the promoter template into chromatin for active transcription (14Landsberger N. Ranjan M. Almouzni G. Stump D. Wolffe A.P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This would imply that the structural requirements for gene transcription are less stringent for some genes than others.Inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide attenuated decreases in histone H2B mRNA (Fig. 11), consistent with the finding that the down-regulation of histone H1 caused by 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine is also prevented by cycloheximide (55Williams A.S. Ingledue T.C. Kay B.K. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4660-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein synthesis has been reported to prevent rapid degradation of histone mRNA (37Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4345-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), possibly by decreasing the interaction of a 45-kDa stem-loop-binding protein with the 3′-end of histone mRNA, which may be necessary for histone mRNA degradation (56Hansen J.C. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2339-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of histone mRNA following chemical stress in LLC-PK1 cells is in part mediated at the post-transcriptional level. Inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D virtually abolished histone H2B expression (Fig. 11), indicating that active transcription is required to maintain histone mRNA levels in these cells.Quinone-thioether-mediated DNA damage and cytotoxicity requires the availability of Fe2+ (9Mertens J.J.W.M. Gibson N.W. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with deferoxamine to chelate intracellular Fe2+ decreases H2B histone mRNA (Fig. 12) and DNA synthesis (Fig. 13). Iron is essential to maintain ribonucleotide reductase activity (57Testa U. Pelosi E. Peschle C. Crit. Rev. Oncol. 1993; 4: 241-276Google Scholar), the rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis (58Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and deferoxamine has been shown to inhibit this enzyme (59Fox R.M. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1985; 30: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Iron is also required to maintain synthesis of the cell cycle-regulated protein p34cdc2 (60Terada N. Or R. Szepesi A. Lucas J.J. Gelfand E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, intracellular iron concentrations, either directly or by modulating p34cdc2 synthesis and ribonucleotide reductase activity, influence cell cycle progression and histone gene expression. H2B histone mRNA levels in deferoxamine-treated cells were unaffected by treatment with 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ (Fig. 12), which is consistent with the ability of deferoxamine to prevent 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ-mediated DNA damage (10Jeong J.K. Stevens J.L. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar) and cytotoxicity (9Mertens J.J.W.M. Gibson N.W. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Jeong J.K. Stevens J.L. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium also plays an important role in controlling cell proliferation and regulates progression through several cell cycle checkpoints, including the G1/S phase transition, the G2/M phase transition, and exit from mitosis (61van Dolah F.M. Ramsdell J.S. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 166: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Calcium is also required for p34cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity (62Takuwa N. Zhou W. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 138-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, decreasing intracellular calcium concentrations will delay cell cycle progression, decreasing the requirement for histone protein synthesis as DNA synthesis is suppressed. Chelation of intracellular calcium in LLC-PK1 cells with EGTA-AM decreases the constitutive expression of histone H2B mRNA and potentiates 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ-mediated decreases in H2B mRNA (Fig. 14). Although the relationship between intracellular calcium concentrations and histone gene expression is likely to be complex, our findings establish a link between the two.In summary, renal tubular epithelial cells respond differently to physiologically and chemically induced stress. The response to physiological stress, induced by a combination of serum and nutrient depletion, involves growth arrest characterized by an inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in the absence of a decrease in histone mRNA or an increase in gadd153 mRNA. In contrast, a chemical-induced stress mediated by exposure of cells to quinone-thioethers involves growth arrest accompanied by a decrease in histone mRNA, particularly core histone H2B and H2A mRNA, and the induction of gadd153 Chemical-induced expression of hsp70 mRNA appears to be linked to decreases in histone mRNA. INTRODUCTIONCells respond to a variety of stresses by activating the transcription of a battery of “acute phase” or “stress response” genes (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar, 2Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulus C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, MA1990Google Scholar). The nature of this response is tailored to the nature of the stress. For example, serum- and nutrient-deprived cells usually enter a quiescent state (G0) that requires both the up-regulation and down-regulation of genes involved in growth control. In contrast, the initial response to DNA-damaging agents includes arrest of cell cycle progression, presumably to facilitate the transcription of a battery of genes involved in the DNA repair process (3Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) prior to DNA replication (G1 arrest) and cell division (G2 arrest). The extent to which physiologically and pathophysiologically induced growth arrest share common genomic responses is unclear and is the focus of the present studies.The conjugation of ortho-, or para-quinones with GSH results in the formation of conjugates that frequently exhibit more potent toxicological activity than the parent quinone (4Monks T.J. Lau S.S. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1992; 22: 243-270Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GSH conjugates of polyphenolics are also formed as metabolites of a variety of “non-genotoxic” carcinogens (5Hill B.A. Kleiner H.E. Ryan E.A. Dulik D.M. Monks T.J. Lau S.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Peters M.M. Lau S.S. Dulik D.M. Murphy D. van Ommen B. van Bladeren P.J. Monks T.J. Chem. Res.

As a model of quinone-thioether-mediated toxicity we have been investigating the cellular and molecular responses to 2-Br-bis-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (2-Br-bis-(GSyl)HQ) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-Br-bis-(GSyl)HQ2-bromo-bis-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ2-bromo-6-(glutathion-S-yl) hydroquinoneDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEBSSEarl's balanced salt solutionEGTA-AMethylene glycol-bis-(β-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidrRNAribosomal RNA. and 2-Br-6-(glutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone (2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ). 2-Br-bis-(GSyl)HQ (30 μmol/kg) causes margination of heterochromatin and loss of chromatin staining when administered to male Fischer 344 rats (8Rivera M.I. Jones T.W. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 128: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in renal tubular epithelial cells (LLCPK1) it causes the formation of single strand breaks in DNA (9Mertens J.J.W.M. Gibson N.W. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), rapid inhibition of DNA synthesis (10Jeong J.K. Stevens J.L. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar), and the induction of the growth arrest and DNA Damage-inducible gene, gadd153 (10Jeong J.K. Stevens J.L. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar). Quinone-thioethers therefore provide a useful model with which to investigate chemically induced growth arrest and the consequences of chemically induced chromatin disruption. We have therefore compared physiologically induced (serum and nutrient depletion) and chemically induced (2-Br-bis-(GSyl)HQ and 2-Br-6-(GSyl)HQ) growth arrest in renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) and determined some of the factors involved in regulating gene expression in response to the chemically induced stress. We report that the response to physiological stress (serum deprivation) involves growth arrest characterized by an inhibition of DNA synthesis in the absence of changes in histone or gadd153 mRNA. In contrast, the chemically induced stress involves growth arrest accompanied by a decrease in histone mRNA, particularly core histone H2A and H2B mRNA, and the induction of gadd153 Cells respond to a variety of stresses by activating the transcription of a battery of “acute phase” or “stress response” genes (1Lindquist S.

https://openalex.org/W1980736013,"Here, we describe the isolation of a rainbow trout cDNA clone that contains the entire fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2; basic FGF) coding region. Interestingly, the rainbow trout cDNA contains a translation stop codon just upstream of the primary initiating methionine codon and so cannot give rise to the longer forms of FGF-2 that are produced in mammals by alternative translation initiation at leucines farther upstream. Transfection of human FGF-2 cDNA into fish cells shows that fish cells can initiate protein synthesis at an upstream leucine CUG codon; surprisingly, however, synthesis is initiated only at the most 5′ CUG and not at the two subsequent CUG codons or the methionine AUG codon also used in mammalian cells. Like other FGF-2 proteins, bacterially produced rainbow trout FGF-2 protein binds tightly to heparin-Sepharose and also promotes the proliferation of fibroblast cells. However, the protein differs from all others previously identified at amino acids 121-123, which are part of the proposed highly conserved receptor-binding domain. Comparisons of the efficacies of recombinant wild-type and mutant rainbow trout FGF-2 proteins demonstrate that these three amino acids are critical to the activity of FGF-2."

In the present study, we showed that the minimal region required for the DNA-protein interaction in RR2 resides in an 18-base pair (−484 to −467) sequence, by using DNase I footprinting and methylation interference studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This minimal cis-acting element was found to be sufficient in enhancing the reporter activity driven by the heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in the 1.B-positive U1240MG cell line. This enhancing effect, however, was not detected in a glioblastoma cell line, U1242MG, which is negative for 1.B expression. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we also identified a specific DNA-protein complex, namely complex I, which is specific for 1.B-positive cell lines and human brain tissue. By in situ UV cross-linking experiment, we further showed that complex I contains two major DNA-binding proteins of apparent molecular masses of 37 and 98 kDa. Our results suggest that the formation of complex I, resulting from the heterodimerization of a 37-kDa protein (1.B-specific) and a 98-kDa protein (ubiquitous) may likely be a prerequisite for the enhanced expression of 1.B transcript in neuronal cells. Four different transcripts encoding fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1, also known as aFGF) have been previously identified in our laboratory. Among them, FGF-1.B is the major transcript expressed specifically in the neuronal cells in brain tissue. Using the transient transfection experiment in a glioblastoma cell line, U1240MG, that expresses 1.B, we previously identified two regulatory regions (RR1 and RR2) in the brain-specific promoter, FGF-1.B.

This growth factor is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological function such as tissue growth, wound healing, neovascularization, mesoderm development, and angiogenesis (6Berry M.

FGF-1 confers tumorigenicity when introduced via expression vectors into normal cells (11Bunnag P. Waddell K.S. Varban M.L. Chiu I.-M. In Vitro Dev.

Unlike FGF-2, FGF-1 is found primarily in brain and retina, although low levels of its mRNA have been demonstrated in other tissues (14Gospodarowicz D. Nucl. Med.

FGF-1 may function in establishment of retinal fate and ganglion cell differentiation from the invaginated optic vesicle (17Guillemot F. Cepko C.L. Development. 1992; 114: 743-754PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of FGF-1 in brain is not yet well understood. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, it has been shown that the expression of this growth factor in brain is exclusively in neural cells but not in glial cells (18Stock A. Kuzis K. Woodward W.R. Nishi R. Eckenstein F.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Eckenstein F.P. Kuzis K. Nishi R. Woodward W.R. Meshul C. Sherman L. Ciment G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the expression of FGF-1 mRNA in neurons is correlated with specific developmental events (20Wilcox B.J. Unnerstall J.R. Neuron. 1991; 6: 397-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). FGF-1 was reported to coexist with tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme for catecholamine synthesis, in neuronal cells (21Bean A.J. Elde R. Cao Y. Oellig C. Tamminga C. Goldstein M. Pettersson R.F. Hökfelt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and is involved in the expression of this gene (22Du X. Stull N.D. Iacovitti L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7688-7694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-1 mRNA (23Logan A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 58: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the protein (24Hara Y. Tooyama I. Yasuhara O. Akiyama H. McGeer P.L. Handa J. Kimura H. Brain Res. 1994; 664: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) levels were also reported to elevate in lesioned rat brain. Interestingly, in gliomas, a major human intracranial tumor (25Zulch K.J. Brain Tumors. Springer Verlag, Berlin1986: 101-102Google Scholar), FGF-1 mRNA expression was reported to increase significantly (7Takahashi J.A. Mori H. Fukumoto M. Igarashi K. Jaye M. Oda Y. Kikuchi H.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 785-789PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanism of FGF-1 gene expression is only beginning to be understood.The human FGF-1 gene spans over 120 kilobase pairs containing three protein coding exons and at least four upstream untranslated exons, namely 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D (27Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K. Varban M.L. Krishnan I. Chiu I.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Chiu I.-M. Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Splicing of each of these untranslated exons to the first protein coding exon generates four different mRNA transcripts designated as 1.A, 1.B, 1.C, and 1.D. These multiple transcripts generated by alternate promotor usage and splicing are distributed in a tissue-specific manner. The major transcript in human brain, 1.B, is different from that in human kidney or prostate (31Payson R.A. Canatan H. Chotani M.A Wang W.-P. Harris S.E. Myers R.L. Chiu I.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Myers R.L. Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Deaven L.L. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar). By RNase protection assay, it was shown that 1.B transcripts are highly expressed in glioblastoma tissues, as well as in some of the glioblastoma cell lines (26Myers R.L. Chedid M. Tronick S.R. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 785-789PubMed Google Scholar, 32Myers R.L. Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Deaven L.L. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar). By in situ hybridization with cRNA probe specific for the murine FGF-1.B transcript, our laboratory has recently shown that 1.B in mouse brain are restricted largely to sensory and motor nuclei in the brainstem, and to the ventral spinal cord and cerebellum (33Alam K.Y. Frostholm A. Hackshaw K.V. Evans J.E. Rotter A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30263-30271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).We have previously identified a 41-bp DNA sequence (−507 to −467) in the brain-specific FGF-1.B promoter, designated as regulatory region 2 (RR2), through luciferase reporter assays (34Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RR2 binds nuclear factors through a 23-bp (−489 to −467) region and this binding is linked to the enhanced functional activity of the promoter (34Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present communication, we have further characterized the functional importance of this region. We have narrowed down the minimal cis-acting sequence to an 18-bp region (−484 to −467) which can form more than one DNA-protein complex including the 1.B-specific complex, complex I. This 18-bp sequence is sufficient to enhance the luciferase reporter gene expression driven by a heterologous thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in a cell line-specific manner. UV cross-linking analysis of this 1.B-specific complex reveals that it contains two major DNA-binding proteins of 37 and 98 kDa.RESULTSFunctional Rescue of FGF-1.B Del-2 Luciferase Reporter Construct with Four Tandem Repeats of −492 to −467 in Sense OrientationTo strengthen the functional link between the DNA-protein interaction and the FGF-1.B promoter activity, we inserted four tandem repeats of the DNA sequences −492 to −467 in the sense (4U(+)) or antisense (4U(−)) orientation into the Del-2 construct (−540 to +31 with the deletion of nucleotides −490 to −467). These constructs were transfected into U1240MG cells and assayed for the luciferase reporter activity. Fig. 1 showed that the insertion of the four repeats in the sense orientation significantly increased the reporter activity (4-fold) in comparison to that with Del-2 construct. The 4U(+) construct had a 20% increase in luciferase activity in comparison to the wild type construct (−540 to +31). In contrast, the insertion of the four repeats in the antisense orientation had no effect in comparison to that observed with Del-2 construct. These results suggest that the enhancer activity of the nucleotide sequences −492 to −467, unlike the conventional enhancer, is orientation-dependent.Minimal Sequence Requirement for the DNA-Protein InteractionTo determine the minimal sequence in RR2 required for the specific DNA-protein interaction, we performed (i) DNase I footprinting assay, (ii) methylation interference assay, and (iii) EMSA with overlapping sequences between −492 and −467.DNase I Footprinting AssayTo characterize the minimal cis-acting element for the specific DNA-protein interaction, we used end-labeled (sense strand labeled at its 3′-end) DNA from −540 to −357 (Fig. 2A) or −594 to −357 (Fig. 2B) in DNase I footprinting assay with increasing amount of U1240MG NE. The results showed a single footprint in the same position (−485 to −467) when either probe was used and indicated that the minimal sequence required for the DNA-protein interaction resides in the sequence from −485 to −467.Fig. 2DNase I footprinting assay of the human FGF-1.B promoter. A DNA fragment containing human FGF-1.B promoter sequences −540 to −357 (panel A) or −594 to −357 (panel B), 3′-end-labeled at the sense strand was incubated with 20 μg of BSA or increasing amount of U1240MG NE (12, 24, 36, and 48 μg in panel A, lanes 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively; and 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 μg in panel B, lanes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively). DNA was then digested with DNase I (10 ng (panel A, lanes 1 and 2, and panel B, lanes 2, 3, and 8), 15 ng (panel A, lanes 3 and 4, and panel B, lanes 4 and 5), or 20 ng (panel A, lane 5 and 6, and panel B lane 7)). Lane 1 in panel B indicates the G cleavage reaction. The footprinted region spanning nucleotides −485 to −465 is indicated by an open oval The sequences in panel A were confirmed by G cleavage reaction (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Methylation of Guanine Nucleotide at −482, −474, and −473 in the Sense Strand Strongly Affects the Specific DNA-Protein Complex FormationTo identify the precise location of the nucleotides in the sense strand contacting with the nuclear factors, methylation interference analysis using a probe labeled at the 3′-end of the sense strand was performed. The previous study could not detect the contact sites in the sense strand (34Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); this may be due to the full methylation of the genomic fragment (−507 to −467) having only 10 guanine nucleotides in the same strand. This problem was overcome by using the DNA fragment (−492 to −467) flanked by vector sequences at both ends. It is evident from the results (Fig. 3) that the methylation of guanine nucleotides in the sense strand at positions −482, −474, and −473 strongly affects the specific DNA-protein interaction.Fig. 3Methylation of guanine nucleotides at positions −482, −474, and −473 in the sense strand strongly affects the complex formation. The methylated HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing nucleotides −492 to −467 and labeled in the sense strand was incubated with U1240MG NE. The complexes and free DNA, localized following electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gel, were eluted, treated with piperidine, and analyzed on a 8% sequencing gel. Lanes G, partial chemical degradation specific for G residues; lane F, free probe DNA; lane B, bound probe DNA. The sequences shown at left by bold letters represent the sense strand (−492 to −467) of the FGF-1.B promoter. The rest are the flanking sequences derived from the pUC19 vector. The positions of guanine nucleotides in the promoter important for the complex formation (−482, −474 and −473) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Minimal cis-Acting Element Required for the Specific DNA-Protein Interaction Is from −484 to −467The DNase I footprinting assay (Fig. 2) showed that the site for the DNA-protein interaction lies in the sequences from −485 to −467. We used oligonucleotides of different sizes between −492 and −467 having overlapping sequence either as cold competitors (Fig. 4A) or as probes (Fig. 4B) in EMSA to determine the minimal sequence requirement for the DNA-protein complex formation with U1240MG NE. In EMSA, we detected three distinct complexes (I, II, and III) with the above NE (Fig. 4A). It is evident from this figure that the sequence −484 to −467 is equally effective to compete these complexes as the wild type oligonucleotide (−489 to −467) does. The oligonucleotide −480 to −467 only partially competes for these complexes, even at 100 molar excess, while −484 to −473 does not compete at all. Likewise, when these oligonucleotides were used as probes (Fig. 4B), only −484 to −467 as well as −492 to −467 could specifically bind to the nuclear factors. The oligonucleotide −480 to −467 showed very poor binding, and no specific binding was detected with the −484 to −473 probe. These three experiments together determine the minimal cis-acting element for the specific DNA-protein interaction lies from −484 to −467.Fig. 4The sequence −484 to −467 of FGF-1.B promoter is sufficient to form the specific DNA-protein complexes. Panel A, oligonucleotides of different sizes between −492 and −467 (oligonucleotide A) having overlapping sequences (oligonucleotide B, C, or D) were synthesized and were used as cold competitor at different molar excess levels in the DNA-protein binding assay. A HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the sequence −492 to −467 was end-labeled and used as a probe. I, II, and III represent the three specific complexes formed with U1240MG NE. Panel B, the oligonucleotide (A, B, C, or D) was labeled by end-filling reaction with Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32p]dATP. Equal count (30,000 cpm) of each oligonucleotide was incubated with 5 μg of U1240MG NE in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 50-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Minimal 18-bp cis-Acting element (−484 to −467) Is Sufficient to Enhance the Activity of the Heterologous tk PromoterTo address the functional consequence of the DNA-protein interaction with the minimal 18-bp (−484 to −467) region and the cell line specificity of such interaction, we tested the activity of the minimal tk promoter in absence or presence of the 18-bp or the 26-bp (−492 to −467) DNA sequence of FGF-1.B in U1240MG or U1242MG cell lines. The results showed that the insertion of the 18-bp sequence upstream of the tk promoter enhanced the reporter activity by 6-fold relative to tk (Fig. 5A, left panel). It is also clear that the 18-bp DNA sequence is sufficient to enhance the activity of the heterologous tk promoter, since the 26-bp construct has no further effect on the enhancement of the promoter activity. This enhancement is cell-specific, since neither 18-bp nor 26-bp DNA sequence enhanced the tk promoter activity in U1242MG cells (Fig. 5A, right panel). It is important to note that a comparable level of reporter activity (10-fold) was scored by both U1240MG and U1242MG cells when tk(−200) was used in transient transfection assay (Fig. 5A). We also assayed the reporter activity of tk promoter in the absence or presence of the 18-bp oligonucleotide in either orientation (Fig. 5B). The results showed that the 18-bp sequence, when placed upstream of the tk promoter in the sense orientation, activated it by 6.5-fold. When placed in the antisense orientation, the activity was reduced to 1.7-fold relative to tk. This result is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating that the regulatory effect of the 18-bp sequence is orientation-dependent. The insertion of mutant oligonucleotide, mut 456 and mut 56, upstream of the tk (mut 456/tk or mut 56/tk) resulted in a 71% and 57% reduction of the promoter activity respectively relative to 18-bp(+)/tk (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5The activity of the minimal tk promoter with or without the 18-bp (−484 to −467) or the 26-bp (−492 to −467) DNA sequence of FGF-1.B promoter. Panel A, plasmids tk, tk(−200), 18bp/tk, or 26bp/tk were used to transfect the glioblastoma cell lines, U1240MG and U1242MG. Panel B, plasmids 18-bp(+)/tk, 18-bp(−)/tk, mut 456/tk, or mut 56/tk were used to transfect the glioblastoma cell line U1240MG. Luciferase activity was measured as described in Fig. 1.

The thin lines represent the standard errors for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Correlation of DNA-Protein Complex I in EMSA with the Expression of 1.B TranscriptSince the activation of the tk promoter through the 18-bp or 26-bp DNA sequence was demonstrated to be cell-specific, we were interested to know whether there is any cell-specific DNA-protein interaction with the same DNA sequence and, if so, whether that correlates with the expression of 1.B. We assayed the NE prepared from five different cell lines (U1240MG, U1242MG, U251MG, U343MG, and CHII) of glial origin for the specific binding of the nuclear protein(s) with the DNA probe having the sequence −492 to −467 (Fig. 6). By RNase protection, it has been shown that U1240MG and U251MG are positive for 1.B transcript, whereas the remaining three cell lines are negative (26Myers R.L. Chedid M. Tronick S.R. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 785-789PubMed Google Scholar, 32Myers R.L. Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Deaven L.L. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6A showed that three distinct complexes (I, II, and III) were formed with U1240MG NE (lane 1) and these complexes were competed by a specific cold competitor (−489 to −467) (lane 2). Notably, the fastest mobility complex, complex I, is exclusively present in the 1.B-positive cell lines (U1240MG and U251MG) but not in the 1.B-negative cell lines (CHII, U343MG, and U1242MG) (Fig. 6, A and B). To understand whether there is any tissue-specific expression of similar factors, we also performed EMSA with the NE prepared from human brain and placenta (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, three specific DNA-protein complexes including complex I were also formed with the NE from the human brain (Fig. 6B, lane 5), but the nuclear proteins in the human placenta failed to form any of these complexes (lane 7). These results are consistent with the previous RNase protection studies, which showed the human brain tissue is positive for 1.B (26Myers R.L. Chedid M. Tronick S.R. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 785-789PubMed Google Scholar, 32Myers R.L. Payson R.A. Chotani M.A. Deaven L.L. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar) whereas placenta is negative for FGF-1 mRNA (5Chiu I.-M. Sandberg P. Wang W.-P. Horrocks L.A. Neff N.H. Yates A.J Hadjiconstantinou M. Trophic Factors and the Nervous System. Raven Press, New York1990: 57-74Google Scholar).Fig. 6Complex I is unique for cell lines expressing FGF-1.B transcript. Panel A, approximately 5 μg of NE from different cell lines was assayed in EMSA in absence (−) or presence (+) of 50-fold molar excess of specific cold competitor (−489 to −467) using the oligonucleotide A probe as described in Fig. 4B Panel B, approximately 5 μg of NE from different cell lines or 2-3 μg of NE from the brain or placenta was assayed in absence (−) or presence (+) of 50-fold molar excess of cold specific competitor (−489 to −467) using the same probe and condition as described in Fig. 4A I, II, and III represent the three specific complexes formed with U1240MG NE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The DNA-Protein Complexes I, II, and III Share a Common DNA Binding SiteSince the methylation of guanine (G) residues at −482, −474, and −473 in the sense strand affected the formation of three complexes (I, II, and III) (Fig. 3), we were interested to know whether these complexes result from the binding of nuclear factors with the DNA sequence −492 to −467 at distinctly different site or an overlapping site. We tested each of these complexes in methylation interference assay and looked for the methylation of particular G residues that affect individual complex. Fig. 7 showed that each of these complexes preferably bound to the labeled and methylated DNA, which had no methylation of the G residues at −474 and −473 in the sense strand. In addition, methylation of the G residue at −482 was also shown to interfere with complex II formation and to some degree with complex I formation. These results indicate that these three complexes share a common binding site including the nucleotides −474 and −473. We also made several mutant oligonucleotides of the sequence −484 to −467 or −489 to −467 considering the G residues important for DNA-protein interaction in the sense strand (Fig. 3) and antisense strand (34Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and used them in EMSA (Fig. 8). The sequences of these mutants are described in Table I. We used these mutant oligonucleotides as well as the WT oligonucleotide in EMSA as cold competitors (Fig. 8, A and C) or as probes (Fig. 8B) to compare their abilities to affect the formation of these three complexes I, II, and III. Fig. 8A showed that the WT oligonucleotide as well as mut 1, mut 3, or mut 13 could compete the three complexes I, II, and III (lane 1) to the same extent. The competition was drastically reduced by mutants that contain mutation at nucleotide −478 including mut 2, mut 12, mut 23, or mut 123. Lane 10 showed the inability of an irrelevant (IR) oligonucleotide to compete these complexes. A comparison of the abilities of these oligonucleotides (WT and mutants) to form specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 8B) reveals that the binding ability of the single point mutant mut 1 or mut 3 is virtually the same as that of the WT. However, the complex formation is significantly reduced for the single point mutant mut 2. These results showed that a single mutation at −478 (mut 2) affects the formation of each of these three complexes to the same proportion. Similarly, mutations at −482, −474, and −473 (mut 456) or at −474 and −473 (mut 56) resulted in the loss of ability to compete these complexes (Fig. 8C, Table I). When used as probes, both mut 456 and mut 56 failed to form these specific complexes (Table I). These results suggest that all these complexes may share a DNA binding site including the sequence from −478 to −473. The nearby G residues in the sense strand at −482 and antisense strand at −484 and −472 may be involved in the stabilization of these complexes.Fig. 7Methylation interference showing that complex I, II, and III share a common DNA binding site around the nucleotides −474 and −473.

Messages for nonsecreted proteins are not degraded. The synthesis of heat shock proteins is not required for this selective message degradation. Our hypothesis explaining this phenomenon is that a component of the early steps in the synthesis of secreted proteins is damaged by heat shock, resulting in a selective halt in translation on secretory mRNAs, which may in turn lead to degradation of those messages. The first committed step in the synthesis of secreted proteins is the binding of the nascent signal sequence to the signal recognition particle. We have obtained cDNA clones and antibodies for the barley 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle. In cell fractionation experiments, more signal recognition particle was bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and less was in the free particle fraction following a heat shock. The results suggest that heat shock inhibits the release of the signal recognition particle from the endoplasmic reticulum. This would, in turn, inhibit the resumption of translation and may be the underlying cause of the secretory message degradation.

The selective translation of hsps which is seen in Drosophila, however, is not a general feature of the heat shock response in plants (7Shah D.M. Rochester D.E. Krivi G.G. Hironaka C.M. Mozer T.J.

In our studies on barley aleurone layers we have observed another response to heat stress which may have a profound effect on cellular metabolism. The aleurone layer of cereal grains is a specialized tissue whose main function in vivo is the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes during seed germination. In the barley aleurone layer system, heat shock has a specific effect on the mRNA levels for secreted proteins. In response to heat shock the normally stable message for α-amylase is rapidly degraded (8Belanger F.C. Brodl M.R. Ho T-H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1354-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At 25°C the half-life of the α-amylase mRNA was estimated to be over 100 h (9Ho T-H.D. On the Mechanism of Hormone Controlled Enzyme Formation in Barley Aleurone Layers. Ph.D. thesis, Michigan State University, East Lansing. 1976; Google Scholar), yet within 30 min at 40°C over 60% of it was degraded (10Brodl M.R. Ho T-H.D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 96: 1049-1052Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon has been observed for the mRNA levels for the secreted proteins endochitinase and protease, whereas the mRNA levels of the nonsecreted proteins actin and tubulin were not affected by heat shock (10Brodl M.R. Ho T-H.D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 96: 1049-1052Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Through the use of RNA synthesis inhibitors we have determined that synthesis of the hsps is not required for this selective message degradation (11Brodl M.R. Belanger F.C. Ho T-H.D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 92: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To better understand this phenomenon we are focusing on those features of protein synthesis unique to secreted proteins. A feature common to most secreted proteins that distinguishes them from cytoplasmically localized proteins is the presence of a signal sequence. The signal sequence at the amino terminus of the nascent peptide chain is bound by the signal recognition particle (SRP) that targets the nascent protein-mRNAribosome complex to the ER. As characterized in mammalian cells, the SRP is a complex of a single RNA molecule and six proteins (for reviews see 12Ng D.T.W. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The 54-kDa protein subunit (Srp54) is the subunit of the complex that binds the signal sequence and the RNA backbone of SRP (14Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9646-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the protein components have not been characterized. Previously we reported the characterization from Arabidopsis thaliana of the first plant genes to be described for srp54 (20Lindstrom J.T. Chu B. Belanger F.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Chu B. Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). srp54 genes from tomato (Lysopersicon esculentum) have also been reported (22Krolkiewicz S. Sanger H.L. Niesbach-Klosgen U. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Following heat shock, the ER membranes of aleurone layers are significantly changed biochemically (23Sticher L. Biswas A.K. Bush D.S. Jones R.L. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1990; 92: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Brodl M.R. Campbell J.D. Grindstaff K.K. Fielding L. Cherry J.H. Biochemical and Cellular Mechanisms of Stress Tolerance in Plants. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 61-76Crossref Google Scholar). In GA3-treated aleurone layers the ultrastructure of the ER membranes is also changed by heat shock (8Belanger F.C. Brodl M.R. Ho T-H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1354-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that a heat shock-induced change in some functions of the ER membranes may have occurred. Our hypothesis explaining the observed heat shock-induced selective degradation of secretory protein mRNAs was that SRP binding to the signal peptide was occurring during heat shock thus selecting for mRNAs encoding secreted proteins. If a step in the secretory pathway subsequent to the binding of SRP, yet prior to the resumption of translation, was damaged by heat shock, the inhibition of continued translation could then result in the observed enhanced mRNA degradation. We have therefore investigated the effect of a heat shock on the binding of the SRP complex to the ER membranes. In order to test our hypothesis we have cloned barley srp54 cDNAs and produced antibodies to an Srp54 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli The antibody was used as a marker for SRP in cell fractions isolated from aleurone layers. Following heat shock there was more SRP bound to the ER membranes and less in the free particle fraction, when compared with the non-heat-shocked samples. This suggests heat shock inhibited the release of SRP from the membranes which would, in turn, inhibit further translation of associated mRNAs. The results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that in barley aleurone layers heat shock results in damage to a component of the early steps in the secretory pathway which then results in enhanced degradation of mRNAs for secreted proteins. Barley seeds (Himalaya, 1988 harvest) were obtained from the Department of Agronomy and Soils, Washington State University, Pullman, WA. For aleurone layer preparations, embryo-less half-seeds were surface-sterilized with 1.5% hypochlorite and imbibed for 4 days on filter paper overlaying vermiculite, which was saturated with 20 mM sodium succinate, pH 5.0, containing 20 mM CaCl2. The aleurone layers were dissected from the starchy endosperm under aseptic conditions and incubated in imbibition buffer. In some samples 1 μM GA3 was added. Total RNA was isolated by using the guanidine HCl method described by Cox (25Cox R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 12: 120-129Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For gel blot analysis, polyadenylated RNA was fractionated from total RNA using the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). For RNA gel blot analysis, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were subjected to electrophoresis in formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Magnagraph, Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA) as described by Selden (26Selden R.F. Ausubel F.E. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 4.9.1-4.9.8Google Scholar). The RNA gel blots were hybridized as described previously (21Chu B. Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Probes used for the RNA gel blots were barley srp54-1 cDNA, barley α-amylase high pI cDNA (provided by Dr. J. Rogers), A. thaliana β-tubulin cDNA (provided by Dr. D. P. Snustad), barley endochitinase cDNA (provided by Dr. S. Muthukrishnan), wheat (Triticum aestivum) SRP RNA (provided by Dr. C. Zweib), and maize (Zea mays) hsp70 cDNA (provided by Dr. T-h. D. Ho). A barley leaf λ gt10 cDNA library, prepared from RNA extracted from 7- to 10-day old seedlings, was provided by Dr. R. Zielinski. The 921-bp SacI/KpnI fragment of the A. thaliana srp54-1 cDNA clone (21Chu B. Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was used to screen the cDNA library as described by Huynh et al. (27Huynh T.Y. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 245-300Google Scholar). The hybridization conditions were as for the DNA and RNA gel blots, except that the hybridization solution was 12.5% formamide instead of 50% formamide. The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42°C, followed by a wash in 1 × SSC, 0.25% SDS at 50°C. In a screen of about 150,000 clones (amplified from 10,000 original plaques) two positive plaques were obtained. Both had an insert of approximately 1.1 kilobases which was sequenced and found to be homologous to A. thaliana srp54 but lacked about 550 bp at the 5′-end of the coding sequence. In order to obtain a full-length barley cDNA clone, we constructed a cDNA library using poly(A)+ RNA from 4-day, germinated barley seedlings. The poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated from total RNA by two rounds of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography as described previously (8Belanger F.C. Brodl M.R. Ho T-H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1354-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). EcoRI-ended cDNA was produced using a commercial kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), ligated into the EcoRI site of the phage cloning vector lambda ZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and packaged using commercial extracts (Gigapack II Gold, Stratagene). The primary library contained 1.2 × 106 plaque-forming units. The library was screened with the A. thaliana srp54-1 cDNA fragment and, at high stringency, with the 1.1-kilobase barley clone. In a screen of 500,000 clones, eight positive plaques were identified. Three of these were further characterized. The cDNA inserts were excised from λ ZAPII as recombinant pBluescript SK(−) plasmids according to the manufacturer's protocols. For sequencing, restriction enzyme fragments were subcloned into both M13mp18 and M13mp19 (28Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) to obtain inserts in opposite directions. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) of single-stranded templates with T7 DNA polymerase was performed by using a commercial sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with 17-base oligonucleotides as primers. In order to be ensured of producing antibodies to an Srp54 protein that is expressed in aleurone layers, an aleurone layer library (Stratagene) was screened with the barley cDNAs, srp54-1 and srp54-3, isolated from the seedling library. In a screen of about 500,000 clones, a positive clone with a 700-bp insert corresponding to the srp54-1 and srp54-2 3′-ends was obtained. srp54-2 was chosen for antibody production. Polyclonal antibodies were produced against a fusion protein expressed in E. coli A 1041-bp PstI fragment covering amino acids 40-386 from the srp54-2 cDNA clone was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The HindIII-SmaI restriction fragment which was in the desired orientation was excised from pBluescript and ligated into the HindIII and SmaI sites of the expression vector pFLAG.ATS supplied with a commercial kit (IBI, New Haven, CT). We could not purify the fusion protein by using the anti-FLAG M1 or M2 affinity gels since the fusion protein was insoluble in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). A Saccharomyces cerevisiae Srp54 fusion protein expressed in bacteria was also reported to be insoluble (30Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The barley fusion protein was purified instead by cell fractionation and gel separation. Briefly, the cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme) for 5 min at room temperature. One-tenth volume of buffer B (1.5 M NaCl, 100 mM CaCl2, 100 mM MgCl2, 0.02 mg/ml DNase I, 50 μg/ml ovomucoid protease inhibitor) was added and the extract incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in TBS containing 8 M urea and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant, containing the solubilized protein, was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with cold 0.25 M KCl, 1 mM DTT (31Hager D.Z. Burgess R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), and the 40-kDa fusion protein band excised. The gel slice was minced finely in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (50 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2). The homogenized gel, containing about 100 μg of the fusion protein, was injected into the subscapular space of a New Zealand White rabbit. Injections were given four times at 3-4-week intervals. Serum was collected, and antibodies specific to the fusion protein were prepared by affinity purification. The fusion protein was excised from SDS-PAGE, and the excised band was transferred to nitrocellulose. The bound fusion protein was then used in affinity purification of the antibody as described previously (32Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 10% polyacrylamide gels (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (Nitro-Bind, Micron Separations, Inc.) (34Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (0.05% Tween 20 in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 180 mM NaCl) for 1 h and then incubated overnight in the affinity purified antibody in TTBS. Membranes were washed four times in TBS, 15 min each wash, and incubated in a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) for 1 h. Membranes were washed three times in TTBS prior to chemiluminescent detection using a commercial kit (enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system, Amersham Corp.). The immunoblot demonstrating the specificity of the antibody was detected using a goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.74Google Scholar). Two-hundred aleurone layers per sample were chopped in 7 ml of chopping buffer (25 mM Hepes-BTP, pH 7.4, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) using an electric carving knife retrofitted to hold single-edged razor blades (36Jones R.L. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1985: 304-330Google Scholar). Lysates from the chopped aleurone layers were filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem), and cell debris was pelleted at 1,000 × g For samples fractionated on continuous sucrose gradients, the 1,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged through gradients with 18-45% sucrose (sucrose w/w, buffered with Hepes-BTP, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT) at 70,000 × g for 14 h using SW27.1 buckets on an SW27 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). One-ml fractions were collected using a Buchler Auto Densi-flow gradient fraction collector (Buchler Instruments, Fort Lee, NJ) and a Gilson Microfractionator (Gilson, Middletown, WI). For samples fractionated on discontinuous sucrose gradients, the 1,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged through layered sucrose cushions of 12, 20, 30, 40, and 50% sucrose (w/w sucrose, 2 ml each; buffered with Hepes-BTP, pH 7.4, 1 mM DTT) at 70,000 × g for 2 h using the same buckets and rotor used for the continuous gradients. The turbid bands at the 12/20% and 30/40% sucrose interfaces were collected as free and ER-bound SRP-containing fractions, respectively. The free SRP fraction was centrifuged at 20,000 × g to remove any contaminating membrane debris. ER-containing fractions were identified by cytochrome c reductase (ER-marker enzyme) activity and assayed according to the procedure of Jones (37Jones R.L. Planta. 1980; 150: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In discontinuous sucrose step gradients, cytochrome c reductase activity in the turbid band at the 30/40% interface was 6-8-fold higher than at the 12/20% interface. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay from Pierce. Sucrose concentrations were measured by refractometry. To inhibit the initiation of translation, aleurone layers were incubated in 50 μM T-2 toxin (4β,15-diacetoxy-3α-hydroxy-8α-[3-methylbutyryloxy]-12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene) (Sigma) for the final 4.5 h of the 19-h incubation. Samples were either maintained at 25°C during this period or shifted to 40°C during the last 3 h of incubation. One-hundred aleurone layers per sample were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then ground into powder with dry ice in an electric coffee mill. Polysomes were isolated using modifications in the procedure of Evins (38Evins W.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4295-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, powdered samples were thawed in buffer (200 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 30 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 350 mM sucrose, 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) containing an RNase/protease inhibitor mixture (30Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), filtered through Miracloth, then spun at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was layered onto pads of 1 and 2 M ice-cold sucrose (in the above buffer) and centrifuged at 75,000 × g at 4°C for 12 h in an SW27 rotor. The pellet, constituting free polysomes, was resuspended in 200 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and stored at −80°C. The band at the 1/2 M sucrose interface was collected and diluted to 8% sucrose with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Nonidet P-40 was added to a concentration of 0.5%, and the sample was layered onto a 2 M sucrose pad and centrifuged at 90,000 × g at 4°C for 1.5 h. The pellet, constituting membrane-bound microsomes, was resuspended in 200 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and stored at −80°C. To isolate RNA from the polysome preparations, samples were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in water. Three μg of RNA extracted from polysomes was spotted onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN) according to manufacturer's instructions. The blots were then prehybridized, hybridized, and washed according to the procedures of Church and Gilbert (39Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Cloned cDNA for the high pI (pM/C) (40Muthukrishnan S. Chandra G.R. Albaugh G.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1983; 2: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) isozyme of α-amylase was nick-translated using a commercial nick-translation kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of α-[32P]dCTP (specific activity >500 Ci/mmol, obtained from DuPont NEN). RNA blot analyses indicated that RNA isolated from the samples was the size expected for α-amylase mRNA. Barley srp54 cDNA clones were obtained by screening a cDNA library at reduced stringency with an A. thaliana srp54 cDNA fragment (21Chu B. Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Three different cDNA clones were obtained and were designated srp54-1, -2, and -3 All three contained the complete coding sequence. They had 76, 142, and 20 bp, respectively, of sequence 5′ to the initiator Met codon. They contained 176, 312, and 215 bp, respectively, of 3′-noncoding sequence. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences from the srp54-1 and srp54-3 cDNA clones is shown in Fig. 1. srp54-1 and srp54-2 had nearly identical noncoding and coding DNA sequences, with only a single bp difference in the coding region. This results in an amino acid difference at position 96 in the protein sequence, threonine in srp54-1 and proline in srp54-2 The amino acid at the corresponding position in srp54-3 is a proline. The amino acid sequence of srp54-2 is not included in Fig. 1. DNA gel blot analysis (data not shown) indicated the presence of two genes or alleles suggesting the srp54-1 and srp54-2 cDNA clones do originate from distinct transcripts rather than from a cloning artifact. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three clones predict proteins with molecular masses of 54,444, 54,448, and 53,761 Da, respectively. These sequences contain the conserved GTP binding motifs and the carboxyl-terminal, Met-rich domains (M-domains) found in other Srp54 sequences (21Chu B. Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 43Marshallsay C. Prehn S. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The M-domains of the barley sequences also contain the proposed RNA binding motif (42Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 11: 1933-1947Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of the three barley srp54 cDNA clones are 79% identical. Amino acid sequences for the barley clones are 65-72% identical to the A. thaliana (21Chu B. Lindstrom J.T. Belanger F.C. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) sequences. RNA gel blot analysis indicated the message level of srp54 in aleurone layers was slightly enhanced by GA3 treatment (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). The srp54 message levels at both 8 and 24 h of GA3 treatment were approximately equal. This is in contrast to the dramatic effect of GA3 on the message level of the secreted enzyme α-amylase. As would be expected, srp54 message was also detectable in seedling tissue (Fig. 2, lane 4). The effect of a 3-h heat shock on the srp54 message level and the level of the RNA component of SRP (43Marshallsay C. Prehn S. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was investigated in aleurone layers incubated both in the absence or presence of GA3 (Fig. 3). Neither was affected by the heat shock treatment. The level of the SRP RNA was also unaffected by GA3. Heat shock did have the expected effect of dramatically reducing the steady state message levels of the secreted proteins α-amylase and endochitinase and in inducing expression of Hsp70 (Fig. 3). Endochitinase is a secreted protein which is expressed both in the absence and presence of GA3 (44Swegle M. Huang J.-K. Lee G. Muthukrishnan S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the protein level and cellular localization of Srp54, polyclonal antibodies were prepared to a 40-kDa polypeptide of Srp54-2 expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli The fusion protein consisted of the amino acids 40-386 encoded by the srp54-2 clone. Fig. 4 demonstrates the specificity of the antibody for Srp54. In the absence of IPTG induction of expression of the fusion protein, there was no antibody reaction (Fig. 4, lane 5). Following IPTG induction a single major protein at the expected size of the fusion protein was recognized by the antibody (Fig. 4, lane 6). The lower molecular weight immunoreactive bands are likely degradation products of Srp54 since they are not present in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 4, lane 5). In protein blots of aleurone layer total protein extracts, Srp54 was barely detectable (data not shown) indicating it is not an abundant cellular protein. Concentration of SRP by cellular fractionation was required for good antibody detection of Srp54 (see below). Incubation with GA3 did not result in any discernible difference in the total protein level of Srp54 (data not shown). Based on our hypothesis regarding the effect of heat shock on the secretory system, we considered the possibility that heat shock may inhibit the binding of SRP to the ER membranes. If this occurred, it would be expected to extend the translational arrest imposed on binding of SRP to the signal peptide. Such an effect might potentiate the observed enhanced message degradation. To test this possibility, we compared the cellular localization of SRP in heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked aleurone layers. Cell fractionation in continuous sucrose gradients followed by immunoblot analysis was carried out to localize Srp54, as a marker for SRP, in aleurone layers incubated for 16 h at 25°C in the presence of GA3 and in samples also subjected to a 3-h heat shock at 40°C. For both samples, SRP had a bimodal distribution with peaks centered around 15-22 and 35-40% sucrose (Fig. 5B). The prominent protein ba"

K., Hashimoto, S., Kelleher, R. J., III, Flanagan, P. M., Kornberg, R. D., Horikoshi, M., and Roeder, R. G. (1994) <i>Nature</i> 369, 252-255). These activation defects were also demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> in yeast cells (Lee, M., and Struhl, K. (1995) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol.</i> 15, 5461-5469). Here, the transcriptional activities of these and other TBP mutations were examined in human by both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays. Mutations L189K and E188K, which lie in the second stirrup region of TBP, show defective activation by acidic activators both in yeast and human. Somewhat surprisingly, mutations L114K and K211L have almost no demonstrable effect on activation by acidic activators in human, in contrast to their severe effects on defective activator responses in yeast. The implications of these results for TBP structure and function are discussed."
