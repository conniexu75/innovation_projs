https://openalex.org/W2107278930,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for adenosine deaminase (ADA)–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) has shown limited clinical efficacy because of the small proportion of engrafted genetically corrected HSCs. We describe an improved protocol for gene transfer into HSCs associated with nonmyeloablative conditioning. This protocol was used in two patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy was not available, which allowed the effect of gene therapy alone to be evaluated. Sustained engraftment of engineered HSCs with differentiation into multiple lineages resulted in increased lymphocyte counts, improved immune functions (including antigen-specific responses), and lower toxic metabolites. Both patients are currently at home and clinically well, with normal growth and development. These results indicate the safety and efficacy of HSC gene therapy combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning for the treatment of SCID."
https://openalex.org/W2058488568,"Phototaxis and photophobic responses of green algae are mediated by rhodopsins with microbial-type chromophores. We report a complementary DNA sequence in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that encodes a microbial opsin-related protein, which we term Channelopsin-1. The hydrophobic core region of the protein shows homology to the light-activated proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. Expression of Channelopsin-1, or only the hydrophobic core, in Xenopus laevis oocytes in the presence of all- trans retinal produces a light-gated conductance that shows characteristics of a channel selectively permeable for protons. We suggest that Channelrhodopsins are involved in phototaxis of green algae."
https://openalex.org/W1518885151,"We study the satisfiability of random Boolean expressions built from many clauses with K variables per clause (K-satisfiability). Expressions with a ratio α of clauses to variables less than a threshold α c are almost always satisfiable, whereas those with a ratio above this threshold are almost always unsatisfiable. We show the existence of an intermediate phase below α c , where the proliferation of metastable states is responsible for the onset of complexity in search algorithms. We introduce a class of optimization algorithms that can deal with these metastable states; one such algorithm has been tested successfully on the largest existing benchmark of K-satisfiability."

https://openalex.org/W2050085273,"Efforts to influence the biology of blood vessels by gene delivery have been hampered by a lack of targeting vectors specific for endothelial cells in diseased tissues. Here we show that a cationic nanoparticle (NP) coupled to an integrin αvβ3–targeting ligand can deliver genes selectively to angiogenic blood vessels in tumor-bearing mice. The therapeutic efficacy of this approach was tested by generating NPs conjugated to a mutant Raf gene, ATP μ -Raf , which blocks endothelial signaling and angiogenesis in response to multiple growth factors. Systemic injection of the NP into mice resulted in apoptosis of the tumor-associated endothelium, ultimately leading to tumor cell apoptosis and sustained regression of established primary and metastatic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2088127501,"Size homeostasis in budding yeast requires that cells grow to a critical size before commitment to division in the late prereplicative growth phase of the cell cycle, an event termed Start. We determined cell size distributions for the complete set of ∼6000 Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion strains and identified ∼500 abnormally small ( whi ) or large ( lge ) mutants. Genetic analysis revealed a complex network of newly found factors that govern critical cell size at Start, the most potent of which were Sfp1, Sch9, Cdh1, Prs3, and Whi5. Ribosome biogenesis is intimately linked to cell size through Sfp1, a transcription factor that controls the expression of at least 60 genes implicated in ribosome assembly. Cell growth and division appear to be coupled by multiple conserved mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2137623306,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an abundant mammalian phagocyte hemoprotein thought to primarily mediate host defense reactions. Although its microbicidal functions are well established in vitro, humans deficient in MPO are not at unusual risk of infection. MPO was observed herein to modulate the vascular signaling and vasodilatory functions of nitric oxide (NO) during acute inflammation. After leukocyte degranulation, MPO localized in and around vascular endothelial cells in a rodent model of acute endotoxemia and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxant responses, to which MPO-deficient mice were resistant. Altered vascular responsiveness was due to catalytic consumption of NO by substrate radicals generated by MPO. Thus MPO can directly modulate vascular inflammatory responses by regulating NO bioavailability."
https://openalex.org/W1991539783,"Axonal regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is limited by two proteins in myelin, Nogo and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). The receptor for Nogo (NgR) has been identified as an axonal glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)–anchored protein, whereas the MAG receptor has remained elusive. Here, we show that MAG binds directly, with high affinity, to NgR. Cleavage of GPI-linked proteins from axons protects growth cones from MAG-induced collapse, and dominant-negative NgR eliminates MAG inhibition of neurite outgrowth. MAG-resistant embryonic neurons are rendered MAG-sensitive by expression of NgR. MAG and Nogo-66 activate NgR independently and serve as redundant NgR ligands that may limit axonal regeneration after CNS injury."
https://openalex.org/W1979998322,"There is considerable public and scientific debate for and against genetically modified (GM) crops. One of the first GM crops, Brassica napus (oilseed rape or canola) is now widely grown in North America, with proposed commercial release into Australia and Europe. Among concerns of opponents to these crops are claims that pollen movement will cause unacceptable levels of gene flow from GM to non-GM crops or to related weedy species, resulting in genetic pollution of the environment. Therefore, quantifying pollen-mediated gene flow is vital for assessing the environmental impact of GM crops. This study quantifies at a landscape level the gene flow that occurs from herbicide-resistant canola crops to nearby crops not containing herbicide resistance genes."

https://openalex.org/W2054686000,"High-temperature superconductivity in doped Mott insulators such as the cuprates contradicts the conventional wisdom that electron repulsion is detrimental to superconductivity. Because doped fullerene conductors are also strongly correlated, the recent discovery of high-critical-temperature, presumably s-wave, superconductivity in C60 field effect devices is even more puzzling. We examine a dynamical mean-field solution of a model for electron-doped fullerenes that shows how strong correlations can indeed enhance superconductivity close to the Mott transition. We argue that the mechanism responsible for this enhancement could be common to a wider class of strongly correlated models, including those for cuprate superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2127232932,"Aquatic ecosystems are often contaminated by multiple substances. Nitrate, a common aquatic pollutant, strongly influenced the cycling of arsenic (As) under anoxic conditions in urban Upper Mystic Lake (Massachusetts, USA) by oxidizing ferrous iron [Fe(II)] to produce As-sorbing particulate hydrous ferric oxides and causing the more oxidized As(V), which is more particle-reactive than As(III) under these conditions, to dominate. This process is likely to be important in many natural waters."

https://openalex.org/W2013682169,"Lactobacilli have previously been used to deliver vaccine components for active immunization in vivo. Vectors encoding a single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment, which recognizes the streptococcal antigen I/II (SAI/II) adhesion molecule of Streptococcus mutans, were constructed and expressed in Lactobacillus zeae (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 393). The scFv antibody fragments secreted into the supernatant or expressed on the surface of the bacteria showed binding activity against SAI/II in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and surface scFv-expressing lactobacilli agglutinated SAI/II-expressing S. mutans in vitro without affecting the corresponding SAI/II knockout strain. Lactobacilli expressing the scFv fragment fused to an E-tag were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using beads coated with a monoclonal anti-E-tag antibody, and they bound directly to beads coated with SAI/II. After administration of scFv-expressing bacteria to a rat model of dental caries development, S. mutans bacteria counts and caries scores were markedly reduced. As lactobacilli are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) microorganisms, this approach may be of considerable commercial interest for in vivo immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2088220696,"Late Pleistocene organic-rich sediments (sapropels) from the eastern Mediterranean Sea harbor unknown, metabolically active chemoorganotrophic prokaryotes. As compared to the carbon-lean intermediate layers, sapropels exhibit elevated cell numbers, increased activities of hydrolytic exoenzymes, and increased anaerobic glucose degradation rates, suggesting that microbial carbon substrates originate from sapropel layers up to 217,000 years old. 16S ribosomal RNA gene analyses revealed that as-yet-uncultured green nonsulfur bacteria constitute up to 70% of the total microbial biomass. Crenarchaeota constitute a smaller fraction (on average, 16%). A slow but significant turnover of glucose could be detected. Apparently, sapropels are still altered by the metabolic activity of green nonsulfur bacteria and crenarchaeota."
https://openalex.org/W1993018878,"We describe a Proterozoic, fully biomineralized metazoan from the Omkyk Member (∼549 million years before the present) of the northern Nama Group, Namibia. Namapoikia rietoogensis gen. et sp. nov. is up to 1 meter in diameter and bears a complex and robust biomineralized skeleton; it probably represents a cnidarian or poriferan. Namapoikia encrusts perpendicular to the walls of vertical synsedimentary fissures in microbial reefs. This finding implies that large, modular metazoans with biologically controlled mineralization appeared some 15 million years earlier than previously documented."

https://openalex.org/W2007480340,"An extremely diverse lower Paleocene (64.1 million years ago) fossil leaf site from Castle Rock, Colorado, contains fossil litter that is similar to the litter of extant equatorial rainforests. The presence of a high-diversity tropical rainforest is unexpected, because other Paleocene floras are species-poor, a feature generally attributed to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction. The site occurs on the margin of the Denver Basin in synorogenic sedimentary rocks associated with the rise of the Laramide Front Range. Orographic conditions caused by local topography, combined with equable climate, appear to have allowed for the establishment of rainforests within 1.4 million years of the K-T boundary."

When a supernova remnant encounters a dense interstellar cloud, the compression may trigger gravitational collapse and the formation of a new generation of stars. This event can be detected through intense stimulated emission in the 1720-megahertz transition of the hydroxyl radical, OH, which yields unique insights into the physical processes and conditions occurring during the interaction."
