https://openalex.org/W2029856705,A diurnal rhythm was observed in the responsiveness of mice to nociceptive stimuli and in the hyperalgesic activity of endogenous opioid peptides and may partly account for previous controversy over the direct action of naloxone in opiate-naive animals.
https://openalex.org/W2040175583,"The number of mitochondrial DNA molecules in a cell population doubles at the same rate as the cell generation time. This could occur by a random selection of molecules for replication or by a process that ensures the replication of each individual molecule in the cell. We have investigated the rate at which mouse L cell mitochondrial DNA molecules labeled with 3H-thymidine during one round of replication are reselected for a second round of replication. Mouse L cells were labeled with 3H-thymidine for 2 hr, chased for various periods of time and then labeled with 5-bromodeoxyuridine for 4 hr immediately before mitochondrial DNA isolation. A constant fraction of 3H-thymidine-labeled mitochondrial DNA incorporated 5-bromodeoxyuridine after chase intervals ranging from 1.5-22 hr. This result demonstrates that mitochondrial DNA molecules replicated in a short time interval are randomly selected for later rounds of replication, and that replication of mitochondrial DNA continues throughout the cell cycle in mouse L cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996507241,"Abstract We have used 16 human × mouse somatic cell hybrids containing a variable number of human chromosomes to demonstrate that the human α-globin gene is on chromosome 16. Globin gene sequences were detected by annealing purified human α-globin complementary DNA to DNA extracted from hybrid cells. Human and mouse chromosomes were distinguished by Hoechst fluorescent centromeric banding, and the individual human chromosomes were identified in the same spreads by Giemsa trypsin banding. Isozyme markers for 17 different human chromosomes were also tested in the 16 clones which have been characterized. The absence of chromosomal translocation in all hybrid clones strongly positive for the α-globin gene was established by differential staining of mouse and human chromosomes with Giemsa 11 staining. The presence of human chromosomes in hybrid cell clones which were devoid of human α-globin genes served to exclude all human chromosomes except 6, 9, 14 and 16. Among the clones negative for human α-globin sequences, one contained chromosome 2 (JFA 14a 5), three contained chromosome 4 (AHA 16E, AHA 3D and WAV R4D) and two contained chromosome 5 (AHA 16E and JFA14a 13 5) in >10% of metaphase spreads. These data excluded human chromosomes 2, 4 and 5 which had been suggested by other investigators to contain human globin genes. Only chromosome 16 was present in each one of the three hybrid cell clones found to be strongly positive for the human α-globin gene. Two clones (WAIV A and WAV) positive for the human α-globin gene and chromosome 16 were counter-selected in medium which kills cells retaining chromosome 16. In each case, the resulting hybrid populations lacked both human chromosome 16 and the α-globin gene. These studies establish the localization of the human α-globin gene to chromosome 16 and represent the first assignment of a nonexpressed unique gene by direct detection of its DNA sequences in somatic cell hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2161076846,"The 5S DNA of Xenopus laevis, coding for oocyte-type 5S RNA, consists of many copies of a tandemly repeated unit of about 700 base pairs. Each unit contains a ""pseudogene"" in addition to the gene. The pseudogene has been partly sequenced and appears to be an almost perfect repeat of 101 residues of the gene. The order of components in the repeat unit is (5') long spacer--gene--linker--pseudogene (3') in the ""+"" strand (or H strand) of the DNA. The possible function of the pseudogene is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2064008318,"Removal of histone H1 produces a transition in the structure of chromatin fibers as observed by electron microscopy. Chromatin containing all histone proteins appears as fibers with a diameter of about 250 A. The nucleosomes within these fibers are closely packed. If histone H1 is selectively removed with 50-100 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in the presence of the ion-exchange resin AG 50 W - X2, chromatin appears as ""beads-on-a-string"" with the nucleosomes separated from each other by distances of about 150-200 A. If chromatin is treated in the presence of the resin with NaCl at concentrations of 650 mM or more, the structural organization of the chromatin is decreased, yielding fibers of irregular appearance."

https://openalex.org/W1520513696,"Monolayer cultures of embryonic chick chondrocytes were incubated with 35SO42- in the presence and absence of 1.0 mM p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xyloside for 2 days. The relative amounts of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and free polysaccharide chains were measured following gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. Synthesis of beta-xyloside-initiated polysaccharide chains was accompanied by an apparent decrease in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan production by the treated cultures. When levels of cartilage-specific core protein were determined by a radioimmunoassay, similar amounts of core protein were found in both beta-xyloside and control cultures, indicating that decreased synthesis of core protein is not responsible for the observed decrease in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan production. Activity levels of the chain-initiating glycosyltransferases (UDP-D-xylose: core protein xylosyltransferase and UDP-D-galactose:D-xylose galactosyltransferase) as well as the extent of xylosylation of core protein were found to be similar in cell extracts from both culture types. Furthermore, beta-xylosides did not inhibit the xylosyltransferase reaction in cell-free studies. In contrast, the beta-xylosides effectively competed with several galactose acceptors, including an enzymatically synthesized xylosylated core protein acceptor, in the first galactosyltransferase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1519078080,"Microtubules are formed from a 110,000-dalton dimeric subunit called tubulin. Two forms of 55,000-dalton monomer, alpha and beta, are found in all microtubule preparations. The dimers could thus theoretically be either heterodimers (alphabeta) or homodimers (alphaalpha and betabeta). This problem was investigated by stigated by chemical cross-linking using several bifunctional reagents, of which one, dimethyl-3,3-(tetrame thylenedioxy) dipropionimidate dihydrochloride (DTDI), was able to make intradimer bonds in tubulin. When soluble chick brain tubulin was cross-linked with DTDI and analyzed by electrophoresis in an acrylamide gel system capable of resolving alphaalpha, alphabeta, and betabeta, 60 to 90% of the cross-linked dimer was alphabeta. If tubulin was incubated at 24 degrees prior to cross-linking with DTDI the total yield of cross-linked dimer increased with time, indicating that tubulin was forming loose aggregates. The relative amounts of cross-linked dimer alphaalpha and betabeta also increase with time, indicating that soluble tubulin is largely alphabeta, and suggesting that cross-linked alphaalpha and betabeta arise from nonspecific aggregation during tubulin purification. The aggregation observed by cross-linking with DTDI was strongly influenced by colchicine and Vinca alkaloids in a pattern similar to the effects of these drugs on tubulin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2082873409,"Duck erythrocyte chromatin has been treated with DNAase 1 under conditions that are known to digest selectively the structural genes coding for globin mRNAs. This limited digestion releases specific sets of nonhistone chromosomal proteins that are not preferentially released during limited digestion with micrococcal nuclease, which does not selectively attack the globin sequences. Analysis of nucleosome monomer and multimer peaks separated on sucrose gradients after limited digestion with micrococcal nuclease shows that the proteins which are released by DNAase 1 digestion remain associated with the chromatin subunits and can be removed by extraction in 0.5 M NaCl. These proteins are tentatively identified as members of the high mobility group (HMG) proteins (originally described by Goodwin et al., 1973 Goodwin G.H. Sanders C. Johns E.W. A new group of chromatin-associated proteins with a high content of acidic and basic amino acids. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 14-19 Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar ) in terms of their extractability, electrophoretic characteristics and amino acid composition."

https://openalex.org/W2134251291,"Radioactively labeled tubulin from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells can be isolated by copolymerization with nonradioactive porcine brain microtubule protein. 75% of the soluble tubulin in CHO extracts co-polymerizes with the porcine protein through several cycles, without preferential loss of either CHO or porcine subunits. After phosphocellulose chromatography of the co-polymerized microtubules, the CHO tubulin is radiochemically homogeneous, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. CHO tubulin purified in this way has 1 mole of nucleotide per mole of protein noncovalently bound at the non-exchangeable or N site. Thin-layer chromatography indicates that the N site nucleotide is entirely ribo-GTP. Label and chase experiments show that the N site GTP exchanges intracellularly with a half-time of 33 hr in growing cells which have a generation time of 17 hr, while the tubulin poly-peptides are degraded with a half-time of 48 hr. Intracellular hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of the N site nucleotide can be detected but occurs very slowly, with a half-time of 24 hr. These results suggest that the N site nucleotide may function in vivo as a stable structural co-factor of the tubulin molecule and render improbable the possibility that it has a regulatory role in microtubule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2096152825,"As analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, no new proteins are synthesized during the first 60 min of differentiation of Dictyostelium discoideum. The major change observed is the cessation of synthesis of five polypeptides and the reduction in the relative rates of synthesis of several more. We show here that this specific inhibition of protein synthesis is under translational control; the mRNAs for these proteins persevere in the cell in a translatable form for as long as 4 hr of differentiation, but these proteins are not synthesized by the cells after 2 min of development. As determined by analysis of the subcellular distribution of ribosomes and messenger RNA, there is a precipitous drop in the overall rate of polypeptide chain initiation during the first 5 min of differentiation. To interrelate and explain these phenomena, we show that a recent kinetic analysis of mRNA translation can explain how a reduction in the activity of a component of the initiation machinery required for translation of all mRNAs, such as an initiation factor, could result in a reduction in the overall rate of chain initiation and also a preferential inhibition of translation of certain mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1983853484,"The control of protein synthesis in oocytes of Xenopus laevis has been investigated by injecting oocytes with mRNA and polysomes followed by labeling with 14C-amino acid mixtures. Contrary to previous reports in which injected oocytes were labeled with 3H-histidine, injected globin mRNA is found to decrease amino acid incorporation into endogenous proteins competitively at all concentrations tested. No increase in overall amino acid incorporation is detected when more mRNA is supplied. Similar results are obtained after labeling injected oocytes with leucine, methionine, proline or valine individually. An explanation is presented for the conflicting results obtained when histidine is used as a label. When reticulocyte polysomes are injected, rather than purified globin mRNA, incorporation of amino acids into endogenous proteins remains roughly constant and overall incorporation increases. Similarly, when encephalomyocarditis viral RNA is injected together with either globin mRNA or reticulocyte polysomes, the globin mRNA causes decreased amino acid incorporation into encephalomyocarditis proteins, but the polysomes do not do so. The results demonstrate that different types of mRNA compete for a strictly limited translational capacity which is saturated in the normal oocyte. The limiting component is present in polysomes and is not message-specific. The constraint on protein synthesis in the amphibian oocyte cannot be fully explained by masked mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2090703323,"The sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease and DNAase I of the integrated proviral DNA sequences in Swiss mouse cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus has been studied. Chromatin was separated into micrococcal nuclease-sensitive and -resistant regions, and the amount of proviral sequences in these DNA preparations was estimated by kinetic hybridization with single-stranded complementary DNA of Moloney murine leukemia virus. At least two thirds of the proviral DNA sequences were found in the open regions of chromatin, and only one third was resistant to nuclease. The proviral DNA sequences are even more sensitive to deoxyribonuclease I. When intact nuclei were treated with limited amounts of enzyme, only 5% of the nuclear DNA was digested, whereas 48% of the proviral DNA was degraded. The proviral DNA sequences in cells which do not produce virus are more resistant to nuclease digestion, as compared to virus producer cells. Thus the endogenous proviral sequences, in normal uninduced Swiss mouse cells, are randomly distributed between resistant and sensitive portions of chromatin when tested with either micrococcal nuclease or pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I. The effect of cell cycle synchronization on the accessibility of the proviral sequences to pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I was investigated with rat cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus. The amount of proviral DNA sensitive to pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I is higher in actively dividing cells than in cells arrested at Go phase, which produce only small amounts of virus."
https://openalex.org/W2025173553,"The organization of the 18S, 28S and 5.8S rRNA genes in the mouse has been elucidated by mapping with restriction endonucleases Eco RI, Hind III and Bam HI. Ribosomal DNA fragments were detected in electrophoretically fractionated digests of total nuclear DNA by in situ hybridization with radioiodinated rRNAs or with complementary RNA synthesized directly on rRNA templates. A map of the rDNA which includes 13 restriction sites was constructed from the sizes of rDNA fragments and their labeling by different probes. The map indicates that the rRNA genes lie within remarkably large units of reiterated DNA, at least 44,000 base pairs long. At least two, and possibly four, classes of repeating unit can be distinguished, the heterogeneity probably residing in the very large nontranscribed spacer region. The 5.8S rRNA gene lies in the transcribed region between the 18S and 28S genes."

https://openalex.org/W1567127782,"In addition to the usual decarboxylation, pig kidney 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) decarboxylase catalyzes a decarboxylation-dependent transamination which converts dopa into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and sinultaneously converts enzyme-bound pyridoxal-P into pyridoxamine-P. Similar reactions occur when this enzyme acts on m-tyrosine, alpha-methyldopa, and alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine. The transamination occurs in about 0.02% of decarboxylations of dopa and m-tyrosine and in about 2% of decarboxylations of alpha-methyldopa and alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine. The fraction of decarboxylations proceeding by the transamination pathway is independent of pH. This reaction appears to result from a divergence in the normal mechanism of decarboxylation; the quinoid intermediate which is formed by decarboxylation of the substrate-pyridoxal-P-Schiff base ordinarily protonates on the alpha carbon of the amino acid, but protonation occasionally occurs at the benzylic carbon of the coenzyme, and this latter route leads to transamination."
https://openalex.org/W1597547504,"The phage DNA-directed synthesis of beta-galactosidase has been examined in a system containing the following purified Escherichia coli factors: RNA polymerase; cyclic AMP receptor protein; N10-formyltetrahydrofolate Met-tRNAf transformylase; initiation factors 1, 2, and 3; elongation factors Tu, Ts, and G; release factors 1 and 2; 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; L factor (Kung, H. F., Spears, C., and Weissbach, H. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1556-1562); and Lalpha (Kung, H.-F., Spears, C., and Weissbach, H. (1976) Fed. proc. 35, 1537). Under these conditions, beta-galactosidase synthesis occurs at less than 1% of the rate obtained with unfractionated extracts, which suggested that other required components were lacking. The difficulty in obtaining large amounts of the purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for these studies made it necessary to modify the system. It was possible to conserve many of the purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases since at least 13 of them could be replaced by an Ehrlich ascites extract. The ascites extract plus other E. coli purified factors was used as a basic system to search for additional components required for beta-galactosidase synthesis. The present report describes the purification from E. coli extracts of three fractions, called Lbeta, Lgamma, and Ldelta, that are needed to restore enzyme synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1499143977,"We have analyzed images of parathormone obtained by dark field electron microscopy in order to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. The technique of autocorrelation was used to differentiate hormone particles from the background of noise in the electron micrographs. Our data suggest that parathormone is about 36 A in maximum dimension and is comprised of two interconnected domains of different mass that occur in a consistent orientation to each other. By means of the formulation of Chou and Fasman (Chou, P.Y., and Fasman, G.D. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 211-222), we predicted the secondary structure of the hormone and fitted this into the three-dimensional structure developed by microscopy. The resultant speculative model can explain certain physical and chemical properties of parathormone."
https://openalex.org/W2031257050,"Measurement of the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into precursor pools and into poly(A) of fertilized sea urchin eggs showed that the amount of adenosine incoporated into poly(A) after a 2 hr incubation approximated the total poly(A) content of the embryos. This was observed whether the incubation was begun at fertilization when the poly(A) content is tripling or at 2.5 hr after fertilization when the poly(A) levels are not changing, and thus indicates that poly(A) turns over continually and completely. The turnover appears to take place on polysomal mRNA, since after either 10 or 120 min of incubation, 75% of the 3H-adenosine incorporated into poly(A) is on polysomes. Poly(A) lengths before and after fertilization are not significantly different, indicating that the increase in poly(A) content reflects the addition of poly(A) sequences onto mRNA molecules which previously contained no poly(A) sequences or only short poly(A) sequences. Both the new as well as the preexisting poly(A) tracts must turn over to produce the incorporation we observe. The radioactive poly(A) tracts measured by alkaline release of adenosine begin as short sequences and gradually extend their lengths until they have reached a size consistent with the idea that the poly(A) sequences have become fully radioactive. This labeling pattern shows that the poly(A) is turning over from the 3′ end terminal probably by a shortening and lengthening mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1984112365,"After forced intragastric intubation of alcohol, rats will show a greatly increased tendency to self-administer alcohol in a free-choice situation. Diazepam (Valium) dosage (5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) during the period of withdrawal serves to maintain undiminished such alcohol self-administration. Without such diazepam dosage the tendency to self-administer alcohol returns to control levels."
https://openalex.org/W1994631198,"A cell-free system is described which formed very high levels of recombinant DNA structures in 4 hr at 26°C. It consisted of a single fraction of a high speed supernatant prepared from an extract of unfertilized eggs of the frog Xenopus laevis. This fraction eluted at 0.16−0.18 M Tris homogenization buffer from a DEAE-cellulose column. When two partially homologous supercoiled DNA molecules of different contour lengths were incubated simultaneously in this system, high levels of heterologous figure eight DNA structures were formed and observed by electron microscopy. Subsequent cleavage of the newly formed figure eight structures with Bam HI and Eco RI restriction endonucleases gave rise to “α structures” and “χ structures.” The observed figure eight structures presumably represent the recombination intermediate predicted by the Holliday model for genetic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2065989942,"Studies were performed with duck immature red blood cells to identify and characterize the globin mRNA sequences in nuclear RNA. Annealing of 3H-globin cDNA to unlabeled nuclear RNA has identified three distinct size classes of nuclear RNA molecules containing globin mRNA sequences. The largest size class contained 1–2% of total nuclear globin mRNA sequences and sedimented through 85% formamide-sucrose gradients at the same rate as 28S ribosomal RNA. Chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose indicated that most of these molecules are not polyadenylated. The bulk of nuclear globin mRNA sequences (70%) was contained in polyadenylated RNA molecules which sedimented at 16.5S. The remainder of nuclear globin mRNA sequences (∼30%) was detected in molecules sedimenting at 10S (the position of cytoplasmic globin mRNA). To determine whether a precursor-product relationship exists between these nuclear molecules and cytoplasmic globin mRNA, pulse-label and chase experiments were performed. Labeled globin mRNA sequences were assayed by annealing to globin cDNA-cellulose. Labeled 28S nuclear globin RNA sequences could not be detected, perhaps due to technical reasons. 16.5S nuclear globin RNA was labeled and chased into cytoplasmic globin mRNA sequences. The half-life of 16.5S nuclear globin RNA was estimated to be less than 30 min. These results demonstrate that in duck immature red blood cells, globin mRNA is transcribed as a larger precursor. Furthermore, size characterization of this precursor during pulse-label and chase periods suggests that it is processed within the nucleus to 10S globin RNA."

This energy difference bears no relationship to the nutritive value of the food. When protein yield is compared, the energy to harvest some seafoods is in the same range as that needed to grow field crops. There is a large increase in energy consumption after processing, partly because of the small percent of the live weight used for human food."
https://openalex.org/W2049010187,"Somatic cell hybrids were generated by fusion of mouse erythroleukemic cells (clone 745) to mouse lymphoma cells or mouse bone marrow cells. The erythroleukemic cells have been shown previously to have a low basal level of erythroid differentiation which is markedly amplified when the cells are grown in medium containing dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Hybrid cells were examined for hemoglobin production by benzidine staining. Many hybrid clones were found in which hemoglobin production in response to DMSO was either abolished or greatly reduced. From these hybrids, subclones were isolated in which hemoglobin production was restored. Karyological and enzyme analysis showed that the restoration of hemoglobin production was associated with the loss of an X chromosome contributed by the nonerythroleukemic parent. Other subclones which retained an X chromosome continued to be inhibited for hemoglobin production. Analysis of other hybrid lines capable of a limited degree of erythroid differentiation indicated a quantitative inverse correlation between the proportion of cells bearing an X chromosome and the proportion of cells able to form hemoglobin. Finally, four hybrid lines having many cells without an X chromosome were grown in medium containing DMSO. This procedure led to the selection of hybrid sublines having a nondifferentiating phenotype and concomitantly having a greatly increased proportion of cells bearing an X chromosome. Thus three lines of evidence suggest that a locus (loci) on the X chromosome is capable of inhibiting the DMSO-inducible hemoglobin production of the erythroleukemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482152230,"Two populations of tryptic peptides were isolated from bovine estrus cervical mucin (BCM). One contained all the carbohydrate, and was rich in threonine and serine. These glycopeptides had, like the whole mucin, alanine as their NH2-terminal residues. Their COOH-terminal residues were arginine. The second population of peptides was rich in carboxylic amino acids, contained two cysteinyl residues, and had, like the whole mucin, leucine as COOH-terminal residues. Their NH2-terminal residues were aspartic acid. The sum of the residues of one glycopeptide plus one cysteinyl-containing peptide corresponded to the number of residues constituting a putative subunit of BCM. The amino acid sequence of the major cysteinyl peptide was determined. A cluster of hydrophobic residues was found in the COOH-terminal region. The amino acid sequences of two of the glycopeptides were found identical up to the 22nd residue. The small number of tryptic peptides, as well as the large amount of NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acids found in BCM indicate that this glycoprotein is made up of similar subunits with a molecular weight of about 22,000, one of the glycopeptides representing the NH2-terminal part, and one of the cysteinyl peptides, the COOH-terminal part. However, the existence of these subunits was not confirmed by ultracentrifugation of BCM in dithiothreitol and sodium dodecyl sulfate. BCM was polydisperse and had a mean molecular weight of 507,000."

https://openalex.org/W2027600008,"A size class of polysomes was isolated from chick embryonic leg skeletal muscle which synthesized almost exclusively a polypeptide chain with a molecular weight identical to the myosin heavy chain. The mRNA purified from these polysomes was shown to synthesize the 200,000 dalton polypeptide in the wheat germ cell-free translation system. At least 90% of the polypeptide had properties similar to the myosin heavy chain. Isoelectric focusing indicated that the myosin heavy chain synthesized in vitro contained two chains in equal amounts, as did purified embryonic leg skeletal muscle myosin. The kinetics of hybridization of the complementary DNA with an excess of the myosin heavy chain mRNA (MHC mRNA) indicated the presence of two different mRNA sequences. Reassociation of the cDNA to an excess of the DNA of the genome suggested that there is little, if any, reiteration of the myosin heavy chain genes."

In order to obtain the various peptides in pure state, a combination of gel permeation, cation and anion exchange column chromatographic methods, as well as various ascending paper chromatographic methods were adopted. Sequence studies of the tryptic peptides were carried out mainly by a modified manual Edman degradation procedure and also by automated analysis, carboxypeptidase digestion, and by hydrazinolysis. Thus, 242 residues (88.6%) out of a total of 273 amino acid residues were sequenced in the present study.

Sequenator analyses of three large cyanogen bromide peptides (53 to 72 residues) provided tryptic peptide overlap data for the inner portion of the protein. The cyanogen bromide peptides accounted for all of the 273 amino acid residues which were present in the tryptic peptides isolated from carboxymethyl-iron protein (Tanaka, M., Haniu, M., Yasunobu, K.

https://openalex.org/W1481212362,"The fluorescence substrate kynuramine was used as a probe of the catalytic site of plasma amine oxidase. Under anaerobic conditions, the binding of kynuramine causes several spectroscopic changes. The Stokes shift (deltav = 5326 cm-) associated with binding of the substrate to the enzyme can be attributed to nonpolar properties of the binding site, whereas the increase in emission anisotropy (A = 33) indicates rigid attachment of the substrate to the enzyme. The fluorescence enhancement that follows the binding of substrate was used to determine the association constant (Ka). The enzyme plasma amine oxidase binds only 1 molecule of substrate with a Ka = 1.8 X 10(5) M-1 under anaerobic conditions. The use of fluorescence substrates seems to offer the possibility of monitoring conformational changes occurring prior to the catalytic event."
