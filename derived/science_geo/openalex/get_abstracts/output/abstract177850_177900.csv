https://openalex.org/W2082424812,"We purified human plasma lysophospholipase D that produces physiologically active lysophosphatidic acid and showed that it is a soluble form of autotaxin, an ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase, originally found as a tumor cell motility-stimulating factor. Its lower K mvalue for a lysophosphatidylcholine than that for a synthetic substrate of nucleotide suggests that lysophosphatidylcholine is a more likely physiological substrate for autotaxin and that its predicted physiological and pathophysiological functions could be mediated by its activity to produce lysophosphate acid, an intercellular mediator. Recombinant autotaxin was found to have lysophospholipase D activity; its substrate specificity and metal ion requirement were the same as those of the purified plasma enzyme. The activity of lysophospholipase D for exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine in human serum was found to increase in normal pregnant women at the third trimester of pregnancy and to a higher extent in patients in threatened preterm delivery, suggesting its roles in induction of parturition.

Particularly, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA,1radyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate) has received interest because of its identification as an active component in platelet-aggregating activity and vasoactivity in incubated animal sera and plasma (4Tokumura A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Later, its principle effects were found to be growth-related; that is, cellular proliferation, alterations in differentiation, and suppression of apoptosis (2Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Tokumura A. Prog.

Other important effects are its cytoskeletal response, cell aggregation, contraction, adhesion, or chemotaxis (1Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 2Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Moolenaar W.H. Exp.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediators. 2001; 64: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Its diverse activities appear to be regulated by the relative distribution of its specific receptors in a family of endothelial differentiation genes (EDG), desensitization of the receptors, and the local concentration of LPA determined by balance between LPA-producing and -degrading enzyme activities (1Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 2Goetzl E.J. An S.

Although LPA is produced intracellularly in phospholipid biosynthesis and turnover, this should be differentiated from its actual pool as a first messenger unless there are efficient mechanisms for its release into extracellular fluid or leaflets of plasma membranes (3Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4Tokumura A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 151-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Tigyi G.

The first study on extracellular production of LPA was our own, detecting lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity that produces bioactive LPA from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in rat plasma (7Tokumura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Its distinct substrate specificity and cation requirement from known intracellular lysoPLD activity suggested that it is a hitherto uncharacterized metalloenzyme (7Tokumura A. Harada K. Fukuzawa K. Tsukatani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Tokumura A. Miyake M. Yoshimoto O. Shimizu M. Fukuzawa K.

Acta. 1999; 1437: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To understand its physiological and pathological significance, the identity of lysoPLD activity in blood circulation should be clarified. Therefore we purified and characterized lysoPLD in human plasma and obtained strong evidence that it is a soluble form of autotaxin (ATX), a member of the ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (PDE) family (10Stracke M.L. Clair T. Liotta L.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). LPC (1-hexanoyl (6:0), decanoyl (10:0), lauroyl (12:0), myristoyl (14:0), palmitoyl (16:0), stearoyl (18:0), oleoyl (18:1), linoleoyl (18:2), and α-linolenoyl (18:3)), LPC plasmalogen from beef heart (alkenyl-LPC), 1-O-hexadecyl-LPC (alkyl-LPC), phosphatidylcholine (PC) (1,2-dibutyryl (4:0/4:0), dihexanoyl (6:0/6:0), dioctanoyl (8:0/8:0), didecanoyl (10:0/10:0), dilauroyl (12:0/12:0), dimyristoyl (14:0/14:0) and diarachidonoyl (20:4/20:4)), and sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were commercial products of Sigma and Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). 1–20:4-LPC was prepared by the hydrolysis of 20:4/20:4-PC with phospholipase A2 from bee venom, as described (11Satouchi K. Sakaguchi M. Shirakawa M. Hirano K. Tanaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For preparation of 2–20:4-LPC, 1-alkenyl-LPC from beef heart was reacted with arachidonic anhydride, and the resultant PC was subjected to mild acid hydrolysis, as described (11Satouchi K. Sakaguchi M. Shirakawa M. Hirano K. Tanaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 1–20:4–2-acetyl (2:0)-PC and 1–2:0–2-20:4-PC were prepared by reacting of 1–20:4-LPC and 2–20:4-LPC with acetic anhydride, respectively, in the presence of pyridine at 35 °C for 12 h. Human blood (120–170 ml) was withdrawn from the antecubital vein of healthy volunteers of both genders aging 21–26 and mixed with 0.15 volume of citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution (102 mm sodium citrate, 17 mm citrate, 129 mm dextrose, and 16 mm NaH2PO4). Plasma was prepared by centrifugation of the blood at 1,500 × g for 30 min, and the proteins in pooled human plasma (1150 ml) were fractionated between 30 and 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate. Fractions were subjected to six chromatographies as follows: 1) anion exchange chromatography on a HiPrep 16/10 Q XL column (16 × 100 mm) with an NaCl gradient (0–1 m) for 40 min in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min, 2) hydroxyapatite chromatography on a Bio-Scale ceramic hydroxyapatite column (5 ml) with a phosphate gradient (10–250 mm) for 50 min in sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, 3) heparin affinity chromatography on a HiTrap heparin column (5 ml) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a stepwise fashion with 0.15, 0.25, and 1m NaCl each for 5 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, 4) concanavalin A affinity chromatography on a Con A-Sepharose HR column (16 × 83 mm) with 0.5 mmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside for 67 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, 5) hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a TSKgel Phenyl-5PW (7.5 × 75 mm) with an ammonium sulfate gradient (1–0 m) for 50 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 6) anion exchange chromatography on a TSKgel Bio-Assist Q (4.6 × 50 mm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20% glycerol in a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5 m for 50 min and then 0.5 to 1m for 5 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Proteins in chromatographic fractions were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Fractions with lysoPLD activity in the final purification step by the second anion exchange chromatography were combined and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gel. After staining the gel with SyproRuby, the 110-kDa band was cut and treated with trypsin. The tryptic digest was directly analyzed by nanoscale high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (0.1 × 50 mm) coupled to tandem mass spectrometer (Q-Tof2) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. Positive ion tandem mass spectra were measured. The amino acid sequence from the NH2 terminus of the purified enzyme was determined in a protein sequencer (Procise cLC). LysoPLD activity was estimated by determining choline liberated from exogenously added LPC, PC, or sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. In the standard assay, diluted sample solutions (0.1 ml) were first incubated with 0.05 ml of the substrate dispersion in saline containing 0.05% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for various time intervals up to 24 h. Choline in 0.1-ml aliquots of the incubation mixture was oxidized to betaine with 1 units/ml choline oxidase (12Takayama M. Itoh S. Nagasaki T. Tanimizu I Clin. Chim Acta. 1977; 79: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), and hydrogen peroxide concomitantly generated was determined by fluorimetry (13Zaitu K. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In brief, the second assay mixture consisted of 0.1 ml of the first assay mixture, 2.6 ml of 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 0.2 ml of 7.5 mm3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), 0.1 ml of 2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Funakoshi), and 0.01 ml of 300 units/ml choline oxidase (Toyobo, Osaka). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, fluorescent intensity from the mixtures was measured at 404 nm with the excitation of 320 nm. Nucleotide PDE activity was measured with a synthetic substrate of nucleotide, p-nitrophenyl thymidine-5′-monophosphate (pNP-TMP, Sigma) essentially as described previously (14Ruzzel W.E. Method Enzymol. 1963; 6: 236-258Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the standard assay, 0.1-ml aliquots of diluted sample solutions were incubated with 0.05 ml of the pNP-TMP solution (0.45 mm) at 37 °C for different time intervals. The assay solution was mixed with 1.0 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and the increase in optical density was measured at 400 nm. Both lysoPLD and nucleotide PDE activities of conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells transfected with a vector containing full-length cDNA of rat ATX corresponding to human ATX-t but not phosphodiesterase I/nucleotide pyrophosphatase brain-specific (15Narita M. Goji J. Nakamura H. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28235-28242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or empty vector (pcDNA3) with the aid of LipofectAMINETM were measured by the methods described above. The activities of the recombinant ATX were calculated by subtracting the value for the medium of control cells from that for the medium of ATX-transfected cells. The conditioned media were provided by Dr. J. Aoki, the University of Tokyo, Japan, who constructed rat cDNA for ATX by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using rat liver cDNA library as template DNA. Human cDNA for ATX-t amplified from human liver DNA library was kindly provided by Dr. T. Katada, the University of Tokyo, and was transfected in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells as described for rat ATX. Both its lysoPLD and nucleotide PDE activities were measured as described above. Re-solubilized proteins from human plasma precipitated with between 30–60% ammonium sulfate were fractionated by sequential HPLC. A summary of results on purification of lysoPLD is presented in Table I. We obtained 14,478-fold purified lysoPLD with 6.1% recovery at the seventh purification step (Phenyl-5PW). By the second anion exchange chromatography, the lysoPLD was further highly purified with 1.2% yield; a major peak with lysoPLD activity was separated by a minor peak with the enzyme activity (Fig.1). The first major peak (fractions 47–51) showed a single band at 110 kDa stained with silver on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with the estimated 110 kDa for a protein peak with lysoPLD activity by its gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 0.2m NaCl). The major peak fraction had the same relative activities for various LPCs with those of the minor peak fraction (data not shown). The peptides digested from the 110-kDa protein band with trypsin were separated by nanoscale reverse phase chromatography on a C18 column and directly analyzed by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. A data base search of tandem mass spectra with a Mascot Search Program revealed that purified lysoPLD shared four fragments of amino acid sequences with ATX from the human teratocarcinoma cell line, Ntera2D1 (ATX-t) (16Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and human PD-Iα (17Kawagoe H. Soma O. Goji J. Nishimura N. Narita M. Inazawa J. Nakamura H. Sano K. Genomics. 1995; 30: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fitted peptides correspond to318YGPFGPEMTNPLR330,335IVGQLMDGLK344,440RIEDIHLLVER450, and854TYLHTYESEI863 of ATX-t (Fig.3). The amino acid sequence from Tyr318 to Arg330 was not included in ATX from an A2058 human melanoma cell line (ATX-m) (18Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) originally identified for a factor with tumor cell motility-stimulating activity at nanomolar concentrations in a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism (19Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Unsworh E.J. Årestad A.A. Cioce V. Schiffmann E. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2524-2528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA for ATX-t (863 amino acids, Fig. 3) and PD-Iα (863 amino acids) were thought to be a spliced form of cDNA for ATX-m (915 amino acids) (16Lee H.Y. Murata J. Clair T. Polymeropoulos M.H. Torres R. Manrow R.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Kawagoe H. Soma O. Goji J. Nishimura N. Narita M. Inazawa J. Nakamura H. Sano K. Genomics. 1995; 30: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); in the amino acid sequence of ATX-m, 52 amino acids were inserted between Glu324 and Met325 in that of ATX-t or PD-Iα (18Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our present result showed that human plasma lysoPLD is a soluble form of human ATX-t or PD-Iα but not ATX-m. Consistent with this suggestion, the elution pattern in the second anion exchange chromatography of human plasma lysoPLD was found to be similar with that of nucleotide PDE activity (Fig. 1). The COOH terminus of purified lysoPLD was identified as the isoleucine residue, since the peptide from Thr854 to Ile863corresponds to the COOH-terminal region of ATX-t (Fig. 3). In addition, the NH2-terminal sequences of the 110-kDa band were determined as AEGWEEGPPTVLSD and RLHTKGSTEERHLLY, which were identical to the sequences of ATX-t from Ala36 to Asp49and from Arg585 to Tyr599, respectively (Fig.3). Because two additional protein bands of about 75 and 30 kDa were detected by SDS-PAGE of purified lysoPLD under reducing conditions (data not shown), the 110-kDa protein should be constructed by cross-linking via a disulfide bridge(s) of these two peptides, generated by multiple proteolytic cleavages of its precursor protein with a putative transmembrane domain. One of the proteolytic cleavage sites should be between Arg35 and Ala36, releasing the NH2-terminal sequence containing the transmembrane domain (Fig. 3). The site was closer to the NH2 terminus than that of the deduced cleavage site between Ser48 and Asp49 for ATX-m (18Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A.

The time courses of hydrolysis of 16:0-LPC and pNP-TMP by the purified lysoPLD are shown in Fig.4 A. The rate of hydrolysis of pNP-TMP by the purified lysoPLD was higher than that of 16:0-LPC. Both the K m and V max values of its lysoPLD activity to 16:0-LPC calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot were 0.26 ± 0.5 mm and 103 ± 22 nmol/h/ml (n = 3), lower than that of its PDE activity to pNP-TMP (5.5 ± 0.5 mm and 752 ± 236 nmol/h/ml,n = 3), respectively. Co2+ increased not only lysoPLD activity of the purified enzyme, as in rat plasma lysoPLD (8Tokumura A. Miyake M. Yoshimoto O. Shimizu M. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but also its nucleotide PDE activity. As shown in Fig.4 B, both ATP and pNP-TMP inhibited the lysoPLD activity in a concentration-dependent manner. This result indicates that purified plasma lysoPLD has nucleotide pyrophosphatase/PDE activity. To obtain direct evidence that human plasma lysoPLD is a soluble form of ATX-t, we measured lysoPLD activity in conditioned media from Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells transfected with a vector containing full-length cDNA of human ATX-t or rat ATX. The time courses of lysoPLD and nucleotide PDE activities of the soluble forms of recombinant ATX (Fig. 4, C andE) were similar to those of purified human plasma lysoPLD (Fig. 4 A), respectively. As in the case of the purified lysoPLD from human plasma, the K m andV max values of the lysoPLD activity of the recombinant human (0.090 ± 0.001 mm and 223 ± 2.6 nmol/h/ml, n = 3) and rat (0.11 ± 0.01 mm and 647 ± 133 nmol/h/ml, n = 3) ATX to 16:0-LPC was less than that of its PDE activity to pNP-TMP (human ATX 1.78 ± 0.07 mm and 2865 ± 62 nmol/h/ml, n = 3; rat ATX 3.63 ± 0.37 mm and 9696 ± 303 nmol/h/ml, n = 3). The addition of Co2+ to the assay solution resulted in an increase in both its lysoPLD and nucleotide PDE activities, like the case of the purified plasma lysoPLD. Both ATP and pNP-TMP inhibited the lysoPLD activity of the recombinant human and rat ATX in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, D andF). We next examined the substrate specificity of purified plasma lysoPLD for various LPCs. The lysoPLD hydrolyzed three subclasses of LPC (acyl > alkyl > alkenyl, Fig.5 A) but failed to hydrolyzesn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, indicating that hydrophobic interaction of amino acid residues in its active site with the fatty acyl moiety is necessary for activity. 1–14:0-LPC was the best of the saturated fatty acyl LPCs, and unsaturated species of C18-fatty acyl LPCs were better than the saturated ones. The enzyme hydrolyzed 2–20:4-LPC acetylated to minimize acyl migration during the assay for lysoPLD activity at a higher rate than that for the acetylated 1–20:4-LPC (Fig. 5 A). Thus, lysoPLD supplies LPAs that are preferable for the LPA3(EDG-7) LPA receptor more efficiently, since LPA3 responds to LPA with a 2-unsaturated acyl group more than LPAs, with a 1-saturated or unsaturated acyl group (20Bandoh K. Aoki J. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27776-27785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The lysoPLD hydrolyzed PCs with two saturated medium chain acyl groups but not with two saturated short or long chain acyl groups (Fig. 5 A). Co2+ increased the activities for acyl LPCs and all related analogs except 18:2-LPC and shifted the optimal chain lengths of saturated acyl LPC and PC from 14 to 12 and from 10 and 8, respectively, and the optimal numbers ofcis-double bonds of unsaturated acyl LPA from 2 to 1. The Co2+-induced alteration in the substrate specificity of purified lysoPLD suggested that this metal ion was replaced with natively bound metal ions, playing an important role in two-step catalytic reactions of ATX (21Zimmermann H.

The substrate specificity of purified human plasma lysoPLD for phospholipids coincided with that of the recombinant human ATX (data not shown), very similar to that of the recombinant ATX (Fig. 5 B). Taken altogether, the current results indicate that human plasma lysoPLD is a soluble form of human ATX-t. An early investigation showed that several fractions with nucleotide PDE activity were separated by electrophoresis of human serum, one of which had a much higher K m value (30 mm) for pNP-TMP than those suggested for others (less than 0.3 mm) and increased during pregnancy (23Lüthje L. Pickert S. Ogilvie A. Hornemann E. Siegfried W. Waldherr A. Domschke W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 177: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In our preliminary work, serum lysoPLD activity measured with a radioactive 16:0-LPC was found to increase in humans in pregnancy (24Tokumura A. Yamano S. Aono T. Fukuzawa K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study with a more convenient lysoPLD assay, we confirmed our previous finding and found that the elevated activity decreased to near the level of nonpregnant women after delivery (Fig.6). Interestingly, its activity in serum from patients with threatened preterm delivery at the third trimester of pregnancy was significantly higher than that of normal pregnant women (Fig. 6). These results suggest that lysoPLD-mediated production of LPA plays physiological roles in parturition, since LPA injected intravenously into rats was reported to increase intrauterine pressure because of contraction of uterine smooth muscle in vivo(25Tokumura A. Fukuzawa K. Yamada S. Tsukatani H. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 1980; 245: 74-83PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, we found that the amino acid sequences of trypsin-digested peptides from purified human plasma lysoPLD were fitted to those of human ATX-t and PD-Iα. However, we could not exclude the possibility that human plasma lysoPLD is an uncharacterized isoform of ATX because of limited numbers of its partial amino acid sequences, revealed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Judging by its apparent molecular mass (110 kDa), the plasma lysoPLD would be a soluble form of ATX-t or PD-Iα, although there is no information on its cell sources, mode of its processing within the cells, and mechanism of its secretion. The soluble form of ATX-t appears to be somewhat structurally different from the soluble form of ATX-m; the molecular mass of the soluble ATX-m was estimated to be 125 kDa and appears to be cleaved at a distinct site from that for ATX-t when processed, probably before its secretion (18Murata J. Lee H.Y. Clair T. Krutzsch H.C. Årestad A.A. Sobel M.E. Liotta L.A. Stracke M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30479-30484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stracke M.L. Krutzsch H.C.

The enzymic properties of the plasma lysoPLD (time courses, kinetics, potentiation by Co2+, and substrate specificity) were found to be similar to those of recombinant human ATX-t and rat ATX examined in this study, whereas the amino acid sequences of human ATX-t and rat ATX are not identical. Thus, this minor structural inconsistency between human and rat ATX seems not to affect their enzymic property appreciably. Our results with the recombinant ATX strongly indicate that lysoPLD purified from human plasma is a soluble enzyme of ATX-t isoform. It has been postulated that the product by ATX of an unknown phosphorylated substrate besides nucleotides may stimulate tumor cell motility (10Stracke M.L. Clair T. Liotta L.A. Adv.

The present study has thrown insight to this issue; the tumor cell motility-stimulating effect of ATX may not be mediated by its postulated agonistic action or nucleotide-metabolizing effect (10Stracke M.L.

Indeed, there is a close fit between the postulated physiological functions of ATX and LPA that have been separately investigated. ATX is implicated in cartilage matrix calcification (22Bollen M.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6938-6944PubMed Google Scholar), although definite evidence is lacking on the fundamental molecular mechanism. LPA was shown to accelerate mouse embryonic neurogenesis and postnatal myelin maturation (1Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 507-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), proliferate primary osteoblasts (35Grey A. Banovic T. Naot D. Hill B. Callon K. Reid I. Cornish J.

In particular, their involvement in the postnatal development of the central nervous system should be addressed. The intermediate peak of mRNA expression of LPA1(EDG-2) LPA receptor around the time of active myelination in neonatal rat brain suggested its involvement in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination (37Allard J.

Similar spatiotemporal expression of mRNA for ATX was observed in developing rat brain after birth; the mRNA was expressed in oligodendrocytes and in cells of the choroid plexus, indicating its relevance of maintenance of myelin sheath and blood-brain barrier (33Fuss B.

Fukuzawa, unpublished data. there is no evidence for its source. The physiological role for LPA generated by lysoPLD in the body fluids including blood plasma is still unclear except that LPA in human follicular fluid was shown to participate in the stimulation of oocyte maturation (39Hinokio K. Yamano S. Nakagawa K. Irahara M. Kamada M. Tokumura A. Aono T. Life Sci. 2002; 70: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The physiological meaning of the elevation in the serum lysoPLD activity in human pregnancy (24Tokumura A. Yamano S. Aono T. Fukuzawa K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is particularly intriguing and could be clarified in near future, since its higher activity of patients in threatened preterm delivery compared with that of women in normal pregnancy found in this study suggested the involvement of LPA produced by circulating lysoPLD in human parturition. Previously, we found that serum lysoPLD activity increased in rabbits fed on a high cholesterol diet, which suggested its pathological role in the induction of atherosclerosis (40Tokumura A. Kanaya Y. Kitahara M. Miyake M. Yoshioka Y. Fukuzawa K. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since LPA induces attachment of monocytes to vascular endothelial cells (40Tokumura A. Kanaya Y. Kitahara M.

The pathophysiological significance of LPA generated by lysoPLD besides its promotion of tumor metastasis is a matter of debate. In this study, we provided evidence that human plasma lysoPLD is identical to ATX-t. Information accumulated by previous studies on the molecular biology of ATX is expected to trigger accelerated advances in the evaluation of the physiological and pathological significance of LPA production by lysoPLD in animal body fluids.

Natural products and synthetic small molecules that bind to the ATP-binding pocket in the amino-terminal domain of Hsp90 inhibit its function and cause the degradation of these client proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 function in cells causes down-regulation of an Akt kinase-dependent pathway required for D-cyclin expression and retinoblastoma protein-dependent G1 arrest. Intracellular Akt is associated with Hsp90 and Cdc37 in a complex in which Akt kinase is active and regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Functional Hsp90 is required for the stability of Akt in the complex. Occupancy of the ATP-binding pocket by inhibitors is associated with the ubiquitination of Akt and its targeting to the proteasome, where it is degraded. This results in a shortening of the half-life of Akt from 36 to 12 h and an 80% reduction in its expression. Akt and its activating kinase, PDK1, are the only members of the protein kinase A/protein kinase B/protein kinase C-like kinase family that are affected by Hsp90 inhibitors.

These complexes also play a role in refolding denatured proteins in cells exposed to environmental stress (11Bansal G. Norton P. Latchman D. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Grp94 and TRAP-1 are members of the Hsp90 family expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively (12Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. J. Mol.

ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for the last steps of refolding and release of the native protein from the chaperone complex (14Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P.

Several natural products, including radicicol and the ansamycin antibiotics geldanamycin and herbimycin-A, bind tightly to the Hsp90 ATP/ADP pocket (15Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Occupancy of the pocket by these drugs prevents ATP binding and the completion of client protein refolding. As a result, drug treatment leads to proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins that require Hsp90 for conformational maturation (18Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to ansamycins or radicicol leads to a decline in expression of Hsp90 client proteins such as Raf, HER2, and mutant p53 (2Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol.

Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 function and degradation of its client proteins do not lead to nonspecific cell death. Instead, in cancer cells, Hsp90 inhibitors cause growth arrest followed by differentiation and then apoptosis (20Srethapakdi M. Liu F. Tavorath R. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3940-3946PubMed Google Scholar, 21Munster P.N. Srethapakdi M. Moasser M.M. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2945-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shimada Y. Ogawa T. Sato A. Kaneko I. Tsujita Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1995; 48: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Treatment of cancer cells with these inhibitors causes retinoblastoma protein (RB)-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest associated with a down-regulation of D-cyclins, loss of D-cyclin-associated kinase activity, and hypophosphorylation of the RB protein (20Srethapakdi M. Liu F. Tavorath R. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3940-3946PubMed Google Scholar). The RB dependence of the G1 arrest suggests that the effects of ansamycins on G1 progression are mediated by inhibition of pathways that selectively affect RB. RB is the only known target of the cyclin D·cdk4 complex. Ansamycins cause a rapid down-regulation of D-cyclin-dependent protein kinase by inhibiting the expression of both D-cyclins and cdk4. Cdk4 associates with Hsp90 and is a direct target of these drugs (5Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In contrast, D-cyclins are not direct targets. Ansamycins cause their down-regulation by inhibiting a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase)/Akt-dependent pathway required for their expression (23Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The coordinate down-regulation by ansamycins of D-cyclin and cdk4 expression and the RB dependence of the G1 block suggest that Hsp90 selectively regulates this pathway. The mechanism whereby these drugs down-regulate the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway is complex. In a subset of tumor cells in which Akt is activated by upstream pathways dependent on the Hsp90 client protein, HER2, drug treatment leads to degradation of HER2 and a rapid loss of Akt activity (24Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp90 inhibitors reduce Akt expression as well in many cellular systems, albeit more slowly. In this article, we describe the mechanism underlying this effect. Endogenous cellular Akt is associated in a complex with Hsp90 and Cdc37. The Akt in this complex is active and stimulatable by extracellular growth factors. Association with functional Hsp90 is required for Akt stability but not for activity. Occupancy of the Hsp90 pocket by inhibitors does not alter the association of Akt with Hsp90 but does result in its destabilization. In cells exposed to drug, Akt is ubiquitinated and targeted to the proteasome, where it is degraded. The only members of the AGC kinase family that are affected by Hsp90 inhibitors are Akt and its activating kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). These findings suggest that these inhibitors selectively down-regulate Akt signaling by coordinately decreasing the expression of both of these proteins. 17-AAG (NSC 330507, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD), radicicol and PU24F-Cl (kindly provided, respectively, by Samuel Danishefsky and Gabriela Chiosis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), proteasome inhibitor I, MG-132, calpeptin, and caspase inhibitor I (Calbiochem), LY294002 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and EGF (Sigma) were dissolved in 100% Me2SO.

Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm each leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) and cleared by centrifugation. Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions were lysed in 2% SDS in 50 mm Tris and boiled for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples were separated by 7–15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted, and detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Results were quantified with the Bio-Rad Gel Doc system. Antibodies used were: Akt, P-Akt (Ser-473), S6K, P-PDK1 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); Akt, p85 (PI3k), p90 RSK, PDK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); Akt1 (D-17), Akt2 (D-17), HER2 (c-18), PKA catalytic unit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); SGK (U. S. Biological, Swampscott, MA); Akt3 (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX); PKCα, PKC δ, PKCε, and PKCγ (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); Cdc37 (Neomarker, Fremont, CA); Hsp90 (spa-35; Stressgen, Victoria, Canada); and FLAG, ubiquitin, HA (Sigma). Conjugated Akt (Cell Signaling), Cdc37 (Santa Cruz), and HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used for immunoprecipitation. For pulse-labeling experiments, 2 million cells/10-cm plate were treated with drug or vehicle for the indicated times. For the last 2 h they were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 without cysteine or methionine, and new vehicle or drug was added as well. Then the cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 500 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of vehicle or drug. For pulse-chase experiments 2 million cells/10-cm plate were incubated with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine for 12 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and normal medium, supplemented with vehicle or drug and 10 μg/ml l-methionine (Sigma), was added for the indicated times. Kinase activity was assayed using a Cell Signaling Akt kinase kit. Complexes were immunoprecipitated, washed twice with lysis buffer, and then twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of substrate (paramyosin fused to a GSK-3 cross-tide) were added, and assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the P-GSK3 reaction product was detected by immunoblotting. Paramyosin exists in two forms differing in size, and thus the reaction product appears as a doublet. Six-week-old athymic BALB/c female mice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Center) were maintained in pressurized ventilated cages. Experiments were carried out under an IACUC-approved protocol, and institutional guidelines for the proper, humane use of animals in research were followed. Prior to tumor cell inoculation, 0.72 mg of SR 17B-estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were placed subcutaneously into the right flank. 1 × 107 MCF-7 cells were mixed at 1:1 with Matrigel (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and injected subcutaneously. Mice were randomized to treatment or control groups and treated with 17-AAG or the egg phospholipid (EPL) vehicle alone. To analyze cellular markers, mice were sacrificed, and tumor tissue was homogenized in 2% SDS lysis buffer. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated Lab-Tek chamber slides (VWR, Willard, OH). After the experiment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with a 1:1 methanol:acetone mixture. Fixed cells were washed with distilled water and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with primary antibody followed by fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with 0.5 μg/ml of bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33258). Slides were visualized using confocal microscopy. Hsp90 inhibitors cause a loss of D-cyclin expression by down-regulating a PI3 kinase/Akt-dependent pathway (23Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29864-29872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate the mechanism by which Hsp90 inhibitors down-regulate this pathway. These drugs have no effect on PI3 kinase expression or activity (24Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We tested whether Hsp90 inhibitors altered the expression of Akt protein. In a panel of over 30 primary, immortalized, and cancer cell lines, geldanamycin, 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), and radicicol caused a decline in the level of Akt protein between 6 and 24 h after drug treatment (Fig. 1, A and D, and data not shown). On average, levels of Akt were reduced by 80% at 24 h. The loss of Akt was both time- and concentration-dependent (Fig. 1, A andB). In MCF-7 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells, 10–50 nm 17-AAG was required to reduce Akt expression by 50% (Fig. 1 B, data not shown). The levels of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 declined with similar kinetics (Fig. 1 C). Synthetic small molecules designed to bind to the ATP/ADP pocket of Hsp90 have been shown to have biological properties similar to those of 17-AAG and to deplete cellular levels of HER2. Their potency in degrading HER2 varies directly and linearly with their affinity for Hsp90 (27Chiosis G. Lucas B. Shtil A. Huezo H. Rosen N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lucas B. Rosen N. Chiosis G. J. Comb. Chem. 2001; 3: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One such compound, PU24F-Cl, caused an 80% reduction of Akt protein in MCF-7 and SKBr-3 cells after 24 h (Fig.1 D, data not shown). Loss of Akt, Raf-1, and HER2 occurred at 15 μm, a drug concentration corresponding to its binding affinity for Hsp90 (data not shown). Treatment with a compound structurally similar to PU24F-Cl that does not bind the Hsp90 pocket had no effect on Akt protein levels (Fig. 1 D, data not shown) (29Chiosis G. Timaul M.N. Lucas B. Munster P.N. Zheng F.F. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rosen N. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 289-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, 17-AAG caused a parallel decline in Akt protein, phosphorylation, and kinase activity. The loss of Akt expression correlated with dephosphorylation of its endogenous substrates, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP-1) (data not shown). Inhibition of upstream activation of Akt kinase with the PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, or the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, ZD1839, did not affect the levels of total Akt protein (24Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 30Moasser M.M. Basso A. Averbuch S.D. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7184-7188PubMed Google Scholar). In murine xenograft models, the maximally tolerated dose of 17-AAG given daily for 5 days ranged from 75 to 125 mg/kg. Treatment resulted in loss of HER2 expression in the tumors and inhibition of tumor growth (24Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The effect of 17-AAG on Akt levels in xenograft tumors was determined after three daily treatments. Levels of Akt were reduced by 70% with 100 mg/kg in MCF-7 xenografts (Fig 1 E). Similar findings were observed in BT-474 xenografts (65% reduction with 100 mg/kg; data not shown). Under these conditions, there was no significant change in p85 (regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase) expression nor was any toxicity noted (Fig. 1 E, data not shown). At these doses, 17-AAG inhibits tumor growth in MCF-7 and BT-474 xenografts (data not shown). A decline in steady state level of Akt could result from changes in the rates of its synthesis or degradation. Cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine following pretreatment with 17-AAG for different times. Treatment with 17-AAG had no significant effect on the incorporation of the labeled amino acid into Akt, indicating there was no change in the rate of its synthesis (Fig.2 A). Pulse-chase experiments were performed to assess the rate of Akt degradation. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 12 h and then chased with media containing vehicle or drug. The half-life of Akt was shortened from 36 to 12 h in cells exposed to 17-AAG (Fig.2 B). 17-AAG treatment did not cause a general increase in degradation of all proteins, but rather drug exposure resulted in a selective effect on Akt (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Protein degradation is catalyzed by various means including lysosome-, proteasome-, caspase-, and calpain-dependent pathways. To determine which pathway was responsible for the accelerated degradation of Akt, selective inhibitors were employed. Weak bases, such as ammonium chloride, raise vacuolar pH and inhibit lysosomal function (31de Duve C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The peptide aldehyde protease inhibitors Proteasome Inhibitor I (Z-Ile-Glu (OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO) and MG-132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO) are reversible inhibitors of the proteasome (32Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Berg K.A. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). Z-VAD.FMK (benzyloxycarbonyl-valinyl-alaninyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone) is an irreversible inhibitor of caspases 1, 3, 4, and 7 (35Dolle R.E. Singh J. Rinker J. Hoyer D. Prasad C.V. Graybill T.L. Salvino J.M. Helaszek C.T. Miller R.E. Ator M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3863-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Calpeptin (Z-Leu-Nle-CHO) inhibits calpains, Ca2+ dependent cysteine proteases (36Tsujinaka T. Kajiwara Y. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Higuchi N. Tanaka T. Mori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the proteasome had no effect on Akt expression alone, but abrogated the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig.3 A). The loss of all three isoforms of Akt was prevented by proteasome inhibition (data not shown). In contrast, inhibitors of caspase, calpain, and lysosomal function had no effect (Fig. 3 A). In cells treated with proteasome inhibitors and 17-AAG, the Akt protein was lost from the Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction and accumulated in an Nonidet P-40 insoluble cellular fraction (Fig. 3 A). The Akt protein found in the Nonidet P-40 insoluble fraction was phosphorylated on Ser-473 (data not shown). The kinase activity of this protein could not be determined because of the requirement of SDS to solubilize the protein. The protected protein showed a faint laddering pattern typically observed for ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3 A). Loss of Akt expression in cells treated with 17-AAG was first detectable at 9 h after drug treatment. In cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor and 17-AAG, accumulation in the insoluble fraction began at the same time (Fig. 3 B). A similar effect has been reported for mutant p53 and Raf (37Whitesell L. Sutphin P., An, W.G. Schulte T. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Schulte T.W., An, W.G. Neckers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The location of the protected Akt protein was determined by immunofluorescence. In untreated SKBr-3 cells, Akt protein was activated and co-localized with HER2 at the plasma membrane (Fig.4, top row). 17-AAG treatment for 12 h led to depletion of both Akt and HER2 protein and morphological changes consistent with epithelial differentiation, including flattening of the cells (Fig. 4, second row (21Munster P.N. Srethapakdi M. Moasser M.M. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2945-2952PubMed Google Scholar)). HER2 protein is depleted following exposure to 17-AAG after 2–4 h, whereas complete Akt depletion requires 24 h (24Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The proteasome inhibitor alone had no effect on the localization of Akt or HER2 (Fig.4, third row). In cells that were treated with the combination of 17-AAG and the proteasome inhibitor, the protected Akt protein accumulated in perinuclear vesicles. The protected HER2 protein accumulated in similar structures and co-localized with Akt (Fig. 4,fourth row). The majority of proteins degraded in the proteasome are first modified by a polyubiquitin chain, which serves as a recognition signal for targeting to the proteasome (39Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor alone or in combination with 17-AAG resulted in the formation of polyubiquitinated, higher molecular weight forms of Akt (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that Hsp90 function is required for Akt stability. We found that endogenous Akt was present in a complex with Hsp90 and the co-chaperone Cdc37. Akt, Cdc37, and Hsp90 were detected in both Akt and Cdc37 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A). Cdc37 was found to be associated with all three Akt kinases (data not shown). As previously reported, Raf was also found to be associated with Cdc37 and Hsp90, whereas PKC and PKA were not (Fig. 5 A, data not shown) (40Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, cotransfection experiments with FLAG-tagged Cdc37 and HA-tagged Akt showed the association of Akt and Hsp90 required the presence of Cdc37 (Fig. 5 D). Although complexes containing endogenous Akt, Cdc37, and Hsp90 can be demonstrated, HA-Akt was found in a complex with Hsp90 only when Cdc37 was overexpressed. More than 99% of Cdc37 protein could be immunoprecipitated by Cdc37 antibody and no Cdc37 was detected in supernatants (Fig. 5 B,lane 3 versus lane 4). These immunoprecipitates contained one-third the amount of Akt as compared with the supernatant, suggesting at least 33% of total Akt was complexed to Cdc37 (Fig.5 B, lane 3 versus lane 4). A similar percentage of Raf was found in the Cdc37 complex (data not shown). Treatment with 17-AAG did not disrupt the Akt·Cdc37 complex. The complex was maintained until 24 h post-treatment when Akt protein expression is lost (Fig. 6 B). Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors also did not disrupt the complex (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates of Cdc37 contained a kinase capable of phosphorylating GSK-3 in vitro (Fig. 6 A). Inhibitors of PI3k blocked this kinase activity (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the kinase activity fell during a 24-hour exposure to 17-AAG in parallel with loss of Akt protein from the Cdc37 complex (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that the Akt protein present in the Cdc37·Hsp90 complex is catalytically active and responsible for the GSK-3 kinase in the complex. Neither Akt stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) nor inhibition by serum starvation changed the amount of Akt present in the Cdc37·Hsp90 complex (Fig. 5 C). Phosphorylation and activity of Akt were induced by EGF whether or not it was present in the Cdc37 complex (Figs. 5 C and 6). In order to compare activation of Akt kinase in the Cdc37 bound and unbound states, Cdc37 was immunoprecipitated. Then Akt was immunoprecipitated from the Cdc37-cleared supernatants. Akt kinase assays were performed on the Cdc37 immunoprecipitates and compared with assays of Akt immunoprecipitates of the supernatant. In response to EGF, kinase activity rose and fell in parallel in both the Cdc37-bound and unbound fractions (Fig. 6 C). There was no appreciable difference in specific activity and kinetics of induction and inactivation (Fig.6 C, data not shown). Akt belongs to the AGC family of protein kinases, which includes cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), p70 S6 kinase (S6K), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK). The catalytic domains of these kinases are closely related. As Cdc37 binds to the catalytic domain of kinases, we evaluated the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on other members of the AGC family. Hsp90 inhibitors did not alter the expression levels of any other member of the family except PDK1 (Fig.7, A and B, data not shown). 17-AAG and radicicol did deplete levels of PDK1 and Raf in a fashion similar to Akt (Fig. 7 B, data not shown). The degree of phosphorylation of PDK1 at serine-241, a site essential for PDK1 activity, declined in parallel with the fall in its protein expression (Fig. 7 B). Additionally, inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome, but not o"
https://openalex.org/W1998000773,"Werner syndrome is a human premature aging disorder displaying cellular defects associated with telomere maintenance including genomic instability, premature senescence, and accelerated telomere erosion. The yeast homologue of the Werner protein (WRN), Sgs1, is required for recombination-mediated lengthening of telomeres in telomerase-deficient cells. In human cells, we report that WRN co-localizes and physically interacts with the critical telomere maintenance protein TRF2. This interaction is mediated by the RecQ conserved C-terminal region of WRN. In vitro, TRF2 demonstrates high affinity for WRN and for another RecQ family member, the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM). TRF2 interaction with either WRN or BLM results in a notable stimulation of their helicase activities. Furthermore, the WRN and BLM helicases, partnered with replication protein A, actively unwind long telomeric duplex regions that are pre-bound by TRF2. These results suggest that TRF2 functions with WRN, and possibly BLM, in a common pathway at telomeric ends.

All three disorders exhibit a predisposition to cancer and increased genomic instability (4Mohaghegh P. Hickson I.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 741-746Google Scholar). WS is of particular interest in aging research, because WS patients prematurely display aging features including gray hair, cataracts, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus (type II) (5Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 286-294Google Scholar). Cells from WS patients show elevated levels of DNA deletions, translocations, and chromosomal breaks (6Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat R.J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5893-5897Google Scholar, 7Stefanini M. Scappaticci S. Lagomarsini P. Borroni G. Berardesca E. Nuzzo F.

Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Google Scholar) encodes a 167-kDa protein (WRN) that has ATPase, 3′ → 5′ helicase, and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities (11Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A.

The status of the WRN protein in the cell influences not only genome integrity but also the cellular life span. The state of telomeres in the cell is also an important determinant of cellular life span. Telomeres cap and protect chromosome ends, and the consequences of telomere dysfunction include replicative senescence, apoptosis, and/or genomic instability (reviewed in Ref. 14Campisi J. Kim S. Lim C.S. Rubio M. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1619-1637Google Scholar). Telomere dysfunction results from direct damage, defects in telomere maintenance proteins, and a progressive decline in telomere lengths that occurs with each cell division (reviewed in Ref. 15Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Google Scholar). Telomere-associated senescence can be bypassed in some cell lines by the expression of telomerase, which extends telomeres (14Campisi J. Kim S. Lim C.S. Rubio M. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1619-1637Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that proper telomere function in mammalian cells is maintained by a nucleoprotein complex, together with structural features of the telomeric DNA. Telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 regulate telomere length, and TRF2 defects induce growth arrest and telomere end fusions (16Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. De Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Google Scholar,17van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. De Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Google Scholar). The TRF proteins specifically bind to duplex telomeric DNA, but not to single stranded DNA, and aid in the formation and stabilization of telomeres in a secondary structure that sequesters and protects the telomeric end (18Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. De Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Google Scholar, 19Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. De Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the RecQ helicases may also function in pathways at telomeric ends. Accelerated rates of telomere shortening and defective repair at telomeres were observed in WS fibroblasts (20Kruk P.A. Rampino N.J. Bohr V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 258-262Google Scholar,21Schulz V.P. Zakian V.A. Ogburn C.E. McKay J. Jarzebowicz A.A. Edland S.D. Martin G.M. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 750-754Google Scholar). Altered telomere length dynamics were reported in WS B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (22Tahara H. Tokutake Y. Maeda S. Kataoka H. Watanabe T. Satoh M. Matsumoto T. Sugawara M. Ide T. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Sugimoto M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1911-1920Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of telomerase in WS fibroblasts extended the cellular life span, rescued the premature senescent phenotype (23Wyllie F.S. Jones C.J. Skinner J.W. Haughton M.F. Wallis C. Wynford-Thomas D. Faragher R.G. Kipling D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 16-17Google Scholar), and partially reversed the hypersensitivity to 4NQO (24Hisama F.M. Chen Y.H. Meyn M.S. Oshima J. Weissman S.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2372-2376Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the apparent connection between WRN and telomerase is unknown. In yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae the RecQ homolog, Sgs1, participates in a telomerase-independent pathway for telomere lengthening (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Google Scholar, 26Cohen H. Sinclair D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3174-3179Google Scholar, 27Huang P. Pryde F.E. Lester D. Maddison R.L. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Louis E.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 125-129Google Scholar). This mechanism for telomere maintenance, termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), was also detected in telomerase-negative immortalized mammalian cells (28Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Pozza L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1271-1274Google Scholar). ALT cells are characterized by long heterogeneous telomeres and distinct nuclear foci referred to as ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, which contain the PML protein telomeric DNA, recombination proteins RAD52, RAD51, RPA, and telomere-binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2 (29Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4175-4179Google Scholar). Recently, WRN was found to co-localize with these ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Google Scholar), and there is evidence for localization of the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) to these bodies, as well (30Yankiwski V. Marciniak R.A. Guarente L. Neff N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5214-5219Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether RecQ helicases participate in a telomere metabolic pathway in mammalian cells. We report here molecular evidence for the participation of human RecQ helicases, WRN and BLM, in a protein complex that functions specifically in DNA metabolic processes at telomeric ends. We observed that telomere-binding protein TRF2 physically associates with the WRN protein in vivo and directly binds to both WRN and BLM with high affinity in vitro. In addition, TRF2 stimulates the helicase activity of both WRN and BLM via physical protein interactions. We propose specific roles for the WRN and BLM helicase activities, together with TRF2, in telomeric DNA metabolism. Recombinant histidine-tagged WRN protein was purified using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system as described previously (31Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Google Scholar). Recombinant histidine-tagged BLM was overexpressed inS. cerevisiae and purified as described previously (32Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Google Scholar). Recombinant human TRF2 protein, containing an N-terminal histidine tag, was purified using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The baculovirus construct for TRF2 expression was generously provided by Dr. Titia de Lange (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). TRF2 protein was purified from expression cultures using a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column charged with Ni2+ ions (AmershamBiosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eluted TRF2 protein was dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mmHepes pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (33Zhong Z. Shiue L. Kaplan S. De Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4834-4843Google Scholar), and the final concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay using BSA as a standard. The protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The identity of TRF2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-TRF2 (sc-8528; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). HeLa nuclear extracts, prepared as described previously (34Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar), were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Extracts (400 μl each) were incubated with either 5 μg of rabbit anti-TRF2 (H-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μg of rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a negative control, overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (40 μl) was added to each sample, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged and washed four times with 500 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.1), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer for 5 min and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using goat anti-TRF2 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-WRN (1:250; Transduction Laboratories) antibodies followed by ECL-Plus detection (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa and U-2 OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum on coverslips. The cells were transfected with the pEGFPC3-WRN expression vector as described previously (35von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L. Opresko P. Zeng X. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22035-22044Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were fixed and permeabilized with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 25 °C. Following washes with PBS, the coverslips were incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 3% BSA in 1× PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-TRF2 antibodies (1:250 dilution; Imgenex) for 4 h at 25 °C. Following washing, coverslips were incubated with anti-mouse Texas Red (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories). After washing, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss 410) in two channels (green, 488 nm; red, 568 nm). Images were analyzed with Metamorph imaging system 4.1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The gene encoding TRF2 in the pBacPA8 vector was cloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of vector pRSETA (Invitrogen). This plasmid was used to generate [35S]methionine-labeled TRF2 protein by in vitro transcription and translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pull down assays with various GST-tagged WRN protein fragments with either HeLa NE or 35S-TRF2 were performed essentially as described previously (34Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar, 35von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L. Opresko P. Zeng X. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22035-22044Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-WRN fragments were bound to glutathione beads and then incubated with either HeLa NE (400 μl) or 35S-TRF2. After washing, total protein was eluted in sample buffer by boiling and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Equal loading of the WRN fragments was verified by either Amido Black or Coomassie staining, and bound 35S-TRF2 was detected by autoradiography. Bound TRF2 from HeLa NE were detected by Western blot with mouse monoclonal anti-TRF2 antibodies (1:250 dilution; Imgenex). ELISA was conducted as described previously (36Brosh R.M., Jr., Li, J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Google Scholar), with some modification. Wells were coated with 50 μl of purified WRN or BLM protein (diluted to 1.5 ng/μl in carbonate buffer) or with 50 μl of BSA as a background control by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed and incubated with 300 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37 °C. After blocking, various concentrations of TRF2 protein were added (50 μl) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Following washing, primary antibody (1:1000; rabbit IgG against TRF2 (H-300); Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added (50 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and secondary antibody (1:10,000; anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase; Vector Laboratories) was added (50 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and bound TRF2 was detected with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride followed by termination with 3 mH2SO4. Absorbance was read at 490 nm, and values were corrected for background in the BSA alone control. For the DNase I-treated control reactions, DNase I (Calbiochem) was included at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. To determine the dissociation constant (K d) for the WRN·TRF2 and BLM·TRF2 complexes the fraction of immobilized WRN or BLM bound by TRF2 was calculated, and the data were analyzed by Hill plot and Scatchard binding theory, as described previously (36Brosh R.M., Jr., Li, J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Google Scholar). The (TTAGGG)4 and (TTAGGG)2 forked duplexes have been described elsewhere as the 34- and 22-bp forked duplex substrates, respectively (37Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Google Scholar). Non-telomeric substrate controls contained the identical nucleotide content, but the telomeric sequence was scrambled. The 22-bp non-telomeric forked duplex constructed by annealing end-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-(T)15GAGTGTGGTGTACATGCACTAC-3′ to oligonucleotide 5′-GTAGTGCATGTACACCACACTC(T)15-3′ (Midland Certified Reagents Co., Midland, TX). The 34-bp non-telomeric forked duplex was constructed by annealing end-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-(T)15GGTGATGGTGTATTGAGTGGGATGCATGCACTTC-3′ to oligonucleotide 5′-GTAGTGCATGCATCCCACTCAATACACCATCACC(T)15-3′ (Midland Certified Reagents Co.). The (TTAGGG)13substrate was prepared by excising the fragment from a BlueScriptII-SK vector (kindly provided by Dr. Judy Campisi) followed by labeling with Klenow (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and gel purification. The WRN exonuclease substrate, duplex DNA with a recessed 3′ end, was as described previously (38Brosh J. Karmakar P. Sommers J.A. Yang Q. Wang X.W. Spillare E.A. Harris C.C. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35093-35102Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations are expressed as nm substrate. Binding reactions (20 μl) were conducted in standard reaction buffer (40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Protein and DNA substrate concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and stopped by addition of 3× dye (0.125% bromphenol blue and 40% glycerol) to a 1× final concentration. Samples were loaded on 4% polyacrylamide (29:1) gels and electrophoresed overnight at 30 V, 4 °C in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Products were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent of bound DNA substrate was quantitated using the following formula: % bound = 100 × (amount of bound DNA)/(total DNA). Background correction was carried out using control reactions that excluded the enzyme. Reactions (20 μl) were performed in standard reaction buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. The DNA substrate concentration was 0.5 nm, and protein concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. For reactions with the (TTAGGG)2 forked duplex, the proteins were pre-incubated at 25 °C for 5 min prior to addition of the DNA substrate. For reactions with the (TTAGGG)4 forked duplex, TRF2 was pre-incubated with the DNA substrate for 5 min prior to the addition of the helicase with or without RPA as indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3× stop dye (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) to a 1× final concentration, along with a 10× molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide to prevent reannealing of the unwound single stranded DNA products. Reactions containing the (TTAGGG)4 forked duplex were incubated with proteinase K (8.3 ng/μl final concentration) following termination, as described previously (37Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Google Scholar). This process disrupts TRF2 and RPA complexes with the DNA substrate and unwound product, respectively, that fail to migrate into the native gel. Products were run on 12% native polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The percent of unwound product (% displacement) was calculated as described previously (37Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Google Scholar). Reactions (10 μl) were performed under standard reaction conditions, and protein concentrations were as indicated in the figure legends. For reactions containing the (TTAGGG)4 forked duplex (0.5 nm), the substrate was pre-incubated with TRF2 prior to the addition of WRN and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. For reactions with the duplex substrate containing the 3′ recessed end, WRN was pre-incubated with TRF2 for 5 min prior to the addition of substrate (3 fmol) and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by addition of equal volume formamide stop dye (37Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Google Scholar). Heat-denatured products were run on 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and were visualized using a PhosphorImager. Based on the reported co-localization of WRN with telomere-binding proteins in ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Google Scholar), we tested for a physical association between these proteins. The C-terminal domain of WRN mediates the binding to several known WRN-interacting proteins (39Bohr V.A. Cooper M. Orren D. Machwe A. Piotrowski J. Sommers J. Karmakar P. Brosh R. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 695-702Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a pull-down assay to test for the association of a GST-WRN C-terminal fragment (amino acids 949–1432) with telomere-binding proteins in HeLa NE. TRF2 co-precipitated with the GST-WRN fragment 949–1432 but not with the GST protein control as shown by Western blot with antibodies against TRF2 and WRN (Fig.1 A). Amido Black staining of the same membrane shows that extracts were incubated with higher amounts of the GST control, relative to the GST-WRN fragment 949–1432 (Fig. 1 B), attesting to the specificity of the TRF2 interaction with GST-WRN. Comparison with the input indicates that ∼25% of the TRF2 protein was precipitated. To test for association of endogenous TRF2 and WRN in vivo we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the HeLa NE. A rabbit antibody against the N terminus of human TRF2 precipitated endogenous WRN protein (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), along with endogenous TRF2 (Fig. 1 D, lane 2). Comparison with the input (Fig. 1 C, lane 1) indicates that ∼15% of the total WRN protein was precipitated. Rabbit IgG alone failed to precipitate either TRF2 or WRN (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively; see lanes 3). Although TRF2 from HeLa NE successfully co-precipitated with a WRN C-terminal fragment (Fig.1 A), we were unable to co-precipitate TRF2 with a WRN antibody, probably because of epitope masking, or because the majority of WRN localizes to non-telomeric regions. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that a fraction of TRF2 and WRN reside in the same complexin vivo. Next we tested for WRN and TRF2 co-localization in HeLa cells. In previous studies, the limited sensitivity of the immunofluorescence assay may have prevented the detection of WRN and TRF2 co-localization in telomerase-positive cell lines, including HeLa (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Google Scholar). To increase the assay sensitivity, we transfected human cell lines with a construct to express WRN fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-WRN). As reported previously for endogenous WRN (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Google Scholar), the EGFP-WRN localized primarily to nuclear foci in the telomerase-negative ALT cell line U-2 OS (Fig. 2, A–C). The majority of these EGFP-WRN foci co-localized with endogenous TRF2 (Fig. 2 C), similar to endogenous WRN (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Google Scholar). However, in HeLa cells EGFP-WRN localized primarily to the nucleolus, consistent with previous reports for endogenous WRN (40Marciniak R.A. Lombard D.B. Bradley Johnson F. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6686-6892Google Scholar). Given that TRF2 stains outside the nucleolus, co-localization with EGFP-WRN was not observed in these cells (data not shown). However, in a minority of HeLa cells (about 20% as reported previously (35von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L. Opresko P. Zeng X. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22035-22044Google Scholar)), EGFP-WRN was either detected both in the nucleolus and in nuclear foci (Fig. 2 E) or exclusively in nuclear foci (Fig. 2 I). In these cells, ∼30–50% of the EGFP-WRN nuclear foci co-localized with distinct TRF2 foci, although the number of the EGFP-WRN foci was small (Fig. 2,G and K, white arrows). WRN has been observed to relocate into nuclear foci in response to some DNA damaging agents and during S-phase arrest (41Sakamoto S. Nishikawa K. Heo S.J. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Shimamoto A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 421-430Google Scholar, 42Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Google Scholar). Therefore, WRN and TRF2 may associate under specific cellular conditions, during which the enzymes participate in a common pathway. A series of WRN protein fragments (35von Kobbe C. Karmakar P. Dawut L. Opresko P. Zeng X. Brosh Jr., R.M. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22035-22044Google Scholar) was used to map the site(s) of protein interaction with TRF2. Recombinant protein fragments that spanned the full-length WRN protein were expressed as GST fusion proteins. The fragments were then mixed with radiolabeled TRF2 (35S-TRF2), and the bound 35S-TRF2 was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 3).35S-TRF2 did not interact with GST alone (Fig.3 B, lane 2). However, 35S-TRF2 showed weak binding to the WRN fragment 114–240 (lane 4), which contains a portion of the WRN exonuclease domain. Incubation of WRN fragments 500–946 and 949–1432 with 35S-TRF2 resulted in a moderate (lane 6) and intense (lane 7)35S-TRF2 band, respectively. These results indicated that TRF2 interacted most strongly with the WRN C terminus but also bound a fragment containing the WRN helicase and conserved RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domains. Next we determined the domain in the WRN C terminus (amino acids 949–1432) responsible for the strong interaction with 35S-TRF2. As shown in Fig. 3 C,35S-TRF2 bound to both the small RQC-containing fragment 949–1092 (lane 3) and the full-length C terminus (949–1432) (lane 5). In contrast, 35S-TRF2 showed only weak association with the WRN fragment lacking the RQC domain (1072–1432) (lane 4). These data indicate that TRF2 binds to WRN primarily via the WRN RQC domain and reveal minor sites of interaction elsewhere in the WRN C terminus and in the WRN exonuclease domain. To confirm the direct interaction between full-length WRN and TRF2 and to determine the strength of the protein association we performed binding studiesin vitro using purified recombinant proteins (Fig.4 A). Because TRF2 bound to the highly conserved RQC domain of WRN (Fig. 3), we also tested another RecQ family member, the BLM protein, for binding to TRF2. BLM encodes a 159-kDa protein with ATPase and helicase activity and shares similar substrate specificities with the WRN helicase (43Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., J.R. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To test for binding, ELISA assays were conducted by coating the wells of microtiter dishes with BSA (control), WRN, or BLM followed by incubation with TRF2 protein. Bound TRF2 was detected using an antibody against TRF2 and colorimetric analysis. The addition of TRF2 protein to wells coated with WRN and BLM resulted in an increase in the colorimetric signal, similar to the positive control (wells coated with TRF2) (Fig.4 B). This signal did not decrease in the presence of DNaseI, indicating that the observed WRN-TRF2 and BLM-TRF2 interactions were not mediated by DNA. In contrast, no signal was observed when TRF2 was added to BSA-coated wells, which attests to the specificity of the TRF2 interaction with WRN and BLM. Furthermore, the colorimetric signal increased as a function of increasing TRF2 concentration for both WRN (Fig. 4 C) and BLM (Fig. 4 D) and began to plateau at approximately equal molar TRF2 and WRN and equal molar TRF2 and BLM concentrations. To determine the strength of the WRN·TRF2 and BLM·TRF2 physical interaction, the data in Fig. 4, Cand D were analyzed by Hill plots, and the apparent dissociation constants (K d) were determined using the Scatchard binding theory as described previously (36Brosh R.M., Jr., Li, J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constants for the WRN·TRF2 and BLM·TRF2 interactions were 2.3 and 2.5 nm, respectively. These values are similar to that reported for the BLM and RPA interaction (K d = 1.3 nm) (36Brosh R.M., Jr., Li, J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Google Scholar). These analyses revealed a high affinity interaction between TRF2 and the human RecQ helicases, WRN and BLM. To test whether the TRF2 interaction with WRN and BLM modulates their activities, we prepared forked duplex molecules that mimic replication and repair intermediates at telomeric ends."

Our previous studies have focused on determining the mechanism by which Myc activates transcription using the target gene cad as an experimental model. Previously, we found that Myc activates cad transcription at a post-RNA polymerase II recruitment step and that the Myc transactivation domain interacts with a number of cdk-cyclin complexes. We now extend these studies to determine the role of these cyclin-cdk complexes in Myc-mediated transactivation. We have found that cyclin T1 binding to Myc localizes to the highly conserved Myc Box I, whereas cdk8 binding localizes to the amino-terminal 41 amino acids of the Myc transactivation domain. We showed that recruitment of cdk8 is sufficient for activation of a synthetic promoter construct. In contrast, the ability of Myc to activate transcription of thecad promoter correlates with binding of cyclin T1. Furthermore, recruitment of cyclin T1 to the cad promoter via a Gal4 fusion protein or through protein-protein interaction with the HIV-1 Tat protein can also activate cad transcription.

Interestingly, recent studies have shown a requirement for continual expression of Myc protein for tumor maintenance (8D'Cruz C.M. Gunther E.J. Boxer R.B. Hartman J.L. Sintasath L. Moody S.E.

Furthermore, another study has shown that only a transient decrease in Myc is necessary to inhibit tumor growth (9Jain M. Arvanitis C. Chu K. Dewey W. Leonhardt E. Trinh M. Sundberg C.D. Bishop J.M. Felsher D.W. Science. 2002; 297: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Such studies suggest that one way to elicit regression of a tumor containing elevated Myc protein would be to design inhibitors that block Myc function. It is generally believed that Myc-mediated neoplastic transformation is due at least in part to activation of a set of target genes. Therefore, understanding how Myc functions as a transcription factor will provide insight into how one might inhibit or reverse tumorigenesis. Myc is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHzip)1 family of transcription factors, which bind to a DNA motif called an E box, which has the consensus sequence CACGTG (10Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). To bind to an E box Myc must form a heterodimer with a protein called Max, another bHLHzip protein (11Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). A number of studies have attempted to block transactivation by Myc using various methods, including the use of antisense oligonucleotides to block Myc protein synthesis, or the use of peptides or small molecules that prevent Myc from forming heterodimers with Max (12Calabretta B. Skorski T. Anti-Cancer Drug Design. 1997; 12: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar, 13Giorello L. Clerico L. Pescarolo M.P. Vikhanskaya F. Salmona M. Colella G. Bruno S. Mancuso T. Bagnasco L. Russo P.

Although at least partially successful as monitored by examination of tumor growth and the levels of specific Myc target genes, such inhibitors may not represent the best approach. Recent studies using microarrays have suggested that Myc may activate hundreds of cellular genes, including many that are required for maintaining cellular homeostasis and basic metabolic functions (16Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 17O'Hagan R.C. Schreiber-Agus N.

A more successful approach may be to pick one or several target genes whose expression may contribute to Myc-mediated neoplasia and design an inhibitor that could specifically block Myc-mediated activation of these particular target genes. We have shown that the gene encoding the trifunctional enzyme carbamoyl-phosphate synthase/aspartate carbamoyltransferase/dihydroorotase, which catalyzes the first three rate-limiting steps of pyrimidine synthesis, is a bona fideMyc target gene. Expression of cad mRNA peaks at the G1/S phase boundary of the cell cycle, and an E box located downstream of the transcription start site of thecad gene is essential for the growth-regulated increase at the G1/S phase boundary (19Miltenberger R.J. Sukow K. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Myc binding correlates withcad expression in several differentiation and proliferation model systems (20Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48562-48571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The function of the cad protein makes thecad promoter an attractive target to use as a model system for the development of a selective Myc inhibitor, because pyrimidine synthesis is not needed for cells that are not undergoing DNA synthesis (which is true of many normal, differentiated cells in the adult) but is essential for rapidly dividing tumor cells. Having selected the cad promoter as a model system, the next step is to determine exactly which regions of the Myc transactivation domain (TAD) are important in activation of this specific promoter. A great deal of work has been previously done to determine the regions of the Myc protein that are important for its transactivation function. For example, Myc amino acids 1–143 can activate transcription when fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (23Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Contained within this amino-terminal region of Myc are two regions that are highly conserved within c-Myc proteins of many species as well as in N-Myc andl-Myc, proteins related to c-Myc in both structure and function. These two regions are called Myc Box 1 (MBI, amino acids 45–63) and Myc Box 2 (MBII, amino acids 129–143). The role of MBI and MBII in transcriptional activation by Myc is controversial. Numerous studies have suggested that deletion of MBII does not affect the ability of Myc to activate transcription (23Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In contrast, MBII has been shown to be required for the interaction of Myc with several proteins that are part of transcription complexes involved in histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling, including TRRAP, TIP48, TIP49, and BAF53 (25McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 26Wood M.A. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation have shown that, at certain Myc target promoters, changes in the levels of histone acetylation correlate with Myc binding and increased transcription, and TRRAP recruitment appears to be involved in this phenomenon (28Xu D. Popov N. Hou M. Wang Q. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Menkel A.R. Henriksson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Frank S.R. Schroeder M.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, a study examining the ability of Myc to activate transcription in yeast showed that neither MBI or MBII were required to activate transcription and that amino acids 1–41 and 66–127 were able to recruit chromatin remodeling complexes (31Flinn E.M. Wallberg A.E. Hermann S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Wright A.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent study showed that MBII is essential for activation of the tert promoter in primary cells, but not in immortalized fibroblasts, whereas MBII is dispensable for Myc-mediated activation of several other Myc target promoters (32Nikiforov M.A. Chandriani S. Park J. Kotenko I. Matheos D. Johnsson A. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 22: 5054-5063Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus the role of MBI and MBII in mediating the ability of Myc to activate a specific target gene cannot be assumed but must be determined by experimentation. We have previously shown that amino acids 1–143 of Myc are sufficient to activate the cad promoter. Although this region of Myc can recruit histone acetyltransferases, our previous results indicate that Myc does not function to alter the level of acetylated histones on the cad promoter (33Eberhardy S.E. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33798-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, we also showed that Myc 1–143 could interact with several cyclin-cdk complexes involved in transcriptional regulation. Based on our findings that Myc can recruit cyclin-cdk complexes and that the cad promoter is activated at a step subsequent to histone acetylation and RNAP II recruitment, we had hypothesized that Myc functions at the cad promoter to recruit a kinase, which phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), and stimulate release of a paused RNAP II (33Eberhardy S.E. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33798-33805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The goals of this current study are to further investigate this hypothesis by defining the regions of the Myc TAD that bind to various cyclin-cdks and to determine if these regions are important in the activation of the cad promoter. GST-Myc-(1–143) has been described previously (22Eberhardy S.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48562-48571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The plasmids GST-Myc-(1–41), GST-Myc-(1–70), GST-Myc-(36–70), GST-Myc-(1–103), and GST-Myc-(1–120) contain the amino acids of human c-Myc indicated in parentheses in the name of each plasmid. The appropriate Myc sequence was obtained by PCR amplification using the plasmid Gal4-Myc-(1–262) (a gift from C. Dang) as template with primers containing BamHI restriction sites. The sequences of the primers can be found at our website (www.mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/farnham). The PCR products were gel-purified, cut with BamHI, and ligated intoBamHI-digested pGex-4T-1. The plasmids Gal4-Myc-(36–70), Gal4-Myc-(1–70), and Gal4-Myc-(1–120) were cloned in the same manner as the GST fusions, except primers withSacI sites were used for PCR, and digested PCR products were ligated into SacI-digested pSG424 (a gift from C. Dang). The nucleotide sequence of all plasmids was verified by dideoxy sequencing. The plasmids Gal4-Myc-(1–41), Gal4-Myc-(103–143), and Gal4-Myc-(1–143) were a gift from C. Dang. The plasmids Gal4-cyclin T1 and CMV-cdk9, were a gift from L. Lania. Gal4-cdk8 was a gift from C. Hermann. SVE-cyclin C was a gift from P. Robbins. HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared from frozen cells as described previously (34Means A.L. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and was dialyzed against affinity chromatography buffer (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 m NaCl. GST fusion proteins were prepared and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and incubated with HeLa nuclear extract, the columns were washed, and the proteins were eluted as described previously (35Fry C.J. Pearson A. Malinowski E. Bartley S.M. Greenblatt J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15883-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Eluates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-cdk8 sc-1521 and anti-cyclin T1 sc-8128 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. Each binding experiment was repeated at least three times. NIH3T3 cell cultures were maintained and synchronized as previously described (20Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For cad-luciferase cotransfections, 1 × 105 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of the indicated Gal4 fusion protein expression plasmid. Calcium phosphate transfections were performed as described previously (21Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Our previous work showed that the Myc TAD can recruit several cdk and cyclin proteins in vitro (22Eberhardy S.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48562-48571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In particular, strong interaction was seen with cyclin T1 and cdk8. Cyclin T1 is a component of P-TEFb, which is composed of the proteins cdk9, a regulatory cyclin subunit (which can be cyclin T1, cyclin T2a, cyclin T2b, or cyclin K), and the 7SK small nuclear RNA, which regulates the kinase activity of cdk9 (36Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 37Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 38Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Cdk8 heterodimerizes with cyclin C. Cyclin-cdk complexes have been implicated in transcription regulation, and it was possible that either cyclin T1 and its partner cdk9 or cdk8 and its partner cyclin C were important in mediating Myc function at the cad promoter. However, our initial studies used a large domain of Myc, and therefore it was not clear if the binding of either of these proteins precisely correlated with cad transactivation. Therefore, we have now determined the minimal region of the Myc TAD that binds to cyclin T1 and cdk8. To do this, we constructed a series of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins consisting of fragments of the Myc TAD fused to GST (Fig.1). The deletions were designed around the locations of the highly conserved Myc boxes at amino acids 45–63 (MBI) and 129–143 (MBII). To examine binding to the Myc TAD, GST fusions were synthesized in Escherichia coli and immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. To ensure that the glutathione beads had equal amounts of the GST proteins on them, a fraction of the beads were boiled and loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize proteins, which showed that approximately equal amounts of protein were bound to the beads (Fig.2, top). Then, HeLa nuclear extract was passed over the beads, and, after extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to cyclin T1 and cdk8. When a Western blot of the eluted proteins was probed with an antibody to cyclin T1, we found that gradual deletion of the C terminus from the Myc TAD gradually reduced binding of cyclin T1. However, binding remained detectable until MBI was deleted (Fig. 2,bottom). Furthermore, cyclin T1 was able to bind a GST fusion containing MBI plus a few additional amino acids (GST-Myc 36–70). Thus we conclude that cyclin T1 binds at or near MBI on the Myc TAD. The gradual reduction in binding observed when increasing numbers of amino acids are deleted could be due to a second binding site for cyclin T1 in the Myc TAD. Alternatively, optimal binding of cyclin T may require that the MBI region be located in a larger amount of the Myc TAD for optimal folding and/or presentation of the binding site.Figure 2Cyclin T1 binds to amino acids 36–70, and cdk8 binds to amino acids 1–41 of Myc. Top panel, Coomassie Blue-stained gel of GST-Myc fusions loaded onto glutathione beads. Asterisks mark the band corresponding to the indicated GST fusion. Bottom panels, proteins eluted from GST-Myc chromatography columns were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were then probed with antibodies to cyclin T1 and cdk8 as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also probed a Western blot of proteins bound to the GST fusions with a cdk8 antibody. We found that, like cyclin T1, cdk8 binding gradually was reduced with deletion from the C terminus. However, unlike cyclin T1, cdk8 bound to the first 41 amino acids of the Myc TAD rather than to MBI (Fig. 2, bottom). Thus the interaction sites of cyclin T1 and cdk8 localize to different regions of the Myc TAD. Having localized sites of interaction of cyclin T1 and cdk8 on the Myc TAD, we next wished to determine if binding of these proteins correlates with the transcriptional activity of the Myc TAD on the cad promoter. To test this, we made fusions of the Myc TAD deletion constructs to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. We then cotransfected each of these constructs into NIH3T3 cells along with the cad3G4luc reporter, which contains the minimalcad promoter and three Gal4 DNA binding elements in place of the E box. The results of this experiment show that, although activity decreases as the Myc TAD is deleted from the C terminus (Fig.3 A), the Gal4-Myc 1–70 construct, which retains the ability to bind cyclin T1, also retains the ability to activate the cad promoter. However, further deletion leaving only Myc amino acids 1–41 abolishes the ability to activate the cad promoter, although the Gal4-Myc 1–41 construct does retain transactivation potential on other promoters (see below). This suggests that recruitment of cdk8 is not sufficient to activate cad. Finally, it should be noted that MBII, a major site of interaction of Myc with histone acetyltransferase complexes, does not appear to significantly influence the ability of the Myc TAD to activate cad3G4luc (compare Gal4-Myc-(1–143) to Gal4-Myc-(1–120)), a result that has been seen by others on both synthetic and natural promoters (24Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 32Nikiforov M.A. Chandriani S. Park J. Kotenko I. Matheos D. Johnsson A. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 22: 5054-5063Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because Myc amino acids 1–70, but not 1–41, could activatecad, we also investigated the ability of MBI alone to activate cad3G4luc. However, Gal4-Myc-(36–70) could not activate cad3G4luc despite its ability to bind cyclin T1 (Fig. 3 A). This could suggest that recruitment of cyclin T1 may contribute to the ability of the Myc TAD activate transcription, but that it is not sufficient. Alternatively, the failure of Gal4-Myc-(36–70) to activate the cad promoter may be due to technical reasons. Western blot analysis of the transfected Gal4 fusions showed that all of the Gal4 fusion proteins were similarly expressed in NIH3T3 cells, including Gal4-Myc-(36–70) (data not shown). However, the expression data does not rule out the possibility that the Gal4-Myc-(36–70) construct may not fold correctly in the nucleus and thus may not bind cyclin T1 efficiently. Further investigations as to whether recruitment of cyclin T1 is sufficient to activate the cad promoter are described below. We have defined several regions of the Myc TAD that are important for activation of the cad promoter. Because our goal was to identify a region of Myc that might be specifically required for activation of cad (and perhaps other select target genes) but was not required for the activation of all Myc target genes, we repeated the cotransfections using the reporter plasmid pG5TI luc in place of cad3G4luc. pG5TI luc drives luciferase expression via a synthetic promoter containing five tandem Gal4 sites placed upstream of a TATA box and an initiator element (Fig. 3 B). Cotransfection of this reporter with the various Gal4-Myc constructs revealed that the ability of these regions of the Myc TAD to activate pG5TI luc was similar to cad3G4luc, with two exceptions. First, the Gal4-Myc constructs activated the pG5TI luc reporter about 2- to 4-fold better than they did cad3G4luc. This could be due to the fact that pG5TI luc contains two more Gal4 sites than cad3G4luc. Second, Myc 1–41 is able to activate pG5TI luc, whereas it cannot activate cad3G4luc. This activation is not due to the general increase in the activity of the Gal4-Myc constructs on pG5TI luc, because when comparing the activity of Myc 1–41 to the full-length Myc TAD, Myc 1–41 has 8% of the activity of Myc 1–143 on cad3G4luc, but Myc 1–41 has 31% of the activity of Myc 1–143 on pG5TI luc. Importantly, this data suggests that recruitment of cyclin T1-cdk9 may be more critical for the activation of cad than for the activation of all Myc target genes. Our results from the experiments using portions of the Myc TAD fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain suggest that cyclin T1-cdk9 but not cyclin C-cdk8 is important for cad transcription. If this is the case, then alternative mechanisms for recruitment of cyclin T1-cdk9 to the cad promoter should also activate transcription. Because cyclins and cdks do not contain a DNA binding domain, they cannot localize to promoter regions without either interactions with or fusion to a DNA binding protein. We have now tested the effects of bringing cyclin T1-cdk9 complexes to thecad promoter using both of these methods, first by using Gal4-cyclin T1 and Gal4-cdk8 to recruit these proteins directly tocad and by using Gal4 fused to another transactivator that binds to cyclin T1-cdk9 (see below). Previous studies using Gal4-cyclin T1 and Gal4-cdk8 have shown that these constructs have the ability to activate a number of viral and cellular promoters (39Gold M.O. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Rice A.P. Herrmann C.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3771-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Majello B. Napolitano G. Giordano A. Lania L.

Licciardo P. Giordano A. Lania L. Gene. 2000; 254: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the ability of cyclin T1-cdk9 and cdk8-cyclin C to directly activate cad transcription by employing Gal4-cyclin T1 and Gal4-cdk8 fusion proteins. Previous results suggest that cotransfection of full-length cdk9 enhances the ability of Gal4-cyclin T1 to activate transcription (22Eberhardy S.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48562-48571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), so cdk9 was coexpressed with the Gal4-cyclin T1. Similarly, the cyclin partner of cdk8, cyclin C, was coexpressed along with Gal4-cdk8. We found that Gal4-cyclin T1 plus cdk9 can activate cad3G4luc to a similar level as that of Gal4-Myc-(1–143) (Fig.4 A). In contrast, we found that Gal4-cdk8 plus cyclin C were unable to activate cad. However, both cyclin-cdk complexes could activate the pG5TI luc reporter (Fig. 4 B). This specificity is similar to that seen when comparing Gal4-Myc-(1–70) (which can recruit cyclin T1) to Gal4-Myc-(1–41) (which can only recruit cdk8). Importantly, these activator bypass experiments indicate that recruitment of cyclin T1, but not cdk8, is sufficient for activation of cad, suggesting that the inability of Gal4-Myc-(36–70) to activate transcription may be a result of technical reasons. An unusual feature of the cad promoter is that the Myc binding site is naturally located downstream of the transcription start site at +65. As shown above, activation by Myc binding to this site appears to be due to recruitment of cyclin T1 and cdk9, which are components of P-TEFb. The mechanism by which Myc activates cad is very similar to the way that Tat activates transcription from the HIV-1 promoter. Tat is a protein produced by the HIV-1 virus that is required for efficient transcription of HIV (reviewed in Ref. 43Taube R. Fujinaga K. Wimmer J. Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 2000; 264: 245-253Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the absence of Tat, transcription initiates but halts after synthesis of a few nucleotides of mRNA. Tat binds to a structure on the nascent transcript called the Tat-associated region and stimulates elongation by recruiting a cellular kinase, initially called Tat-associated kinase (TAK), which phosphorylates the RNAP II CTD (44Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 19"
https://openalex.org/W2063157862,"The trace metal copper is an essential cofactor for a number of enzymes that have critical roles in biological processes, but it is highly toxic when allowed to accumulate in excess of cellular needs. Consequently, homeostatic copper metabolism is maintained by molecules involved in copper uptake, distribution, excretion, and incorporation into copper-requiring enzymes. Previously, we reported that overexpression of the human or mouse Ctr1 copper transporter stimulates copper uptake in mammalian cells, and deletion of one Ctr1 allele in mice gives rise to tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. To investigate the physiological roles for mammalian Ctr1 protein in cellular copper metabolism, we characterized wild type, Ctr1 heterozygous, and Ctr1 homozygous knock-out cells isolated from embryos obtained by the inter-cross of Ctr1 heterozygous mice. Ctr1-deficient mouse embryonic cells are viable but exhibit significant defects in copper uptake and accumulation and in copper-dependent enzyme activities. Interestingly, Ctr1-deficient cells exhibit ∼30% residual copper transport activity that is saturable, with a K m of ∼10 μm, with biochemical features distinct from that of Ctr1. These observations demonstrate that, although Ctr1 is critical for both cellular copper uptake and embryonic development, mammals possess additional biochemically distinct functional copper transport activities. The trace metal copper is an essential cofactor for a number of enzymes that have critical roles in biological processes, but it is highly toxic when allowed to accumulate in excess of cellular needs. Consequently, homeostatic copper metabolism is maintained by molecules involved in copper uptake, distribution, excretion, and incorporation into copper-requiring enzymes.

Copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes including cytochromec oxidase, copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), 1The abbreviations used are: Cu, Zn-SOD, copper, zinc superoxide dismutase; HBSS, Hepes-buffered salt solution; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: Cu, Zn-SOD, copper, zinc superoxide dismutase; HBSS, Hepes-buffered salt solution; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. tyrosinase, dopamine β-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase, and ceruloplasmin (1Linder M.C.

Consequently, copper metabolism is an important underlying component for cellular energy generation, defense against oxidative damage, pigmentation, neurotransmitter generation and maturation, and iron metabolism. However, with excess accumulation, copper generates hydroxyl radicals that damage virtually all cellular components (3Halliwell S. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar). Consistent with the essential yet toxic nature of copper, cells harbor mechanisms for homeostatic copper metabolism with respect to uptake, excretion, and distribution. The Ctr1 copper transporter was first cloned from bakers' yeast (4Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D.

Once copper is transported across the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic metallochaperones including CCS, Cox17, and Atox1 deliver copper to specific cellular targets or compartments (12–23). CCS delivers copper to Cu,Zn-SOD via direct physical interactions as a CCS-SOD heterodimer (12Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells deficient in the Ctr1 high affinity copper transporter exhibit phenotypes including respiratory deficiency, oxidative stress sensitivity, and iron deficiency that occur as a consequence of copper-dependent defects in cytochrome c oxidase, Cu,Zn-SOD, and the Fet3 multicopper ferroxidase, respectively (4Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 5Knight S.A.B. Labbé S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the bakers' yeast Ctr1 high affinity copper transport system provides copper to each of the three characterized copper chaperone pathways. Ctr1 copper transporters from a variety of eukaryotes possess similar structural features including three transmembrane domains and conserved residues required for copper transport activity (24Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Google Scholar, 25Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Google Scholar). The expression of human or mouse Ctr1 by mammalian cell transfection was shown to increase both steady state levels of copper and the rate of64Cu uptake with an apparent K m of ∼1–2 μm (26Moller L.B. Petersen C. Lund C. Horn N. Gene. 2000; 257: 13-22Google Scholar, 27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar, 28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J.

Human Ctr1-mediated 64Cu transport is an energy-independent process and is stimulated by extracellular acidic pH and high K+ concentrations (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). The strong inhibition by Ag(I) in Ctr1-mediated 64Cu uptake suggests that Ag(I), which is isoelectric to Cu(I), can be transported by human Ctr1 and that reduced monovalent copper is a preferred substrate for human Ctr1 (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, ascorbate treatment to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) also enhanced human Ctr1-mediated copper uptake (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar), and metalloreductase genes are important for high affinity copper transport in S. cerevisiae (30Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Google Scholar, 31Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Google Scholar). Although overexpression of human or mouse Ctr1 enhances copper uptake, targeted disruption of one allele of the mouse Ctr1 gene results in tissue-specific reductions in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar, 32Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Google Scholar). For example, brain and spleen copper levels in Ctr1 heterozygous mice were ∼50% that of copper levels found in wild type littermates, and cuproenzyme activities including Cu,Zn-SOD and cytochrome c oxidase were reduced by ∼20%. However, there were no significant differences in liver and kidney copper levels between wild type and Ctr1 heterozygous mice. The mechanisms underlying tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation in Ctr1 heterozygous mice are not yet clearly understood. This could reflect low levels of Ctr1 expression in the brain and spleen (9Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene. 2000; 254: 87-96Google Scholar) or the presence of as yet uncharacterized tissue-specific copper uptake compensatory mechanisms. Furthermore, mice deficient for both alleles of the Ctr1 gene exhibit profound growth and developmental defects and die in utero in mid-gestation, underscoring the critical function for Ctr1 in embryonic development (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar, 32Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Google Scholar). To further investigate the roles for Ctr1 protein in cellular copper metabolism, we generated and characterized mouse cells from wild type, Ctr1 heterozygous, and Ctr1 homozygous knock out embryos obtained from the inter-cross of Ctr1 heterozygous mice. Mouse embryonic cells lacking Ctr1 exhibit significant defects in copper uptake and accumulation and in copper-dependent enzyme activities, demonstrating the important physiological functions of Ctr1 in copper uptake in mammalian cells. Interestingly, Ctr1-deficient cells express residual copper transport activity that is saturable and is characterized by a K m for copper of ∼10 μm. Unlike Ctr1-mediated copper uptake, the Ctr1-independent copper transport activity appears to be a Cu(II) transporter, as suggested by the lack of stimulated copper uptake by ascorbate and the absence of competition by silver ions. These results demonstrate that although Ctr1 is a major copper transporter that plays essential roles for copper acquisition and for mouse development, an alternative copper transporter system identified in Ctr1-deficient cells is sufficient for copper acquisition, which is required for proliferation of mouse embryonic cells in vitro. Embryos generated from the inter-cross of Ctr1 gene heterozygous knock-out mice were dissected out of decidua between E7 and E8 embryonic days with the removal of all maternal tissues. Total embryonic tissue was treated with 0.05% trypsin at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were cultured on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. To facilitate mitochondrial function under potentially low intracellular copper concentrations, uridine (50 mg/liter) and pyruvate (110 mg/liter) were added to the culture medium (33King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Google Scholar). After 2–4 weeks cells were cultured without mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells, and the pSV3 plasmid carrying SV40 large T antigen gene (34Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341Google Scholar) and the pTK-hygromycin plasmid (Invitrogen) were co-transfected into the cells for immortalization using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reagent. Hygromycin (100 μg/ml) was used for the selection of transfected cells, and surviving cell clones were isolated and expanded. Ctr1 genotyping in embryonic cell lines was carried out by Southern blotting as described previously (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar). Mouse Ctr1 expression in mouse embryonic cells of distinct Ctr1 genotypes was detected by RNA blotting with the mouse Ctr1-specific probe as described previously (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar). Radioactive copper (64Cu) was purchased from the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University (Saint Louis, MO). 64Cu uptake was measured with a slight modification of methods described previously (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). Briefly, Hepes-buffered salt solution (HBSS) (pH 7.5) containing 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes was used for64Cu uptake assays except as indicated in figure legends. A Pipes-buffered salt solution (substitution of Pipes for Hepes (pH 6.5)) and MES-buffered salt solution (substitution of MES for Hepes (pH 5.5)) were used to ascertain pH effects on 64Cu uptake. The effect of ascorbic acid on 64Cu uptake was analyzed by adding ascorbic acid to 100 μm final concentrations in uptake buffer. Competition effects of other metal ions on64Cu uptake was measured by the co-incubation of a 50-fold molar excess of test metals with 64Cu. The effects of metabolic inhibitors, extracellular pH, Na+, or K+ on 64Cu uptake were tested as described previously (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). To measure steady state cellular copper levels, 90% confluent cells were collected and wet-digested with concentrated NHO3, and copper levels were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and normalized to protein concentrations as described previously (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar). For Cu,Zn-SOD activity assays, wild type, Ctr1 heterozygous, or Ctr1 homozygous knock-out cells were harvested with or without copper supplementation (50 μm CuCl2) for 12 h. Cells were lysed by freezing and thawing in lysis buffer containing 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Supernatants were collected by centrifugation of total cell lysates at 15,000 × g for 10 min and used for enzyme assays. Cu,Zn-SOD activity was determined as described previously (35Oyanagui Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 290-296Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Protein extract was diluted into 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, fractionated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and probed with antibodies against human Cu,Zn-SOD (1:2000, StressGen). For cytochrome c oxidase assays cells were lysed in a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 250 mmsucrose, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1% Tween 80 (Sigma). Total cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and supernatants were used for enzyme assays and immunoblotting analysis. Cytochrome coxidase activity was detected with the method described previously (36Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. Taanman J.-W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Google Scholar) and 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies against cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (1:2000, Molecular probes). Anti-actin antiserum (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect actin as a loading control. For tyrosinase assays Ctr1-deficient cells were cultured overnight to 80% confluency and transiently transfected with the pcTyr human tyrosinase cDNA expression plasmid (provided by Dr. Richard Spritz) in combination with either the hCtr1-myc expression plasmid (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar) or the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Cells were cultured for 48 h in basal medium or in medium containing 30 μm CuCl2, harvested by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and sonicated in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm ascorbate, and 1 mm bathocuproine disulfonate to chelate free copper. Cell lysates (20 μg) were fractionated by non-reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and tyrosinase activity was colorimetrically determined by incubating gels for 15 min at 37 °C in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1.5 mml-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 4 mm 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (Sigma). The hCtr1-myc and tyrosinase proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and goat anti-tyrosinase antibodies (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We previously generated Ctr1-deficient mice as one approach to understand roles for Ctr1 in copper metabolism. Ctr1 heterozygous mice (Ctr1+/−) manifest tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation, and Ctr1-deficient mice (Ctr1−/−) die during mid-gestation with severe growth and developmental phenotypes (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar, 32Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Google Scholar). To further investigate the function of mammalian Ctr1 in copper metabolism at the cellular level, we isolated wild type, Ctr1 heterozygous, and Ctr1 homozygous knock-out cells from embryos between E7 and E8 embryonic days obtained from the inter-cross of Ctr1 heterozygous mice. Total embryonic tissue was trypsinized and cultured, and cells were immortalized by expression of the SV40 large T antigen. Cell clones carrying wild type (Ctr1+/+), Ctr1 heterozygous (Ctr1+/−), and Ctr1 homozygous knock-out (Ctr1−/−) alleles were identified by Southern blotting analysis, which we previously described for the genotyping of Ctr1 knock-out mice (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A with probes specific for the Ctr1 5′-region (upper panel) and 3′-region (lower panel), respectively, we detected 3.2- and 6.0-kilobase fragments from the wild type Ctr1 locus and 4.0- and 5.4-kilobase fragments, indicative of the Ctr1 knock-out allele. Furthermore, wild type, Ctr1+/−, and Ctr1−/− cells exhibit Ctr1 gene dosage-dependent Ctr1 mRNA levels, as ascertained by RNA blotting analysis with a mouse Ctr1-specific probe (Fig.1 B). Therefore, the characterization of cells carrying Ctr1 wild type and heterozygous and homozygous deletion alleles and loss of Ctr1 mRNA clearly demonstrate that we could isolate viable Ctr1-deficient cells. However, the precise lineage of these cells and whether it is common for all cell types is currently unknown. We initially supplemented high concentrations of copper (50 μm) in culture medium with the expectation of copper uptake through alternative mechanisms by which Ctr1-deficient cells may acquire copper required for cell growth. However, even without copper supplementation we did not observe significant growth defects in the Ctr1-deficient cells compared with wild type cells isolated from littermate embryos (data not shown). These results demonstrate that, although Ctr1-mediated copper uptake is critical for embryonic development, Ctr1 is dispensable for cell viability at least for specific cells proliferating under these culture conditions. Previous studies demonstrated that Ctr1 overexpression in mammalian or insect cell lines stimulates copper uptake (26Moller L.B. Petersen C. Lund C. Horn N. Gene. 2000; 257: 13-22Google Scholar, 27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar, 28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar, 29Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Google Scholar) and that Ctr1+/− mice manifest tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation (28Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Google Scholar, 32Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Google Scholar). These results suggest that Ctr1 is an important component for mammalian copper acquisition. Therefore, we examined whether Ctr1-deficient cells exhibit defects in the rate of64Cu uptake or in steady state cellular copper levels. The initial rate of copper uptake was measured in wild type (Ctr1+/+), Ctr1 heterozygous (Ctr1+/−), and Ctr1-deficient (Ctr1−/−) cells by incubation of cells in HBSS with 2 μm64Cu for 5 min, conditions under which copper uptake by Ctr1 is linear (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the rate of 64Cu uptake in these cells was Ctr1 dosage-dependent, with Ctr1+/− cells exhibiting64Cu uptake rates between that observed for wild type and Ctr1−/− cells. Consistent with the changes observed for copper uptake rate, cellular copper accumulation, measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, was also significantly decreased and displayed a Ctr1 gene dosage-dependent profile (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that Ctr1 is a copper transporter at physiological levels, which constitutes a major component of cellular copper transport activity in these cell lines. Interestingly, Ctr1-deficient cells possess ∼30% of 64Cu transport activity that is observed in Ctr1+/+ cells, as measured by both64Cu uptake rates and total copper accumulation, suggesting the existence of a Ctr1-independent route for copper uptake. Once transported into cells copper is delivered by target-specific metallochaperones, CCS, Cox17, and Atox1, to Cu,Zn-SOD, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. and the secretory compartment, respectively (12–23). We tested whether and to what extent the Ctr1-mediated copper transport system in mouse cells provides copper to all three known copper distribution pathways by measuring cellular copper-dependent enzyme activities. As shown in Fig. 3 A Cu,Zn-SOD activity is decreased ∼50% in Ctr1−/− cells compared with wild type cells, without a significant decrease in activity in Ctr1+/− cells. Consistent with similar steady state levels of the Cu,Zn-SOD monomer in all cell lines as determined by immunoblotting (Fig.3 A), copper supplementation completely restored Cu,Zn-SOD activity levels in Ctr1−/− cells to that found in wild type cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity and steady state levels of the copper-containing subunit 1 of cytochrome c oxidase are clearly decreased in the Ctr1−/− cells and modestly though significantly decreased in the Ctr1+/− cells. Consistent with a copper deficiency in the Ctr1-deficient cells, copper supplementation in the culture medium (50 μm for 12 h) restored cytochrome coxidase enzyme activity and steady state levels of cytochromec oxidase subunit 1 (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 C, Ctr1-deficient cells display severe defects in ectopically expressed tyrosinase activity, which is corrected by either copper supplementation to the growth medium or co-expression of a functional c-Myc epitope-tagged allele of human Ctr1 (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate that an adequate supply of copper to all known intracellular copper delivery pathways is dependent on the levels of the Ctr1 copper transporter. Ctr1−/− cells exhibit severe reductions in copper transport, accumulation, and delivery to the three characterized pathways of intracellular copper routing. However, as shown in this work, Ctr1−/− cells possess significant residual64Cu transport activity. To begin to characterize this alternative cellular copper uptake pathway, we tested whether copper transport in Ctr1-deficient cells is a carrier-mediated process or a consequence of simple diffusion. 64Cu transport activity in the Ctr1−/− cells was measured both as a function of time and copper concentration. As shown in Fig.4 A, Ctr1−/− cells exhibited time-dependent 64Cu uptake that was linear for ∼10 min. Consequently, the initial rate of 64Cu uptake at 5 min was measured in a copper dose-response analysis and demonstrated that the residual copper transport activity in Ctr1−/−cells is concentration-dependent and saturable (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, this activity was significantly reduced at 4 °C (Fig.4, A and B). Analysis of these data indicates that, compared with the low micromolar (∼1 μm)K m for Ctr1-mediated copper transport, the Ctr1-independent copper transport activity shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K m for copper of ∼10 μm. These results strongly suggest that the Ctr1-independent copper transport activity is a carrier-mediated and thermal energy-requiring process that has relatively low affinity compared with Ctr1-mediated copper transport. We previously demonstrated that Ctr1-mediated copper transport is highly specific for copper, since of the several metals tested, only copper or silver could effectively compete for64Cu uptake (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined whether the Ctr1-independent copper transport activity is specific for transporting copper rather than other metals under our standard 64Cu transport conditions. A 50-fold molar excess of copper or other metal including zinc, silver, iron, manganese, or cadmium was individually added to 64Cu uptake medium to test for competition by these metals in 64Cu transport. As shown in Fig.5 A, co-incubation with a 50-fold molar excess of nonradioactive copper inhibited ∼90% of64Cu uptake. Among other metals tested, zinc inhibited ∼70% of 64Cu transport, and iron, manganese, or cadmium inhibited ∼25% 64Cu transport. This trend of competition by copper and other metals in 64Cu uptake by Ctr1-deficient cells is similar to that of human Ctr1-mediated copper transport (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar), the human counterpart of mouse Ctr1. However, in contrast to Ctr1-mediated 64Cu uptake, silver did not detectably inhibit 64Cu transport by the Ctr1-independent activity. Furthermore, to test whether there might be differences in the metal specificity profile between human and mouse Ctr1, we confirmed the competitive effect of silver on mouse Ctr1-mediated copper transport by expressing mouse Ctr1 in Hek293 cells (Fig. 5 B). Because of the electronic similarity between silver and reduced copper (Cu(I)), these and other previous observations suggest that Ctr1 transports Cu(I). However, these studies and data shown below suggest that the Ctr1-independent activity may transport another form of copper, perhaps Cu(II). We further tested several biochemical features of the copper transport activity in Ctr1−/− cells to compare it with known features of Ctr1-mediated copper transport. The primary sequences of the Ctr1 family of copper transporters do not possess recognizable ATP-binding domains (2Peña M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Google Scholar, 24Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Google Scholar). Moreover, Ctr1-mediated 64Cu uptake was not inhibited in cells depleted of ATP (27Lee J. Peña M.M.O. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 33244-33251Google Scholar), suggesting that this process is not ATP-dependent. We tested the effects of the metabolic inhibitors an"
https://openalex.org/W2094323432,"The androgen receptor (AR) has been shown to be modified by SUMO-1, a ubiquitin-like protein. Recently we showed that PIAS family proteins function as SUMO-E3 ligases. Here we provide evidence that PIAS1 and PIASxalpha act as specific SUMO-E3 ligases for the AR. PIAS1 and PIASxalpha but not PIAS3 or PIASxbeta enhanced the sumoylation of AR in intact cells and in vitro. PIAS1 and PIASxalpha bound Ubc9, the E2 enzyme for SUMO-1, in a RING finger-like domain-dependent manner. Consistent with previous studies (Kahyo, T., Nishida, T., and Yasuda, H. (2001) Mol. Cell 8, 713-718), the RING finger-like domain of the SUMO-E3 was required for ligase activity. The binding of a ligand, e.g. testosterone, to the AR was required for the sumoylation of AR in intact cells. Although AR-dependent transcription was enhanced by PIAS proteins without sumoylation of the receptor, PIAS1 and PIASxalpha repressed AR-dependent transcription in a manner dependent on the ectopic expression of SUMO-1 and their RING finger-like domain. Furthermore, the sumoylation sites of the AR were necessary for the full repressive effect on AR-dependent transactivation, indicating that the sumoylation of AR was crucial for the repression of transactivation of the AR. Thus, PIAS1 and PIASxalpha modulate the AR-dependent transactivation, which, at least in part, can be attributed to their SUMO-E3 activity toward AR."
https://openalex.org/W2024695156,"Aquaporins (AQP) were originally regarded as plasma membrane channels that are freely permeated by water or small uncharged solutes but not by ions. Unlike other aquaporins, AQP6 overexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes was previously found to exhibit Hg2+ or pH-activated ion conductance. AQP6 could not be analyzed electrophysiologically in mammalian cells, however, because the protein is restricted to intracellular vesicles. Here we report that addition of a green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag to the N terminus of rat AQP6 (GFP-AQP6) redirects the protein to the plasma membranes of transfected mammalian cells. This permitted measurement of rapid, reversible, pH-induced anion currents by GFP-AQP6 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells.

Site-directed mutation of a pore-lining threonine to isoleucine at position 63 at the midpoint of the channel reduced NO3−/Cl− selectivity. Moreover, no anomalous mole-fraction behavior was observed with NO3−/Cl− mixtures, suggesting a single ion-binding pore in each subunit. Our studies indicate that AQP6 exhibits a new form of anion permeation with marked specificity for nitrate conferred by a specific pore-lining residue, observations that imply that the primary role of AQP6 may be in cellular regulation rather than simple fluid transport.

Most characterized mammalian aquaporins are localized to plasma membranes where they mediate the cellular entry or release of water (aquaporins) or glycerol and small neutral solutes (aquaglyceroporins) (1Agre P. King L.S. Yasui M. Guggino W.B. Ottersen O.P. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. Nielsen S. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Aquaporin-6 (AQP6)1 is unlike other members of the aquaporin family in terms of distribution and function. AQP6 resides exclusively in the membranes of intracellular vesicles of acid-secreting intercalated cells in renal collecting duct where it colocalizes with H+-ATPase (2Yasui M. Kwon T.H.

Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). AQP6 expression is increased in rat models of chronic alkalosis or lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but the cellular distribution of AQP6 is not altered (4Promeneur D. Kwon T.H. Yasui M. Kim G.H. Frokiaer J. Knepper M.A. Agre P. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1014-F1026Google Scholar). Restriction of AQP6 to intracellular vesicles may be critical for its physiological function. It is widely believed that most aquaporins are virtually impermeable to ions (5Agre P. Lee M.D. Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have revealed high resolution atomic structures of aquaporins (6Murata K.

Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The atomic structure of AQP1 provided insight into the lack of ion permeability, a feature that is essential for answering the longstanding question of how membranes can be freely permeated by water but impermeable to protonated water, H3O+ (6Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations based on the atomic structures have shown ultra high speed movement of water molecules through the aqueous pore in each subunit of the aquaporin tetramer (9de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 10Tajkhorshid E. Nollert P. Jensen M.O. Miercke L.J. O'Connell J. Stroud R.M. Schulten K. Science. 2002; 296: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that a highly conserved, pore-lining arginine forms a proton-repelling selectivity filter at a critical narrowing in the channel. It was also demonstrated that reorientation of the dipole is needed for simultaneous hydrogen bonding of an isolated water molecule to two perfectly conserved pore-lining asparagines in the signature motifs Asn-Pro-Ala, thereby creating a block in the center of the membrane to the movement of protons along the single file column of water (11Kozono D. Yasui M. King L.S. Agre P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Unlike other aquaporins, AQP6 was found to be permeated by anions in response to acidic pH or Hg2+ activation (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Moreover, Hg2+-activated ion conductance has been verified by single-channel recordings of oocytes expressing AQP6 (12Hazama A. Kozono D. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Yasui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29224-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The number of Hg2+-binding sites and the kinetics of Hg2+activation of the channel indicate that each subunit of the AQP6 tetramer has an individual ion-conducting pore (12Hazama A. Kozono D. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Yasui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29224-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been suggested that a single ion-conducting pathway resides at the 4-fold axis in the center of the homotetramer in the Escherichia coli aquaglyceroporin, GlpF (7Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). A putative channel at the 4-fold axis may explain the rare and aberrant membrane currents sometimes observed with AQP1 (13Anthony T.L. Brooks H.L. Boassa D. Leonov S. Yanochko G.M. Regan J.W. Yool A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still uncertain how ions pass though AQP6. In this study we sought to investigate the activation and anion selectivity of AQP6 expressed in cultured mammalian renal cells. Our previous studies were restricted to expression in X. laevisoocytes (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Hazama A. Kozono D. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Yasui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29224-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), because AQP6 was retained in intracellular membranes when expressed in cultured mammalian cells. Here we found that tagging the N terminus of AQP6 with GFP redirected its expression to the plasma membrane of cultured mammalian cells where the protein was amenable to electrophysiological analysis. These studies revealed unique selectivity for the nitrate anion, even without activation by acidic pH or Hg2+. Nitrate selectivity was in part determined by a single residue of the aquaporin aqueous pore, threonine 63. Also, anomalous mole-fraction behavior was not observed with NO3−/Cl− mixtures, indicating the presence of a single anion-binding site in each pore. Taken together, we propose that AQP6 may function as an intracellular vesicle nitrate channel and provide a model that explains how nitrate ions may pass through AQP6, based on the atomic structures of AQP1 and the ClC chloride channel. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293; ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (1:1), penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with 2–4 μg of AQP6 plasmid DNA in a 35-mm well. Cells were plated on glass coverslips 1 day post-transfection and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde the next day. Coverslips were mounted and observed under an LSM 410 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Conventional tight seal whole cell recordings were performed at room temperature on HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips 2 to 3 days post-transfection. Transfected cells expressing GFP were identified under a fluorescent microscope (TE200; Nikon). Cells were perfused with an extracellular solution (ES) containing the following (in mm): 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 40 sucrose, 0.1 niflumic acid, 0.1 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris). Sucrose, niflumic acid, and DIDS were used to prevent the activation of endogeneous currents. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 150 CsCl, 0.2 EGTA, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris). Acid solutions (pH 4–6.1) were made by substituting 10 mm MES for Hepes in ES without niflumic acid and DIDS and were puff-applied using a nearby pipette of 30–35-μm diameter. We tested solutions below pH 4 (pH 3.7). These solutions were made by adding gluconic acid to the solution containing MES, because we have observed that acid-induced AQP6 channel is impermeable to the gluconate (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). For the ion selectivity experiments, 150 mm NaCl in ES without niflumic acid and DIDS was replaced with 150 mm NaNO3, 150 mmNaI, 150 mm NaBr, 150 mm NMDGCl, and 100 mm Na2SO4 or 100 mmCaCl2 at both pH 7.4 and pH 4. In preliminary experiments, replacement of NaCl solution with these solutions at both pH 7.4 and pH 4 induced negligible conductance changes in control GFP-expressing cells (<0.6 nS). pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments) was used to sample and analyze data. The input capacitance was estimated from the decay time course of the capacitative surge, and this value was used to normalize the current amplitude and the conductance. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained at 100 ms of each voltage step from a holding potential of 0 or −40 mV. Conductance was calculated from the slope of the I-V relationship between reversal potential and reversal potential +40 mV. Junction potential correction was performed as described previously (15Ikeda M. Iyori M. Yoshitomi K. Hayashi M. Imai M. Saruta T. Kurokawa K. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the reversal potentials, the relative ion permeability for monovalent ions was calculated according to the modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, and that for divalent ions was calculating according to the equation of Fatt and Ginsborg (16Fatt P. Ginsborg B.L. J. Physiol. 1958; 142: 516-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The specific activation of AQP6 by low pH was characterized by fitting (by least squares) a Hill equation to the relationship between the corrected conductance (G = Gmeasured − Gnonspecific) and [H+]: G = Gmax/(EC50n/[H+]n + 1), where n is the Hill coefficient, EC50 is the concentration of half-activation, and Gmax is the corrected maximum conductance. Using Swiss PDB Viewer, a nitrate ion (from atomic resolution PDB coordinates 3LZT) was manually placed in the putative anion-binding site of a previously generated homology model of rat aquaporin-6 (12Hazama A. Kozono D. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Yasui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29224-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in such a way to maximize favorable ligand-protein interactions (17Walsh M.A. Schneider T.R. Sieker L.C. Dauter Z. Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 522-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Key amino acid residues and structural features were visualized with VMD and Raster3D (18Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35757) Google Scholar, 19Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar). AQP6 is abundant in intracellular vesicles of acid-secreting type-A intercalated cells in renal collecting duct (2Yasui M. Kwon T.H. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). When transfected into mammalian cell lines (Chinese hamster ovary, Madin-Darby canine kidney, or HEK293), rat AQP6 is also restricted to intracellular sites with no detectable expression in the plasma membranes (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The intracellular location has prevented electrophysiological studies of AQP6 expressed in mammalian cells. To examine molecular mechanisms by which AQP6 is targeted to membrane compartments, AQP6 was tagged with GFP at either the N terminus (GFP-AQP6) or the C terminus (AQP6-GFP). HEK293 cells were then transfected with the DNA constructs, and the subcellular distribution of the expressed proteins was determined by confocal microscopy. As expected, GFP by itself is diffusely present throughout the cytosol (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, GFP-AQP6 is exclusively present in the plasma membrane (Fig.1 B), whereas AQP6-GFP resides at intracellular sites in a reticular web-like pattern (Fig. 1 C). When over-expressed in X. laevis oocytes, AQP6 is expressed in the plasma membrane where permeation by ions occurs in response to acidic pH or Hg2+ (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To further validate these findings, whole cell currents were measured in HEK293 mammalian cells transfected with GFP, GFP-AQP6 or AQP6-GFP. At pH 4, currents are rapidly and reversibly activated in cells expressing GFP-AQP6, but not in cells expressing GFP or AQP6-GFP (Fig. 2). The I-V relationship rectifies slightly in the inward direction, and the reversal potential is near 10 mV (see Fig. 2 E and Table I). These features of acid-induced currents in cells expressing GFP-AQP6 are similar to measurements of AQP6 overexpressed in X. laevis oocytes (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Moreover, when oocytes expressing GFP-AQP6 were examined, the protein behaved identically to wild-type AQP6 (data not shown).Table IReversal potentials (Erev), reversal potential shifts (ΔErev), and permeability ratios for AOP6nErev at pH 7.4Erev at pH 4ΔErev at pH 7.4ΔErev at pH 4P X/P Cl at pH 7.4P X/P Cl at pH 4mVmVmVmVNaCl60−9.9 ± 1.19.5 ± 0.7001.01.0NaNO310−63.0 ± 4.3−60.5 ± 2.6−55.7 ± 3.7−67.1 ± 2.59.8 ± 1.414.7 ± 1.7(P NO3/P Cl)(P NO3/P Cl)NaI3 (pH 7.4)−41.0 ± 14.5−33.6 ± 4.8−23.7 ± 11.4−48.6 ± 2.43.1 ± 1.47.0 ± 0.77 (pH 4)(P I/P Cl)P I/P Cl)NaBr5 (pH 7.4)−6.0 ± 1.2−4.5 ± 1.4−4.4 ± 0.7−13.4 ± 1.01.2 ± 0.031.7 ± 0.0711 (pH 4)(P Br/P Cl)(P Br/P Cl)Na2SO443.3 ± 0.934.3 ± 5.312.3 ± 4.523.0 ± 5.6NMDGCI4−7.0 ± 2.516.1 ± 1.70.3 ± 4.82.5 ± 0.6CaCl24−3.0 ± 1.77.5 ± 0.92.0 ± 1.4−6.8 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab At pH 6.1 the current responses were negligible, but marked activation of currents were observed in HEK293 cells expressing GFP-AQP6 at pH 5.6 or below (Fig. 3 A). Attempts to measure currents at pH 3.7 or below were complicated by the appearance of nonspecific leak currents in control cells expressing GFP (Fig. 3 A, open circles). Therefore, the AQP6-specific currents were calculated by subtracting the currents measured from control cells expressing GFP in solutions of corresponding pH values. After normalization to maximum currents (pH 4.1), the [H+]-response relationship was fitted to the Hill equation, resulting in an EC50 value of 6.3 μm (pH 5.2) and a Hill coefficient of 1.04 (Fig.3 B). To estimate the ion selectivity of the AQP6 channel, current responses to voltage steps were measured first in a solution containing NaCl at pH 7.4 and then in solutions containing different ions. Shifts in reversal potential in substitution experiments were used to calculate the relative permeability to various ions (Table I). AQP6 currents exhibit substantial anion permeability (see Fig.4 and Table I). In cells expressing GFP-AQP6, outward-rectifying currents were observed at pH 7.4 with a notable negative shift of the reversal potential immediately after replacement of the solution containing NaCl with NaNO3(Fig. 4, A and C). These data suggest that there is some basal channel activity of AQP6 channels at pH 7.4. At pH 4 the amplitudes of the outward currents are enhanced, with a −67-mV shift in reversal potential in a solution containing NaNO3 (Fig.4 D). The calculatedP NO3/P Cl at pH 4 is 14.7 (see Fig. 4, B and D, and see TableI), similar to the high perm selectivity to NO3− at pH 7.4 (Table I). These observations indicate that NO3− is much more permeable than Cl− both at acid pH and at neutral pH. A similar nitrate permeability was found when wild-type AQP6 is expressed in oocytes (not shown). A series of ion substitution experiments gave the following halide permeability sequence: NO3− ≫ I− ≫ Br− > Cl− (Table I). In contrast to monovalent anions, an inward-rectifying current with a positive reversal potential was observed in a solution containing Na2SO4 at pH 4 (Table I), suggesting a lower permeability of SO42− in AQP6 channels (P SO4/P Cl of 0.01 ± 0.05 at pH 4). Cation permeability was also examined. Replacing extracellular Na+ with NMDG+ did not shift the reversal potential, suggesting that the acid-induced AQP6 currents were not cation-permeable (Table I). On changing to a solution containing CaCl2 at pH 4, no potentiation of inward currents was observed, and there was even slight negative shift of reversal potential, suggesting that the channel was virtually impermeable to Ca2+ (Table I). To identify structures involved in anion-binding site for AQP6, we used site-directed mutagenesis followed by electrophysiological assessment based on the information provided by AQP1 and ClC structures. Sequence alignments of mammalian aquaporins revealed that AQP6 has several unique hydrophilic or charged residues in the pore region: Tyr-34, Thr-58, Thr-63, and Lys-72 (Fig.5 A). These residues are identical in AQP6 orthologs from rats, mice, monkeys, and humans but are not found in other known aquaporins. Cells expressing the GFP-AQP6 mutant polypeptide T58A behaved the same as cells expressing wild-type GFP-AQP6 to acidic pH and Hg2+, except the maximum current level was smaller than that in wild-type GFP-AQP6 (data not shown). GFP-AQP6 mutant polypeptide K72E did not traffic to the plasma membranes when transfected into HEK293 cells, and mutant polypeptide Y34F did not even traffic to the plasma membrane of Xenopusoocytes (data not shown). The currents in response to acidic pH are significantly greater in cells expressing the GFP-AQP6 mutant polypeptide T63I than in cells expressing wild-type GFP-AQP6, although the two cell types exhibited fairly similar responses to Hg2+ (Fig. 5 B). The response to different proton concentrations in cells expressing the GFP-AQP6 mutant polypeptide T63I gave an EC50 value of 8.8 μm (pH 5.1) and a corresponding Hill coefficient of 1.02, close to the values in cells expressing wild-type GFP-AQP6 (Fig. 5,C and D). Thus, the pH sensitivity of the T63I mutant remains unchanged, suggesting that Thr-63 is unlikely to play a role as a pH sensor but is an important site for ion permeability. Membrane currents of cells expressing the GFP-AQP6 mutant polypeptide T63I were examined using NaCl and NaNO3 solutions at pH 7.4 and 4.0. In a solution containing NaCl at pH 7.4, small currents are observed (Fig. 6 A) with a reversal potential of −4.0 ± 0.7 mV (n = 6), which is slightly more positive than that of wild-type GFP-AQP6. At pH 4, the current amplitudes are drastically enhanced (Fig.6 B) compared with pH 7.4 (Fig. 6 A), and the reversal potential was 6.9 ± 0.5 mV similar to that observed in cells expressing wild-type GFP-AQP6 (Table I). The increase in current amplitude between pH 7.4 and 4.0 is obviously greater for the mutant (Fig. 6, A and B) than that observed for wild-type (Fig. 4, A and B). In a solution containing NaNO3, outward currents measured at pH 7.4 (Fig.6 C) were higher compared with those observed with an NaCl-rich solution (Fig. 6 A), with a mean reversal potential of −44.7 ± 3.6 mV. In a solution containing NaNO3, currents measured at pH 4 (Fig. 6 D) were higher compared with those observed in a solution containing NaNO3 at pH 7.4. The mean reversal potential measured in the NaNO3-rich solution at pH 4 was −37.8 ± 1.6 mV. Summarized data are presented in Fig. 6 F, which depicts whole cell membrane conductance. The major effect of the T63I mutation is a significantly enhanced conductance in solutions containing NaCl at pH 4 compared with that of wild-type. In contrast, this mutation did not significantly alter the conductance in solutions containing NaCl at pH 7.4 or NaNO3 at pH 4 or pH 7.4, when compared with the wild-type channel (Fig. 6 F). Relative permeability ratios (P NO3/P Cl) calculated from the mean values of shifts in reversal potential are 5.2 at pH 7.4 (5.2 ± 0.7, n = 6) and 5.9 at pH 4 (Table II). Both values are lower than those of wild-type GFP-AQP6, which are 9.8 and 14.7 (Table I), respectively, suggesting a somewhat lower selectivity of the mutant channel.Table IIReversal potential shifts (ΔErev) and permeability ratios at pH 4 for T63I mutantnΔErev at pH 4P X/P Cl at pH 4mVNaNO36−44.7 ± 1.95.9 ± 0.4 (P NO3/P Cl)NaI4−40.8 ± 1.65.0 ± 0.3 (P I/P Cl)NaBr5−14.4 ± 1.11.8 ± 0.08 (P Br/P Cl) Open table in a new tab To further determine the halide permeability in the GFP-AQP6 mutant polypeptide T63I, we also measured reversal potentials in solutions containing NaI or NaBr at pH 4. Shifts in reversal potentials at pH 4 are summarized in Table II. For the mutant channel, the permeability ratio of P I/P Cl was 5.0, and that of P Br/P Cl was 1.8. Thus, T63I still has a halide permeability sequence of NO3− > I− > Br− > Cl− similar to that of wild-type, but the relatively lower permeability ratios forP NO3/P Cl andP I/P Cl again suggest that the mutant channel has a somewhat lower selectivity. If an ion channel holds one ion at a time when two permeant ions are mixed together at different concentration ratios, membrane conductance and reversal potential will change monotonically. In contrast, in multi-ion pore models, membrane conductance and reversal potential go through a minimum or maximum as a function of the concentration ratio of two permeant ionic species, a phenomenon commonly referred to as anomalous mole-fraction (20Hagiwara S. Takahashi K. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 18: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild-type GFP-AQP6 were evaluated, but membrane conductance and a shift in reversal potential changed monotonically when the concentration ratio between solutions containing NaCl and NaNO3 at pH 4 was varied (Fig. 6, G andH). Likewise, anomalous mole-fraction behavior was not observed with Cl−/Br− or with Cl−/I− mixtures (data not shown). These observations suggest that GFP-AQP6 may have a single ion-binding site. Moreover, anomalous mole-fraction behavior was not observed with NO3−/Cl− (Fig. 6, Gand H), Cl−/Br−, or Cl−/I− mixtures (data not shown) in T63I mutant, suggesting that T63I may also have a single ion-binding site similar to wild-type. The closest sequence-related homologs of mammalian AQP6 are AQP0 (lens fibers), AQP2 (collecting duct principal cells), and AQP5 (secretory glands); however AQP6 exhibits markedly different cellular properties. Whereas the other aquaporins are known to reside in the plasma membrane (AQP0 and AQP5) or traffic to the plasma membrane (AQP2), AQP6 is restricted to intracellular locations. Our studies with the GFP-AQP6 implicate the N terminus of AQP6 as a determinant of this distribution. Unlike other the aquaporins, rapid and reversible anion conductance was revealed when GFP-AQP6 is expressed in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (HEK293). In addition, surprisingly high permeation by NO3− was identified and found to require a single pore-lining threonine. Together these observations indicate that the primary biological function of AQP6 is not water transport. In contrast, we consider it likely that AQP6 may regulate an intracellular process within type-A intercalated cells of collecting duct. In our earlier immunogold electron microscopic studies, we reported that AQP6 is almost exclusively localized in intracellular vesicles containing H+-ATPase but is absent from the plasma membrane (2Yasui M. Kwon T.H. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5808-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Attempts to express AQP6 in mammalian epithelial cells by transient transfection with rat AQP6 cDNA revealed that the protein remains in intracellular sites, precluding electrophysiological analyses of AQP6 in mammalian cells. Here we found that the addition of the GFP tag to the N terminus, but not the C terminus, causes AQP6 to traffic to the plasma membrane. This suggests that not C terminus but N terminus of AQP6 is important for the restriction of AQP6 to intracellular sites. The GFP tag may interfere with the recognition of the signal in the N-terminal AQP6 by the proteins that determine AQP6 trafficking. Delineation of the specific determinants required for membrane trafficking is now being pursued with a series of deletions and point mutations at the N terminus of AQP6. Electrophysiological assessment of GFP-AQP6 in HEK293 mammalian cells demonstrated rapid and reversible activation of AQP6 by low pH. The [H+]-response relationship (pH 3.7–7.4) gave an EC50 value of 6.3 μm (pH 5.2) and a Hill coefficient of 1.04. Low pH extremes are physiologically relevant, because AQP6 colocalizes with H+-ATPase in intracellular vesicles of acid-secreting type-A intercalated cells where the pH drops to 5.0 or lower (21Glickman J. Croen K. Kelly S. Al Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Hill coefficient of 1.04 suggests that the binding of a proton to a single site fully activates the channel. The response to extracellular pH of AQP6 is similar to that of ClC-2 chloride channel, although its anion selectivity is different: Cl− = NO3− for ClC-2 (22Stroffekova K. Kupert E.Y. Malinowska D.H. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1113-C1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tewari K.P. Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C40-C50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the amino acid Glu-419 was identified in the extracellular region as the pH sensor in ClC-2 (22Stroffekova K. Kupert E.Y. Malinowska D.H. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1113-C1123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the identity of the pH sensor of AQP6 is still being sought. The explanation of why AQP6 acts as an acid-induced anion channel in type-A intercalated cells in collecting duct is beginning to emerge. AQP6 is unlike other known anion channels. First, a series of substitution experiments indicated that AQP6 has an anion permeability sequence of NO3− ≫ I− ≫ Br− > Cl− > SO42. This order resembles that of the GABA- and glycine-gated channels (19Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar). However, selectivity for nitrate by AQP6 is considerably higher than that of GABA- or glycine-gated channels:P NO3/P Cl > 9.8 (AQP6) and ∼2 (GABA- or glycine-gated channels). Moreover, our data suggest that AQP6 has a single ion-binding pore; GABA- or glycine-gated channels have been proposed to contain a multi-ion-binding pore. Second, high permeability for nitrate is observed even at pH 7.4. This implies either that the channel is already open to some extent even under basal conditions, or permeation by nitrate induces channel gating. Third, AQP6 is not inhibited by known anion channel inhibitors such as DIDS, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB), niflumic acid, and diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) (3Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the permeability sequence is identical to that of lysosomal membranes (25Klemm A.R. Pell K.L. Anderson L.M. Andrew C.L. Lloyd J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The acidic pH within the interior of lysosomes is generated and maintained by a V-type H+-ATPase, which is an electrogenic process (26Harikumar P. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10403-10410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and anion conductance is needed to maintain electroneutrality across the membranes (27Schwartz G.J. Al Awqati Q. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms may take place in intracellular vesicles where H+-ATPase and AQP6 colocalize within acid-secreting type-A intercalated cells of renal collecting duct. Note that the osmotic water permeability of AQP6-expressing oocytes was not altered by the presence of nitrate ions in the extracellular solution, suggesting that AQP6 may function as a nitrate channel rather than as a water channel. 2Masato Yasui, unpublished data. The physiological relevance of the high permeability of AQP6 by nitrate needs to be established. Intracellular nitric oxide is produced by nitric-oxide synthase in response to various stimuli and is rapidly metabolized into nitrate. In renal collecting duct, nitric oxide has been reported to inhibit H+-ATPase activity in microdissected, isolated tubules or in an in vivo ureteral obstruction model (28Tojo A. Guzman N.J. Garg L.C. Tisher C.C. Madsen K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar, 29Valles P.G. Manucha W.A. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1641-1651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nitrate has also been reported to inhibit H+-ATPase (30Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although an interaction between AQP6 and H+-ATPase activity has yet to be elucidated, AQP6 may be involved in the regulation of H+-ATPase activity in acid-secreting type-A intercalated cells. We recently generated AQP6 null mice by homologous recombination, 3Masato Yasui, unpublished data. and these animals may be useful to examine whether AQP6 is involved in regulation of H+-ATPase activity by nitric oxide signaling. Our electrophysiological measurements indicate that the pore-lining residue Thr-63 in AQP6 is required for nitrate selectivity. Our data also suggest a single ion-binding pore in each subunit with monotonic mole-fraction behavior with NO3−/Cl− mixtures. The high permeability to nitrate and the single ion-binding pore for AQP6 can be explained by structural assessment. Using the AQP1 crystal structure as a template (8Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), we recently built a three-dimensional structural model of AQP6 (12Hazama A. Kozono D. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Yasui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29224-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One of the water-binding sites for AQP1 is present at the midpoint of the pore where the N termini of short pore α-helices meet to induce a positive electric field (6Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). The AQP6 model was useful in illustrating that the same site is where nitrate binding may occur (Fig. 7). AQP6 contains hydroxyl-containing residues (Tyr-34 and Thr-63) on the channel wall opposite the two highly conserved asparagine residues (Asn-79 and Asn-193) and a nitrate ion coordinates with these four residues (Fig.7). Thr-63 is unique to AQP6, because all other aquaporins have hydrophobic residues at that site; however Drosophila Big Brain, a homolog recently reported to exhibit ion conductance (31Yanochko G.M. Yool A.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2530-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shares the residue corresponding to Tyr-34. Our attempts to substitute a phenylalanine for tyrosine in AQP6 were unsuccessful, because the mutant protein apparently failed to traffic to the plasma membrane (data not shown). The possible role of the other residues determining the nitrate specificity remains to be investigated. Although ClC chloride channels do not belong to the aquaporin gene family, a similar mechanism for anion coordination was demonstrated in ClC chloride channel (32Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 33Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 276-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Like AQP1, ClC has a symmetrical hourglass shape with a constriction in the center of the membrane and wide openings at the membrane surfaces. In ClC, a positive electric field contributed by those short pore α-helices provides the favorable electrostatic environment for chloride with two hydrophilic residues at the constriction (Ser-107 and Tyr-445). The pore of AQP1, and presumably all other aquaporins, is largely hydrophobic with water molecules spaced at four hydrophilic sites (8Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This is indeed important for ultra high speed movement of water molecules through the pore (9de Groot B.L. Grubmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 10Tajkhorshid E. Nollert P. Jensen M.O. Miercke L.J. O'Connell J. Stroud R.M. Schulten K. Science. 2002; 296: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 11Kozono D. Yasui M. King L.S. Agre P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This fundamental structure of the pore also explains the anion permeability sequence through AQP6. The mobility sequence for the ions in aqueous solution is Br−(D = 2.08 × 10−5 cm2s−1) > I− (2.04) > Cl− (2.03) > NO3−(1.90) > SO42− (1.06), whereD represents the diffusion coefficient. Thus, the highP NO3/P Cl cannot be explained for AQP6 if the pore is entirely filled with water. The predicted AQP6 structure conforms well to the nitrate ion (Fig. 7), but the actual crystal structural model for AQP6 has not yet been reported. Except a few unique amino acid residues such as Tyr-34 and Thr-63, the residues critical for water channel function are very well conserved in AQP6, suggesting that very subtle differences can lead to major differences in biophysical function. We believe that understanding structure-function relationships of AQP6 will provide fundamental and novel insights into new functions of aquaporins. We particularly hope to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the impermeability to ions observed for aquaporins in general, in contrast to the rapid transport of anions by AQP6. We thank Fong Peying for a critical reading of the manuscript."

Sporozoites invade hepatocytes and differentiate into exo-erythrocytic forms (EEFs)1 that after a few days contain several thousand merozoites. After exiting the hepatocyte, merozoites invade erythrocytes and start the blood stage cycle that causes malaria disease. Salivary gland sporozoites and EEFs are rational targets for immunoprophylaxis and drug prophylaxis because they precede the development of the pathogenic blood stages. One important limitation for drug discovery and vaccine development is the lack of candidate target molecules specifically expressed in the pre-erythrocytic stages. To date, only a few sporozoite-expressed proteins have been identified, mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining sporozoites in large quantities. Of those proteins, the sporozoite-specific coat protein CS (1Aikawa M. Yoshida N. Nussenzweig R.S. Nussenzweig V. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 2494-2495PubMed Google Scholar, 2Menard R. Sultan A.A.

Med. 1998; 4: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sporozoite biology provides a unique opportunity to identify candidate virulence factors that contribute to the successful transmission ofPlasmodium. We refer to the observations that oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites display dramatically different phenotypes. Sporozoites isolated from the mosquito salivary glands are highly infectious to the mammalian host, migrate in a typical circular gliding pattern, and can elicit strong protective immune responses (7Nussenzweig R.S. Vanderberg J.P. Most H. Orton C. Nature. 1969; 222: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Vanderberg J.P. Nussenzweig R.S. Sanabria Y. Nawrot R. Most H. Proc. Helminth. Soc.

Parasitol. 1975; 61: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, oocyst sporozoites are ∼10,000-fold less infective to the mammalian host, do not exhibit circular gliding, and fail to produce protective immunity (Fig.1). Furthermore, sporozoites that entered the salivary glands are no longer capable of reentering them, suggesting that the mature sporozoites are irreversibly programmed to invade mammalian hepatocytes and continue the life cycle (11Touray M.G. Warburg A. Laughinghouse A. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that despite the technical challenges, basic transcriptional profiling of Plasmodium sporozoites using expressed sequence tag analysis is feasible (12Kappe S.H. Gardner M.J. Brown S.M. Ross J. Matuschewski K. Ribeiro J.M. Adams J.H. Quackenbush J. Cho J. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Nussenzweig V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9895-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether analysis of transcriptional differences between noninfective and infective sporozoites provides a means to efficiently identify genes controlling infectivity to the mammalian host. Using a suppression subtractive hybridization screen (13Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), we identify a number of developmentally up-regulated genes, demonstrating for the first time differential gene expression in sporozoites. The change in transcriptional repertoire could be an important mechanism controlling sporozoite infectivity and therefore transmission success. Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were raised at 28 °C, 75% humidity under a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle and maintained on a 10% sucrose solution during adult stages. 4–5-day-old female mosquitoes were blood-fed on anesthetized young S/D rats or Syrian hamsters that had been infected with the P. berghei strain NK65. Rodents were assayed for high levels of parasitemia and the abundance of gametocyte-stage parasites capable of exflagellation. After the infective blood meal, mosquitoes were maintained at 21 °C, 80% humidity. On day 10 postfeeding, mosquitoes were dissected in RPMI 1640 medium, and isolated midguts were examined for the infection rate. Only mosquito cages having at least 70% of mosquitoes infected were kept for further analysis. Sporozoite populations were separated as described previously (9Vanderberg J.P. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Naive rodents were subjected to blood feeding of infected mosquitoes at day 18 postfeeding to maintain a continuous P. berghei cycle. We dissected four million P. berghei sporozoites each from midguts and salivary glands of infected A. stephensi mosquitoes. Salivary gland and oocyst sporozoites were purified over a DEAE-cellulose column to remove contaminating mosquito tissue. This crucial step resulted in one million highly purified parasites for each population. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from these sporozoites, from 50 uninfected salivary glands, and from whole uninfected mosquitoes using oligo(dT) columns (Invitrogen). The poly(A)+ RNA was used as a template for first-strand cDNA synthesis and one subsequent round of amplification using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech). Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed with the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech). The subtracted cDNA population was ligated into vector pCR2.1-Topo (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen). Sequencing was done at a DNA sequencing facility (Rockefeller University) by BigDye terminator cycle sequencing with the M13 reverse primer. The single-pass cDNA sequences from the subtraction libraries tended to be short and contained sequencing errors. It was possible to obtain some homology information by using the P. berghei cDNA sequences directly for BlastX searches against the GenBankTM nonredundant protein data base and the PlasmoDB automated predictions of P. falciparumproteins (PlasmoDB.org). However, more detailed information could be obtained by using the nearly complete genome sequence of the sibling species P. yoelii as a stepping stone (www.tigr.org). This enabled us to identify open reading frames (ORFs) and create predicted protein sequences for each gene. First the P. bergheicDNAs were clustered using the program Sequencher v3.1.1. The consensus sequences of clusters containing two or more P. berghei cDNA sequences were compared by BlastN to the PlasmoDB set of P. yoelii genomic contigs, and the single best matching contig was selected (>95% identity). The largest complete ORF was identified within the contig that overlapped the region matched by the cDNAs using the NCBI ORF Finder (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf). The protein translation of each ORF was then used for a BlastP search of the GenBankTM nonredundant protein data base. We verified these ORFs by also using the entire sequence of the selectedP. yoelii contigs for BlastX searches of the GenBankTM nonredundant protein data base. In every case, the ORF that overlapped the cDNA corresponded to the same region and reading frame of the contig as the best BlastX match for that contig. Functional predictions for putative UIS(up-regulated in infective sporozoites) genes were obtained by using the translated protein sequence of each ORF for hidden Markov models searches of the Pfam data base (pfam.wustl.edu/). Signal peptide predictions were done with SignalP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP), and prediction of transmembrane domains was done with Tmpred (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). For mRNA expression analysis, we generated cDNA populations from around 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNA obtained from 1 million purified P. berghei sporozoites of the respective parasite stages using the Advantage RT-PCR kit (Clontech). cDNAs were separated on 1.0% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Gene-specific probes were labeled using digoxigenin-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hybridized to the cDNA blot. For the dot blot analysis the reverse approach was employed. Representative cDNA inserts obtained from the subtraction screen were PCR amplified with the T7 and M13 reverse primers. Appr. 1 μg of each PCR insert was spotted onto a nylon membrane, denatured and hybridized to digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled cDNA populations from the respective parasite stages. For Western blot analysis, protein extracts from 50,000 sporozoites from either oocysts, hemocoel, or salivary glands were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The antibodies to P. berghei TRAP and CS have been described previously (3Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), respectively, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL;Amersham Biosciences). Two million salivary gland and two million oocyst sporozoites of P. yoelii were purified over a DEAE-cellulose column to remove contaminating mosquito tissue. This resulted in 500,000 highly purified parasites for each population. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Twenty ng of RNA for each sporozoite population was used as a template in first-strand cDNA synthesis, using the TaqMan® reverse transcriptase kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequences for oligonucleotides are as follows: (i)TRAP, 5′-CATCTGACTCAGAAGTAGAATATCCAAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TATGGGTTATCACCTGGTGATGG-3′ (antisense); (ii) CS ,5′-AGCCCAAAGAAACTTAAACGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCAAGTAATCTGTTGACTATATTTCGA-3′ (antisense); (iii) UIS1, 5′-ATTGTCAGTATGAATGATTTTTGGTTAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGTTGTCTTTTTTCACGCCG-3′ (antisense); (iv) UIS10,5′-CACCTGAAGCAGTGGTCGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAACTGAAGGATCATCTTTATCAGC-3′ (antisense); (v) UIS16, 5′-ATCCGACGAAATTCTAGCTATTGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCCTTAGGATAGATAAAAAGAGCAA-3′ (antisense); and (vi)UIS24, 5′-GCATCAAAGCCAAATTTACCAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGTTCTATTACCTTGATCGTTTGCA-3′ (antisense). Amplicon size for all oligonucleotide primer pairs was kept constant at ∼ 200 bp. PCR fragments were cloned into plasmid pCR4 (Invitrogen). Each plasmid construct was used in a 10-fold dilution series (10 copies to 106 copies, each in triplicate) to determine a standard curve. The standard curve plots the threshold value (Ct), defined as the cycle number at which reporter dye fluorescent intensity increases over background, over plasmid copy number. Absolute transcript copy number for each gene is calculated based on the external standard curve. Real-time RT-PCR amplification was done in a GeneAmp® 5700 Sequence detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the double-stranded DNA binding probe SYBR Green I® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were subjected to one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C. Real-time RT-PCR experiments were done in triplicate. Differential infectivity of salivary gland and oocyst sporozoites may result from a major difference in expression levels of cell surface ligands. We first asked whether the two characterized sporozoite-specific genes CS and TRAP are differentially expressed. In order to compare transcript abundance, we generated amplified cDNAs from poly(A)+ RNA of 1 million purified P. berghei parasites of either late blood stage schizonts, mature salivary gland sporozoites, or oocyst sporozoites, respectively. Next, we hybridized the stage-specific cDNAs with gene-specific labeled probes (Fig.2 A). No significant differences in transcript abundance for either CS orTRAP were observed between the sporozoite stages. As expected, transcripts of CS and TRAP were absent in late blood stage schizonts. To control for similar loading we reprobed the same blots with a probe for MyoA, a myosin that is expressed in all invasive Plasmodium stages (14Pinder J.C. Fowler R.E. Dluzewski A.R. Bannister L.H. Lavin F.M. Mitchell G.H. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1831-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Matuschewski K. Mota M.M. Pinder J.C. Nussenzweig V. Kappe S.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In order to independently confirm these results, we employed QRRT-PCR using total RNA of a different rodent malaria parasite, P. yoelii (Fig. 2 B). The results show that transcript levels of the CS and TRAP genes are similar in oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites, confirming the cDNA blot results. We also compared TRAP and CS protein levels during sporozoite maturation (Fig. 2 C). No dramatic differences were observed, indicating that these gene products are unlikely to determine the profound differences in the phenotype of sporozoites. To test whether differential gene expression occurs during sporozoite maturation, we wished to compare transcript profiles of infectious salivary gland sporozoites with noninfectious oocyst sporozoites. Sporozoites have to be isolated from infected mosquitoes and are highly contaminated with mosquito tissue. For our experiments, we collected 4 million P. berghei sporozoites from the two respective stages in order to obtain 1 million highly purified salivary gland sporozoites and 1 million highly purified oocyst sporozoites. RNA extraction yielded around 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNA for each population that was used as a template for cDNA amplification. For all hybridization experiments throughout this work we used the additional amplification step because several attempts to detect a signal from first-strand cDNA synthesized from 50 ng of poly(A)+ RNA failed. 2K. Matuschewski, J. Ross, S. M. Brown, K. Kaiser, V. Nussenzweig, and S. H. I. Kappe, unpublished results. Importantly, the comparison of QRRT-PCR experiments with the cDNA blot analysis forCS and TRAP (Fig. 2, A andB) indicated that amplification of cDNAs does not significantly bias gene representation and can be used to compare transcript expression levels of different parasite stages. We could therefore perform a cDNA-based screening technique, suppression subtractive hybridization, with low amounts of starting material. Suppression subtractive hybridization allows selective enrichment of differentially regulated cDNAs of high and low abundance that are present in only one population. This is achieved through a combination of hybridization and PCR amplification protocols that allow simultaneous normalization and subtraction of the cDNA populations (13Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). We enriched for up-regulated transcripts of P. bergheisalivary gland sporozoites by using the sporozoite cDNA as our tester cDNA. The driver was a mixture of cDNAs generated from oocyst sporozoites and uninfected salivary glands (to eliminate possible contaminating salivary gland transcripts). Analysis ofP. berghei cDNA sequences isolated by our subtraction screen was facilitated by the genome sequence data from P. falciparum and P. yoelii (PlasmoDB.org) as well asP. berghei genome sequence data (www.sanger.ac.uk). We sequenced 300 cDNA clones and matched their sequences to the genome sequence data bases. None of the sequenced clones was of mosquito origin. Cluster analysis revealed 32 individual genome contigs that were tagged by at least 2 sequenced cDNA clones. Notably, we did not isolate any of the genes that are expressed throughoutPlasmodium sporozoite maturation, i.e. MyoA, CS, and TRAP. To further select only those genes that are specifically up-regulated in salivary gland sporozoites, we probed dot-blots of representative cDNAs for each genome contig with labeled amplified total cDNA probes from different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle (Fig. 3). Among the 32 genes recovered, 2 genes (A2 and F4) were abundantly transcribed in all stages tested by dot-blot analysis, thereby identifying them as false positives that could serve as independent internal controls. F4 encodes the P. berghei ortholog of the large subunit of RNA polymerase I ofP. falciparum (16Fox B.A., Li, W.B. Tanaka M. Inselburg J. Bzik D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a likely constitutive protein required for rRNA synthesis throughout the Plasmodium life cycle. No function could be assigned to clone A2. The dot-blot analysis demonstrates that the remaining 30 genes are up-regulated in infective sporozoites isolated from the mosquito salivary glands (termed UIS genes). We conclude that maturation of infectivity in Plasmodium sporozoites is accompanied by dramatic changes in their transcriptional repertoire. One gene (UIS16) displayed a unique expression pattern. It is enriched both in salivary gland sporozoites and blood stage schizonts (clone E3 in Fig. 3). UIS16 encodes the P. berghei ortholog of the previously described P. falciparum MCP-1. MCP-1 is expressed in invasive merozoites and appears to be located initially at the attachment site between merozoites and erythrocytes, and then it migrates backwards around the merozoites during invasion of the red blood cells (17Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Hudson-Taylor D.E. Dolan S.A. Klotz F.W. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Koonin E.V. Miller L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Invasion proceeds by a “moving junction” between the membrane of the parasite and the membrane of the host cell. It has been proposed that MCP-1 participates in the movement of the junction along the parasite's cytoskeleton (17Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that MCP-1 has a similar function during invasion of red blood cells by merozoites and invasion of hepatocytes by salivary gland sporozoites. Remarkably, the 29 remaining UIS genes are not expressed at significant levels in the parasite blood stages (Fig.3). Schematic diagrams of the deduced proteins for each UISare presented in Fig. 4. Overall, we identified novel stage-specific genes that encode putative-regulatory proteins, such as kinases and phosphatases as well as transcriptional regulators. Other UIS gene products have predicted enzymatic activities. In addition, a number of predicted proteins display consensus amino-terminal signal peptides and/or internal hydrophobic segments that could function as transmembrane domains. The most frequently recovered gene (UIS1, 26% of all sequences) encodes a protein kinase. UIS1 contains the conserved kinase motifs but could not be classified into one specific kinase subfamily. A number of putative secreted molecules are differentially expressed in salivary gland sporozoites. For example, UIS2 (7% of all sequences) encodes a secreted molecule with a region of homology to purple acid phosphatases. In vitro, these enzymes resemble phosphomonoesterases; however, their physiological function remains to be established. In order to validate our findings, we performed independent expression experiments for selected UIS genes (Fig.5). To demonstrate that PCR amplification of transcripts had not biased representation, we compared the cDNA blot methodology with expression data generated by QRRT-PCR. A blot of amplified cDNA of oocyst sporozoites, salivary gland sporozoites, and late blood stage schizonts hybridized with a UIS1probe detected no transcripts in P. berghei oocyst sporozoites or blood stage schizonts, whereas transcripts were abundant in salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 5 A). QRRT-PCR data generated separately from P. yoelii sporozoites showed an ∼24-fold up-regulation of UIS1 transcripts in salivary gland sporozoites when compared with oocyst sporozoites (Fig.5 A), confirming differential expression of UIS1during sporozoite maturation. Transcript abundance for UIS10encoding a lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was up-regulated ∼16-fold during sporozoite maturation (Fig. 5 B). Although subtractive hybridization screens are not exhaustive, and other UIS genes may be identified in the future through additional approaches, we most likely identified a significant portion of genes that are up-regulated during sporozoite maturation. As shown in Fig. 4, UIS1 to UIS13 were recovered frequently in our screen. In good agreement with these data, we observed strong differential expression by either cDNA blot analysis or QRRT-PCR or both2 for UIS3 andUIS4, both of which encode small molecules containing potential transmembrane domains, and UIS5, which encodes a putative aminotransferase class V. To test whether up-regulation of transcript abundance is still significant for UIS genes recovered only twice in our subtraction screen, we performed QRRT-PCR experiments for two representative genes (Fig. 5 B). Transcript abundance increased ∼8-fold for UIS16/MCP1 and ∼6-fold forUIS24/HSP70–3 in salivary gland sporozoites compared with oocyst sporozoites. In this study, we identify the first candidate infectivity genes of Plasmodium sporozoites. We demonstrate that the sporozoites located in the salivary glands differ significantly in their transcriptional repertoire from sporozoites emerging from oocysts. These findings, taken together with the dramatic phenotypic differences (7Nussenzweig R.S. Vanderberg J.P. Most H. Orton C. Nature. 1969; 222: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Vanderberg J.P. Nussenzweig R.S. Sanabria Y. Nawrot R. Most H. Proc. Helminth. Soc.

Parasitol. 1975; 61: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), show that maturation of Plasmodiumsporozoite infectivity for the mammalian host follows a developmental program. We found that salivary gland sporozoites up-regulate many genes that are not expressed earlier in development. Among them are potential regulatory proteins, secretory molecules, and metabolic enzymes that probably control sporozoite virulence. Sporozoites residing in the salivary gland are programmed to invade hepatocytes and to continue the life cycle in the mammalian host. The associated phenotypical and molecular changes are probably irreversible because salivary gland sporozoites introduced into the hemocoel of mosquitoes are no longer capable of reentering the salivary glands (11Touray M.G. Warburg A. Laughinghouse A. Krettli A.U. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sporozoite transmission during the mosquito bite is one of the bottlenecks in the Plasmodium life cycle (19Ghosh A. Edwards M.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 196-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A sporozoite within the mosquito salivary gland has to reach the mammalian liver, invade a suitable hepatocyte, and commence development into an EEF. Some of the UIS genes most likely participate in these events. Support for this comes from our finding that UIS16encodes MCP-1, the only UIS protein characterized previously in invading merozoites. MCP-1/UIS16 localized to the moving junction between merozoites and host red blood cell, leading to the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole (17Klotz F.W. Hadley T.J. Aikawa M. Leech J. Howard R.J. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 36: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MCP-1 expression was tightly regulated. It was only seen in merozoites but not in earlier blood stages. It is likely that MCP-1 performs a similar function in the merozoite and the salivary gland sporozoite. The presence of MCP-1 in the subtraction screen provides support for the identification of genes that control parasite infectivity using differential gene expression profiling. The noise in our screen is remarkably low. Among 32 selected candidates, we obtained only 2 false positives (A2 and F4 in Fig. 3). We believe that mainly two factors contributed to the success: (i) the purity of the starting material as well as mixing uninfected mosquito material to the driver population, and (ii) the threshold of at least two hits. Based on the significant up-regulation of UISgenes that just met the threshold level (Fig. 5 B), we may recover additional candidate genes that are developmentally regulated among the single-hit cDNAs. Regulation of gene expression is probably the major mechanism that underlies the development of sporozoite infectivity. MCP-1 and other UIS proteins may be involved in salivary gland sporozoite invasion of target cells. Others could be important in adapting to new metabolic requirements within the infected hepatocyte. UIS10is an example of a secretory molecule that is likely to function during EEF replication. It encodes lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (20Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) is the major cholesterol esterifying activity in human plasma, and in addition it facilitates reverse cholesterol transport. The mevalonate pathway of sterol biosynthesis has not been identified in Plasmodium. Therefore, the parasite's cholesterol is most likely host-derived. ThePlasmodium EEFs have a very high demand for membrane biogenesis because they generate thousands of merozoites. Thus, UIS10 may participate in the transport of cholesterol from the hepatocyte into EEFs. UIS10 contains the signature sequence GXSXG that is conserved in the active site of lipases, as well as the loop region that confers binding of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase to the surface of lipoproteins (20Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the mobilization of cholesterol from host cell lysosomes is required for intracellular growth (21Coppens I. Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but the underlying enzymatic mechanisms that allow the parasite to utilize an exogenous supply of cholesterol have not been identified. In accordance with a function in EEF, we can detect lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase transcripts 20 h (at this time point, all invaded sporozoites have transformed into EEFs) after sporozoite invasion of cultured hepatoma cells.2 UIS14 is a member of the ornithine/methionine decarboxylase family. These enzymes participate in the initial steps in the synthesis of polyamines, molecules that are crucial for cell differentiation and proliferation in animals, plants, and bacteria (22Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). UIS14 differs substantially from theP. falciparum bifunctional ornithine,S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (ODC/AdoMetDC) (23Müller S. Da'dara A. Luersen K. Wrenger C. Das Gupta R. Madhubala R. Walter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8097-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). UIS14 is strikingly similar to the bacterial enzymes, in particular to Mycobacterium ornithine decarboxylase, but differs greatly in amino acid sequence from the eukaryotic enzymes. Earlier studies indicated that difluoromethylornithine, an enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, inhibited liver stage schizogony but had little or no effect on the erythrocytic schizogony in vivo (24Hollingdale M.R. McCann P.P. Sjoerdsma A. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 60: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Francois G. Van Looveren M. Timperman G. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1997; 91: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These observations were previously explained by the different pharmacokinetics of difluoromethylornithine in red cells and in hepatocytes. Our findings suggest instead that ornithine decarboxylase performs a vital function in the pre-erythrocytic stages (most likely during DNA replication in EEFs) and that the polyamine requirements are differentially regulated in blood stages and EEFs. UIS genes may encode key regulators themselves. For example,UIS1 encodes a novel protein kinase. Although the function of UIS1 and its product remains to be elucidated by reverse genetics and biochemical approaches, it could participate in the signaling events associated with gliding motility, hepatocyte invasion, and/or the transformation of sporozoites into EEFs. What are the signals that induce UIS transcript up-regulation? One possibility is that Plasmodiumsporozoites undergo a time-dependent endogenous developmental program. Thus, independently of external signals, sporozoites gradually increase expression of UIS, and completion of maturation coincides with their entry into the salivary glands. This hypothesis could be tested in the recently developed culture system for P. berghei oocysts (26Al-Olayan E.M. Beetsma A.L. Butcher G.A. Sinden R.E. Hurd H. Science. 2002; 295: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that leads to the production of sporozoites that are infective for mice. However, thein vitro-produced sporozoites are ∼1,000-fold less infective for rodents when compared with the levels of salivary gland sporozoite infectivity (3Sultan A.A. Thathy V. Frevert U. Robson K.J. Crisanti A. Nussenzweig V. Nussenzweig R.S. Menard R. Cell. 1997; 90: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 10Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1975; 61: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in infectivity could be associated with an outside signal that coincides with sporozoite entry of mosquito salivary glands. Recent studies suggest that Plasmodium sporozoites may indeed selectively recognize specific receptors on salivary glands (27Barreau C. Touray M. Pimenta P.F. Miller L.H. Vernick K.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Brennan J.D. Kent M. Dhar R. Fujioka H. Kumar N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 13278-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Perhaps sporozoite interactions with putative salivary gland receptors trigger the onset of a new gene expression program. Because transcription of most UIS genes is restricted to salivary gland sporozoites, they can be targeted by reverse genetics. This should reveal those gene products that perform crucial functions for the sporozoite's successful journey from the mosquito salivary gland into hepatocytes and for its subsequent development into EEFs. Functional complementation of uis-null mutants with the corresponding P. falciparum sequences will ultimately prove whether the UIS genes identified in this study are true functional orthologs of the human malaria parasite. The developmentally up-regulated genes identified in this study are important stepping stones for the dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying sporozoite maturation and, as a consequence, infectivity to the mammalian host. UIS genes can serve as a gateway for the identification of parasite genes expressed in the EEF. In fact, we have performed RT-PCR with UIS-specific oligonucleotide primers using RNA isolated from HepG2 cells 20 h after infection with P. berghei sporozoites. Of seven UIS genes tested, six are expressed in EEF at this time point.2 We thank Ivette Caro-Aguilar for expert technical assistance and Oscar Bruna-Romero for the introduction to the QRRT-PCR techniques.

To understand the apparently contradictory function of MBD2/dMTase, we studied the effects of dMTase overexpression on the activity of various in vitro methylated promoters transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. We found that forced expression of a MBD2/dMTase expression vector (His-dMTase) differentially activated two methylated reporters, pSV40-CAT (the SV40 enhancerless promoter adjacent to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene) and pGL2T+I4xTBRE (a region of the p21 promoter next to the luciferase reporter gene), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. His-dMTase increased pSV40-CAT expression by 3–10-fold after 96 h, while pGL2T+I4xTBRE expression was increased by 2–3-fold after only 48 h and did not further increase at 96 h. Gene activation was not universal because no effect was seen with the p19-ARF promoter. We then assessed whether activation might be due to demethylation within the promoter region. Using bisulfite mapping, we found that exogenous expression of His-dMTase induced demethylation at 8 of the 10 CpG sites within the SV40 promoter. The observation that His-dMTase increases the demethylase activity in the cells was also confirmed using an in vitro CpG demethylase assay with a mC32pG oligonucleotide substrate and purified Q-Sepharose fractions from HEK293 cells transfected with His-dMTase or empty pcDNA3.1His vector. We propose that a single protein possessing both repressor and demethylase functions has evolved to coordinate a program that requires suppression of some methylated genes and activation of others.

In vertebrates, 80% of cytosine residues within the dinucleotide sequence CpG are modified by methylation in a pattern that is tissue-specific and that is formed during development and maintained in somatic cells (1Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 782: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the DNA methylation pattern is maintained exclusively by DNA methyltransferase activities, but we have recently proposed that DNA demethylase activities might also participate in the process (2Bhattacharya S.K.

It is well documented that the state of activity of a gene, the chromatin structure, and DNA methylation are correlated (7Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) such that areas of the genome that are methylated are usually less expressed. One molecular mechanism that explains this relationship has recently been elucidated. Repressor complexes are recruited to methylated DNA via the binding of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs).1 These complexes contain proteins that have histone deacetylase and chromatin remodeling activities, leading to the formation of a more compact and transcriptionally inactive chromatin (8Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). The earliest discovered MBD, MeCP2, has been found to associate with the Sin3a co-repressor complex (8Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar) and can also repress transcription in a histone deacetylase-independent manner (9Yu F. Thiesen J. Stratling W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). MBD1, MBD2, and MBD3 were later discovered and were also shown to be involved in transcriptional repression (for review, see Ref. 10Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have reported that MBD2 is an enzyme (dMTase) capable of actively demethylating DNA (2Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This activity was shown bothin vitro (2Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A demethylase is expected to activate genes by removing the repressive methyl residues. The assignment of a demethylase function to a protein that was independently discovered as a recruiter of repressor complexes has triggered obvious controversy in the field (11Ng H.H. Zhang Y.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that MBD2 is a multifunctional protein and that its activity might depend on the context of the promoter with which it interacts. By examining the effects of MBD2/dMTase expression on the activity of various reporter constructs methylated in vitro and transfected into HEK293 cells, we found that MBD2/dMTase differentially activated some but not all promoters in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Using bisulfite mapping, we found that exogenous expression of MBD2/dMTase induced demethylation within the SV40 promoter, and we also confirmed the demethylase activity of MBD2/dMTase in vitro. These data support our hypothesis that the complex functional role of this protein depends on the promoter context. Enhancerless pSV40-CAT (GenBankTM accession no.

Another 12 units of Sss1 and 0.16 μmol of S-adenosylmethionine were then added, and the reaction was further incubated another 3 h. The methylated plasmid was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and complete methylation was confirmed by observing full protection from HpaII digestion. HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 7 × 104/well in a six-well dish and transiently transfected with 100 ng of reporter plasmid (methylated or mock-methylated) and 1.2 μg of one of the following plasmids: pcDNA3.1HisB vector (Invitrogen), pcDNA-His-dMTase (2Bhattacharya S.K.

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as described previously (17Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was assessed using the Promega luciferase assay system. The activity of each extract was measured in triplicate and then normalized to the protein concentration. Fold induction was calculated relative to the activity observed with the HisB vector alone. Experiments were performed several times using different cultures of HEK293 cells and different preparations of plasmids. For dose curve experiments, transfections were performed in triplicate using increasing amounts of HisB or His-dMTase vector (0.05, 0.1, 0.6,1.2, and 3 μg). Cells were then harvested after 96 h for CAT or luciferase assays. Fold induction was calculated relative to the activity observed with the HisB vector alone at each concentration. Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously (18Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The SV40 promoter sequence was amplified from 5 μg of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA using the following primers: 5′-AAGGGGGATGTGTTGTAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAAAATACCTCAAAATATTCTT-3′ (antisense). PCR products were then used as templates for subsequent nested PCRs using the primers 5′-GGTTAGTGAATTTTAGATTTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TATATCCAATAATTTTTTTCTCC-3′ (antisense). PCR products were subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and clones were then sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Whole cell extracts were prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer according to the protocol from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 50 μg of extract were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Transfected His-dMTase protein was detected either by anti-MBD2 sheep polyclonal IgG (Upstate Biotechnologies no. 07198) according to the manufacturer's protocol or by anti-Xpress mouse monoclonal IgG antibody (Invitrogen R910-25, which recognizes the Xpress epitope within the pcDNA3.1His vector) at 1:5000 followed by peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:20,000. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit was used for both (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of His-dMTase/10-cm plate (×10) or left untransfected, and nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h later as described previously (19Szyf M. Bhattacharya S.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 200: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 8.5 mg of extract (1.4 ml) was diluted to 50 mm NaCl with 10 ml of buffer L (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8) containing a 1 μg/ml concentration of each of the following protease inhibitors: Pefabloc, aprotinin, and leupeptin. 2 ml of Q-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed three times with 8 ml of buffer L + 50 mm NaCl and then pre-equilibrated for 30 min in the same buffer. Each extract (HEK or HEK + dMTase) was then subjected to 4 × 40-min bindings, each with 0.25 ml of Q-Sepharose, with rotating at 4 °C. The beads were then pooled (1 ml/sample) and washed 5 × 10 min, each with 4 ml of buffer L + 50 mm NaCl. Batch elution was then performed with 5 × 1 ml of buffer L, each containing the following concentrations of NaCl: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 m for 10 min each. The different fractions, flow through, and washes were then assayed for demethylase activity. Demethylase activity was measured using a methylated (m) C32pG oligonucleotide substrate as described previously (20Szyf M. Bhattacharya S.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 200: 155-161PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 1 μl of a mCpG oligonucleotide substrate ([α-P32]dGTP-labeled) was incubated with 30 μl of buffer L and 20 μl of each of the purification samples for 48 h at 37 °C. Samples were then subjected to a phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 8 μl of double distilled H20. 1 μl of 10× micrococcal nuclease buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2) and 1 μl of micrococcal nuclease were added followed by an overnight incubation at 37 °C. 2 μl of each sample were then resolved by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. Since MBD2b was found to act as a DNA demethylase (2Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 3Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and since promoter demethylation is associated with gene activation (21Plumb J.A. Strathdee G. Sludden J. Kaye S.B. Brown R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar), we first wanted to determine whether ectopic expression of MBD2/dMTase would lead to promoter activation. We performed various co-transfection experiments using several in vitro methylated reporter constructs. A long line of data has established that in vitro methylation can suppress genes when these genes are ectopically introduced into vertebrate cells (22Cedar H. Stein R. Gruenbaum Y. Naveh-Many T. Sciaky-Gallili N. Razin A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 605-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, both the SV40 and 4xTBRE (a 4× repeat of the transforming growth factor-β response element of the p21 promoter) reporter constructs (Fig.1 A) were inhibited considerably by in vitro methylation (Fig. 1 B). Co-transfection of His-dMTase led to activation of the SV40 promoter, but only after 96 h, while the 4xTBRE promoter was activated almost equally at both 48 and 96 h post-transfection. Similar results were obtained with TSA, which activates transcription by inhibiting histone deacetylases and which has also been found to induce DNA demethylation (3Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Sp1 was used as a positive control for activation since both the SV40 and 4xTBRE promoters are highly enriched in Sp1 sites (Fig. 1 A). The transcriptional activation seen with MBD2/dMTase is not universal since exogenous MBD2/dMTase was not able to activate the p19-ARF promoter even after 96 h (Fig. 1 C). Thus MBD2/demethylase acts differently on different CG-rich ubiquitous promoters. If the co-repressors required for suppressing methylated promoters by MBDs are saturated in HEK293 cells, then this might explain why MBD2 does not suppress methylated promoters in HEK293 cells. To exclude this possibility, we tested whether another member of the MBD family, MeCP2, could repress these methylated promoters. The results shown in Fig. 1 Dillustrate that MeCP2 represses the SV40 promoter, consistent with previous findings (9Yu F. Thiesen J. Stratling W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and thus the machinery necessary for repressing methylated genes by MBDs is active in HEK293 cells. In summary, our results show that MBD2/dMTase can differentially activate certain methylated promoters. To provide further evidence that MBD2/dMTase can act as a transcriptional activator, we transfected the methylated SV40 or 4xTBRE reporters along with different amounts of pcDNA3.1-His-dMTase. As seen in Fig.2, A and B, while we observed a general dose-dependent increase in activation of both promoters, these promoters also varied slightly in their sensitivity to the amount of transfected His-dMTase as well as in the magnitude of their response, similar to the observations presented in Fig. 1. A Western blot using an antibody against MBD2 confirms that the His-dMTase construct is expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 C) and demonstrates that the protein levels correlate with the transcriptional activation observed. These results, together with those in Fig. 1, indicate that MBD2/dMTase can function as a dose-dependent activator of gene transcription, which is both time- and promoter-dependent. One explanation for the transcriptional activation by His-dMTase is that it causes promoter demethylation. To demonstrate that the His-dMTase construct produces an active demethylase enzyme in our system, we subjected nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with His-dMTase to chromatography on Q-Sepharose to partially purify the demethylase and compared the demethylase activity with non-transfected HEK293 cells. Fractions were eluted with a step gradient of NaCl, tested for the presence of His-dMTase by a Western blot using anti-Xpress antibody, and also assayed for demethylase activity. The latter was carried out by measuring the conversion of mdCMP to dCMP within a 24-bp mC32pG double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate using thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig.3 A, His-dMTase elutes at 0.2 and 0.4 m NaCl. These fractions exhibit a significant increase in demethylase activity: 42% of the mdCMP is converted to dCMP in the 0.2 m fraction in comparison to the non-transfected controls, which display minimal demethylase activity (<5% in the 0.2 m fraction) (Fig. 3, B andC). Since demethylation within a promoter is associated with transcriptional activation (21Plumb J.A. Strathdee G. Sludden J. Kaye S.B. Brown R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar), we next wanted to determine whether this was a possible mechanism by which MBD2/dMTase overexpression led to the activation of the SV40 promoter. Following transfection of methylated SV40-CAT along with His-dMTase or empty vector as a control, we used bisulfite mapping to examine the 10 different CpG sites within the SV40 promoter (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, expression of dMTase increased the level of demethylation at 8 of the 10 CpG sites. Remarkably, most of the CpG sites remained fully or almost (<5%) fully methylated in the control clones with the exception of site 6. Since between 20 and 30 clones were sequenced from three independent experiments, it is highly unlikely that this is a random event. These results are also consistent with previous studies demonstrating that exogenous expression of MBD2/dMTase leads to increased demethylation within a promoter (3Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and that expression of MBD2/dMTase is correlated with demethylation within the promoters of c-erbB-2 andsurvivin genes (23Hattori M. Sakamoto H. Satoh K. Yamamoto T. Cancer Lett. 2001; 169: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We also assessed the CAT activity from the same transfections used for bisulfite mapping and found that, as in our previous experiments, dMTase overexpression led to transcriptional activation of the SV40 promoter (Fig. 4 C). This supports the hypothesis that the likely mechanism by which dMTase causes transcriptional activation is by demethylating the promoter and thus allowing an open chromatin configuration free of transcriptional repressor complexes. Our study provides evidence that MBD2/dMTase can act as a transcriptional activator, consistent with its role as a DNA demethylase. However, the activation observed is critically dependent on several parameters, including promoter identity and length of transfection time (Fig. 1). Our results are consistent with previous data, demonstrating that MBD2/dMTase is an active demethylase in vitro (2Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and that transfection of exogenous dMTase can lead to demethylation in living cells with a concomitant increase in gene expression (3Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The activation of methylated promoters by MBD2/dMTase is partial as is the demethylation. This suggests the presence of other factors that protect the DNA from complete demethylation and activation of transcription. Although it is accepted in recent publications that MBD2 acts as a transcriptional repressor (11Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Boeke J. Ammerpohl O. Kegel S. Moehren U. Renkawitz R. J. Biol.

Murakami-Sekimata A. Homma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42632-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the data presented here do not necessarily contradict previously published data once the experimental conditions stated in these reports are carefully considered. First, in all the studies demonstrating repression by MBD2/dMTase, transcriptional assays were performed anywhere from 24 to 48 h post-transfection. Since we do not see activation of the SV40 promoter until 96 h post-transfection, it is possible that some of the promoters in these reports could be activated by MBD2/dMTase provided that the transfection time is extended. The fact that a longer time is necessary for activation by MBD2/demethylase may be explained by previous data showing that demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA in living cells is a slow process (3Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Second, previous studies (11Ng H.H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 25Sekimata M. Takahashi A. Murakami-Sekimata A. Homma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42632-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) used the Gal4 DNA binding domain to bind MBD2/GAL4 chimeras to their promoters rather that looking at the effect of cognate MBD2 on methylated DNA as done in this study, which may also account for some of the discrepancies. Third, not all promoters are repressed by MBD2, and not all concentrations of transfected MBD2 bring about repression. For example, Boeke et al. (12Boeke J. Ammerpohl O. Kegel S. Moehren U. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34963-34967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although the TK promoter was repressed by methylation, transfection of MBD2 had no effect; and in a study by Sekimata et al. (25Sekimata M. Takahashi A. Murakami-Sekimata A. Homma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42632-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), certain concentrations of transfected Gal4-MBD2 alone did not repress their reporter construct. The data presented above are consistent with our findings that MBD2 had no effect on the p19-ARF promoter (Fig. 1 C) and that the effect on transcription we observed is dose-dependent, where the dose causing activation varies with the promoter type (Fig.2, A and B). Last, although MBD2 has been found to associate with the NuRD repressor complex (24Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar), it was not originally purified as part of this complex (26Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the NuRD complex may associate with different DNA-binding proteins, not only MBD2, depending on the physiological state of the cell (24Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that under certain cellular conditions and within certain promoters MBD2/dMTase may act as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting the NuRD complex. However, it is equally possible that in a different cell environment and within different promoters MBD2 may act independently of NuRD as a demethylase and activator. In support of the latter, expression of dMTase is correlated with demethylation within the promoter of c-erbB-2 and survivin genes (23Hattori M. Sakamoto H. Satoh K. Yamamoto T. Cancer Lett. 2001; 169: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report has demonstrated that the Drosophila homolog of MBD2, dMBD2/3, formed foci that associated with DNA at the cellular blastoderm stage, concurrent with the activation of the embryonic genome, and also associated with the active Y chromosome (27Marhold J. Zbylut M. Lankenau D.H., Li, M. Gerlich D. Ballestar E. Mechler B.M. Lyko F. Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been found to possess dual repressor and activator functions, such as E2F (28Muller H. Helin K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M1-12PubMed Google Scholar), ATF4 (29Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and the Sp family of proteins (30Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), so it is similarly feasible that MBD2 is a protein with dual functions. It is possible that both repressor and demethylase functions reside in one protein to coordinate a program of gene expression that requires suppression of some methylated genes and activation of others. Further studies will be necessary to determine what are the key factors involved in determining the role of MBD2/dMTase in transcription."

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the benefits of HDL. Among these, reverse cholesterol transport concept has been widely accepted. This notion, proposed more than 30 years ago by Glomset (1Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is defined as the process through which nascent HDL particles remove excessive free cholesterol from peripheral tissues and carry it back to the liver for catabolism. The studies on cellular cholesterol efflux pathway were highlighted by the recent breakthrough defining the genetic defects associated with Tangier disease and hypoalphalipoproteinemia (2Brooks-Wilson A.

PLTP transfers phospholipids from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to HDL during lipolysis. Moreover, it also participates the phospholipid exchanges between HDL particles (21Kieft K.A. Bocan T.M.

However, ABCA1 expression is thought to be closely related to the generation of nascent HDL through both phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to free apoAI (18Oram J.F. Expert Opin. Investig.

In mice HDL maturation or remodeling is dependent on at least two other proteins, PLTP and LCAT (20Qin S. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that a specific LXR agonist, T0901317, regulates transcriptionally PLTP in vivo. Our studies indicate, for the first time, that PLTP is a direct target gene of LXRs and plays an important role in LXR agonist-mediated HDL cholesterol and size increase in mice.RESULTSC57BL6 mice fed on a chow diet were dosed orally with various amounts of T0901317 (13Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar) once daily for 1 week. Plasma samples were prepared and subjected to lipid analysis. Total cholesterol and phospholipid were increased in a dose-dependent fashion (Table I). At the highest dose used (100 mg/kg), total cholesterol increased 257% and phospholipid 220% compared with vehicle control. Plasma samples were then subjected to FPLC lipoprotein analysis (Fig. 1). The increase in total cholesterol caused by T0901317 was due to the increase of cholesterol in HDL and LDL-like particles. The plasma fractions from mice treated with 100 mg/kg T0901317 were analyzed further for their apolipoprotein contents. Plasma fractions separated by FPLC (Fig. 1, A–D) were subjected to SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis for ApoE, ApoAI, and ApoB. The results indicated that the fractions from T0901317-treated mice contained much more ApoE and ApoAI, but not ApoB, than those from controls (Fig.2). Measurement of phospholipid levels indicated that these fractions also contained much more phospholipid than did the controls (data not shown). We concluded that the LDL-like fraction actually contained enlarged HDL particles. Moreover, the overall HDL cholesterol increase upon LXR agonist T0901317 treatment appeared to be biphasic. At 1 and 10 mg/kg, the cholesterol increase was observed largely in the fractions that were similar in size to those from the wild type. Higher doses resulted in a significant induction of enlarged HDL particles.Table ILipid analysis of C57/BL6 mice treated with vehicle or various doses of LXR agonist T0901317T0901317Vehicle1 mg/kg10 mg/kg50 mg/kg100 mg/kgTotal cholesterol (mg/dl)101 ± 23136 ± 14164 ± 33bp = 0.002 versus vehicle.245 ± 20ap < 0.001 versus vehicle.260 ± 31ap < 0.001 versus vehicle.Phosholipid (mg/dl)150 ± 14181 ± 28246 ± 28ap < 0.001 versus vehicle.291 ± 12ap < 0.001 versus vehicle.330 ± 31ap < 0.001 versus vehicle.Triglyceride (mmol/liter)1.024 ± 1.491.141 ± .1611.431 ± .3781.623 ± .440cp = 0.017 versus vehicle.1.263 ± .281Body weight (g)22.60 ± .6422.83 ± 1.2723.05 ± 1.1423.35 ± .8822.43 ± .80Data were expressed as ± S.D.a p < 0.001 versus vehicle.b p = 0.002 versus vehicle.c p = 0.017 versus vehicle.

Plasma PLTP activity was increased in a dose-dependent fashion by T0901317 (Fig.3 A). At the highest dose (100 mg/kg), plasma PLTP activity was increased 201% compared with vehicle control. To determine whether the increased PLTP activity was a result of increased gene transcription, we measured liver PLTP mRNA by RNase protection. PLTP mRNA was increased by LXR agonist in a dose-dependent manner up to 6-fold at the 100 mg/kg dose (Fig. 3 B). We noticed that the distinct induction of PLTP mRNA, its plasma activity, and the appearance of large HDL particles were all closely correlated well with the dose of 50 mg/kg, suggesting that PLTP regulation was critical for the enlarged HDL production. The in vivo regulation was also examined in other tissues (heart, lung, adipose tissue, and small intestine), and only modest increases were observed (data not shown), suggesting that the liver is the major contributor to the phenotype. We further utilized a nuclear run-on assay to show that the up-regulation of PLTP mRNA by LXR agonist is transcriptional (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3In vivo regulation of PLTP by LXR agonist T0901317.

Plasma samples from wild type and PLTP-deficient mice were subjected to FPLC analysis (Fig. 4). Although increases of HDL cholesterol and particle size persisted in PLTP-deficient mice, the extent of induction of HDL cholesterol levels was greatly attenuated (see also TableII). We concluded that the presence of PLTP contributed significantly to LXR agonist-mediated HDL cholesterol and size increase in mice.Figure 4Plasma lipoprotein analysis by FPLC in LXR agonist (T0901317)-treated PLTP0 and wild type mice.

Open table in a new tab Because LXRs regulate a spectrum of important genes involved in cholesterol efflux in macrophage cells, we speculated that PLTP might also be regulated in macrophage cells and potentially contribute to macrophage cholesterol efflux. Thus we further investigated PLTP expression and its regulation in mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. C57BL/6 mice were injected with thioglycollate, and peritoneal macrophage cells were collected and analyzed. There was basal level expression in these cells. In vitro treatment of these cells with T0901317 caused a concentration-dependent increase of PLTP mRNA of up to 5-fold at 1 μm (Fig.5 A). Treatment of macrophage cells with 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol or 9-cis-retinoic acid also induced PLTP expression (Fig. 5 B). The combination of these two reagents resulted in additive activation of PLTP mRNA, suggesting that PLTP was regulated by the LXR/RXR heterodimer. To further elucidate the function of PLTP in macrophages, we measured cholesterol efflux from peritoneal macrophage cells of wild type and PLTP-deficient mice. The deficiency of PLTP caused only minimal reduction in cholesterol efflux capacity under both basal and LXR agonist stimulated conditions (Fig. 5 C). Examination of phospholipid efflux in these cells yielded similar results (data not shown). Thus PLTP is not essential for either cholesterol or phospholipid efflux in mouse peritoneal macrophage cells, or there is a compensatory mechanism to complement PLTP deficiency.Figure 5PLTP regulation in mouse peritoneal macrophage cells by LXR agonists. Mouse peritoneal macrophage cells were collected and cultured as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, cells were treated with various concentrations of T0901317 for 24 h and RNAs were isolated and subjected to RNase protection assay. B, cells were treated with either 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol or 9-cis-retinoic acid or with both, and PLTP mRNAs were detected by RNase protection assay. C, cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol and loaded with 50 μg/ml acetylated LDL. Cholesterol efflux was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that the LXR agonist T0901317 increases HDL cholesterol and causes enlargement of HDL particles. The LXR agonist transcriptionally up-regulates PLTP expression that contributes to the increase of HDL cholesterol, because the increase was greatly attenuated in PLTP-deficient mice. PLTP had no direct effect on cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages, although the LXR agonist-mediated up-regulation of PLTP was also observed in these cells.Oxysterols were initially identified and proposed as endogenous LXR ligands (25Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Gene disruption of LXRα in mice resulted in massive lipid accumulation in the liver in response to a lipid-rich diet (15Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). With several critical gene products involved in lipid metabolism identified as direct target genes for LXRs, the concept was proposed that LXRs acted as master transcription factors mediating cholesterol catabolism (7Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 17Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Indeed, the ensuing reports convincingly showed that a specific nonsteroidal synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317, increased HDL cholesterol and regulated ABCA1 in vivo (13Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 16Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J., Li, L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). LXRs also regulate sterol-responsive element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), which controls lipogenesis (13Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 26Repa J.J. Liang G., Ou, J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). In this study we showed that the increase in HDL cholesterol is associated with two distinct HDL particles: a normal size HDL and an enlarged HDL enriched with apoE and ApoAI. The increase of the HDL cholesterol appears to be biphasic. A low dose of LXR agonist caused normal size HDL to increase, and higher doses resulted in a robust increase of a distinct class of HDL particles in the LDL size range.We report here for the first time that PLTP is an LXR target gene. Although the mouse promoter region does not contain a typical LXR-responsive element (DR-4), the administration of an LXR agonist in mouse up-regulated PLTP mRNA and activity. The treatment of mouse macrophages with T0901317 or oxysterols, which are thought to be endogenous ligands for LXR, also induced PLTP mRNA. Thus, PLTP is clearly regulated by LXR agonists. Earlier reports showed that various degenerate forms of IR-1, DR-3, or DR-4 elements were bound by FXR/RXRα in vitro (27Kirschning C.J., Au- Young J. Lamping N. Reuter D. Pfeil D. Seilhamer J.J. Schumann R.R. Genomics. 1997; 46: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Huuskonen J. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that some degenerate DR-4 element(s) may be responsible for the induction of PLTP expression by LXR agonists.We have shown that PLTP is strongly regulated by LXR agonists in liver and macrophage cells but is minimally enhanced in other tissues. This effect is similar to lipoprotein lipase regulation by LXR agonists. These results suggest that tissue-specific repressors or activators are associated specifically with LXR/RXR heterodimer action.The LXR agonist caused a dose-related enlargement of HDL. This effect was paralleled by the PLTP induction. However, up-regulation of PLTP by the LXR agonist is not a primary factor for HDL enlargement, because this effect was also observed in PLTP-deficient mice. This scenario is different from PLTP regulation by PPARα, where fenofibrate treatment increased plasma PLTP activity through a PPARα-dependent mechanism and increased plasma PLTP levels accounting for the marked enlargement of HDL in fenofibrate-treated mice (24Bouly M. Masson D. Gross B. Jiang X.C. Fievet C. Castro G. Tall A.R. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Lagrost L. Luc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25841-25847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The enlargement of HDL after LXR agonist administration to the mouse may largely involve the induction of ABCA1 and apoE, because both are regulated by LXRs (8Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J.

It has also been reported that apoE is responsible for larger HDL formation (32Koo C. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11934-11943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other factor involved in HDL enlargement in humans is CETP. In patients with complete CETP deficiency, HDL is increased in size and enriched in apoE and cholestryl ester (33Yamashita S. Sprecher D.L. Sakai N. Matsuzawa Y. Tarui S. Hui D.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because mouse has no CETP activity in plasma (34Ha Y.C. Barter P.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1982; 71: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the accumulation of enlarged HDL became evident in the animal after administration of the LXR agonist (Figs. 1and 2). It is very interesting to note from our preliminary results that LXR agonist-induced enlarged HDL particles were preferential substrates for CETP.Although PLTP was expressed and regulated in macrophage cells, which suggests its potential involvement in phospholipid and cholesterol efflux, we were surprised to find that the absence of PLTP did not produce significant changes in cell cholesterol efflux capacity. It is very likely that other alternative molecules are also operating in macrophage cells to compensate for PLTP action. Indeed, a redundancy of LXR-regulated apolipoprotein secretion from macrophages has been suggested (35Mak P.A. Laffitte B.A. Desrumaux C. Joseph S.B. Curtiss L.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31900-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that phosphatidylcholine transfer protein is involved in phospholipid and cholesterol efflux from Chinese hamster ovary cells (36Baez J.M. Barbour S.E. Cohen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6198-6206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As the cholesterol-carrying capacity of lipoproteins is a function of their phospholipid content, it can be expected that variations in PLTP levels in plasma would be associated with variations in their capacity to cause cholesterol efflux from tissues. Thus, phospholipid homeostasis is closely linked to cholesterol homeostasis.In summary, we report here the in vivo regulation of PLTP mediated by LXR agonists, which contributes significantly to HDL cholesterol metabolism. Our studies further suggest the critical role that PLTP plays in HDL biogenesis. Epidemiological studies have revealed that plasma HDL1 cholesterol is inversely correlated to coronary artery disease in humans. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the benefits of HDL. Among these, reverse cholesterol transport concept has been widely accepted. This notion, proposed more than 30 years ago by Glomset (1Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is defined as the process through which nascent HDL particles remove excessive free cholesterol from peripheral tissues and carry it back to the liver for catabolism. The studies on cellular cholesterol efflux pathway were highlighted by the recent breakthrough defining the genetic defects associated with Tangier disease and hypoalphalipoproteinemia (2Brooks-Wilson A.

https://openalex.org/W2019008376,"The antioxidant mechanism of ebselen involves recently discovered reductions by mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and thioredoxin (Trx) forming ebselen selenol. Here we describe a previously unknown reaction; ebselen reacts with its selenol forming an ebselen diselenide with a rate constant of 372 m−1s−1. The diselenide also was a substrate of TrxR forming the selenol withK m of 40 μm andk cat of 79 min−1(k cat/K m of 3.3 × 104m−1s−1). Trx increased the reduction because of its fast reaction with diselenide (rate constant 1.7 × 103m−1s−1). Diselenide stimulated the H2O2 reductase activity of TrxR, even more efficiently with Trx present. Because the mechanism of ebselen as an antioxidant has been assumed to involve glutathione peroxidase-like activity, we compared the H2O2 reductase activity of ebselen with the GSH and Trx systems. TrxR at 50 nm, far below the estimated physiological level, gave 8-fold higher activity compared with 1 mm GSH; addition of 5 μm Trx increased this difference to 13-fold. The rate constant of ebselen selenol reacting with H2O2was estimated to be faster than 350m−1s−1. We propose novel mechanisms for ebselen antioxidant action involving ebselen selenol and diselenide formation, with the thioredoxin system rather than glutathione as the predominant effector and target.

TrxR at 50 nm, far below the estimated physiological level, gave 8-fold higher activity compared with 1 mm GSH; addition of 5 μm Trx increased this difference to 13-fold. The rate constant of ebselen selenol reacting with H2O2was estimated to be faster than 350m−1s−1. We propose novel mechanisms for ebselen antioxidant action involving ebselen selenol and diselenide formation, with the thioredoxin system rather than glutathione as the predominant effector and target. 2-phenyl-1,2 benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (EbSe) thioredoxin reductase thioredoxin, Trx-(SH)2, reduced Trx oxidized Trx ebselen diselenide 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid glutathione peroxidase selenocysteine, DTT, dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography Tris/EDTA Ebselen1(2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one, also called PZ51) is a seleno-organic compound, originally synthesized while searching for compounds that mimic the activity of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase (1Muller A.

Unlike other selenium compounds, ebselen possesses a very low toxicity because of its unique stability in structure and because its selenium moiety is not liberated during biotransformation and therefore does not enter the selenium metabolism of the organism (7Fischer H.

More importantly, ebselen has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with delayed neurological deficits after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (15Saito I.

The thioredoxin system, a collective name for thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH, is the most powerful protein disulfide reductase system in cells and is present in all living organisms (18Holmgren A.

TrxR is a dimeric FAD-containing enzyme, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the active site disulfide in oxidized Trx (Trx-S2) to give a dithiol in reduced Trx (Trx-(SH)2) (18Holmgren A.

The reduced Trx is a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase, the essential enzyme for DNA synthesis and a powerful general protein disulfide reductase with a large number of functions in growth and redox regulations (18Holmgren A.

Mammalian TrxRs are large selenoproteins (M r 114,000 or larger) with structures showing a close homology to glutathione reductase but with an elongation containing a unique catalytically active selenolthiol/selenenylsulfide in the conserved C-terminal sequence Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly (22Luthman M.

Sci. 1997; 10: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian enzymes also are NADPH-dependent lipid hydroperoxide reductases (31Björnstedt M. Hamberg M. Kumar S. Xue J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11761-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and may serve directly as an electron donor of human plasma glutathione peroxidase (32Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported that ebselen is a substrate of mammalian TrxR, which is reduced by NADPH forming ebselen selenol with a K m value of 2.5 μm and a k cat of 588 min−1 (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We also showed that ebselen strongly enhanced the hydrogen peroxide reductase activity of mammalian TrxR, acting as a TrxR peroxidase. In the presence of Trx, ebselen acted as a mimic of a peroxiredoxin (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In reduction of ebselen by mammalian TrxR, we observed that under certain conditions, ebselen reacted with its selenol forming ebselen diselenide (2,2-diselenobis-(N-phenyl)-benzamid in Reaction FR1), which absorbs strongly at 340 nm and has a low solubility giving rise to a precipitate and increase in A 340(33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Here we report a study on the interaction of ebselen diselenide with the mammalian thioredoxin system to clarify the role of this compound in the H2O2 reductase activity of ebselen. We found that ebselen diselenide also is a direct substrate of mammalian TrxR and that Trx increases the reduction rate. The kinetics of the formation of ebselen diselenide (Reaction FR1) from ebselen reacting with its selenol was measured. Ebselen has been widely used as an antioxidant in experimental models assuming that it is acting via a GSH peroxidase-like mechanism (1Muller A. Cadenas E. Graf P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 2Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Sies H.

The discovery of its reactivity with thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) changed this picture. Using glutathione as the reductant, the H2O2 reductase activity of ebselen was compared with that in the presence of the mammalian thioredoxin system. Our results demonstrate that ebselen uses the thioredoxin system far more efficiently than glutathione. Formation of ebselen diselenide may serve as a dose-dependent storage form of ebselen, which can be relatively slowly activated to the catalytically active selenol by the mammalian thioredoxin system. NADPH, DTT, and DTNB were from Sigma. Hydrogen peroxide (perhydrol) (30%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were from Merck. TrxR from calf thymus or human placenta was purified to homogeneity (25 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min per mg) essentially as described for the rat liver enzyme (20Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Trx from Escherichia coli was a homogeneous preparation, and recombinant human Trx and the mutant C61S/C72S prepared as described by Ren et al. (34Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were from IMCO Ltd, Stockholm, Sweden (www.imcocorp.se). The sources of other materials have been described in previous publications (25Zhong L. Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 28Kumar S. Björnstedt M. Holmgren A. Eur. J.

Ebselen and ebselen diselenide were products of Daiichi and were dissolved in fresh Me2SO before addition into the aqueous solvents. Concentrations of Me2SO were less than 5% of the solvent buffer, effective in dissolving the drug. The activity of enzymes was determined at room temperature using an Ultrospec 3000 uv/visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Measurements of TrxR activity were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, generally with 100 μm NADPH and the indicated amounts of ebselen. Reactions were started with addition of 5 or 10 μl of a stock solution of TrxR in a final total volume of 0.50 ml. Cuvettes containing reference mixtures contained the same amount of Me2SO in the samples and TrxR. The glutathione peroxidase activity of ebselen was measured according to Wilson's method (35Wilson S.R. Zucker P.A. Huang R.R.C. Spector A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5936-5939Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm GSH, 1 unit of GSH reductase, and 2 μmebselen. The mixtures were preincubated for 10 min, and NADPH was added to a final concentration of 250 μm. The reactions were then initiated by addition of 0.5 mmH2O2, and the activities were followed by the decrease of NADPH at 340 nm against blanks without ebselen. Protein fluorescence was measured with a thermostatic SPEX-FluoroMax Spectrofluorometer. Trx-(SH)2 was prepared from E. coliTrx-S2, which was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 10 mm DTT. DTT was subsequently removed by gel chromatography on a NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using N2-equilibrated buffer. Trx-(SH)2 was mixed with ebselen in a total volume of 3 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 directly at 22 °C. Excitation of fluorescence was at 290 nm and emission spectra from 300 to 500 nm were recorded. Emission at 340 nm was followed to record the rate of oxidation of Trx-(SH)2 by ebselen diselenide (18Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Using the authentic compound, the absorption spectrum of 30 μm ebselen diselenide in TE buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2% Me2SO was measured (Fig. 1). The ebselen diselenide has two strong and broad absorption bands (from 250 to 300 nm and from 300 to 420 nm) overlapping each other. The band from 250 to 300 nm can be ascribed to the phenyl moieties, and a tailed broad band from 300 to 420 nm is caused by the Se-Se moiety (36Alam M.M. Ito O. Koga Y. Ouchi A. Int. J. Chem. Kinet. 1998; 30: 193-200Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of (EbSe)2 at 340 nm (ε340) was calculated to be 21,000 m−1cm−1 using several known concentrations of (EbSe)2. It should be noted that most assays of ebselen and its reactivity toward hydroperoxides were measured at 340 nm, where the kinetic oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ was followed. The high and broad absorption of (EbSe)2 has to be taken into consideration when a decrease of A 340 is interpreted. Another useful wavelength for (EbSe)2 measurement is 390 nm with ε390 of 8000m−1cm−1, where most of the other substances used in the assays have no or very weak absorbance. Reduction of ebselen by NADPH catalyzed by mammalian TrxR produces ebselen selenol (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, when lower concentrations of the enzyme and higher concentrations of ebselen were used, the A 340 showed a complex change. Fig.2 shows the change ofA 340 upon the reduction of 10–100 μm ebselen by NADPH catalyzed by 7.5 nm TrxR. With higher concentrations of ebselen (>20 μm), theA 340 first increased, followed by a decrease to give the final reduction product ebselen selenol. The highest concentrations (50 and 100 μm) gave visible precipitates. This is due to a fast reaction of excess ebselen with its reduction product ebselen selenol through Reaction FR1. The rate constant of Reaction FR1 was measured in a way where 40 μm ebselen selenol is produced by reduction of 40 μm ebselen with 100 μm NADPH catalyzed by 50 nm calf liver TrxR (Fig.3 A). After 20 min, where the reaction was complete, the enzyme in the solution was removed by filtering though an Ultrafree®-MC Millipore 10,000 cutoff filter. To this solution containing 40 μm ebselen selenol, another 40 μm ebselen was added, and the kinetics of formation of (EbSe)2 was followed at 390 nm (Fig. 3 B). The formation of ebselen diselenide was fitted to second-order rate Equation 1, where x is the micromolar concentration of (EbSe)2 using ε390 of 8000m−1s−1, and a is the initial concentration of ebselen and ebselen selenol, in this case, 40 μm. x/a(a−x)=k1·tEquation 1 As seen from the inset of Fig. 3 B, a plot of the left side of Equation 1 against time gave a straight line confirming second-order kinetics with a slope corresponding to the second-order rate constant k 1 of 0.0223 μm−1min−1 (372m−1s−1). To TE buffer solutions (pH 7.5) containing 10 and 20 μm ebselen diselenide, 100 μm NADPH, 50 nm calf thymus TrxR were added. The decreases of (EbSe)2 were followed against an identical blank without TrxR (Fig. 4). Ebselen diselenide was a direct substrate of mammalian TrxR, and addition of human Trx increased the reaction rate. Reduction of ebselen diselenide by NADPH catalyzed by TrxR produced ebselen selenol (Reaction FR2), as evidenced by the final spectrum and HPLC analysis (data not shown). Addition of one volume of 6 mguanidine hydrochloride containing 10 mm DTNB at the end of the reaction also gave formation of TNB, showing the reduction of DTNB by the ebselen selenol in Reaction FR2(33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Figure FR2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The steady state kinetics of ebselen diselenide as a substrate of TrxR was also measured directly using 100 nmmammalian TrxR. As shown in Fig. 5, theK m value of 40 μm andk cat of 79 min−1 can be derived from a Lineweaver-Burk Plot of an assay, and thek cat/K m was calculated to be 3.3 × 104m−1s−1. From Fig. 4, it was obvious that addition of Trx to TrxR increased reduction rate of NADPH toward ebselen diselenide. This indicated that Trx-(SH)2 is a fast reductant of (EbSe)2 according to Reactions FR3 and FR4 in the following reaction scheme.Figure FR4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mammalian and E. coli Trx have the same active site (WCGPC) and reactivity with disulfides (18Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Since E. coli Trx-(SH)2 has a 3-fold higher tryptophan fluorescence than TrxS2 (18Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhong L. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18121-18128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), this was used to follow the reaction with ebselen diselenide. The fluorescence decay of 5 μm reduced E. coli Trx-(SH)2 was recorded after adding 5 μm (EbSe)2 (Fig.6). The inverse of the Trx-(SH)2 fluorescence intensity was found to be linear against time indicating a typical second-order kinetics (Fig. 6,inset). Thus the slope of the linear fit gave a second-order rate constant k 5 of 1.7 × 103m−1s−1. This rate constant is lower than the one for the reduction of insulin by reduced Trx (105m−1s−1) (37Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Ebselen diselenide also was reduced by DTT to form two equivalents of ebselen selenol (Reaction FR5). The rate constant of this reaction was directly measured by following the decrease of 20 μm (EbSe)2 at 390 nm after adding 2 mm reduced DTT. The ebselen diselenide has an ε390 of 8000m−1cm−1, and all other species involved have little or no absorbance at this wavelength. Since the concentration of DTTred is 100-fold higher than that of (EbSe)2, the decrease of (EbSe)2 absorption at 390 nm should follow a pseudo first order kinetics. The decrease of (EbSe)2 was found to be first order with a half-life of 5 s. Thus k 6 was calculated to be ∼70 ± 2 m−1s−1. This rate constant can be compared with the one for the reduction of insulin by DTT as 5 m−1s−1 (39Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of Trx by DTT is much faster with a rate constant of 1647m−1s−1 (39Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because reduction of ebselen diselenide by NADPH produces two equivalents of ebselen selenol, which will rapidly reduce H2O2 and generate ebselen, a much more efficient substrate of mammalian TrxR and thus a TrxR peroxidase (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), ebselen diselenide should also stimulate the H2O2 reductase activity of mammalian TrxR. Fig.7 showed that the changes inA 340 as recorded after addition of 1–10 μm (EbSe)2 to TE buffers, pH 7.5, containing 250 μm NADPH, 18 nm mammalian TrxR, and 0.5 mm H2O2. These H2O2 reductase activities of (EbSe)2 were compared with that of 2 μmebselen (dark line). Obviously (EbSe)2stimulated the H2O2 reductase activity of TrxR. However, we also noticed that this activity was higher than expected, since ebselen diselenide is about a 100-fold less efficient substrate of the TrxR than ebselen, as we have described above. Although we cannot account for the high reactivity of ebselen diselenide, which may have to do with a direct interaction of the oxidized form of ebselen diselenide with TrxR, it will be active as an antioxidant in the presence of the thioredoxin system. At higher (EbSe)2concentrations, the H2O2 reductase activity reached saturation, probably because (EbSe)2 was regenerated through Reaction FR1. The molecular mechanism of ebselen acting as an antioxidant has long been attributed to its activity as a glutathione peroxidase mimic, catalyzing the glutathione detoxification of hydroperoxides (1Muller A. Cadenas E. Graf P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 2Sies H. Free Radic. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A number of other thiols, e.g. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (40Cotgreave I.A. Sandy M.S. Berggren M. Moldeus P.W. Smith M.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2899-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), dithiothreitol (41Muller A. Gabriel H. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and dihydrolipoate (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar) were also used. The endogenous dihydrolipoate was found to be a better cofactor than glutathione for the peroxidase activity of ebselen (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the H2O2 reductase activities of ebselen using a lower than normal physiological concentrations of TrxR (50 nm), with or without the presence of 5 μmTrx (43Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 44Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Luthman M. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hansson H.A. Holmgren A. Rozell B. Täljedal I.B. Cell Tissue Res. 1986; 245: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with the activity in the presence of 1 mmglutathione. As shown in Fig. 8, the rate of NADPH turnover was 1.66 μm/min for 2 μmebselen in the presence of 1 mm GSH, excess glutathione reductase and 0.5 mm H2O2. When 50 nm calf thymus TrxR was used, the rate was found to be 13 μm/min, thus an increase of H2O2reductase activity of 8-fold. With the further addition of 5 μm Trx, the rate was increased to 21 μm/min, i.e. a relative increase of the H2O2 reductase activity of ebselen to 13-fold. This experiment clearly demonstrated that ebselen reacted with TrxR and Trx far more efficiently than with glutathione. Direct measurement of the rate constant for ebselen selenol reducing H2O2(Reaction FR6) was complicated by the reaction between ebselen and ebselen selenol to form the (EbSe)2 (Reaction FR1). However, an estimate of the lowest limit of this rate constant can be made from the enzyme and H2O2 coupled assays. As seen from Fig. 8, the rate of NADPH oxidation was ∼21 μm/min in a solution containing 250 μmNADPH, 2 μm ebselen, 50 nm TrxR, 5 μm Trx, and 0.5 mmH2O2. If we assume a saturation of this reaction by the turnover of ebselen selenol to ebselen, i.e.the rate of ebselen selenol with H2O2 becomes rate-limiting step, we get Equation 2. v=k1·[H2O2]·[EbSeH]=21μM/minEquation 2 Because the highest concentration for ebselen selenol was 2 μm, one can estimate a rate constantk 1 to be at least larger than 21 mm−1min−1, i.e. 350m−1s−1. The actual rate constant should be even larger since with 50 nm TrxR and 5 μm Trx, the oxidation of NADPH has not reached saturation and then the concentration of the ebselen selenol should be much lower than 2 μm. Nevertheless, this rate constant is ∼7.5 times higher than the previously reported 2.8 mm−1min−1 (46Morgenstern R. Cotgreave I.A. Engman L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 84: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), most probably because the interference of the diselenide formation was not considered. The high rate constant k 7 also demonstrates that ebselen selenol is the most active form of ebselen for its H2O2 reductase activity. The selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides by reduced glutathione with a ter uni ping pong mechanism (Scheme FS1 A) (47Ursini F. Maiorino R. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Thus, a similar reaction pathway can be drawn for ebselen acting as a Trx peroxidase mimic (Scheme FS1 B). It is well known that the active site of glutathione peroxidase is its selenocysteine residue (CysSeH), which because of its much lower pKavalue and higher nucleophilicity of the corresponding selenolate, will easily reduce H2O2 to form H2O and the cysteine selenenic acid (CysSeOH). The latter consumes two glutathione molecules as hydrogen donors to finish a catalytic cycle and regenerating the selenocysteine. A corresponding reaction mechanism for ebselen (Scheme FS1 B) would imply that ebselen needs an efficient two-electron donor to form the active selenol to carry out its H2O2 reductase activity. As the most effective dithiol reductant of the cell (18Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar), the mammalian thioredoxin and particularly the selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductase are therefore electron donors for ebselen and its hydroperoxide reductase activity. The ebselen selenol was found to be much less oxygen sensitive than the cysteine selenol (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This is expected for an aryl selenol in ebselen, because correspondingly, an aryl thiol has much lower oxygen sensitivity than an alkyl thiol,e.g. cysteine (48Zhao R. Lind J. Gábor M. Eriksen T.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2811-2816Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Though ebselen is known for being a glutathione peroxidase mimic, the activity is rather weak (1Muller A. Cadenas E. Graf P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 49Wendel A. Fausel M. Safayhi H. Tiegs G. Otter R. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ebselen was shown to react with glutathione forming an ebselen selenenylsulfide, which in turn is only slowly converted, in the presence of an excess of glutathione, to ebselen selenol and (EbSe)2 (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar, 51Cotgreave I.A. Morgenstern R. Engman L. Ahokas J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 84: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the selenol as an intermediate in the reduction of the selenenylsulfide to (EbSe)2 by thiols was clearly demonstrated by Cotgreaveet al. (51Cotgreave I.A. Morgenstern R. Engman L. Ahokas J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 84: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by trapping the selenol with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Formation of diselenide of ebselen was evident from both HPLC and 77Se NMR analysis (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic explanations of the chemical conversions of ebselen reacting with thiols were controversial (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar, 52Fischer H. N. D. Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 1987; 96: 757-768Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and Reaction FR1 was not recognized. The argument also included whether the active form of ebselen toward H2O2 is ebselen diselenide (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar,52Fischer H. N. D. Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 1987; 96: 757-768Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or the selenol (46Morgenstern R. Cotgreave I.A. Engman L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 84: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 50Maiorino M. Roveri A. Coassin M. Ursini F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Formation of a diselenide was suggested to be a key step for catalytic activity as the slowest one, and its reaction with the H2O2 would yield the parent compound and water (42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar, 52Fischer H. N. D. Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 1987; 96: 757-768Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, Maiorino et al. (50Maiorino M. Roveri A. Coassin M. Ursini F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) concluded that the ebselen mechanism appeared kinetically identical to the enzyme reaction and showed that carboxymethylation of intermediates by iodoacetamide formed inactive derivatives suggested that an ebselen selenol is involved. Morgenstern et al. (46Morgenstern R. Cotgreave I.A. Engman L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1992; 84: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) also concluded that the selenol is the predominant molecular species responsible for the GSH-dependent peroxidase activity of ebselen. Because we have a reaction system where ebselen directly undergoes a fast two-electron reduction by NADPH catalyzed by mammalian TrxR, forming the ebselen selenol, the occurrence of Reaction FR1 became evident. The formation of the ebselen diselenide, measured to have a second order rate constant of 372m−1s−1, was apparent when both ebselen and ebselen selenol are present, e.g. in reduction reactions at high concentrations of ebselen and low concentrations of enzymes. Formation of the diselenide was not a unique feature of the enzyme since it could be mimicked by using a low non-stoichiometric concentration of DTT (10 μm) and 100 μmebselen, whereas excess DTT only gave the selenol as is also shown by HPLC (data not shown). It is therefore not surprising that dithiols like DTT or dihydrolipoate are better cofactors of ebselen than glutathione as observed (41Muller A. Gabriel H. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Haenen G.R., De Rooij B.M. Vermeulen N.P. Bast A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 412-422PubMed Google Scholar). When the mammalian thioredoxin system was used, ebselen was highly efficiently reduced to its selenol, which in the presence of H2O2, rapidly forms H2O and a selenenic acid, and then spontaneously eliminates H2O and regenerates the ebselen for another catalytic cycle (Reaction FR6). We have clearly shown that ebselen diselenide is also a substrate of mammalian TrxR with a K m value of 40 μm and k cat of 79 min−1; thus thek cat/K m is calculated to be 3.3 × 104m−1s−1. Compared with the reduction of ebselen by NADPH catalyzed by mammalian TrxR having aK m value of 2.5 μm, ak cat of 588 min −1 and ak cat/K m of 3.9 × 106m−1s−1 (33Zhao R. Masayasu H. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the efficiency of ebselen diselenide reduction is 100 times slower. The mechanism of mammalian TrxR acting on ebselen diselenide can be illustrated in Scheme FS2. The C-terminal active site selenenylsulfide in TrxR is reduced by NADPH via the active site disulfide in the second subunit forming a thiol and a selenolate (25–27,53). The latter will reduce (EbSe)2 via a short-lived intermediate, TrxRSe-SeEbSe, and will form two equivalents of ebselen selenol. Ebselen diselenide also was shown to have an H2O2 reductase activity (Fig. 7), which was surprisingly high compared with that of ebselen, taking into account the difference as the substrates for the enzyme as described above. A simple mechanism for (EbSe)2 acting as an H2O2 reductase is given in SchemeFS3. Reduction of (EbSe)2 by the mammalian TrxR slowly forms the ebselen selenol, which will rapidly reduce H2O2 and generate ebselen, a 100-fold more efficient substrate of mammalian Trx system. At the same time, ebselen will also react with the ebselen selenol to reform the ebselen diselenide through Reaction FR1. Thus the H2O2reductase activity of (EbSe)2 is actually achieved through a bridge connecting the active form of the catalytic cycle,i.e. the ebselen selenol and ebselen, with H2O2. The pathways described in Scheme FS3 also stand for a complete mechanism of ebselen for its H2O2 reductase activity. A more simplified form of Scheme FS3 is drawn in Scheme FS4, including a previously unrecognized part of the antioxidant mechanism of ebselen, i.e. the ebselen itself will compete with H2O2 for the ebselen selenol to form the ebselen diselenide, which in fact limits the level of its H2O2 reductase activity. Since the reduction of (EbSe)2 by NADPH catalyzed by the mammalian Trx system is much slower than that of ebselen, (EbSe)2 may then serve as a storage form of ebselen, which is slowly reactivated by the mammalian Trx system. Formation of the diselenide is definitely a part of ebselen antioxidant action, which will affect its efficiency as a peroxidase but will not change the character of ebselen as a thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin peroxidase mimic.Figure FS3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure FS4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Dr Hiroyuki Masayasu from Daiichi Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, is gratefully thanked for his gifts of the ebselen and ebselen diselenide compounds and helpful discussions."

Thus, the toxin may target the detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRMs) of these membranes, in analogy to aerolysin, a heptameric pore-forming toxin that associates with DRMs. To test this idea, we examined the distribution of radiolabeled ε-toxin in DRM and detergent-soluble membrane fractions of MDCK cells and rat synaptosomal membranes. When MDCK cells and synaptosomal membranes were incubated with the toxin and then fractionated by cold Triton X-100 extraction and flotation on sucrose gradients, the heptameric toxin was detected almost exclusively in DRMs. The results of a toxin overlay assay revealed that the toxin preferentially bound to and heptamerized in the isolated DRMs. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin abrogated their association and lowered the cytotoxicity of the toxin toward MDCK cells. When ε-protoxin, an inactive precursor able to bind to but unable to heptamerize in the membrane, was incubated with MDCK cell membranes, it was detected mainly in their DRMs. These results suggest that the toxin is concentrated and induced to heptamerize on binding to a putative receptor located preferentially in DRMs, with all steps from initial binding through pore formation completed within the same DRMs. Clostridium perfringens ε-toxin, which is responsible for enterotoxaemia in ungulates, forms a heptamer in rat synaptosomal and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell membranes, leading to membrane permealization.

C. perfringens ε-toxin (ET) possesses biochemical properties similar to those of aerolysin, which led us to speculate that ET also attacks DRMs and also to expect that it may be potentially useful, as aerolysin is, for understanding the molecular organization and functional entity of DRMs (4Galbiati F.

We have previously shown that proteolytic activation of ε-protoxin (ProET) is due to the removal of a C-terminal peptide (19Minami J. Katayama S. Matsushita O. Matsushita C. Okabe A. Microbiol.

Similar ET oligomerization has been reported for Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell membranes, where the potassium ion permeability is increased by the toxin (21Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, the ability of heptamerized ET to form a ion-permeable channel was demonstrated by an in vitro study involving artificial lipid bilayers (22Petit L. Maier E. Gibert M. Popoff M.R. Benz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15736-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ET is rich in β-strand (23Habeeb A.F. Lee C.L. Atassi M.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 322: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that it functions as a β-barrel pore-forming toxin. Considering these characteristic features of ET, it may be possible that ET utilizes DRMs as a concentration device in a similar way to aerolysin and thereby rapidly exhibits its high toxicity. Functional and biochemical studies on the association of trafficking, signaling, and pathogen entry with DRMs have been based mainly on two operational strategies: depletion of cell cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MbCD), a cholesterol-extracting agent, and isolation of membrane fractions that are resistant to cold detergent extraction (24Edidin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 492-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). By means of these strategies, we have assessed the possible association between ET and DRMs that were prepared from rat synaptosomal membranes and MDCK cells, the only ET-sensitive cell line so far available. The results presented here show that ET heptamerizes exclusively in DRMs like aerolysin, which constitutes convincing evidence of the proposed action of DRMs as a device for the concentration and heptamerization of pore-forming toxins (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown by means of a ProET binding experiment that it binds mainly to DRMs. This suggests that ET binds predominantly to DRMs, and that all the steps from binding to pore formation are completed within the same DRMs, unlike aerolysin in which the precursor is activated in non-DRMs and then moves into DRMs. Finally, to address the question of whether or not the cytotoxicity of ET is reversed by inhibition of ET heptamerization, we examined the effect of cholesterol depletion on ET toxicity toward MDCK cells. The finding that MbCD had an inhibitory effect on ET cytotoxicity provides an insight not only into the molecular mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of ET but also into the cases of other pore-forming toxins. MbCD, lovastatin, mevalonate, and a protease inhibitor mixture were obtained from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the α-1 subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from BioRad. A plasmid, pEP1, that encodes ProET (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI andXhoI to abolish the HindIII site in the non-coding region, blunt-ended, and then religated. Two synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-TATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCACAGCAGCGGC ATCGAAGGTCGT¯¯ATGAGACGTGCGTCTGTTAA-3′ (sense; the His6 tag, factor Xa, and protein kinase A recognition sequences are underlined, doubly underlined, and italicized, respectively) and 5′-AGCTTTAACAGACGCACGTCTCATACGACCTTCGATGCCGCTGCTGTGATGATGATGATGATGGCCCA-3′ (antisense), were annealed and cloned into the above plasmid, which had been digested with NdeI and HindIII. The resultant plasmid, which encodes His6-ΔN-proET (ProET lacking an N-terminal propeptide of 13 amino acid residues but having a His6-tag, a factor Xa cleavage site, and a protein kinase A-specific phosphorylation site at the N terminus), was named pEL18. ANdeI-AvrII insert DNA fragment from pEL18 was cloned into pEP4, which was described previously (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid, named pEL20, enabled the expression of a His6-ΔN-ProET derivative (His6-ΔN-ProET with an additional factor Xa cleavage site at the C terminus). The identity of each of the His-tagged toxins was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Transformants ofEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) carrying plasmids pEL18 and pEL20 were cultured, and the recombinant proteins were expressed as described previously (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The toxins were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing His6-ΔN-ProET or the His6-ΔN-ProET derivative, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled. Their N-terminal His6-tags and the C-terminal pro-regions of the His6-ΔN-ProET derivative were cleaved off at factor Xa-sensitive sites, as described previously (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), to generate recombinant ProET and ET, respectively. The purified toxins were dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and stored at −80 °C. Because the cytotoxic activities toward MDCK cells of recombinant ProET and ET were comparable with those of ProET from C. perfringens cultures and the trypsin-activated ET, respectively (data not shown), they were used as ProET and ET throughout this study. Radiolabeling of ProET and ET was performed as described previously except that [γ-35S]ATP (46.3 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used instead of [γ-32P]ATP to minimize cleavage by endogenous phosphatases. In brief, 1 mg of purified His6-ΔN-ProET or His6-ΔN-ProET derivative was incubated in 300 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2,1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 MBq of [γ-35S]ATP, and 15,000 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A catalytic subunit (New England Biolabs) at 4 °C for 16 h. The [35S]-labeled proteins were purified as described above. The specific activities of the [35S]-labeled His6-ΔN-ProET and His6-ΔN-ProET derivative were about 650 and 580 kcpm/μg protein, respectively. [35S]-ProET and [35S]-ET were prepared from the [35S]-labeled His6-ΔN-ProET and His6-ΔN-ProET derivative, respectively, as described above. MDCK cells were grown to confluency in MEM (Eagle's minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All incubations of MDCK cells were carried out in this medium, unless otherwise stated. MDCK cell plasma membranes were prepared as described by Shortt et al. (25Shortt S.J. Titball R.W. Lindsay C.D. Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 2000; 19: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Synaptosomal membranes were prepared from rat brains as described previously (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The membranes were suspended in a small volume of TBS containing the protease inhibitor mixture. [35S]-ET binding and heptamerization in the MDCK cell or rat synaptosomal membranes were carried out as described previously (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). After incubating the membranes with [35S]-ET, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The membrane pellet was washed three times with TBS at 4 °C and then resuspended in TBS with or without 10 mm MbCD. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 15 min. The precipitate was further extracted with TBS containing 1% TX-100 at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and precipitate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography with an imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film, Kanagawa, Japan). Separation of DRMs from detergent-soluble membranes (non-DRMs, non-detergent-resistant membranes) and a cytosoluble fraction was carried out by flotation-centrifugation on a sucrose gradient (26Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar), as follows. MDCK cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 100 ng/ml [35S]-ET for 90 min. The cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by exposure to 1% TX-100 for 30 min at 4 °C in TBS containing the protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a cell scraper and then homogenized by passage through a 22-gauge needle. Synaptosomal membranes were also incubated with 2 μg/ml [35S]-ET in TBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 90 min and then lysed with 1% TX-100 in TBS containing the protease inhibitor mixture. Portions of the lysates were brought to 40% sucrose in a final volume of 0.5 ml and overlaid with 3.5 ml of 30% sucrose in TBS, followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in TBS. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 50,000 rpm (∼250,000 × g) at 4 °C in a Hitachi RPS65T rotor. Fractions (∼0.5 ml each) were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously (27Miyata S. Moriyama R. Miyahara N. Makino S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, aliquots of membrane samples (10 μg of protein each) or 100-μl aliquots of flotation sucrose gradient fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved by heating in 2× SDS-sample buffer at 99 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with TTBS containing 5% skim milk and incubated first with the primary antibody in TTBS containing 1% skim milk, then with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and finally with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). MDCK cell and synaptosomal membranes were fractionated by flotation-centrifugation in the same manner as described above except for omission of the preincubation with ET. The ET overlay assay for the detection of membrane-bound toxins was performed as follows. MDCK cell or synaptosomal membranes (1 μg of protein each) or 10-μl aliquots of flotation sucrose gradient fractions were diluted with TBS to 200 μl and then slot-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in TTBS supplemented with 5% skim milk at 25 °C for 90 min, followed by a 90-min incubation in TTBS containing 1% skim milk and 1 μg/ml [35S]-ET or [35S]-ProET. The membrane was then washed five times with TTBS for 10 min each. ET bound to the cell membranes was visualized by autoradiography. When the effect of MbCD on ET binding was examined, the membranes were preincubated in TBS with and without 10 mm MbCD at 37 °C for 30 min, washed three times with TBS, and then slot-blotted. MDCK cell and synaptosomal membranes were incubated in TBS with and without 10 mm MbCD at 37 °C for 30 min. The membranes were washed three times with TBS and then incubated with 2 μg/ml [35S]-ET at 37 °C for various times. After incubation, the reaction mixture was dissolved by heating in SDS-sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The amounts of heptameric ET were determined with Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film) and are presented as percentages of the total amount of ET added to the incubation mixture. Cholesterol depletion from MDCK cells was carried out as described by Keller and Simons (28Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells (2.0 × 104) were cultured in the medium containing 4 μm lovastatin and 0.25 mm mevalonate in a 96-well microculture plate for 48 h to minimize the de novo synthesis of cholesterol. Then the residual cholesterol was extracted by treatment with 10 mm MbCD in MEM for 80 min at 37 °C. After washing two times with MEM, the MDCK cells were incubated with various concentrations of ET in MEM for 4 h and then subjected to the cytotoxicity assay. MDCK cell membranes were incubated with 2 μg/ml [35S]-ProET in TBS containing 0.1% BSA at 37 °C for various times in a centrifuge tube, which had been pretreated overnight with 1% BSA in TBS to avoid nonspecific adsorption of the toxin to the tube wall. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 5 min and washed three times with TBS. The membrane precipitate was treated with cold 1% TX-100 and separated into non-DRM and detergent-insoluble DRM fractions by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min as described above. The cytotoxicity of ET toward MDCK cells was measured by means of the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt; Promega) conversion assay as described previously (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed with a 4–20% gradient Laemmli gel under denaturing conditions. Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. To assess the possible association of ET heptamerization with the DRMs of MDCK cell and rat synaptosomal membranes, we first examined the distribution of ET heptamers in the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions after TX-100 extraction at low temperature. The SDS-resistant ET heptamer formed in MDCK cell membranes was found almost exclusively in the precipitate (detergent-insoluble fraction) after treatment with 1% TX-100 at 4 °C followed by centrifugation, there being very little in the supernatant (detergent-soluble fraction) (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and3). Its association with the detergent-insoluble fraction was affected only marginally by MbCD treatment alone (Fig.1 A, lane 4). However, the ET heptamer was found mainly in the detergent-soluble fraction when the precipitate after MbCD treatment was extracted with cold 1% TX-100 (Fig. 1 A,lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that the heptameric ET is associated with DRMs. Similar results were obtained when the heptameric ET in synaptosomal membranes was analyzed (Fig.1 B). These results suggest that most ET heptamers are associated with DRMs in both MDCK cell and synaptosomal membranes. Although monomeric ET showed an apparently similar TX-100 extraction profile, its band intensity was too low to evaluate accurately. To analyze more precisely the distribution of heptameric ET in membranes, we fractionated ET-bound membranes by flotation-centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2, the heptameric ET was detected almost exclusively in the DRMs, i.e. not in the non-DRMs, of ET-bound MDCK cells, as revealed by the distribution of a DRM marker, caveolin-1. Likewise, when fractions of ET-bound synaptosomal membranes were analyzed (Fig. 2 B), the heptameric ET was detected almost exclusively in the DRM fraction containing a DRM marker, flotillin-1, i.e. not in that containing a non-DRM marker, Na+,K+-ATPase α-1 subunit. These results indicated that ET heptamers are located predominantly within their DRMs.Figure 2Flotation gradient fractionation of ET-bound MDCK cells and synaptosomal membranes. MDCK cells (A) and synaptosomal membranes (B) were incubated in the presence of [35S]-ET (100 ng/ml medium and 2 μg/ml TBS, respectively) at 37 °C for 90 min and then extracted with TBS containing 1% TX-100 at 4 °C for 30 min. Aliquots of the extracts were brought to 40% sucrose and then loaded at the bottom of a centrifuge tube. After flotation sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, 11 (A) or 10 (B) different fractions (∼0.5 ml each) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The gradient fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved by heating in 2× SDS-sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting (a) or autoradiography (b). Lanes 1–11, fractions from the top to bottom of the gradient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The association of heptameric ET with DRMs may result from the heptamerization of monomeric ET in the DRMs or from the translocation of ET heptamerized outside the DRMs. If ET heptamerization occurs in DRMs, it would be abrogated by MbCD treatment, which depletes cholesterol and disrupts the integrity of DRMs. To assess this possibility, we examined the effect of MbCD treatment on the rate of ET heptamerization. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with MbCD decreased the rate of heptamerization; the level of heptameric ET in MDCK cell and synaptosomal membranes was reduced to 1 and 12% of those in untreated control membranes, respectively. This suggests that ET heptamerization occurs at least mainly in DRMs, depending on their integrity. However, it still does not exclude the possibility that heptameric ET is translocated from non-DRMs, because MbCD may also affect cholesterol surrounding and outside of DRMs, altering the diffusion of ET therein, as has been suggested for the MbCD effect of proaerolysin on non-DRMs (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of ET to heptamerize in DRMs and non-DRMs fractionated by flotation-centrifugation (Fig.4). The heptameric ET was detected exclusively in the DRMs, i.e. not in the solubilized non-DRMs, of MDCK cells, as revealed by the distribution of a DRM marker, caveolin-1 (Fig. 4 A). Likewise, when fractions of synaptosomal membranes were analyzed (Fig. 4 B), heptameric ET was detected only in the fraction containing a DRM marker, flotillin-1, i.e. not in that containing a non-DRM marker, Na+,K+-ATPase α-1 subunit. The distribution of [35S]-ET detected in the toxin overlay assay with the same fractionated samples coincided with that of heptameric ET, suggesting that ET binds preferentially to the DRMs. Consistent with this, ProET, which is able to bind but unable to heptamerize, was also detected in DRMs but not in solubilized non-DRM fractions (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, it can be assumed that ET binds to a putative ET receptor predominantly located in DRMs. This was reinforced by the results of a toxin overlay assay with MbCD-treated membranes (Fig. 5). MbCD treatment decreased the binding of ET to MDCK cell and synaptosomal membranes to 22 and 9.6%, respectively, of the levels in untreated control membranes, as was calculated from the band intensity of each slot-blot.Figure 5The effect of MbCD treatment on ET binding. MDCK cell membranes (A) or synaptosomal membranes (B) (1 μg of protein each) were incubated in TBS with or without 10 mm MbCD at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBS and then slot-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by the overlay assay with [35S]-ET. Lane C, MbCD-untreated controls; lane M, MbCD-treated membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The levels of bound ET detected in the toxin overlay assay may reflect ET heptamerization rather than ET binding, because monomeric ET might have heptamerized during the incubation. Furthermore, the TX-100 used for the fractionation of membrane domains may affect toxin binding in non-DRMs. To confirm that ProET binds predominantly to DRMs but not to non-DRMs, MDCK cell membranes were incubated with ProET in the absence of TX-100 for various times and then fractionated by cold TX-100 extraction. As shown in Fig.6, ∼2-fold more ProET was detected in DRMs than in non-DRMs even at 5 min after initiation of the incubation; this proportion increased slightly during 80 min of incubation. This result indicates that a ProET receptor, which must be the same as the ET one (see “Discussion”), is predominantly located in DRMs. Thus, ET is very likely to bind predominantly to DRMs and to heptamerize therein. To examine the effect of cholesterol depletion on ET cytotoxicity, MDCK cells were grown in the presence of lovastatin and mevalonate to minimize thede novo synthesis of cholesterol, followed by an 80-min incubation in the presence of MbCD. The cell viability revealed by the MTS assay was compared between MbCD-treated and untreated cells. The MbCD treatment decreased the ET cytotoxicity toward MDCK cells; the cell viability with 100 ng/ml ET of MDCK cells treated with MbCD was 5-fold lower than that of untreated cells (Fig.7). This study has revealed that the ET heptamer exists almost exclusively in DRMs of MDCK cells and rat synaptosomal membranes by showing the distribution of [35S]-labeled ET heptamers in DRM fractions floating on sucrose density gradients. ET heptamer association with DRMs was further confirmed by its dislocation from the detergent-insoluble to the detergent-soluble fraction upon cholesterol depletion, as has been widely performed for the demonstration of DRM components. It was also shown that heptamerization is inhibited by cholesterol depletion. Furthermore, ET was shown by the ET overlay assay to bind to DRMs but not to solubilized non-DRMs, both of which were isolated by cold detergent extraction and flotation-centrifugation. To overcome the disadvantage of the ET overlay assay so that it might reflect ET heptamerization rather than ET binding and that TX-100 might affect the ET binding to non-DRMs, ProET (which is able to bind but unable to heptamerize) was used to monitor only toxin binding. The results showed that ProET binds predominantly to DRMs even in detergent-free conditions. ProET and ET can be assumed to bind to the same receptor, because ProET inhibits the binding of ET to the synaptosomal fraction (14Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1237-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the heptamerization of ET therein (20Miyata S. Matsushita O. Minami J. Katayama S. Shimamoto S. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13778-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and also its mouse lethality (30Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, a putative ET receptor appears to be located mainly in DRMs. The finding that a minor fraction of ProET was detected in non-DRMs does not rule out the possibility that some ET monomers diffuse into DRMs after binding to the outside of the DRMs. Overall, however, it seems likely that most ET molecules complete all the steps from initial binding to heptamerization within the same DRMs. The hypothesis that DRMs act as a specialized concentration device for pore-forming toxins has been proposed based on the finding that aerolysin binds specifically to GPI-anchored proteins (31Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and that proaerolysin is highly abundant in DRMs (32Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has been further reinforced by the finding that aerolysin heptamers formed in DRMs move to a non-DRM fraction upon treatment with saponin, a cholesterol-binding agent (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity and heptamerization of aerolysin in T lymphocytes, however, are insensitive to MbCD treatment, thus arguing against the dependence of aerolysin heptamerization on DRMs (33Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19839-19843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A plausible explanation for these apparently contradictory observations is that cholesterol depletion affects heptamerization in most cell types but not in T lymphocytes expressing unusually high levels of aerolysin receptors (10Fivaz M. Abrami L. Tsitrin Y. van der Goot F.G. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another likely explanation is that MbCD only affects cholesterol surrounding and outside of DRMs (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Although the effects of MbCD on the distribution of GPI-anchored proteins are controversial (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the finding that ET preferentially binds to DRMs and heptamerizes therein in a cholesterol-dependent manner lends some support to these explanations and adds weight to the proposed function of DRMs as a platform that promotes the multimerization of pore-forming toxins. ET and aerolysin are similar in that their heptamers are almost exclusively found in DRMs. However, they are different in that only a minor fraction of ProET binds to the outside of DRMs in contrast to proaerolysin, which binds equally to the inside and outside of DRMs (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Proaerolysin is activated by furin recruited outside of DRMs (34Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Buckley J.T. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32656-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and hence binding of proaerolysin to non-DRMs is necessary for it to be activated. On the contrary, ProET must be activated before reaching its target, e.g. by digestive proteases in the intestine orC. perfringens λ-protease at the site of multiplication of the organism. Furthermore, a putative receptor seems to be confined to specific sites, i.e. the DRMs of only a few cell types, in contrast to the aerolysin receptor, which is ubiquitously distributed in GPI-anchored proteins. Thus, ET seems to use the simplest strategy: it completes all steps from binding to pore-formation within the same region. ET and aerolysin also differ in the response of their heptamerization to MbCD treatment. The heptamerization of ET but not of aerolysin is sensitive to MbCD, although the latter is sensitive to saponin, a cholesterol-sequestering agent (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This is not surprising, because abrogation of the receptor function by cholesterol depletion is not always a sure sign that DRMs are associated with signaling (24Edidin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 492-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 35Germain R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35223-35226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and MbCD and another cholesterol-sequestering agent, filipin, exhibit different effects on antigen receptor-mediated signaling in B lymphocytes (36Awasthi-Kalia M. Schnetkamp P.P. Deans J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If MbCD affects cholesterol surrounding and outside of DRMs more preferentially than cholesterol inside of DRMs (9Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), the difference in the MbCD effect between ET and aerolysin may suggest that heptamerization of the two toxins occurs in different environments within DRMs, e.g. ET heptamerizes at the MbCD-sensitive boundary between DRMs and non-DRMs. Whatever the mechanism, these different effects suggest the need for caution in the interpretation of the results of experiments that utilize these drugs. There is no evidence indicating the intracellular location of aerolysin and ET (21Petit L. Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Abrami L. Fivaz M. van der Goot F.G. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 168-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the cytotoxicity of these toxins may involve not only membrane disruption due to pore formation but also other cellular events, especially with low concentrations, e.g.apoptosis (10Fivaz M. Abrami L. Tsitrin Y. van der Goot F.G. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Nelson K.L. Brodsky R.A. Buckley J.T. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and vacuolation of the endoplasmic reticulum (10Fivaz M. Abrami L. Tsitrin Y. van der Goot F.G. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,32Abrami L. Fivaz M. Glauser P.E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) by aerolysin, and mitotic disturbance by ET (39Borrmann E. Gunther H. Kohler H. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 31: 85-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the questions remain as to whether or not these events are linked to the heptamerization of pore-forming toxins in DRMs, and if the answer is yes, how they are linked to each other. The inhibition of ET cytotoxicity and ET heptamerization by MbCD suggests that heptamerization is at least mainly responsible for the cytotoxicity of ET. The present study has provided useful information pertaining not only to the molecular basis of ET cytotoxicity but also to biochemical approaches for identification of an ET receptor, which is a prerequisite for addressing the above questions. It should also be noted that ET is highly toxic, whereas ProET is non-toxic unless proteolytically converted to ET. It preferentially binds to the DRMs of a narrow range of susceptible cells such as renal epithelial and neuronal cells in vivo and MDCK cells in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2125285895,"The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases in mammals contains three members, Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3, that are involved in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by mediating receptor ubiquitination and degradation. More recently, a novel pathway has been identified whereby Cbl promotes internalization of EGF receptor via a CIN85/endophilin pathway that is functionally separable from the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Here we show that Cbl-b, but not Cbl-3, utilize the same mechanism to down-regulate multiple RTKs. CIN85 was shown to bind to the minimal binding domain identified in the carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b. Ligand-induced phosphorylation of Cbl-b further increased their interactions and led to a rapid and sustained recruitment of CIN85 in the complex with EGF or PDGF receptors. Inhibition of binding between CIN85 and Cbl-b was sufficient to impair Cbl-b-mediated internalization of EGF receptors, while being dispensable for Cbl-b-directed polyubiquitination of EGF receptors. Moreover, CIN85 and Cbl/Cbl-b were constitutively associated with activated PDGF, EGF, or c-Kit receptors in several tumor cell lines. Our data reveal a common pathway utilized by Cbl and Cbl-b that may have an important and redundant function in negative regulation of ligand-activated as well as oncogenically activated RTKs in vivo.

Growth-factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) leads to their activation and subsequent down-regulation through a rapid removal from the cell surface. Recruitment of EGF receptors to clathrin-coated pits as well as their sorting in early endosomes and multivesicular bodies requires kinase activity of the receptors, their ubiquitination, and interactions with multiple regulatory components of endocytic machinery (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 3Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of receptors for EGF, PDGF, and CSF-1 is important for targeting these receptors toward the lysosomal degradation pathway (4Levkowitz G.

The mammalian Cbl protein family consists of three members: Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3, all having a highly conserved amino-terminal part composed of a tyrosine kinase-binding module and a ring-finger domain (7Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat.Rev.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). This part of Cbl is able to recruit ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in the complex with activated tyrosine kinase receptors, thus enabling ubiquitination of the receptor molecules (8Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9Joazeiro C.A. Hunter T. Science. 2000; 289: 2061-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the carboxyl termini of Cbl proteins are more diversified. Cbl-3 contains only a short polyproline domain in its carboxyl terminus, whereas Cbl and Cbl-b have long proline-rich domains and additional distal parts containing an acidic box and a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain (10Tsygankov A.Y. Teckchandani A.M. Feshchenko E.A. Swaminathan G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6382-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The distal carboxyl-terminal tails of Cbl and Cbl-b contain several polyproline motifs scattered among tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated in vivo after growth-factor stimulation (11Liu Y.C. Altman A. Cell.Signal. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of multiple signaling proteins containing SH2 and SH3 domains to this part of Cbl is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (10Tsygankov A.Y. Teckchandani A.M. Feshchenko E.A. Swaminathan G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6382-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal interactions are involved in the control of cell type-specific functions of Cbl, such as regulation of glucose uptake, osteoclast activation, and bone remodeling, as well as cell spreading and migration (12Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 13Sanjay A. Houghton A.

Several recent reports have also implicated the carboxyl terminus of Cbl in the control of endocytosis of RTKs. The major mechanism of Cbl recruitment to activated EGF receptors involves binding of the SH2 domain of Cbl to the autophosphorylated tyrosine 1045 of EGF receptor (15Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway recently discovered by using EGFR-Y1045F mutant was showed to employ the Grb2 adaptor protein, which acts as an intermediate between Cbl and the receptor (16Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of SH3 domain-containing protein CIN85 to the distal carboxyl terminus of Cbl was shown to regulate EGF and c-Met receptor endocytosis in mammalian cells (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). CIN85 (Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa) is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein with three SH3 domains at the amino terminus and a proline-rich region and a coiled-coil domain in the carboxyl terminus. This multi-domain protein binds also to the adaptor proteins Grb2, Crk, and p130Cas and can form larger protein complexes after oligomerization mediated by coiled-coil domain (18Watanabe S. Take H. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CIN85 was also cloned as Ruk (regulator of ubiquitous kinase) and SETA (SH3 domain-containing gene expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes) and was shown to regulate cell-survival signaling pathways in neuronal and glial cells (19Gout I. Middleton G. Adu J. Ninkina N.N. Drobot L.B. Filonenko V. Matsuka G. Davies A.M. Waterfield M. Buchman V.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4015-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Chen B.

Here we describe how Cbl-b mediates down-regulation of activated RTKs, a pahway that depends on binding of CIN85 to an unconventional motif in the distal carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b. CIN85/Cbl-b interaction was critical for a rapid and sustained recruitment of CIN85 in the complex with active EGF and PDGF receptors. In addition, CIN85 and Cbl-b were constitutively associated with activated PDGF, EGF, or c-Kit receptors in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), A431 breast cancer, and HMC-1 mastocytoma tumor cell lines, respectively. This indicates that Cbl-b and CIN85 participate both in ligand-dependent down-regulation of RTKs and in internalization of constitutively active RTKs found in tumors. EGF was purchased from Intergen; human recombinant 125I-EGF was from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies recognizing Cbl-b (C-20), phosphotyrosine (PY99), and autophosphorylated EGF receptor (phosphotyrosine 1173) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, mouse anti-HA from Roche, and mouse anti-FLAG M2 and M5 antibodies from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal (RK2) as well as mouse monoclonal (108) anti-EGF receptor antibodies were provided by Joseph Schlessinger. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing caboxyl terminus or phosphotyrosine 1009 of PDGF receptor were provided by Carina Hellberg and Arne Ostman, rabbit polyclonal antibody against c-Kit by Lars Ronnstrand. Details of the rabbit polyclonal sera raised against RING finger of Cbl and Cbl-b (RF) and carboxyl-terminal and 477 peptides of CIN85 were described previously (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Constructs of CIN85 and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin were described previously (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). HA-tagged deletion forms (N1/2 and C2/3) and full size Cbl-b (alternatively spliced form, see Ref. 21Keane M.M. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the long form of Cbl-3 in pCEFL were provided by Stanley Lipkowitz. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of Cbl-b were created by introducing stop codons at the indicated positions. The screening procedure was performed as described in GAL4-based Matchmaker two-hybrid system manual (Clontech), using Y190 yeast clone, pYTH9 GAL4-DNA binding domain vector with full size CIN85 as a bait, and human thymus cDNA library. The yeast retransformation and filter lift assays were performed on selective −Leu −Trp −His agar plates. CHO, NIH3T3, and HeLa cells were purchased form ATCC. CHO cells with stable expression of EGF receptor were provided by Jannie Borst and Annemieke de Melker. DFSP cell line was provided by Tobias Sjoblom and Arne Ostman (22Sjoblom T. Shimizu A. O'Brien K.P. Pietras K. Dal Cin P. Buchdunger E. Dumanski J.P. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5778-5783PubMed Google Scholar). NIH cells with stable expression of EGFR were provided by Pier Paolo De Fiore and mast cell leukemia cell lines HMC-1.1 and 1.2 by Gunnar Nilsson. Expression of EGF receptor in CHO clone was maintained by presence of G480 (2.4 mg/ml) in the culture medium. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. 30 h after transfection, cells were starved for an additional 12 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for the times indicated. Cells were lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates with adjusted protein concentration (Bradford assay, Bio-Rad) were incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-HA, rabbit polyclonal anti-CIN85 (CT), goat polyclonal anti-Cbl-b, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2), rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (RK2), rabbit polyclonal anti-RING Cbl/Cbl-b. Immune complexes were precipitated after a 1-h incubation with protein A agarose beads. After washing in cold lysis buffer, the complexes were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Cells were seeded on collagen-coated cover slips for 20 h, transfected with indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE reagent for 24 h, and starved for an additional 12 h. Cells were left untreated or were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, treated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking for 1 h in 4% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were probed with the primary antibodies (dilution 1:50 or 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% fetal calf serum, for 90 min), and secondary antibodies were conjugated with fluorophores for 60 min. The preparations were mounted using Fluoromount G, and the images were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Ligand internalization assays were performed as described (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) with modifications as described in Ref.1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar. Briefly, cell monolayers of transfected CHO cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 125I-labeled EGF, washed twice with binding buffers, and incubated at 37 °C for the time intervals indicated. Cells were transferred on ice and washed with either cold binding buffer or mild acidic buffer to remove surface-bound radiolabeled EGF. The remaining radioactivity in cells was quantified after cell lysis. Each point was measured in quadruplicate and expressed as a percentage (average + S.D.) of internalizedversus total cell-associated radioactive EGF. HEK293T cells were transfected with cDNA for EGF receptor and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin together with HA-tagged Cbl-b constructs (wild type) and CIN85 constructs: full size, CIN85–3SH3 or CIN85-PCc in FLAG-pcDNA3, as indicated. Cells were treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C (+) and immunoprecipitates of EGFR were blotted with anti-FLAG (M5), and the same membranes were re-probed with anti-EGFR (RK2) antibodies. For each experiment, the levels of transfected Cbl-b and CIN85 constructs were analyzed in cell lysates. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for binding partners of CIN85. Screens of human thymus cDNA library with the full size CIN85 gave rise to 25 double-positive clones, two of which encoded the carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b containing the last 124 amino acids. Yeast clones expressing either three SH3 domains of CIN85 (3SH3), a proline-rich region with coiled-coil domain (PCc), or the full size CIN85 were transformed with the carboxyl-terminal part of Cbl-b, and interactions were checked by the ability of clones to grow on selective agars and by filter-lift assays. As shown in Fig.1 A, the 3SH3 domain, but not PCc domain of CIN85 bound to the carboxyl-terminal part of Cbl-b in yeast cells. Similarly, the three SH3 domains, and not the PCc domain, of CIN85 were sufficient for binding to wild-type Cbl-b expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 B). To further analyze Cbl-b domains required for association with CIN85, we co-transfected FLAG-CIN85 together with constructs of Cbl-b (schematically shown in Fig. 1 E) in HEK293T cells. Full size Cbl-b, Cbl-b without leucine zipper domain (Δ927), or Cbl-b without SH2 domain (C2/3) precipitated equal amounts of FLAG-tagged CIN85, whereas Cbl-b constructs with deletions of the distal carboxyl 90 and 190 amino acids (Δ891 and Δ751) or of the entire carboxyl terminus (N1/2) did not bind to CIN85 (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate a minimal binding domain (containing 36 amino acids; 891–927) present in the distal carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b that is critical for binding to CIN85 in mammalian cells. This part of Cbl-b contains three PXXP motifs, known as consensus binding sites for SH3 domains (23Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). We have mutated the first proline in these PXXP motifs, each separately or all of them together, and showed that neither mutation abrogated binding of CIN85 to Cbl-b (data not shown), suggesting that CIN85 binding to Cbl-b may be mediated by PXXP-independent motifs present in the distal carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b. Because it was previously reported that CIN85 interacts with all Cbl family members including Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3 in an in vitro assay (24Borinstein S.C. Hyatt M.A. Sykes V.W. Straub R.E. Lipkowitz S. Boulter J. Bogler O. Cell.Signal. 2000; 12: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we further tested the ability of Cbl-3 to bind to CIN85 in mammalian cells. Although Cbl and Cbl-b readily co-precipitated CIN85, Cbl-3 failed to interact with CIN85 when co-expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1 D). In addition, Cbl-3 did not associate with CIN85 in glutathione S-transferase binding assays and did not colocalize with CIN85 in transfected NIH-EGFR cells (data not shown). Although showing significant similarities in the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus of Cbl-3 contains only a short proline-rich region and completely lacks the distal part found in Cbl or Cbl-b proteins (25Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together with our previous observations (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), these results indicate that CIN85 binds to the distal C termini of Cbl and Cbl-b, but not to Cbl-3, in mammalian cells. Previous studies showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl increases binding of the SH3 domains of CIN85 (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 26Take H. Watanabe S. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether EGF stimulation that leads to strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl-b affects its interactions with CIN85. HEK293T cells co-expressing EGF receptor, HA-Cbl-b, and FLAG-tagged CIN85 or CIN85–3SH3 constructs were stimulated with EGF, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies. Binding between Cbl-b and CIN85 or CIN85–3SH3 was observed in unstimulated cells, and was significantly increased after EGF stimulation (Fig.2 A). The basal level of the complex formed in unstimulated cells was most likely caused by activation of EGF receptor kinase due to receptor overexpression. We next tested whether growth factor stimulation leads to a complex formation between endogenous CIN85, Cbl-b and EGF or PDGF receptors in several cell lines. EGF- or PDGF-stimulated cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against CIN85 or Cbl-b, and the protein complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. A ligand-inducible complex between endogenous CIN85, Cbl-b, and activated EGF receptor was detected in HeLa and NIH3T3-EGFR cells (Fig. 2 B) and similarly with PDGF receptors in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 C). CIN85 was also found constitutively bound to endophilins (Fig. 2 B, left panel) as previously described (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The complex between CIN85 and activated receptors was detected as early as 5 min and was sustained up to 30 min after PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2 D). This result indicates that CIN85 and Cbl-b are rapidly associated with activated receptors and remain anchored in receptor complexes following the receptor endocytosis in the cell. That observation was further tested by analysis of subcellular localization of endogenous CIN85 and Cbl-b in CHO-EGFR cells. In serum-starved cells, CIN85 and Cbl-b were diffusely distributed in cytoplasm, whereas in EGF-treated cells a significant proportion of Cbl-b and CIN85 were found in endocytic vesicles containing clustered receptors (Fig.3). This is consistent with previous reports showing that Cbl associates with activated EGF receptors at the cell membrane and traffics together with receptor complexes along the endocytic pathway toward lysosome (27de Melker A.A. van Der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that CIN85 and Cbl co-localize with activated EGF receptors in endocytic vesicles of CHO cells (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). To test the functional significance of CIN85 in regulating EGF receptor endocytosis, we used a dominant interfering form of CIN85 containing the three SH3 domains (CIN85-SH3) (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) in ligand internalization assays. Expression of Cbl-b together with EGF receptors led to a significant increase in the rate of EGF internalization when compared with cells transfected with EGF receptor alone (Fig. 4 A). Cbl-b-accelerated internalization of EGF receptors was blocked by expression of CIN85–3SH3 but not by CIN85 (Fig. 4 A). A comparative assay in CHO cells transfected with either of the three members of the Cbl family showed that Cbl and Cbl-b were more potent in inducing EGF receptor internalization than Cbl-3 (Fig. 4 B), which is unable to bind to CIN85 (Fig. 1 D). This was despite the fact that Cbl-3 was expressed to a higher level than the other Cbl proteins (Fig. 4 B, right panel). Interfering properties of CIN85 truncation were further demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies, showing that in cells expressing CIN85–3SH3, the formation of receptor-containing vesicles upon EGF stimulation was inhibited (Fig. 4 C, left panel). Expression of wild-type CIN85 did not lead to inhibition of EGF receptor endocytosis (Fig. 4 C, right panel). Interestingly, we have observed that overexpression of CIN85 caused formation of multiple cytoplasmic vesicles that also contained endogenous Cbl-b and Cbl, which further indicates the importance of CIN85 in regulation of the endocytic pathway (Fig. 4 C, data not shown, and Ref. 18Watanabe S. Take H. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similar observations were also reported for CMS, CIN85-related adaptor protein, which is involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton via its PCc domain (28Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Shishido T. Langdon W.Y. Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4957-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Hrs, a protein with coiled-coil and proline-rich domains, which is found in early endosomes and is involved in EGF receptor down-regulation (29Chin L.S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H.Q. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitination of receptors was implicated as a signal for internalization (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), we tested whether CIN85 binding to Cbl-b could influence Cbl-b-mediated EGF receptor ubiquitination. Data from transient expression in HEK293T cells showed that activated EGF receptors are ubiquitinated by Cbl-b to the same extent in the absence and in the presence of CIN85 or interfering forms of CIN85 (Fig.4 D, left panel). Moreover, Cbl-b N1/2, which associates with receptor through SH2 domain but is unable to bind to CIN85 (Fig. 1 C), facilitated ubiquitination of EGF receptors to similar level as wild-type Cbl-b (Fig. 4 D, right panel). Taken together, these results suggested that CIN85 binding to Cbl-b is important for EGF receptor internalization, although it has no effect on Cbl-b-induced receptor ubiquitination. Similarly, cells expressing mutated dynamin K44A showed impaired EGF receptor internalization, whereas EGF receptor poly-ubiquitination was intact (30Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13940-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PDGF and EGF receptors are expressed in many human tumors, and constitutive activation of their tyrosine kinase domains was shown to contribute to tumor development. For example, autocrine secretion of PDGF is critical for constitutive activation of PDGF receptors in cells isolated from several DFSP patients (22Sjoblom T. Shimizu A. O'Brien K.P. Pietras K. Dal Cin P. Buchdunger E. Dumanski J.P. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5778-5783PubMed Google Scholar), whereas high overexpression of EGF receptors in breast cancer cell line A431 leads to permanently active receptors and thus contributes to oncogenic transformation (31Reiss M. Stash E.B. Vellucci V.F. Zhou Z.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6254-6262PubMed Google Scholar). In these cell lines, CIN85 and Cbl-b readily co-precipitated PDGF or EGF receptors, and their interactions were only minimally up-regulated by the addition of EGF or PDGF to the medium (Fig. 5,A and B), indicating that CIN85 and Cbl-b constitutively associate with activated PDGF and EGF receptors in human tumor cell lines. Additionally, Cbl-b and CIN85 were co-localized with PDGF receptors in endocytic vesicles of DFSP cells without external addition of PDGF (data not shown). Gain-of-function point mutations of the c-Kit gene, which encodes a receptor for stem cell factor have been isolated from mast cell tumors and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. A c-Kit mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (D816V) is commonly found in human mastocytomas, whereas a mutation in the juxtamembrane domain (V560G) is associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (32Ma Y.

Blood. 1999; 93: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether CIN85 and Cbl proteins interact with mutant c-Kit receptors found in the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC-1.1, expressing the V560G mutant, and HMC-1.2, expressing c-Kit receptor with both V560G and D816V mutations. As shown in Fig. 5 C, CIN85 and Cbl/Cbl-b were found in the constitutive complexes with oncogenic forms of c-Kit expressed in these cells with only slight increase of complex formation after stimulation with stem cell factor. This suggests that CIN85 together with Cbl/Cbl-b are associated with oncogenic RTKs and could thus play an important role in receptor down-regulation in transformed cells. Dynamic protein interactions and formation of RTK-associated complexes are involved in regulation of multiple steps during receptor internalization and endosomal sorting for recycling or degradation (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,35Oksvold M.P. Skarpen E. Wierod L. Paulsen R.E. Huitfeldt H.S. Eur.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cbl proteins play a critical role in these processes, by acting as scaffolding molecules and ubiquitin ligases that remain associated with active receptors throughout the endocytic compartments (27de Melker A.A. van Der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate an important role for the adaptor protein CIN85 in mediating Cbl-b-induced down-regulation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (Fig. 6). After ligand binding, RTKs become tyrosine-phosphorylated and bind to and phosphorylate Cbl-b, which in turn directs ubiquitination of activated receptors (36Ettenberg S.A. Rubinstein Y.R. Banerjee P. Nau M.M. Keane M.M. Lipkowitz S. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res.Commun. 1999; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Ettenberg S.A. Magnifico A. Cuello M. Nau M.M. Rubinstein Y.R. Yarden Y. Weissman A.M. Lipkowitz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27677-27684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Cbl-b can also recruit CIN85/endophilin complexes in the vicinity of internalizing receptors (Fig. 2 B), whereby endophilins may control clathrin-coated vesicle formation during RTK endocytosis (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cbl-b appears to promote receptor down-regulation via two mechanisms, one dependent on the amino-terminal part of Cbl-b that facilitates receptor ubiquitination, and the other mediated by the carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b that is responsible for binding to CIN85. Receptor ubiquitination is essential for both receptor internalization as well as receptor sorting for lysosomal destruction (30Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13940-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 38Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and all members of the Cbl family (Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3) were shown to bind to and ubiquitinate activated EGF receptors (15Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the CIN85-dependent pathway is essential for receptor internalization, although its function is not directly involved in the control of receptor ubiquitination (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). The importance of this pathway has been demonstrated in the down-regulation of EGF and HGF receptors (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the CIN85 pathway is specific for Cbl and Cbl-b proteins, but not Cbl-3 (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these data suggest a common CIN85-dependent mechanism by which Cbl and Cbl-b negatively regulate RTKs. Indeed, the functional redundancy for Cbl and Cbl-b is indicated by embryonic lethality of double Cbl−/−Cbl-b−/− mice (39Liu Y.C. Gu H. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 140-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas mice deficient for either Cbl or Cbl-b are viable and show defects in distinct populations of T cells (40Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I. Kong Y.Y. Sasaki T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Itie A., Le, J. Ohashi P.S. Sarosi I. Nishina H. Lipkowitz S. Penninger J.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, CIN85 and Cbl/Cbl-b are associated with constitutively active EGF, PDGF, and c-Kit receptors in several tumor cell lines, indicating that this mechanism is also involved in down-regulation of oncogenically activated receptor tyrosine kinases (Fig. 5 and 6). The complex formation seems to depend on receptor kinase activity, and all tumor cell lines used express constitutively active, phosphorylated forms of receptors (Fig. 5 A) (22Sjoblom T. Shimizu A. O'Brien K.P. Pietras K. Dal Cin P. Buchdunger E. Dumanski J.P. Ostman A. Heldin C.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5778-5783PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ma Y. Zeng S. Metcalfe D.D. Akin C. Dimitrijevic S.

Cancer Surv. 1985; 4: 767-788PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperactivation of RTKs can result from autocrine production of a ligand, overexpression of receptors, or the presence of constitutively active receptor mutants. We addressed these three mechanisms in the respective cell models: dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, carcinoma A431, and mastocytoma HMC-1.1 and 1.2, and in all cases we found constitutively present receptor-Cbl/Cbl-b-CIN85 complexes (Fig. 5). Whereas in normal cells the signal triggered by ligand-activated RTKs is terminated via Cbl/CIN85-dependent degradation (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), receptors in malignant cells seem to escape down-regulatory mechanisms despite their association with Cbl/Cbl-b and CIN85 and co-localization in endocytic pathways (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Possible mechanisms for this effect may include enhanced receptor recycling, increased synthesis of new active receptors and saturation of endogenous endocytic machinery, which all contribute to the increase in oncogenic potential (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 43Xue L. Lucocq J. Cell.Signal. 1998; 10: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Sorkin A. Kornilova E. Teslenko L. Sorokin A. Nikolsky N. Biochim.Biophys.Acta. 1989; 1011: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is also possible that a proportion of oncogenic receptors is re-localized to intracellular membrane pools from the plasma membrane and so becomes inaccessible for binding of negative regulators. Interestingly, therapeutic treatment of tumors is able to shift that equilibrium by enhancing the degradative path. Cbl was recently shown to mediate the tumor-suppressing effects of anti-ErbB-2 antibodies following receptor crosslinking at the plasma membrane and more efficient receptor degradation (45Klapper L.N. Waterman H. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3384-3388PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between CIN85 and Cbl/Cbl-b is based on binding of the SH3 domains of CIN85 to distal carboxyl termini of Cbl/Cbl-b. There are two interesting features in the nature of this interaction. First, high affinity binding to Cbl requires multiple SH3 domains of CIN85 (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), and second, their association is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl/Cbl-b (Fig. 2; Ref. 1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The association between CIN85 and the carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b in yeast cells is present even without detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). However, in mammalian cells the complex formation between endogenous Cbl-b and CIN85 is highly increased upon ligand-induced phosphorylation of Cbl-b (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with these data, CIN85 homologous adaptor protein CMS was shown to bind to the distal proline-rich region of Cbl in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (28Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Shishido T. Langdon W.Y. Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4957-4963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It appears that phosphorylation of Cbl/Cbl-b is not directly involved in binding to CIN85 or CMS, but has a regulatory role that promotes conformational change in the carboxyl terminus of Cbl and thus allows CIN85/CMS to bind with higher affinity to polyproline motifs in the distal tail of Cbl proteins. Taken together, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl/Cbl-b may control specificity and avidity of SH3 domain-containing proteins and thus regulate the dynamics of their interactions. In addition, we identified a minimal binding domain encompassing amino acids 891–927 in the distal carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b that is necessary for efficient binding of CIN85 (Fig.1 C). This CIN85-binding region seems to be particularly conserved between Cbl and Cbl-b, and significant homology is absent in Cbl-3 sequence. Interestingly, CIN85 binding to Cbl-b appears to be mediated via PXXP-independent motifs, since mutation of all PXXP sequences present in the minimal binding domain of the carboxyl terminus of Cbl-b did not abrogate CIN85 binding. Recent reports have provided evidence for a general mechanism that employs CIN85/endophilin complexes and Cbl/Cbl-b proteins in internalization of numerous tyrosine kinase receptors (1Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 17Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which CIN85/Cbl and CIN85/Cbl-b complexes control subsequent steps of RTKs endocytosis remain unknown. An additional interesting feature of both Cbl and CIN85 is that they can oligomerize via their leucine zipper or coiled-coil domains, respectively (18Watanabe S. Take H. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 46Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is possible that an increase in local concentrations of CIN85-Cbl/Cbl-b around internalized RTKs provides spatial coordination for interactions with multiple endocytic proteins. These interactions could in turn control endosomal sorting and targeting of activated RTKs for lysosomal degradation. Taken together our findings suggest that Cbl/Cbl-b and CIN85 play redundant roles in regulating multiple steps in down-regulation of activated tyrosine kinase receptors. Note Added in Proof Recent findings by Haglund et al. (Haglund, K., Shimokawa, N., Szymkiewicz, I., and Dikic, I. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99,12191–12196) have demonstrated that ligand-induced binding of CIN85 to Cbl-b is important for Cbl-b-mediated monoubiquitination of CIN85 and their degradation together with EGF receptors in the lysosome.

Small Hsps have 12- to 42-kDa subunit sizes and have sequences that are conserved among all organisms. The recently determined crystal structure of Hsp16.5 indicates that it consists discretely of 24 identical subunits. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that at temperatures above 60 °C, the subunits of MjHsp16.5 freely and reversibly exchange with a rate constant of exchange at 68 °C of 0.067min−1. The subunit exchange reactions were strongly temperature-dependent, similar to the exchange reactions of the α-crystallins. The exchange reaction was specific to MjHsp16.5 subunits, as other sHsps such as α-crystallin were not structurally compatible and could not integrate into the MjHsp16.5 oligomer. In addition, we demonstrate that at temperatures as high as 70 °C, MjHsp16.5 retains its multimeric structure and subunit organization. Using insulin and α-lactalbumin as model target proteins, we also show that MjHsp16.5 at 37 °C is a markedly inefficient chaperone compared with other sHsps with these substrates.

Leigh J.A. Mayer F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 136: 254-261Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). sHsps are ubiquitous among all organisms, have subunit sizes that range from 12 to 42 kDa, and show homology in amino acid sequence (2de Jong W.W. Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Most of the conservation between sHsps exists in a region known as the α-crystallin domain (2de Jong W.W. Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar); this is a stretch of 80–100 amino acids generally located in the C-terminal part of the sequence. A number of studies have identified this domain to be important for subunit-subunit interactions that lead to the assembly of building blocks of oligomeric structure (3Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Koteiche H.A. Berengian A.R. Mchaourab H.S.

Many sHsps exist as high molecular weight assemblies that have dynamic and variable quaternary structures with subunits that can freely and rapidly exchange between oligomers (6Haley D.A. Bova M.P.

Current evidence suggests that the quaternary structure of mammalian sHsps has smaller multimers that exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the larger oligomeric assembly (9Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S.

Although many sHsps have variable quaternary structures, Hsp16.5 is monodisperse consisting of exactly 24 subunits with a molecular mass of 400 kDa (12Kim R. Kim K.K. Yokota Y. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9129-9133Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the subunit exchange properties of MjHsp16.5 and its multimeric structure at higher temperatures have not been investigated. The crystal structure of Hsp16.5 has been determined and reveals 24 subunits arranged in octahedral symmetry forming a hollow spherical assembly with small openings (13Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The monomer folds into a β-sandwich or immunoglobulin fold with one strand, referred to as β-6, contacting a neighboring subunit at the dimer interfaces. A similar but not identical folding pattern has been shown for the α-crystallin domain in αA-crystallin (14Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of Hsp16.9 from wheat was obtained at 2.7-Å resolution where its α-crystallin domains and flanking extensions assemble into a dodecameric double disk (15Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha A. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The dodecamer of Hsp16.9 consists of two disks, each comprising six α-crystallin domains organized into a trimer of dimers (15Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha A. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Although wheat Hsp16.9 and MjHsp16.5 from the hyperthermophile M. jannaschii are distantly related from an evolutionary standpoint, as well as in amino acid sequence (23%), their α-crystallin domains are similar, and both use a dimer as the fundamental unit of oligomeric assembly (15Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha A. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). However, despite the similarities in their α-crystallin domains, the quaternary structures of MjHsp16.5 and Hsp16.9, as well as the mammalian sHsps are different. This difference in oligomeric assembly may be encoded in the N-terminal domains of sHsps (16Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); alternatively, it has been hypothesized to result from different orientations of their respective C-terminal extensions caused by a hinge between β-strands 9 and 10 in their α-crystallin domains (15Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha A. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Many sHsps have been shown to function in a chaperone-like manner (17Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 18Jakob U.

In the crowded molecular environment of the cell, aggregation of proteins will lead to impaired function and ultimately cell death. sHsps have been shown to bind unfolding proteins without the hydrolysis of ATP and are remarkably efficient in terms of ratio of chaperone subunit to bound substrate. It has been suggested that sHsps serve as a storage depot for unfolded proteins, which can then be completely refolded in the presence of other chaperones (21Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). A number of protein folding diseases such as desmin-related myopathies and cataracts have been shown to result from specific point mutations in sHsps (22Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P., Li, Z.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5198-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this report, we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer, circular dichroism, and size exclusion chromatography with online multi-angle light scattering, absorbance, and refractive index detectors to characterize the subunit exchange properties and oligomeric structure of MjHsp16.5 at various temperatures. In addition, we also investigate the chaperone-like properties of MjHsp16.5 using a variety of substrates over a wide temperature range. The results in this paper illustrate the importance of monitoring the function of MjHsp16.5 at temperatures that are physiologically relevant to M. jannaschii. Bovine insulin and α-lactalbumin were obtained from Sigma. Lucifer yellow iodoacetamide (LYI) and 4-acetamido-4′-((iodoacetyl) amino) stilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid (AIAS) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. The wild-type MjHsp16.5 clone in the pET 20b+ vector was a generous gift of Dr. Hassane Mchaourab, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. E. coli strain BL21DE3 was purchased from Novagen. Tear lipocalin was a generous gift of Dr. Ben Glasgow. Complete protease inhibitor tablets were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Wild-type Hsp16.5 in the pET 20b+ vector was transformed into E. coli strain BL21DE3. Bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside when the culture reached an optical density between 0.6 and 1. Bacterial cells were grown for 3 h after induction and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g. Cells were resuspended in 20 mmTris buffer, pH 7.9 containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm EDTA and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min to create particulate and soluble fractions. It was determined that Hsp 16.5 was expressed predominately in the soluble fractions. One protease inhibitor mixture table tablet was added to every 30 ml of soluble lysate, which was then stored on ice until further processing. The soluble lysate was applied to an Amersham Biosciences Mono-Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.2 containing 100 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Relevant fractions were collected, pooled, concentrated, and adjusted to pH 7.0 with 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. These concentrated fractions were then applied to an AmershamBiosciences Phenyl Sepharose HP column (1 ml bed volume) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 1m ammonium sulfate. Protein was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 1–0.1 m ammonium sulfate in the same buffer. MjHsp16.5 containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to an Amersham Biosciences Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 100 mm NaCl. These procedures yielded pure MjHsp16.5 as assayed by SDS-PAGE. αB-Crystallin was purified as previously described (26Horwitz J. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 290: 365-383Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All near and far UV CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter interfaced with a Lauda water circulator. Far UV CD measurements were performed using a cell with a 0.2-mm path length, whereas the near UV CD cuvette had a path length of 1 cm. MjHsp16.5 was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.9 containing 100 mm NaCl. Solid LYI or AIAS was added to the solution to final concentrations of 8.5 and 3.2 mm respectively. The reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature in the dark for 12 h. Subsequently, AIAS- and LYI-containing solutions were heated at 37 °C for 3 and 5 h, respectively. Covalently bound probe was separated from free, unreacted probe using gel filtration with a Sephadex G-25 column. Fluorescent-labeled Hsp16.5 was electrophoresed on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and imaged using an AlphaImager 2000 (AlphaInnotech). To initiate the subunit exchange reaction, 30 μm concentrations of AIAS- and LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 were mixed together in a reaction tube at 68 °C unless otherwise noted. At the time points indicated in the figures, a 20-μl aliquot was taken from the reaction mixture and diluted 1:100 with room-temperature phosphate-buffered saline to quench the reaction. Because subunit exchange does not take place at temperature below 50 °C, upon dilution of the sample to room temperature the subunits that were exchanged are now “frozen.” The sample was subsequently excited at 335 nm in a 1-cm square cuvette, and the fluorescence emission spectra were taken from 360–600 nm at room temperature. It should be emphasized that the subunit exchange reactions occur at 68 °C or higher. However, the fluorescence emission spectra are recorded at room temperature. The emission intensity at 412 nm was recorded and plotted. The normalized donor fluorescence intensity as a function of time, F(t), was fit to the equation F(t) = C1 + C2e−kt. The constants C1 and C2 were determined by the conditions that C1 + C2 = 1 at F(0) and F(infinity) = C1. The rate constant k of the subunit exchange reaction was determined using the BMDP statistical package. All fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Spex Fluorolog Fluorometer model FL3–11, interfaced with an Isotemp 1016S water circulator. To find the native molecular weight of MjHsp16.5 at various temperatures, size-exclusion chromatography with online light scattering, absorbance, and refractive index detectors were used (27Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 28Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 29Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, size-exclusion chromatography was carried out with a Pharmacia Bios FPLC system using Bio-Sil SEC 400–5 (300 × 7.8 mm) column with a Bio-Sil 400 guard column (80 × 7.8m). The columns were mounted in an Eppendorf CH500 column heater. The column was connected in line with 1) uv detector Pharmacia LKB UV-M-11, 2) multi-angle laser light scattering detector Down-EOS (Wyatt-Technology, Santa Barbara CA), 3) refractive index detector, Optilab-DSP (Wyatt-Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). Both the light-scattering detector and the refractive-index detector have a Peltier heating/cooling system for controlling and obtaining the desired temperature. These were assayed as previously described (26Horwitz J. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 290: 365-383Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Bovine insulin and α-lactalbumin were unfolded with 20 mm DTT at 37 °C. This resulted in the aggregation of the B-chain of insulin, and α-lactalbumin that was monitored by measuring the apparent absorption due to to light scattering in a spectrophotometer. MjHsp16.5 or αB-crystallin was added to the various target proteins at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Protein concentrations of MjHsp16.5 and αB-crystallin were determined from their absorption spectra using their published extinction coefficients at 280 nm, which are E 0.1%280 = 0.565 for MjHsp16.5 (30Kim K.K. Yokota H. Santoso S. Lerner D. Kim R. Kim S.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and 19,000m−1cm−1 for αB-crystallin (26Horwitz J. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 290: 365-383Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A specific refractive index increment value of 0.186 ml/g was used (28Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The concentrations of fluorophore were determined from their absorption spectrum using extinction coefficients of 11,000m−1cm−1 at 425 nm for LYI and 39,000 m−1cm−1 at 335 nm for AIAS. In addition, to calculate the stoichiometry of fluorescent probe bound to MjHsp16.5, we have used extinction coefficients at 280 nm for AIAS of 11,000 m−1cm−1 and 25,080m−1cm−1 for LYI. There was little difference in the far UV spectra of MjHsp16.5 taken at 25 °C, 37 °C, or 70 °C (Fig.1 A). The far UV spectra of MjHsp16.5 had a pronounced minimum at 217 nm, characteristic of β-sheet-containing protein and consistent with what is known from the crystal structure of MjHsp16.5. The near UV CD spectra of MjHsp16.5 is shown in Fig. 1 B. The vibronic transition at 295 nm arises from the single tryptophan residue, whereas the bands at 285 and 275 nm reflect contributions from both the tryptophan residue and the two tyrosine-residue side chains. The fact that the near UV spectra at 25 °C and 70 °C are very similar indicates that the environment of aromatic amino acids did not change. Taken together, the CD data imply that both the secondary and tertiary structure did not change in this temperature range. It has recently been shown that increase in temperature can lead to changes in the oligomeric state of several sHsps (15Van Montfort R.L.M. Basha A. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 31Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Because conventional methods for estimating molecular weight such as standard gel filtration, and ultracentrifugation cannot be easily performed at temperatures above 50 °C, we used size-exclusion chromatography with online multi-angle laser light scattering, absorbance, and refractive index detectors to characterize the oligomeric structure of MjHsp16.5 at various temperatures. The advantage of this system is that the molecular mass determination is independent of the elution volume, the shape of the macromolecule, or the possible interaction between the column matrix and the protein (27Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 28Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 29Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the molar mass distribution of MjHsp16.5, which is being eluted from the column at 25 °C and 70 °C. The average molecular mass at the peak at 25 °C is 403 kDa, whereas at 70 °C the average molecular mass was found to be 397 kDa. The average molecular mass at the peak at 25 °C of three separate experiments yielded a value of 400 kDa. At 70 °C, the average molecular mass of three separate experiments was 397 kDa. The predicted molecular weight from the protein sequence is 394,848. It should be noted that with this system, the molecular mass is continuously being determined on small volumes (16 μl) as the sample is being eluted from the column. As seen in Fig. 2, the molecular mass does not change very much across the peak implying that MjHsp16.5 is relatively homogeneous. The data presented in Fig. 2unequivocally proves that at 70 °C, the majority of MjHsp16.5 still retains its native oligomeric state of comprising 24 subunits. As shown in Fig. 2, at 70 °C MjHsp16.5 eludes faster than at 25 °C. However, in this system, the molecular mass determinations are independent of the column properties. It has recently been shown using fluorescence resonance energy transfer that the mammalian sHsps have a dynamic structure best characterized by a rapid exchange of subunits between oligomers at physiological temperatures. The homology between MjHsp16.5 and the mammalian sHsps exists only in the α-crystallin domain, and in that region the homology is only 20%. We wanted to determine whether the subunits of MjHsp16.5 also exchange between oligomers. Therefore, we have labeled one population of MjHsp16.5 with AIAS that will serve as the donor, and another population of MjHsp16.5 with LYI the acceptor. These two probes have been previously characterized and used to monitor exchange of αA-crystallin subunits. The stoichiometry of labeling was found to be 1 mole of LYI and 0.9 mole of AIAS labeled per subunit of MjHsp16.5. It should be emphasized that the stoichiometry of labeling of the fluorophore to MjHsp16.5 most likely represents a statistical distribution of fluorophore per subunit, because wild-type MjHsp16.5 does not contain a cysteine. It is well documented that iodoacetamides at higher pH will label amines and methionine residues as well as tyrosine (32Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar). To ensure that the fluorescent probe associated with MjHsp16.5 was covalently bound, we denatured fluorescent-labeled MjHsp16.5 in 5% SDS with heating at 45 °C for 20 min and ran the sample on a gel filtration column equilibrated in 8 m urea. We observed that 98% of the fluorescence co-eluted with protein-containing fractions (data not shown). Because the subunit exchange takes place at temperatures above 50 °C but the actual fluorescence measurements are taken at room temperature where the subunit exchange is arrested, it is important to determine that at the higher temperatures the fluorescent probes are not chemically modified. Fig. 3, A and Bshow fluorescence emission spectra of AIAS- and LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 that has been pre-heated at temperatures and times indicated in the figure legend. AIAS-labeled MjHsp16.5 excited at 335 nm had a fluorescence emission maximum at 412 nm whereas LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 excited at 425 nm had an emission maximum at 515 nm. Pre-heating the AIAS-labeled Hsp16.5 at 72 °C for up to 60 min did not change the fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3 A). Pre-heating LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 at higher temperatures led to a small but reproducible increase in fluorescence emission (Fig. 3 B). These experiments indicate that heat alone will not result in marked changes in the fluorescence signal of either fluorophore when attached to MjHsp16.5. In addition, after heating LYI-labeled MJHsp16.5 at 68 °C for 90 min, the sample was electrophoresed on a 12.5% acrylamide denaturing gel. This experiment showed that the label migrated with the protein. Thus, heating did not break the covalent linkage of fluorophore to MjHsp16.5 to any major extent. Similar results were observed with heat-treated AIAS-labeled MjHsp16.5 (data not shown.) The subunit exchange reaction was initiated by mixing an equimolar concentration of the donor, AIAS-labeled Hsp16.5, with the acceptor, LYI-labeled Hsp16.5. If MjHsp16.5 has a static structure at 68 °C, then we will not observe a change in the fluorescence emission spectrum over time. At 10 min into the reaction, we observed a significant amount of quenching of donor fluorescence with a concomitant increase in acceptor fluorescence, consistent with an exchange of subunits between oligomers (Fig. 4 A). The quenching of donor fluorescence continued until the 90 min time point, after which we did not observe a change in fluorescence emission spectra. The donor fluorescence intensity at 412 nm is plotted versus time in Fig. 4 B. Using the BMDP statistical program, the quenching of donor fluorescence was fit to the single exponential function F(t) = C1 + C2e−kt where the rate constantk for subunit exchange was determined to be 0.067min−1 (Fig. 4 B). To unequivocally determine that the quenching of donor fluorescence and concomitant rise in acceptor fluorescence is caused only by an exchange of subunits between oligomers, which brings the donor the acceptor fluorophores close to each other, we performed an additional control. We mixed unreacted free AIAS with LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 at equimolar concentration at 68 °C. At various time points, an aliquot was taken from the reaction tube and the fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded. We did not observe changes in the spectra over a 60-min time period (data not shown). This result indicates that the energy transfer that we are observing in the subunit exchange reaction is not caused by minute amounts of free donor or acceptor fluorophores that may be moving between oligomers. To determine whether the subunit exchange reaction is reversible, we mixed 30 μmconcentrations of AIAS-labeled MjHsp16.5 and LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 at 68 °C for 90 min. At this point, the subunits are completely mixed and scrambled. Subsequently, a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled MjHsp16.5 was added to fluorescent-mixed MjHsp16.5 at 68 °C. At various time points, an aliquot was taken from the reaction tube and the fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded. As expected, at time 0 we observe the maximal amount of quenching of donor fluorescence and concomitant maximal amount of acceptor fluorescence. With time, as the unlabeled MjHsp16.5 subunits are integrating into the fluorescent-mixed MjHsp16.5 oligomers, the distance between the donor and acceptor labeled subunits increase. This leads to an increase in donor fluorescence with a loss of acceptor fluorescence. The data obtained is on concordance with Fig. 4 A (data not shown). This result proves that the subunit exchange reaction of MjHsp16.5 is reversible. In order to determine whether the reversibility of subunit exchange is specific to MjHsp16.5 subunits, we have added tear lipocalin at a 5-fold molar excess to fluorescent-mixed MjHsp16.5 subunits at 68 °C. Tear lipocalin is structurally unrelated to MjHsp16.5, and is thermally stable at 68 °C, 2O. Gassymov, O., A. R. Aabduragimov, T. Yusifov, and B. Glasgow, personal communication. and should not integrate into the fluorescent-mixed MjHsp16.5 oligomer. We found that the addition of tear lipocalin did not markedly change the emission spectrum of the fluorescent-mixed MjHsp16.5 over a 90 min time frame (data not shown) indicating that the reversibility of the reaction is specific to MjHsp16.5. To determine the effect of temperature on the subunit-exchange reaction of MjHsp16.5, we performed the exchange reaction over a wide range of temperatures (Fig. 5). At 50 °C, there was no change in donor fluorescence over a 4-h time period, suggesting that Hsp16.5 has a static structure at this temperature with no exchange of subunits. At 65 °C, the reaction was complete in 5 h, with k = 0.025min−1 whereas at 68 °C, the reaction was complete in 90 min with a half-life of 10.9 min. Increasing the temperature to 72 °C dramatically increased the rate of the reaction. At 72 °C, the rate constant of subunit exchange was 0.36min−1 with the reaction having a half-life of 1.9 min. We plotted ln(k) versus the reciprocal of temperature in the form of an Arrhenius activation energy plot. From the slope of the line, we determined the activation energy for the subunit exchange reaction of MjHsp16.5 subunits to be 84 kcal/mole (data not shown). In a separate set of experiments, we examined the effects of concentration on the rate of subunit exchange by measuring the decrease in AIAS emission intensity at 412 nm 6 min after mixing at 68 °C different concentrations of AIAS-labeled and LYI-labeled MjHsp16.5 subunits. The concentrations used were 5, 30, and 300 μm MjHsp16.5. The rate of subunit exchange at 30 μm and 300 μm were similar. At the lowest concentrations measured (5 μm), the rate of s"

It is not known, however, whether any signals actually originate from caveolae in living cells. To address this question, we have engineered the calcium sensor yellow cameleon so that it is targeted either to the plasma membrane, caveolae, or the cytoplasm of endothelial cells. Quantitative measurements of the three Ca2+ pools detected by these probes indicate that caveolae are preferred sites of Ca2+ entry when Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum are depleted. These results suggest that the signaling machinery in control of Ca2+ entry is functionally organized in the caveolae of living cells.

Early studies on their function in endothelial cells suggested that caveolae sequester blood borne molecules and carry them across the cell to the tissue space (reviewed in Ref. 1Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). An endocytic function was further indicated by the discovery that receptor-mediated potocytosis (2Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) relies on caveolae to carry folic acid to the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Opportunistic pathogens also enter cells through caveolae. For example, caveolae internalize SV40 virus and deliver it to the ER1 (3Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). They also are involved in a novel type of phagocytosis where FimH-expressing bacteria are delivered to a unique endocytic compartment that lacks the enzymatic machinery to kill the bacteria (4Shin J.S. Gao Z. Abraham S.N. Science. 2000; 289: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, caveolae appear to be a multifunctional vehicle for an endocytic pathway that is structurally and functionally separate from coated pits (1Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). A breakthrough in caveolae research was the discovery of a marker protein called caveolin-1 (5Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 appears to be a component of the striated coat material often found on the cytoplasmic surface of invaginated and non-invaginated caveolae. This marker has been used to develop isolation protocols that provided the first clues about the molecular composition of this membrane domain. These techniques indicate that caveolae are enriched in a variety of signal transducing molecules (6Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A., Tu, Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 7Chang W.-J. Ying Y.-S. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A., De Gunzburg J. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), which suggests that caveolae are important for the temporal and spatial control of signal transduction at the cell surface (8Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that isolated caveolae contain complex sets of functionally organized signaling molecules capable of producing a signal when stimulated in vitro (9Liu P. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Liu P. German Z. Sherman T.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Anderson R.G. Shaul P.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: E44-E52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The limitation of these in vitro experiments, however, is that they cannot determine if signal transduction from caveolae actually occurs in living cells. One way to address this problem is to place a sensing device in caveolae that measures quantitatively the activity of a specific signaling pathway and determine directly if that pathway originates from caveolae membranes. A signaling activity that might be a good test of this strategy is regulated Ca2+ entry (11Isshiki M. Anderson R.G. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Several molecules involved in Ca2+ translocation have been localized to caveolae, including an IP3 receptor-like protein (12Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Finally, EM studies suggest Ca2+ is concentrated in caveolae (17Sugi H. Suzuki S. Daimon T. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1982; 60: 576-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki S. Sugi H. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 257: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), caveolae are often found in close association with the ER, and Ca2+influx through caveolae may trigger Ca2+ sparks (19Lohn M. Furstenau M. Sagach V. Elger M. Schulze W. Luft F.C. Haller H. Gollasch M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have designed an experimental strategy to determine if caveolae might be involved in regulating Ca2+ entry in living cells using the Ca2+-sensing probe yellow cameleon (YC) (20Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). We engineered this probe to target YC either to caveolae, the bulk plasma membrane or the cytoplasm. ER Ca2+ was depleted with ATP and thapsigargin to stimulate entry of extracellular Ca2+. The yellow cameleon sensors indicate that under these conditions caveolae are the preferred sites of Ca2+ entry. Furthermore, the Ca2+ that enters through this portal is coupled to the activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), a resident protein of caveolae. The results suggest that signal transduction from caveolae occurs in living cells and that caveolae may be a compartment involved in regulating store-operated calcium entry.

Endothelial cells (EC) were isolated from the descending thoracic aorta of a bovine fetus by brief collagenase digestion of the intimal lining. Cells were grown in M199 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 20%(v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 50 IU/ml of penicillin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged before reaching confluence. In all experiments we used subconfluent ECs no older than passage 10. Yellow cameleon 3.1 (YC3.1) inserted in pcDNA3 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Miyawaki and Dr. R. Y. Tsien. Yellow cameleons are genetically engineered Ca2+ indicating proteins that are tandem fusions of the enhanced cyan-emitting mutant of the green fluorescent protein (ECFP), calmodulin, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13, and the enhanced yellow-emitting mutant of the GFP (EYFP). The EYFP contains the amino acid substitutions V68L and Q69K, which reduces the pH sensitivity of the acceptor EYFP. The sensitivity of yellow cameleons can be tuned by introducing mutations in the Ca2+ binding domains of calmodulin. YC3.1 is a relatively insensitive version of yellow cameleon that has the amino acid substitution, E104Q. We made the substitution Q104E to convert YC3.1 to YC2.1, which increases the Ca2+ affinity (K d ∼0.2 μm Ca2+) (21Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1α cDNA was engineered with HindIII sites at both ends and subcloned into the HindIII site of YC2.1-pcDNA3, which is 18 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon for YC2.1. The resulting caveolin-1-YC2.1 chimera was confirmed by sequencing. Neuromodulin-YC (NYC) was generated using forward (5′-AGCT TATGCTGTGCTGTATGAGAAGAACCAAACAGGTTGAAAAGAATGATGAGGACCAAAAGATCA-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCTTGATCTTTTGGTCCTCATCAT TCTTTTCAACCTGTTTGGTTCTTCTCATACAGCACAGCATA-3′) oligonucleotides that code for the N-terminal 20 amino acids of neuromodulin plusHindIII sites at both ends. The annealed products were inserted into the HindIII site of the pcDNA3-YC2.1 and sequenced. Subconfluent endothelial cells were transiently transfected with the indicated cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). One day after transfection, the cells were transferred to 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (Mat Tek Corp, Ashland, MA) and grown for 2 days before use. FRET measurements were performed using a Leica confocal microscopy system equipped with argon laser and an acousto-optic tunable filter (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). This filter consists of a transparent, optical crystal with an ultrasonic wave field and can be tuned to emit 458 nm for excitation of CFP. In the absence of Ca2+, the yellow cameleon has an extended conformation and excitation of CFP at 458 nm causes peak emission of CFP at 480 nm without energy transfer to YFP. The binding of Ca2+ causes folding of the yellow cameleon, bringing the CFP and YFP in juxtaposition and allowing energy transfer from CFP to YFP. As a result, the emission shifts from 480 to 530 nm as a function of increasing concentrations of Ca2+. We designate the 515–540/465–495 nm (acceptor/donor) emission ratio, which is a measure of bound Ca2+, as the FRET image. Cells transfected with the indicated probe were grown on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes for 2 days and washed three times with the indicated starting medium. For experiments that required physiological Ca2+, we used Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1.05 mmMgCl2, and 0.83 mm MgSO4. For experiments that required Ca2+-free conditions, the [MgCl2] of HBSS was adjusted to ∼1.88 mm. Washed cells were transferred to the stage of the microscope within 5 min. Cells were excited at 458 nm and the emission at 465–495 nm and 515–540 nm were simultaneously acquired. Cells of interest (COI) were traced on the monitor after each experiment, and the acceptor (EYFP) fluorescence and donor (ECFP) fluorescence was measured and the ratio of acceptor to donor for each COI was calculated using a built-in accessory program in the confocal system. The calculation of ratio value for each COI and the processing of ratio images was done off-line using the ratio imaging module of OpenLab software (Improvision Inc., Lexinton, MA). Cells transiently expressing each probe were grown on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes and preincubated at 20 °C in nominally Ca2+-free HBSS. Throughout the following procedure, we used a medium containing 10 μmionomycin, 10 μm nigericin, 100 mm KCl, 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. In this medium, the cells were sequentially exposed to 10 mm EGTA to obtain Rmin, the indicated concentration of Ca2+, and finally 10 mm CaCl2 to obtain Rmax. Percent emission ratio increase (%ERI) was measured as described by Miyawaki et al. (21Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Known concentrations of Ca2+ were prepared using a calcium calibration buffer kit using the method of Tsien and Pozzan (22Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cells were sequentially exposed to 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EGTA plus 10 μmionomycin, and 10 mm CaCl2 plus 10 μm ionomycin and acceptor fluorescence (EYFP) to donor fluorescence (ECFP) ratio was continuously recorded. The minimum ratio (Rmin) corresponds to the lowest ratio detected in the experiment while the maximum ratio (Rmax) is the maximum value after the addition of Ca2+ and ionomycin. Using these values, we calculated the basal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]b) detected by each probe when the cells were in Ca2+-free medium using the standard formula: [Ca2+]b = K d × {(R − Rmin)/(Rmax − R)(1/n)} whereK d = 260 nm, n is the Hill coefficient (a value of 1 was used), and R equals the ratio at the beginning of the experiment. The average [Ca2+]b ± S.E. for cells in nominally Ca2+-free HBSS was 321 ± 19 nm for CYC, 263 ± 21 nm for NYC, and 22 ± 4 nmfor YC. For cells in 1.2 mm Ca2+, [Ca2+]b was 616 ± 58 nm, for NYC was 376 ± 15 nm, and for YC was 63 ± 5 nm. To calculate the [Ca2+] when cells were exposed to different concentrations of extracellular Ca2+, we used the simultaneous equations [Ca2+] =K d × (R − Rmin)/(Rmax− R) and [Ca2+]b = K d × (Rs-Rmin)/(Rmax − Rs) where K d = 260 nm, [Ca2+]b is the basal [Ca2+] calculated above for each probe, and Rs is the starting ratio value for each experiment. Solving these equations, [Ca2+] was calculated from the formula [Ca2+] = {K d × R − (K d + [Ca2+]b)Rs + [Ca2+]b × Rmax}/(Rmax − R). Cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm DAF-2DA, 5 μm Fura Red-AM, and 0.05% pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min in serum-free M199 medium. Cells were then washed twice with M199 and postincubated in the presence of M199 medium plus 20% fetal bovine serum for 20 min. Cells loaded with these dyes were washed three times with recording medium (Ca2+-free HBSS supplemented with 1.8 mmMg2+) and mounted on the inverted stage of the confocal microscope. Cells were excited at 488 nm, and emission at 500–540 nm (DAF-2) and 600–680 nm (FuraRed) were acquired simultaneously. One day after transfection, cells were transferred to 35-mm dishes containing 22 × 22 mm coverglasses and grown for 2 days. The cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. After fixation, the cells were rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min on ice and washed extensively with PBS before processing for indirect immunofluorescence localization of caveolin-1. Cells were examined with the Leica confocal microscope. GFP pAb (Clonetech, San Diego, CA) immunogold labeling of yellow cameleon transiently expressed in primary endothelial cells was carried out using the method of Pathak and Anderson (23Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to determine if caveolae were preferred sites of regulated Ca2+ entry. YC 2.1 was chosen as the Ca2+ sensor and we either used it without modification (YC) or attached two different targeting motifs. The motif used to target YC 2.1 to the plasma membrane was the 20 amino acid long, doubly palmitoylated, amino-terminal portion of neuromodulin/GAP-43 (NYC) (24Moriyoshi K. Richards L.J. Akazawa C. O'Leary D.D. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We targeted YC to caveolae by attaching it to the carboxyl end of full-length caveolin-1 (CYC). Caveolin-1 is thought to be positioned in the membrane with the first 101 amino acids in the cytoplasm, the next 33 amino acids embedded in the membrane and the terminal 44 amino acids in the cytoplasm. Therefore, NYC and CYC should be similar distances from the membrane (27 and 51 amino acids, respectively) but targeted to different membrane locations while the YC should be distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Primary endothelial cells were transiently transfected with each construct and processed for indirect immunofluorescence localization of caveolin-1 (Fig. 1). A comparison of the fluorescence images of YFP with the immunofluorescence images of caveolin-1 in cells transfected with CYC (A–C) shows that the two fluorescence signals are co-localized. Importantly, the fluorescence pattern in transfected cells matched closely the typical caveolin-1 immunofluorescence staining pattern seen in adjacent, non-transfected cells (asterisk in B). The YFP fluorescence signal in cells transfected with NYC (D) was diffusely distributed on the cell surface, but extended into caveolin-rich regions (D–F). Cells transfected with YC alone had cytoplasmic YFP fluorescence (G–I) throughout the cell, including the centrosomal region near the nucleus. Finally, immunogold labeling showed that typical, invaginated caveolae in CYC-transfected cells were labeled with pAb GFP (J) while adjacent non-transfected cells were not labeled (K). We conclude that CYC is targeted to caveolae. The three different cameleon probes (YC, NYC, and CYC) were calibrated in live cells to determine if each had the same range of calcium sensitivity. Cells expressing the indicated constructs were preincubated at 20 °C in nominally Ca2+-free buffer containing 10 μm ionomycin, 10 μmnigericin, 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. The cells were then sequentially exposed to 10 mm EGTA to obtain Rmin, the indicated concentration of Ca2+ and finally 10 mm CaCl2 to obtain Rmax(Fig. 2). Known concentrations of Ca2+ were prepared using a calcium calibration buffer kit (22Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Over a Ca2+ range between 17 and 1350 nm, the percent emission ratio increase (designated %ERI) for the three probes was identical. The estimated K d for the three probes was 260 nm. These results indicate the two chimeric probes (NYC, CYC) have the same sensitivity to Ca2+ as the native YC. Moreover, the Ca2+-sensing ability of each probe appears to be independent of its cellular location. We first visualized the FRET produced by each probe using pseudo-color imaging methods (Fig. 3). Cells transfected with either CYC (A–D), NYC (E–H), or both NYC and CYC (I–L) were either imaged directly at the YFP emission (515–540 nm) to see the distribution of each protein (A,E,I) or processed to detect FRET (515–540/465–495 nm emission ratio), which is a measure of relative [Ca2+] (B–D,F–H, J–L). CYC was distributed in patches usually at the edge of the cell (A) while NYC was uniformly distributed on the surface (E). Cells expressing both probes (CYC+ NYC) had predominately random fluorescence on the surface with areas of increased fluorescence at one edge of the cell (pink arrows,I) that resembled sites of CYC accumulation. The pseudo-color FRET image produced by each probe had different characteristics. CYC-expressing cells incubated in the presence of Ca2+ free medium (B) showed FRET at the edge of the cell that overlapped with the location of the YFP image of CYC (A). NYC FRET, by contrast, was uniformly distributed across the surface (F). In the doubly transfected cells we could compare FRET from each probe in the same cell (J). An intense yellow-red image was seen at the edge of the cell (pink arrows,J) corresponding to the expected distribution of CYC. The uniformly distributed NYC probe produced a less intense, yellow image. The intensity of the color from each probe decreased when the cells were exposed to 0.1 mm EGTA (C,G,K) but then dramatically increased when the cells were transferred to medium containing 1.2 mmCa2+ (D,H,L). Based on these images, the submembrane [Ca2+] detected by CYC under these conditions appears to be higher than that detected by NYC. We next determined the basal level %ERI for each probe. Recordings were made in cells expressing the indicated probe after they had been incubated in nominally Ca2+-free medium for 5 min. Then fresh medium was added to the dish followed by the addition of 0.1, 1, and 10 mm EGTA at the indicated points. A representative trace for the three probes is shown in Fig.4 A. EGTA caused a dramatic reduction in the emission ratio for CYC and NYC (left ordinate) but little change for YC. At 180 s, 10 mm Ca2+ plus ionomycin was added to the dish, and the emission ratio for each probe rose to a maximum level. The Ratiomin and Ratiomax values were used to calculate the relative %ERI detected by each probe (right ordinate, Fig. 4 A). The %ERI, in turn, is a function of the local [Ca2+] detected by each probe (See Fig. 2). From multiple trials we determined that the average baseline %ERI detected in cells grown in nominal Ca2+-free media was 54% for CYC, 49% for NYC, and 7% for YC. These values indicate that the [Ca2+] beneath the plasma membrane is considerably higher than the bulk cytosol. The response of each probe to sequential changes in extracellular Ca2+ was also studied. A typical trace is shown in Fig.4 B where the emission ratio is plotted on the left ordinate and %ERI on the right. Based on the calculations in Fig. 4 A, we set the baseline %ERI for CYC probe at 54%, NYC at 49%, and YC at 7%. The addition of 0.12 mm Ca2+ to the dish caused the CYC %ERI to change from 54 to 70% while 1.2 mm Ca2+ caused a rise to 90% followed by a decline. Traces for the NYC and YC probes showed that extracellular Ca2+ had to be at least 1.2 mm before a change in %ERI was detected. Therefore, it takes nearly 10-fold less extracellular Ca2+ to raise the [Ca2+] in the region surrounding the CYC probe than it takes to raise the local [Ca2+] detected by the other two probes. These measurements suggest that the immediate environment of the three cameleon probes has a characteristic [Ca2+] and that each of these Ca2+ pools vary independently in response to extracellular Ca2+. We further explored the spatial resolution of each probe by measuring the %ERI at each site after cells were stimulated with different concentrations of ATP (Fig. 5). ATP stimulates both Ca2+ release from the ER and Ca2+ entry at the plasma membrane. We focused on the effects of Ca2+ release from the ER by incubating cells in nominal Ca2+-free media, adding 0.5 μm (A), 5 μm(B), or 50 μm (C) ATP and then determining the %ERI. A final measurement of relative %ERI was made at 1.5 min after the addition of ATP. The CYC probe did not detect any change in %ERI during the experiment, although at the highest concentrations of ATP we observed a slight decrease at 1.5 min (C, ○). The NYC probe showed a reproducible decline in %ERI, which persisted out to 1.5 min (●). The YC probe, by contrast, reproducibly showed a marked change in %ERI when ATP was added to the medium. The %ERI always returned to basal levels after 1.5 min of incubation (▪). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic yellow cameleon detects Ca2+ release from the ER while the other probes do not. An important regulator of Ca2+entry into cells is ER [Ca2+]. When this pool of Ca2+ becomes low, specific plasma membrane Ca2+channels open to allow refilling of the ER from an extracellular source. We used the three yellow cameleon probes to detect Ca2+ entry following depletion of ER Ca2+. Endothelial cells transiently transfected with CYC, NYC, or YC were placed in Ca2+-free medium for 30 s before 50 μm ATP plus 4 μm thapsigargin was added to deplete ER Ca2+. A representative trace of the emission ratio as a function of time for cells expressing each of the three probes is shown in Fig. 6. The CYC probe exhibited a slight decrease in emission ratio after the addition of ATP plus thapsigargin, but then the emission ratio increased stepwise in response to each addition of extracellular Ca2+ until reaching a plateau at ∼400 μm Ca2+. Visualization of sites of FRET showed that it had a typical caveolin-1 distribution (D). The NYC probe (B), by contrast, showed a drop in emission ratio after the addition of ATP plus thapsigargin, which gradually returned to baseline by 300 s. Extracellular Ca2+ had to be at least 120 μmbefore the NYC probe showed any change in the emission ratio. The YC trace (C) was similar to the NYC trace with the exception that instead of a drop in the emission ratio in response to ATP and thapsigargin, it showed a transient increase. The effect of extracellular [Ca2+] on the %ERI exhibited by each probe in multiple trials is shown in Fig 6 E. CYC exhibited an immediate, rapid rise in %ERI when extracellular [Ca2+] was increased (○), which plateaued at ∼400 μm Ca2+. By contrast, the %ERI for NYC (●) changed slowly over the same concentration range of Ca2+. YC (▪) showed little change in %ERI until extracellular Ca2+ was 120 μm and then rose rapidly. The response of the three probes to depletion of ER Ca2+indicates that Ca2+ flux through caveolae occurs at much lower levels of extracellular Ca2+ than for non-caveolae sites. We think the change in relative %ERI detected by CYC (Fig. 6 E) when cells are depleted of ER Ca2+ reflects the Ca2+ flux through caveolae when channels are opened. Ca2+ flux, in turn, depends on store-operated channels in the membrane that mediate Ca2+entry. Previous studies have identified two categories of reagents that affect store-operated Ca2+ entry. The first modifies IP3 receptor function (25Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) while the second appears to block interactions between the plasma membrane and the ER (26Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We tested representative inhibitors in each class, as well as inhibitors of caveolae function, to determine the affect they had on the %ERI detected by CYC and NYC (Fig.7 A). Two widely used cell permeable IP3 receptor antagonists are xestospongin C (27Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and 2-APB (25Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Cells expressing CYC (solid bars) or NYC (shaded bars) were either not treated (A) or exposed to these two inhibitors (D andE). ER Ca2+ was depleted by incubating the cells in the presence of ATP plus thapsigargin for 5 min. The cells were then placed in 120 μm Ca2+ and the peak %ERI recorded by each probe was determined. We chose this concentration of extracellular Ca2+ because it causes only a slight increase above baseline of NYC %ERI (see Fig. 6, B andE). The baseline %ERI for CYC (dashed line) and NYC (dotted line) are shown for reference. The peak change in %ERI in control cells was 77% for CYC and 57% for NYC. Xestospongin C blocked the rise in %ERI detected by CYC but had no effect on NYC %ERI (D). 2-APB also blocked the rise in %ERI recorded by CYC but, in addition, significantly reduced the peak %ERI detected by NYC (E). These results suggest that CYC detects IP3 receptor-dependent, capacitative Ca2+ entry. We used the same protocol to look at the effect of agents that are thought to prevent plasma membrane-ER interactions (Fig. 7,A,F–H). The marine sponge toxin jasplakinolide and the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A have been shown to block store-operated Ca2+ entry (26Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Calyculin A blocked the rise in %ERI detected by CYC without affecting NYC %ERI (compareblack with shaded bars, F). Jasplakinolide had a weaker but significant effect (H) and, in addition, reduced NYC %ERI. We also found that the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid had the same effect as calyculin A (G). Therefore, the same inhibitors that block Ca2+ entry through store-operated channels selectively reduce the change in CYC %ERI that occurs when ER Ca2+ is depleted. Under some conditions, okadaic acid will cause caveolae vesicles to accumulate at the center of the cell (28Parton R.G. Joggerst B. S"
https://openalex.org/W2044951610,"Citrate plays a pivotal role not only in the generation of metabolic energy but also in the synthesis of fatty acids, isoprenoids, and cholesterol in mammalian cells. Plasma levels of citrate are the highest (∼135 μm) among the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Here we report on the cloning and functional characterization of a plasma membrane transporter (NaCT for Na+-coupled citrate transporter) from rat brain that mediates uphill cellular uptake of citrate coupled to an electrochemical Na+ gradient. NaCT consists of 572 amino acids and exhibits structural similarity to the members of the Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter/Na+-sulfate cotransporter (NaDC/NaSi) gene family including the recently identifiedDrosophila Indy. In rat, the expression of NaCT is restricted to liver, testis, and brain. When expressed heterologously in mammalian cells, rat NaCT mediates the transport of citrate with high affinity (Michaelis-Menten constant, ∼20 μm) and with a Na+:citrate stoichiometry of 4:1. The transporter does interact with other dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates but with considerably lower affinity. In mouse brain, the expression of NaCT mRNA is evident in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. NaCT represents the first transporter to be identified in mammalian cells that shows preference for citrate over dicarboxylates. This transporter is likely to play an important role in the cellular utilization of citrate in blood for the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol (liver) and for the generation of energy (liver and brain). NaCT thus constitutes a potential therapeutic target for the control of body weight, cholesterol levels, and energy homeostasis.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These transporters, known as NaDC1 (sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter)1 and NaDC3, can be distinguished from one another primarily based on their substrate affinity. NaDC1 is a low affinity transporter with a Michaelis-Menten constant (Kt) for succinate in the millimolar range whereas NaDC3 is a high affinity transporter with aKt for succinate in the micromolar range. NaDC2, identified in Xenopus laevis intestine, is functionally and structurally related to the mammalian NaDCs, but may represent a species-specific ortholog of NaDC1 (2Bai L. Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G267-G274PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian NaDCs have been cloned from different species and their functional characteristics have been elucidated in different heterologous expression systems (3Pajor A.M. J. Biol.

NaDC1 is expressed primarily in the intestine and kidney whereas NaDC3 is expressed not only in the intestine and kidney but also in the brain, liver, and placenta (1Pajor A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A unique feature of both of these transporters is that they interact with dicarboxylates with greater preference than with citrate, a tricarboxylate at physiological pH. Furthermore, even though NaDC1 and NaDC3 are able to transport citrate to some extent, only the dianionic form of citrate is recognized as the substrate by these transporters. Thus, NaDC1 and NaDC3 are specific for dicarboxylates. NaDCs are structurally related to the Na+-coupled sulfate transporters NaSi and SUT1 (1Pajor A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Together, these transporters constitute the NaDC/NaSi gene family. Recently, Rogina et al. (11Rogina B. Reenan R.A. Nilsen S.P. Helfand S.L. Science. 2000; 290: 2137-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) reported on the identification of a gene in Drosophila melanogaster which, when mutated, confers life span extension to the organism. Interestingly, the predicted protein product of this gene, known as Indy (forI'm Not Dead Yet), shows significant homology to mammalian NaDCs. It was therefore suggested that Indy is the Drosophila ortholog of either NaDC1 or NaDC3 and that disruption of its function may restrict the cellular entry of dicarboxylates, leading to decreased energy production, a metabolic condition similar to caloric restriction. This seemed logical because caloric restriction in rats and non-human primates has been shown to be associated with life span extension (12Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar,13Helfand S.L. Rogina B. Cell Differ. 2000; 29: 67-80Google Scholar). However, even though it was assumed, based on the structural similarity, that Drosophila Indy is a sodium-coupled transporter for dicarboxylates similar to mammalian NaDCs, its transport identity has not been established. We have recently clonedDrosophila Indy and investigated its transport function. 2K. Inoue and V. Ganapathy, unpublished observations. These studies have produced unexpected results. Drosophila Indy does possess the ability to transport succinate as do mammalian NaDCs but the transport is Na+-independent. Furthermore, unlike mammalian NaDCs, Drosophila Indy transports citrate very effectively. The affinity for citrate is severalfold greater in the case ofDrosophila Indy than in the case of mammalian NaDCs. These findings suggested that neither NaDC1 nor NaDC3 is the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Indy. Therefore, we searched the GenBankTM data base to see if there are additional transporters in mammals that are structurally related to NaDC1 and NaDC3. This search led to the identification of a novel mammalian transporter that is structurally similar to mammalian NaDCs as well as to Drosophila Indy. Interestingly, this new transporter transports citrate much more effectively than succinate, a characteristic more similar to that of Drosophila Indy than to that of mammalian NaDCs. However, the transport process is coupled to Na+, a feature distinct from that ofDrosophila Indy but similar to that of mammalian NaDCs. Based on these functional characteristics, we have designated this novel transporter as NaCT (for Na+-coupled citrate transporter). This represents the first sodium-coupled transporter in mammals to be identified that shows preference for citrate as a substrate. [14C]Citrate (specific radioactivity, 55 mCi/mmol), [3H]succinate (specific radioactivity, 40 Ci/mmol), and [14C]pyruvate (specific radioactivity, 15 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). The human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) cell line, used routinely in our laboratory for heterologous expression of cloned transporters, was originally provided by M. A. Del Monte (W. K. Kellog Eye Center, Dept. of Ophthalmology, Ann Arbor, MI). The cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Lipofectin was purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Magna nylon transfer membranes used in library screening were purchased from Micron Separations (Westboro, MA). Unlabeled monocarboxylates, dicarboxylates, and tricarboxylates were obtained from Sigma. A search of the GenBankTM data base for murine ESTs (established sequence tags) with the amino acid sequence of Drosophila Indy as a query identified several ESTs whose predicted amino acid sequences showed significant similarity to that of mammalian sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters NaDC1 and NaDC3. Many of these ESTs were identical to murine NaDC1 and NaDC3, which have been already cloned and functionally characterized (9Pajor A.M. Gangula R. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1215-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pajor A.M. Sun N.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F482-F490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there were three ESTs (GenBankTM accession nos. BB261903, BB393630, and BB641100) with overlapping nucleotide sequences, and the predicted amino acid sequence from these ESTs did not correspond to that of murine NaDC1 or NaDC3. However, there was significant similarity between this sequence and that of NaDC1, NaDC3, and Drosophila Indy. There is no information in the literature on the functional identity of this new putative mammalian transporter. The sequence similarity however suggested that it might represent a new member of the sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter gene family. We used the overlapping nucleotide sequences of two of these ESTs to design primers for RT-PCR to obtain a cDNA probe that is specific for this transporter. The forward primer was 5′-TCTTTTCTCCCTCCAGTCAGT-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GGCAATCTTCTCGGTGTC-3′. The predicted size of the RT-PCR product, based on the positions of the primers, was 943 bp. Since both of these ESTs were identified from a mouse cerebral cortex cDNA library, we used poly(A) RNA from mouse brain as the template for RT-PCR to obtain the probe. This yielded a cDNA product of expected size. The product was subcloned in pGEM-T vector and sequenced to establish its molecular identity. The cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the ready-to-go oligolabeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). This probe was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library under medium stringency conditions. The screening of the library was done as described previously (13Helfand S.L. Rogina B.

The cDNA inserts in the vector were under the control of T7 promoter. Both sense and antisense strands of the cDNA were sequenced by primer walking. Sequencing was done byTaq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing using an automated PE Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA sequencer. The sequence was analyzed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information server www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The expression pattern of NaCT mRNA in rat tissues was analyzed by Northern hybridization using a commercially available rat multiple tissue blot. The blot was hybridized with a 32P-labeled rat NaCT-specific cDNA probe under high stringency conditions. The same blot was then hybridized with a cDNA probe specific for rat β-actin as an internal control to detect the presence of RNA in each lane. The cloned transporter was expressed heterologously in HRPE cells using the vaccinia virus expression technique (14Kekuda R. Prasad P.D., Wu, X. Wang H. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Functional analysis of the cloned transporter was carried out with this experimental system. Briefly, subconfluent HRPE cells grown on 24-well plates were first infected with a recombinant (VTF7–3) vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase and then transfected with the plasmid carrying the full-length rat NaCT cDNA. For comparison with the newly cloned transporter, rat NaDC3 cDNA isolated from a placental cDNA library (6Kekuda R. Wang H. Huang W. Pajor A.M. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J.

After 12–15 h post-transfection, uptake measurements were made at 37 °C with radiolabeled citrate, succinate, or pyruvate. The uptake medium in most experiments was 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. The time of incubation was 15 min for citrate and 1 min for succinate. These time periods were chosen from time course studies with respective substrates to represent linear uptake conditions. Endogenous uptake was always determined in parallel using the cells transfected with pSPORT1 vector alone. The uptake activity in cDNA-transfected cells was adjusted for the endogenous uptake activity to calculate the cDNA-specific activity. In experiments in which the cation and anion dependence of the uptake process was investigated, NaCl was replaced isoosmotically with LiCl, KCl, N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) chloride, sodium gluconate, or mannitol. When the influence of pH on the uptake process was investigated, uptake buffers of different pH values were prepared by appropriately altering the concentrations of Tris, Mes, and Hepes. Saturation kinetics was evaluated by non-linear regression analysis, and the kinetic parameters derived from this method were confirmed by linear regression analysis. The Na+:citrate stoichiometry was calculated by measuring citrate uptake with varying concentrations of Na+ and then by analyzing the data according to Hill equation. The concentrations of Na+ were varied by appropriately changing the concentrations of NaCl and NMDG chloride without changing the osmolality. The influence of membrane potential on the uptake process was investigated by measuring the uptake in the presence of high concentrations of K+, a condition, which leads to depolarization of the membrane. Experiments were done in duplicate or triplicate, and each experiment was repeated two or three times. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. The expression pattern of NaCT mRNA in mouse brain was investigated by in situhybridization as described previously (18Huang W. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fei Y.J. Friedrich A. Wang J. Conway S.J.

For the preparation of the mouse NaCT-specific riboprobe, we used as the template a 363 bp cDNA derived by PCR from the ∼0.9 kbp RT-PCR product that was generated with mouse brain RNA. This cDNA was subcloned in pGEM-T vector, and T7 RNA polymerase and SP6 RNA polymerase were used to prepare the sense and antisense riboprobes after linearization of the plasmid with appropriate restriction enzymes. The riboprobes were labeled using a digoxigenin-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Whole brains from mice were frozen immediately in Tissue-Tek OCT, sectioned at 10-μm thickness, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sections were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 1% diethylpyrocarbonate. Permeabilization of the sections was carried out with proteinase K (1 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 min. The activity of proteinase K was terminated by rinsing the sections with glycine (2 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, equilibrated in 5× SSC (100 mm NaCl/15 mm sodium citrate), and prehybridized for 2 h at 58 °C in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 2% (w/v) blocking agent (provided with the digoxigenin nucleic acid detection kit), 0.1% (w/v) N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sections were hybridized with digoxigenin-UTP-labeled antisense or sense (negative control) riboprobes (1 μg/ml) and were incubated overnight at 58 °C. Post-hybridization washings were done twice in 2× SSC at 58 °C, twice in 1× SSC at 55 °C, and twice in 0.1× SSC at 37 °C. Hybridization signals were then detected immunologically by using an antibody specific for digoxigenin. This was done by first washing the sections in a buffer containing 0.1 m maleic acid and 0.15m NaCl (pH 7.5) and then exposing the washed sections to 1% blocking agent in the same buffer. Sections were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody (1 in 5000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Following this, sections were washed in the preceding wash buffer containing levamisol (0.2 mg/ml) twice for 10 min and equilibrated with 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 9.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mmMgCl2. The color reaction was developed in NBT/BCIP (4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate). Slides were washed in distilled water and coverslipped but not counterstained so that the purplish-red colored precipitate, indicative of a positive reaction, could be visualized in the sections. The cloned rat NaCT cDNA is 3254 bp long with a poly(A) tail and an open reading frame (24–1742 bp) coding for a protein of 572 amino acids (GenBankTMaccession number AF522186). The cloned transporter is new and has not been reported previously in the literature. Based on the amino acid sequence, rat NaCT belongs to the NaDC/NaSi (sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter/sodium-sulfate cotransporter) gene family which, to date, consists of three sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters (NaDC1, NaDC2, and NaDC3) and two sodium-coupled sulfate transporters (NaSi and SUT1) (1Pajor A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the rat NaCT is structurally more closely related to sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters than to sodium-coupled sulfate transporters. It shows a 44–50% sequence identity with rat NaDCs (Fig. 1). It also shows significant structural similarity to Drosophila Indy (34% identity). Hydropathy analysis suggests that rat NaCT possesses eleven putative transmembrane domains, similar to the previously known sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters. A search of GenBankTM data base using the rat NaCT amino acid sequence as a query has revealed that a putative human ortholog of rat NaCT is located on chromosome 17 upstream of the gene coding for NaDC1 (17p13 in the case of the gene coding for NaCT and 17p11.1-q11.1 in the case of the gene coding for NaDC1) (4Pajor A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F642-F648PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis shows that NaCT mRNA (∼3.2 kb) is expressed in a restricted manner in rat tissues. The expression is evident only in the liver, testis, and brain (Fig.2). The level of expression in the liver and testis is much higher than in the brain. There is only a single transcript detectable. We assessed the transport function of rat NaCT in a heterologous expression system in a mammalian cell line (HRPE) using the vaccinia virus expression technique. Since rat NaCT shows high structural similarity to the sodium-coupled dicarboxylate transporters, we first tested the ability of rat NaCT to transport succinate in the presence of a Na+ gradient (Fig.3 A). The uptake of succinate (80 nm) in cells transfected with rat NaCT cDNA was about 7-fold higher than in cells transfected with vector alone, indicating that the cloned transporter does possess the ability to mediate the uptake of this dicarboxylate. We then tested whether pyruvate (a monocarboxylate) and citrate (a tricarboxylate) are recognized as transport substrates by rat NaCT. Surprisingly, the uptake of both of these compounds (pyruvate, 135 μm; citrate, 35 μm) was higher in cDNA-transfected cells than in vector-transfected cells. The cDNA-induced increase in pyruvate uptake was marginal (∼3-fold) whereas the increase was much more marked in the case of citrate (∼90-fold). This was very interesting because the previously described NaDCs possess much lower ability to transport citrate than to transport succinate (1Pajor A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since rat NaCT was able to transport citrate preferentially, we used this tricarboxylate as a substrate for subsequent functional characterization of the transporter. The cDNA-mediated uptake of citrate was linear even up to 30 min (Fig.3 B). The uptake process operated maximally at pH 7 (Fig.3 C). The involvement of Na+ in the uptake process mediated by rat NaCT was evaluated by monitoring the uptake of citrate in vector-transfected cells and in rat NaCT cDNA-transfected cells in the presence and absence of Na+. This was done by isoosmotically replacing NaCl in the uptake medium with NMDG chloride, KCl, LiCl, or mannitol (Table I). The cDNA-specific uptake was almost completely abolished when Na+ was removed from the medium. The uptake process was however not dependent on Cl− because the replacement of Cl− with gluconate had only a small effect on the cDNA-specific citrate uptake.Table IIon dependence of citrate uptake via rat NaCTSaltCitrate UptakeVectorcDNAcDNA-specificpmol/106cells/min%NaCl0.84 ± 0.1438.8 ± 3.338.0 ± 3.3100NMDG chloride1.22 ± 0.221.6 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.31KCl0.49 ± 0.030.6 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.10LiCl0.51 ± 0.021.6 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.13Sodium gluconate0.48 ± 0.0329.6 ± 2.329.1 ± 2.377Mannitol0.59 ± 0.030.7 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.10Uptake of [14C]citrate (7 μm) was measured in vector-transfected HRPE cells and in rat NaCT cDNA-transfected HRPE cells at pH 7.5 in the presence of various inorganic salts or mannitol.

The substrate specificity of rat NaCT was examined by competition studies in which we assessed the ability of various unlabeled compounds (2.5 mm) to compete with [14C]citrate (7 μm) for uptake via rat NaCT (TableII). Unlabeled citrate was the most potent inhibitor of [14C]citrate uptake mediated by rat NaCT. Among the dicarboxylates, succinate and malate were very potent inhibitors. Fumarate and α-ketoglutarate were comparatively less effective. Maleate, the cis isomer of fumarate, was one of the least potent inhibitors, showing stereoselectivity of the transporter. The monocarboxylates pyruvate and lactate were not effective in inhibiting [14C]citrate uptake.Table IISubstrate specificity of rat NaCTUnlabeled compound[14C]Citrate uptakepmol/106 cells/min%None108.3 ± 5.5100Citrate1.5 ± 0.11Succinate5.7 ± 0.25Malate7.8 ± 0.17Fumarate17.7 ± 1.416α-Ketoglutarate36.5 ± 2.134Maleate78.8 ± 1.573Pyruvate89.4 ± 7.283Lactate89.6 ± 2.083Uptake of [14C]citrate (14 μm) was measured in vector-transfected HRPE cells and in rat NaCT cDNA-transfected HRPE cells in the absence or presence of various monocarboxylates, dicarboxylates, or tricarboxylates (2.5 mm).

Open table in a new tab Uptake of [14C]citrate (14 μm) was measured in vector-transfected HRPE cells and in rat NaCT cDNA-transfected HRPE cells in the absence or presence of various monocarboxylates, dicarboxylates, or tricarboxylates (2.5 mm). Data (means ± S.E.) represent only cDNA-specific uptake. Citrate uptake mediated by rat NaCT was saturable with a Kt of 18 ± 4 μm (Fig. 4 A). Kinetic analysis of Na+ dependence of citrate uptake via rat NaCT showed that the relationship between the uptake and Na+ concentration was sigmoidal, indicating the involvement of multiple Na+ ions per transport cycle (Fig.4 B). The data were analyzed by Hill equation to determine the Na+:citrate stoichiometry. This analysis gave a value between 3 and 4 (3.3 ± 0.3) for the Hill coefficient (nH). Since citrate exists predominantly as a trivalent anion under the experimental conditions (i.e. pH 7.5), cotransport of citrate with 3 Na+ ions will render the transport process electrically silent whereas cotransport with 4 Na+ ions will render the process electrogenic. Therefore, we investigated whether or not the rat NaCT-mediated citrate uptake in the presence of Na+ is influenced by membrane potential. For this purpose, we compared the cDNA-specific citrate uptake between control conditions and membrane depolarizing conditions (i.e. high extracellular K+) (Fig.4 C). The uptake was inhibited significantly (43 ± 2%) when membrane was depolarized, indicating that the uptake process is influenced by membrane potential. Since depolarization inhibits the uptake, we conclude that the uptake process mediated by rat NaCT is electrogenic associated with a net transfer of positive charge into the cells. This would then suggest that at least 4 Na+ are cotransported with one citrate in the transport process. We then compared the affinities of rat NaCT for different tricarboxylates (citrate, isocitrate, and cis-aconitate) and dicarboxylates (succinate, fu"

The receptor kinase is activated by binding with at least five distinct ligands, including EGF and Transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α). Upon ligand binding, the EGFR undergoes autophosphorylation and initiates multiple intracellular signaling cascades, leading to induction of cell growth (3Hill C.S. Treisman R.

In addition to its mitogenic signaling, which is common to other tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptors, the EGFR promotes growth by binding to AT-rich DNA sequences (ATR sequences), thus acting as a transcription factor or a co-activator for cyclin D1 gene expression in cells overexpressing the EGFR (9Lin S.Y.

Secretion of TGF-α in particular is potently mitogenic because its dissociation from EGFR after endocytosis promotes receptor recycling, rather than degradation, and allows unabated signaling in the presence of a continuous ligand source (22Wells A.

In addition to its well studied role in calcium metabolism, the hormonal form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) is known to suppress normal and malignant cell growth (23Matsumoto K. Hashimoto K. Nishida Y.

Several mechanisms have been implicated in 1,25(OH)2D3arrest of the cell cycle at the G0/G1transition (32Jensen S.S. Madsen M.W. Lukas J. Binderup L. Bartek J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In human epidermoid A431 cells, like in many aggressively growing tumors, enhanced co-expression of TGF-α and EGFR generates an autocrine growth loop that constitutes the major mitogenic signal (35Derynck R. Goeddel D.V. Ullrich A. Gutterman J.U. Williams R.D. Bringman T.S. Berger W.H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 707-712PubMed Google Scholar,36Haigler H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This result is also supported by the fact that the use of specific inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase significantly arrests growth in A431 cells and in TGF-α-driven tumors (37Busse D. Yakes F.M. Lenferink A.E. Arteaga C.L. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28 Suppl. 16: 47-55Crossref Google Scholar, 38El-Obeid A. Hesselager G. Westermark B. Nister M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The effectiveness of 1,25(OH)2D3 in suppressing TGF-α-induced growth in psoriasis and renal hyperparathyroidism led us to hypothesize that 1,25(OH)2D3 could be affecting the TGF-α/EGFR-autocrine growth loop. To test this hypothesis, we used the human epidermocarcinoma cell line A431. In this study, we present evidence for a novel mechanism for the antiproliferative properties of 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3 alters EGFR membrane trafficking, down-regulates EGFR-growth signaling, and impairs binding of nuclear EGFR to cognate DNA sequences, which in turn decreases its transcriptional activity on the cyclin D1 promoter. A431 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), NR6, or HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) containing 4 mml-glutamine, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Fisher) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For 1,25(OH)2D3treatment, cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum either in the presence or absence of 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3for 24 h (a gift from Dr. Uskokovic, Hoffman-La Roche). After this incubation, the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Aldrich) in the presence or absence of 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3, and cell growth was measured after 24 h. EGF (Calbiochem) treatment was performed at the concentration and time of exposure specified in the respective protocols. After the specified treatment, cell growth was measured by thymidine incorporation into DNA. Cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml of methyl-[3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was then added, and cells were solubilized with 1 m NaOH. Tritium was measured by scintillation counting (Taurus, Micromedic). Mouse EGF (Calbiochem) was iodinated with125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-BEAD (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. EGF binding was measured as previously described (39Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, cells were washed with binding buffer (α-modified Eagle's medium, 13 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 0.3% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mg/l penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C, and allowed to bind 100 pm [125I]-EGF at 4 °C for 2h. Cells were then washed five times with cold binding buffer to remove the unbound 125I-EGF. Cells were lysed overnight at 4 °C in 1 N NaOH, and surface-bound 125I-EGF was measured with a gamma counter (Apex, Micromedic). Nonspecific binding (<4%) was assessed by co-incubation of radiolabeled EGF with 200 nmradioinert human EGF (Aldrich). Control and 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells were incubated with binding buffer containing no EGF or 17 nmEGF for 20 min at 37 °C. At the end of the pulse, cells were washed and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmNaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) pH 7.2). The lysate was vortexed and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of total protein from cell lysates was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-EGFR antibody (Ab-5 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) or Ab-13 monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers)) bound to Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. For ERK1/2 activation analysis, 30 μg of total protein from lysates were analyzed by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with antibodies against total EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR (BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratory) or total ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were developed using super signal reagents (Pierce). Gels were scanned, and the densitometric analysis was performed using Gel Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). For preparation of nuclear extracts, we used the Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control and 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and immunostained with the appropriate primary antibodies. Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. Slides were examined by confocal microscopy (MRC1024; Bio-Rad) using a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture bright-field objective and fluorescein filter sets. Control and treated cells were fixed in methanol for 10 min, quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. After 45 min blocking at room temperature, cells were exposed to a 1:250 dilution of either anti-total ERK1/2 or anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs) at 4 °C overnight. A biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Zymed) was applied, and immune complexes were visualized with aminoethyl carbazole (AEC) substrate chromogen. For each experiment, one hundred cells per field were counted using a 10× high power-field objective. Four different fields were counted per well, and two wells were counted per experiment. Three independent experiments were performed. Nuclei staining positive for phosphorylated ERK1/2 were expressed as percent of positive nuclei per total number of cells counted. Nuclear extracts from control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells were obtained and used for EMSAs. The assays were conducted as described by Kotanides and Reich (40Kotanides H. Reich N.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1265-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), using the EGFR consensus binding site (wild type: CTTGTTTACGGTCCCCCCATTTTTACGCTGGTCCT) and its mutant (mutant type: CTAGTCCACGGTCCCCCCATCTGGACGCTGGTCCT) (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) as probes, and 10 μg of total nuclear protein. For binding interference, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-EGFR antibody (Ab-12 NeoMarkers). Bands in the dried gels were visualized by scanning densitometry after an overnight exposure, using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the proximal region of the cyclin D1 promoter that contains the EGFR consensus binding site (AT-rich sequences) or a mutant construct lacking the mentioned site (9Lin S.Y.

Richard Pestell, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Mien-Chie Hung, University of Texas, Anderson Cancer Center). After a 7-h transfection with Superfect (Qiagen), cells were treated with 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h in the presence or absence of 17 nm EGF for the last 6 h of treatment. Cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase reporter kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired ttests. To determine whether 1,25(OH)2D3 affects EGFR growth signal, we studied the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the proliferation of A431 cells. 1,25(OH)2D3inhibited basal-cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner, as shown by a decrease in cell number (Fig.1 A) and by reduction in thymidine incorporation into DNA and was also capable of abolishing all of the growth-stimulatory effect of EGF treatment. (Fig.1 B). Lower doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 had no effect on basal proliferation rates (data not shown). This result suggests that growth inhibition by 1,25(OH)2D3is related to its ability to block the EGFR-induced growth signal. Because ligand-induced internalization of EGFR is an important mechanism to attenuate the receptor signaling (7Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EGFR localization and signaling. Treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 caused a time-dependent decrease in plasma membrane-associated EGFR as shown by a significant increase of EGFR in the cytosol of treated cells (Fig. 2 A) and confirmed by a 20% and 40% reduction in specific surface-bound125I-EGF after 24- and 48-h treatments, respectively (Fig.2 B). The effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EGFR localization correlated with a significant inhibition of ligand-dependent EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells (Fig. 2 C) (pY-EGFR % reduction: 24 h, 65 ± 5 and 48 h, 78 ± 8; p-ERK1/2% reduction: 24 h, 45 ± 3 and 48 h, 80 ± 7). Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3treatment reduced EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR to levels even lower than those present without EGF treatment. Shorter exposure time (20 min or 6 h) to 1,25(OH)2D3 did not affect either the localization (Fig. 3 A) or the activation (Fig. 3 B) of the EGFR, suggesting a VDR-dependent mechanism. These results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 affects EGFR localization and signaling.Figure 3Short-time exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 does not affect EGFR localization and signaling. A, A431 cells treated with 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 for 20 min or 6 h were fixed and immunostained with anti-EGFR antibody. B, control A431 cells or cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 20 min or 6 h were incubated with or without 17 nm EGF for 20 min at 37 °C. Cellular extracts were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody, and analyzed by Western blot for total (EGFR) and tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR (pY-EGFR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibition of cell proliferation and EGFR signaling was specific for A431 cells. We used NR6 mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 4,A and B), a non-tumorigenic cell line overexpressing the human EGFR (39Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 45Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and the human cell line HeLa (Fig. 4, C and D) expressing physiological levels of EGFR. 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly affected EGF-dependent cell proliferation (compare Fig. 4,A and C) and EGFR phosphorylation (compare Fig.4, B and D) in the cell line overexpressing EGFR, NR6, but not in HeLa cells. The results suggest that the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EGFR-induced growth and signaling is not exclusive for A431 cells but requires EGFR overexpression. As shown in figure 2A, 1,25(OH)2D3 reduced plasma membrane EGFR in the absence of exogenous ligand. To directly address whether the effect of the sterol on EGFR localization was related to that of the endogenous ligand, we examined TGF-α localization. As expected, in control cells, TGF-α co-localized with the EGFR to the plasma membrane (Fig.5, A–C). After 48 h of treatment with 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3, TGF-α localization was also changed from the plasma membrane to cytosolic vesicles and significantly co-localized with the EGFR (Fig. 5,D–F). Similar TGF-α/EGFR co-localization was found after 24 h of treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 (data not shown). These data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced changes on both EGFR and TGF-α localization. We next examined the intracellular localization of the EGFR in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells. Co-localization studies using the early endosome autoantigen, EEA1, demonstrated that after a 48-h treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, the EGFR predominantly localized in the early endocytic compartment (Fig.5, G–I). There was no significant co-localization of the EGFR with the lysosomal marker Lamp1 (Fig. 5,J–L). The pattern of localization for EEA1 and Lamp1 was similar for control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells (data not shown). These results indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 changes EGFR localization from the plasma membrane to early endocytic compartments. The observation that in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, EGFR did not localize in the lysosomal compartment is consistent with the lack of effects of the sterol in the total EGFR content, as shown in Fig.2 C. In many tumors and tumor cell lines, including A431 cells, co-expression of EGFR and TGF-α triggers an “autocrine” growth loop (35Derynck R. Goeddel D.V. Ullrich A. Gutterman J.U. Williams R.D. Bringman T.S. Berger W.H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 707-712PubMed Google Scholar). Measured by proliferative indices, the magnitude of the autocrine growth signal directly correlates with nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (42Albanell J. Codony-Servat J. Rojo F. Del Campo J.M. Sauleda S. Anido J. Raspall G. Giralt J. Rosello J. Nicholson R.I. Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6500-6510PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, prevention of nuclear translocation of activated ERK1/2 is an indicator of the therapeutic efficacy in counteracting TGF-α/EGFR autocrine growth. To further confirm the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on TGF-α/EGFR growth signal, nuclear levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were measured. As expected, in control A431 cells, most cells (90 ± 9.5%) exhibited nuclear staining for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig.6 A) (42Albanell J. Codony-Servat J. Rojo F. Del Campo J.M. Sauleda S. Anido J. Raspall G. Giralt J. Rosello J. Nicholson R.I. Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6500-6510PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h of treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, nuclear phosphorylated ERK1/2 was significantly reduced (Fig. 6 B) (p-ERK1/2% reduction: 48h, 70 ± 6.4). These results were further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 E). Because 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment for 48 h had no effect on total ERK1/2 from whole-cell lysate (Fig. 2 C), these results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 reduces TGF-α/EGFR-dependent activation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2. It has been recently shown that activated EGFR translocates to the nucleus of EGFR overexpressing cells and binds to specific AT-rich DNA sequences, either directly or as a co-activator molecule, to activate cyclin D1 gene transcription (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Given the importance of EGFR transcriptional activity in EGFR-overexpressing cells (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), we examined whether 1,25(OH)2D3 affected this novel EGFR biological function. Using nuclear extracts from A431 cells and the described ATR sequence as a probe, the expected EGFR-DNA complex was observed (Fig.7, A and C) (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The specificity of EGFR-DNA binding was supported by competition of the protein-DNA complex by an excess of radioinert oligonucleotide containing wild-type ATR sequences (Fig. 7 A, lane 4 and Fig. 7 C, lane 6), but not by an excess of mutated ATR sequences (Fig. 7 A, lane 5 and Fig. 7 C, lane 7). EGFR-DNA binding was significantly increased by EGF treatment (compare lanes 2and 3 in Fig. 7 C) and abolished by incubation with anti-EGFR antibody (Fig. 7 C, lane 5). These results suggest that EGFR is a component of this protein-DNA complex. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment for 48 h decreased EGFR binding to DNA in both EGF-treated (compare lanes 3 and4 in Fig. 7 C) and EGF-untreated cells (comparelanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 7 A). This reduction in EGFR binding to ATR sequences was consistent with a significant decrease in both total and phosphorylated nuclear EGFR in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, in the presence (Fig. 7 D) or absence (Fig. 7 B) of EGF (pY-EGFR % reduction: 48 h, 55 ± 8 and 48 h + EGF, 45 ± 4). To test whether the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EGFR-DNA binding resulted in an effect on its transcriptional activity, A431 cells were transfected with a wild-type luciferase reporter construct driven by the proximal region of the cyclin D1 promoter that contains ATR sequences (−163 wild type) or a mutant construct lacking the mentioned sequence (−163 mutant type) (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). As expected, EGF induced transcription of the wild-type, but not the mutant, construct (Fig. 7 E). 1,25(OH)2D3 abolished the EGF-induced luciferase activity (compare control + EGF with 1,25D + EGF in Fig. 7 E) and also inhibited the reporter activity regulated by autocrine signaling (compare control with 1,25D in Fig.7 E). These effects were exclusive for the wild-type construct. Taken together, these data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits EGFR binding to its cognate DNA sequence and its transcriptional activity on the cyclin D1 promoter in both the autocrine and the EGF-activated system. The present work shows that 1,25(OH)2D3inhibits autocrine (TGF-α) and EGF-induced A431 cell proliferation, changes the localization of TGF-α and EGFR, and inhibits ligand-dependent EGFR and ERK1/2 activation. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 impairs autocrine and EGF-induced EGFR binding to AT-rich DNA sequences and consequently its transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. The use of A431 cells was important because they overexpress EGFR and its ligand TGF-α and proliferation in these cells is mainly driven by this growth signal (37Busse D. Yakes F.M. Lenferink A.E.

Although other antiproliferative actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 such as reduction of c-myc expression (33Kremer R. Bolivar I. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (34Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) could contribute to the effects of the sterol in A431 cell growth, those actions are unrelated to TGF-α/EGFR signaling. Studies in normal NR6 mouse fibroblasts that overexpress the human EGFR (45Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 39Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and in the human cell line, HeLa, expressing physiological levels of EGFR, suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulation of EGFR-induced growth and signaling requires EGFR overexpression and is independent of tumorigenicity (Fig. 4). This finding renders our work of potential importance in explaining the mechanisms for 1,25(OH)2D3 antiproliferative actions in many tumors and hyperplastic tissues whose growth is driven by co-expression of EGFR and its ligand TGF-α (25Verstuyf A. Segaert S. Verlinden L. Bouillon R. Mathieu C. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2000; 9: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Kragballe K. Arch. Dermatol. 1989; 125: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). At present, the gene/s and detailed molecular mechanisms mediating 1,25(OH)2D3 effects on EGFR localization and signaling are unknown. Most (if not all) 1,25(OH)2D3 biological actions are mediated by its receptor (VDR) (31Brown A.J. Dusso A. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F157-F175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A431 cells express normal levels of VDR (46Segaert S. Garmyn M. Degreef H. Bouillon R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 551-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the non-genomic, VDR-independent actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 occur within seconds (31Brown A.J. Dusso A. Slatopolsky E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F157-F175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the long time of exposure required to see the effects of the sterol on EGFR signals (Fig. 3) suggests that these effects are VDR-dependent. The alteration of normal TGF-α/EGFR trafficking caused by 1,25(OH)2D3 could be an important determinant for the effects of the sterol in A431 cells. The effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EGFR localization seems to be specific as suggested by the lack of effect on the transferrin receptor (data not shown). Additional work will be required to fully identify the mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)2D3 induces apparent stasis of EGFR in the early endocytic compartment and affects EGFR signaling. In addition to the potent inhibition of EGFR signaling at the plasma membrane, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits EGFR functions as a transcription factor (co-activator) of the cyclin D1 promoter in A431 cells (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Several mechanisms could mediate this effect of the sterol, including either a direct effect of the 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR complex on EGFR DNA binding and transcriptional activity or inhibition of EGFR nuclear translocation by 1,25(OH)2D3. The former possibility is unlikely due to the long time required for the effect of the sterol. The latter is a likely mechanism for the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on EGFR transcriptional activity and is supported by the reduced amounts of nuclear EGFR in A431 cells after a 48-h treatment (Fig. 7, B and D). The prolonged treatment required to see this effect suggests a potential role of 1,25(OH)2D3/VDR in regulating proteins involved in EGFR trafficking to the nucleus. This novel aspect of the intracellular trafficking of the EGFR has been recently postulated (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), and very little is known about how this process occurs. Further experimentation is needed to assess this mechanism in detail. The fact that the mutant construct, lacking ATR sequences, does not respond to 1,25(OH)2D3 rules out the possible role of VDR as a direct transrepressor of the cyclin D1 promoter. In summary, this work presents evidence for a novel mechanism for the poorly understood antiproliferative actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 in TGF-α/EGFR-overexpressing cells.

Although the cellular functions of PTEN as a tumor suppressor have been well characterized, the mechanism by which PTEN activity is modulated by other signal molecules in vivo remains poorly understood. In searching for potential PTEN modulators through protein-protein interaction, we identified the major vault protein (MVP) as a dominant PTEN-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. MVP is the major structural component of vault, the largest intracellular ribonucleoprotein particle. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction between PTEN and MVP in transfected mammalian cells. More importantly, we found that a significant portion of endogenous PTEN associates with vault particles in human HeLa cells. Deletion mutation analysis demonstrated that MVP binds to the C2 domain of PTEN and that PTEN interacts with MVP through its EF hand-like motif. Furthermore, the in vitro binding experiments revealed that the interaction of PTEN with MVP is Ca2+-dependent.

The genetic evidence that PTEN is an important tumor suppressor is supported by the fact that heterozygous disruption of the PTEN gene in knockout mice results in the spontaneous development of tumors (8Di Cristofano A. Pesce B. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 348-355Google Scholar, 9Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated that the tumor suppressor functions of PTEN are linked primarily with the lipid phosphatase activity and its association with the well defined phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway (reviewed in Refs. 14Maehama T.

Substantial progress has been made in the characterization of PTEN as a tumor suppressor as well as in the regulation of many cellular processes including growth, adhesion, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which PTEN activity is modulated in various cellular signaling complexes remains elusive. It is assumed that the activity and the cellular function of PTEN may be regulated through in vivoprotein-protein interactions. PTEN contains a number of putative regulatory modules, including the N-terminal phosphoinositide binding motif, a C2 domain, a PDZ-binding site, and two proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich segments (21Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Google Scholar). The C2 domain of PTEN has been implicated in mediating membrane association (22Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M., Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of PTEN interacts with several PDZ domain-containing proteins such as hDLG, hMAST205, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3 (23Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S., Do, D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Google Scholar, 24Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Laura R.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37Google Scholar). The interaction of PTEN with these proteins may be important for its biological function, as it has been reported that MAGI-2 and MAGI-3 can enhance the activity of PTEN (23Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S., Do, D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Google Scholar, 24Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Laura R. Lee J., Gu, Q. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Google Scholar). In contrast, several groups found that the PDZ-binding site of PTEN is not required for tumor suppression or other biological activities (21Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Google Scholar, 25Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A. Baumgard M.L. Pero R. Byreddy D.V. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L.

Therefore, the complete spectrum of PTEN-interacting proteins and the effects of the interactions on PTEN function are not yet defined. To date, the vault complex with a molecular mass of 13 MDa is the largest intracellular ribonucleoprotein particle to be described. Vaults were first observed in preparations of clathrin-coated vesicles (29Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar) and were so-named because of their arched morphology, reminiscent of the vaulted ceilings of a cathedral (29Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Google Scholar). Vaults are conserved in phylogenetic groups as diverse as mammals, avians, amphibians, sea urchins, and slime molds. The mammalian vaults comprise three proteins, the major vault protein (MVP) 1The abbreviations used are: MVP, major vault protein; VPARP, vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PLC, phospholipase C. 1The abbreviations used are: MVP, major vault protein; VPARP, vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PLC, phospholipase C. (30Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 12: 225-235Google Scholar), the vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VPARP) (31Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 917-928Google Scholar), and the telomerase-associated protein 1 (32Kickhoefer V.A. Stephen A.G. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32712-32717Google Scholar), as well as one or more small untranslated RNA molecules (33Kickhoefer V.A. Searles R.P. Kedersha N.L. Garber M.E. Johnson D.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7868-7873Google Scholar). MVP constitutes >70% of the total mass and is the major vault structural component. The precise cellular function(s) of the vaults are not yet completely understood. However, several studies have implicated that the vaults are involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The vaults apparently reside in the cytoplasm, but ∼5% of the vaults are occasionally localized to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear membrane at or near nuclear pore complexes (34Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Google Scholar). Moreover, the 31-Å resolution structure of vault determined by cryoelectron microscopy reveals a hollow interior that is big enough to enclose a complex as large as intact ribosome (35Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 371-379Google Scholar). The hollow structure may indicate an important role for vault in the transport/sequestration of cellular molecules. In addition, MVP has been identified as the lung resistance-related protein (36Scheffer G.L. Wijngaard P.L.J. Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Slovak M.L. Pinedo H.M. Meijer C.J.L.M. Clevers H.C. Scheper R.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 578-582Google Scholar). Many multidrug-resistant cancer cells frequently overexpress MVP/lung resistance-related protein and intact vault particles (reviewed in Ref. 37Scheffer G.L. Schroeijers A.B. Izquierdo M.A. Wiemer E.A. Scheper R.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 550-556Google Scholar). How vault functions in drug resistance is unknown. It has been proposed that vault may function as a transporter or sequester, but proteins or protein complexes that can be transported or sequestered by this particle have yet to be identified. We have employed the protein-protein interaction approach to screen for signaling molecules potentially modulating the activity of PTEN and found that PTEN associates with both MVP and intact vault particles. Rabbit anti-PTEN polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-lung resistance-related protein (MVP) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Myc (clone 9E10) monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10) used for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5) used for Western blot was prepared from the culture medium of hybridomas (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC). Nitrocellulose membrane Hybond-ECL was from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent kit was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Diagnostics. HeLa and 293T cells, obtained from ATCC, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Full-length PTEN was amplified by PCR from a mammary gland cDNA library using Pfu DNA polymerase and inserted into pGEM-T vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). An aspartic acid 92 to alanine mutant (PTEN-D92A) was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. This PTEN-D92A mutant was cloned in-frame downstream of the DNA binding domain of LexA in the pBTM-116-src vector (38Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544Google Scholar) to form the bait construct (LexA-PTEN-D92A). The human lung cDNA library expressed as fusion proteins with the activation domain of GAL4 in the pACT2 vector were obtained from Clontech. The two-hybrid screen was carried out using the Clontech systems according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the bait DNA and library DNA were sequentially transformed into the yeast strain L40α. Positive colonies growing on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine were further screened for expression of β-galactosidase. The plasmid DNA was recovered from the His+/LacZ+ colonies and identified by DNA sequencing. To construct a plasmid for the expression of MVP in mammalian cells, a cDNA clone (P-22), isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen, encoding the amino acid residues Gln113to the end of the C terminus of MVP in pACT2 vector was digested withBglII, and the DNA fragment was inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI site. The resulting plasmid, termed pHA-MVP/113–893, expresses an HA-tagged MVP fragment. A C-terminal Myc-tagged PTEN construct (pPTEN-myc) was obtained by inserting the full coding region of PTEN cDNA, amplified by PCR with primers incorporating an HindIII site, into pcDNA3-myc-His-(-C) vector (Invitrogen) at the same site. The plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline once and lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of this whole cell lysate was removed, and the remaining lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (40Wu L., Fu, J. Shen H.-S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) overnight and then incubated with the first antibodies for 2 h. After washing four times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with the second antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h and then washed four times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20. The blots were developed using the Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 113–474 of MVP was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pGEX-5X1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli strain DH10 by induction with 25 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 16 h and purified as described previously (41Yu Z., Su, L. Hoglinger O. Jaramillo M.L. Banville D. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3687-3694Google Scholar). HeLa cells were lysed with Buffer B (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and EDTA-free mixture protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as whole cell lysates. For binding assays, glutathione-Sepharose beads with ∼1 μg of bound GST or GST fusion protein were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with 1 ml of HeLa cell lysates in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+, and as a negative control, with 1 ml of Buffer B, as well. The beads were washed four times with Buffer B containing the same concentration of Ca2+ as that in the binding solution, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. HeLa cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with Buffer C (20 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 10% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, and EDTA-free mixture protease inhibitors). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C, and 250 μl of whole cell lysates were loaded on the top of 30–60% sucrose gradients (5 ml) prepared in Buffer C and centrifuged for 3 h at 50,000 rpm using a Beckman Vti65 rotor. Twenty fractions (250 μl each) were collected starting from the bottom of the tube to avoid contamination. The fractions were directly used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. To identify PTEN-interacting proteins and its potential substrates, we carried out a modified yeast two-hybrid screen with the expression of an exogenous protein-tyrosine kinase (38Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544Google Scholar). The full-length PTEN with a mutation of aspartic acid 92 to alanine (PTEN-D92A), which dramatically reduces the protein-tyrosine phosphatase catalytic activity but retains the binding ability to its substrates (39Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Google Scholar), was cloned into the plasmid pBTM-116-Src (38Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544Google Scholar). Transformation of the plasmid into yeast results in the expression of the LexA DNA binding domain-PTEN-D92A fusion protein and c-Src kinase. This allows us to identify both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent interactions. Starting from 6.9 × 106 primary transformants using a human lung cDNA library, ∼60 colonies were positive for both HIS3 and LacZ expression. DNA sequencing revealed that almost half of these positive clones (25 clones) encode the MVP, the major component of vault particles. The shortest MVP clone identified contains an open reading frame encoding amino acid Gln113 to the C terminus (Arg893). The interaction specificity was confirmed by co-transforming an MVP clone with PTEN and some unrelated baits such as the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, respectively, into yeast. The β-galactosidase filter lift assay revealed that MVP specifically interacted with PTEN but not with SHP-1 or SHP-2 though both were well expressed as indicated by their interaction with Grb2 in this assay (TableI). We next determined whether the interaction between PTEN and MVP is tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent. To do so, we cloned PTEN into the pBTM-116 vector that does not express Src kinase and carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay using this construct. As shown in Table I, the presence of Src is not required for the interaction of MVP with PTEN.Table IMVP interacts with PTEN but not with SHP-1 in yeast two-hybrid assayBD-PTEN + SrcBD-PTENBD-SHP-1 + SrcBD-SHP-2 + SrcAD-MVP++++−−AD-Grb2NDND++++, yeast colonies turned blue after 30 min of incubation. +, yeast colonies turned blue after 2 h of incubation. −, yeast colonies did not turn blue after 6 h of incubation.

To determine whether MVP interacts with PTEN in mammalian cells, we co-transfected PTEN-myc (C-terminal Myc-tagged PTEN) with HA-MVP/113–893 (N-terminal HA-tagged MVP fragment containing the amino acid residues Gln113 to the C terminus) into 293T cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti-Myc antibody or an anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitants were subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HA-MVP/113–893 was detected in the anti-myc immunoprecipitant, indicating that HA-MVP/113–893 was co-precipitated with PTEN-myc. As a negative control, mouse IgG did not precipitate HA-MVP/113–893. The reciprocal experiment further confirmed the association of these two proteins in 293T cells, as PTEN-myc was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MVP/113–893 by the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 B). MVP is the major component of the vault particle, which is comprised of three proteins and at least one small untranslated RNA molecule. To investigate whether PTEN interacts with the assembled vault complex, we isolated vault particles from HeLa cells by centrifugation on a 30–60% sucrose gradient. Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions with anti-MVP antibody showed that the vault particles were present in fraction 11 to fraction 17 with a peak concentration in fraction 13. Very little MVP was detected in the top gradient fractions containing the original whole cell lysates, indicating that most MVP molecules are assembled into the vault particles in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis of the same fractions with anti-PTEN antibody indicated that PTEN was distributed in the top gradient fractions of the original whole cell lysates, as well as in the fractions 12–15 where the vault particles were located. PTEN was not detected in fractions 8–11, indicating that the PTEN co-localized with the vault fractions was not contamination derived from the top fractions. To further exclude the possibility of contamination of PTEN in the vault fractions 12–15 from the whole cell lysates, we analyzed two unrelated proteins Dok1 and Erk1 in the same fractions. As shown in Fig. 2, C andD, neither Dok1 nor Erk1 was detected in the vault fractions. These results strongly suggest that endogenous PTEN associates with intact vault particles in HeLa cells. The association of endogenous PTEN with vault particles prompted us to define the mechanism of the association between PTEN and MVP. We first mapped the MVP binding region of PTEN by deletion analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system. PTEN is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain, followed by a C2 domain, two PEST segments, and a PDZ domain binding motif. We made mutations with sequential deletion of each C-terminal functional region. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the deletion of the PDZ domain binding motif (the last three amino acid residues) and the PEST segments did not affect the interaction. However, the deletion of the C2 domain completely abolished the interaction. This result suggests that the C2 domain is necessary for the interaction of PTEN with MVP. Similarly, we determined which region of MVP was responsible for the interaction. For this, we first searched any putative structural or functional domains in MVP. As reported by van Zon et al.(42van Zon A. Mossink M.H. Schoester M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Sonneveld P. Wiemer E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 535-541Google Scholar), the MVP molecule contains three putative EF hand repeats in the N-terminal half and a coiled-coil conformation in the C-terminal half. EF hand is a helix-loop-helix motif. In general, six amino acid residues in position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 of the loop structure are involved in calcium binding. These amino acid residues are conserved in the first two EF hand motifs, but not all are conserved in the third one though the overall homology between the second and the third EF hands (52% identity) is higher than that between the first and the second ones (42% identity). The shortest MVP clone (P-22) we identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen encodes the peptide sequence from Gln113 to the C terminus (Arg893) and contains both the EF hand repeats and the coiled-coil sequence. Based on this clone, we made constructs that consist of the N-terminal part of P-22 (MVP113–620) including the EF hands and its C-terminal part (MVP621–893) including the coiled-coil domain, respectively. The β-galactosidase assay experiments showed that PTEN interacted with the N-terminal fragment (MVP113–620) but not with the C-terminal part (MVP621–893) (Fig. 3 B). Based on these results, we further made sequential deletions of the N-terminal fragment starting from both the N terminus and the C terminus. As shown in Fig. 3 B, deletion of a short N-terminal region (from amino acid 113 to amino acid 156) containing part of the first EF hand sequence resulted in complete disruption of the interaction between MVP and PTEN, suggesting that the first EF hand is essential for the interaction. With the C-terminal deletion analysis, the interaction region for MVP was finally narrowed down to a fragment containing residues 113–222 that is composed of the first two EF hand repeats. Taken together, PTEN interacts with MVP through the C2 domain of PTEN and the first two EF hand domains of MVP. Because EF hands are Ca2+ binding motifs, and the binding of Ca2+ induces the conformation change of EF hands, we were interested in testing whether the interaction of MVP with PTEN requires Ca2+. We carried out GST pull down experiments using a GST fusion protein containing amino acid residues 113–474 of MVP (GST-MVP/113–474). As shown in Fig.4 A, PTEN was pulled down by GST-MVP/113–474 from HeLa cell lysates in the presence of Ca2+ (lane 5) but not in its absence (lane 7). In the same conditions, PTEN was not precipitated by GST alone (lane 3). As a negative control, we also incubated GST fusion proteins with lysis buffer in the pull down experiment to exclude the unspecific binding of anti-PTEN antibody to the GST fusion proteins or the co-purified bacteria proteins in the Western blot analysis. The band with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa recognized by anti-PTEN antibody in the Western blot analysis was not detected in the control samples (pull down of lysis buffer) (lanes 2,4, and 6). Further experiments revealed that 5 mm Ca2+ is required for maximum binding (Fig.4 B). These results suggest that PTEN interacts with MVP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In this study we found that endogenous PTEN associates with the vault particle, the largest intracellular ribonucleoprotein particle described to date. The precise cellular function(s) of the vault complex are not yet completely revealed. However, its unique structure and subcellular localization indicate that vault may be involved in the transport/sequestration of cellular molecules. Although the majority of vaults are present in the cytoplasm, a subset of vaults localizes to the nuclear membrane at or near the nuclear pore complexes (34Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Google Scholar). The structure of vault shows a hollow interior that is big enough to enclose a complex as large as an intact ribosome (35Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 371-379Google Scholar). Identification of vault cargos would verify its role in molecular transportation. It has been reported recently that the vaults associate with the estrogen receptor in the nucleus of MCF7 cells, and this association increases in response to estrogen stimulation (43Abbondanza C. Rossi V. Roscigno A. Gallo L. Belsito A. Piluso G. Medici N. Nigro V. Molinari A.M. Moncharmont B. Puca G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1301-1310Google Scholar). At present, the physiological function of the association between PTEN and vault is not clear. It is known that the substrate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) of PTEN is localized to the membrane, whereas PTEN is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm. However, in some cell lines, PTEN is also localized in the nucleus (12Tamura M., Gu, J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Google Scholar, 44Gimm O. Perren A.

Sultana N. Schonhoff C.M. Mitra P. Poluha W. Lambert S. Quesenberry P.J. Litofsky N.S. Recht L.D. Nabi R. Miller S.J. Ohta S. Neel B.G. Ross A.H. J.

Zhou X.P. Cummings M.C. Pavey S. Hayward N.K. Eng C. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 63-67Google Scholar). PTEN does not contain a nuclear localization signal, and the mechanism by which PTEN is localized to the nucleus is unknown. Because the endogenous PTEN interacts with vault that can be localized in the nuclear membrane, it is possible that vault mediate the cellular localization of PTEN. Evidence has been emerging recently that both MVP and the vault particle are frequently up-regulated in multidrug-resistant cancer cells (reviewed in Ref. 37Scheffer G.L. Schroeijers A.B. Izquierdo M.A. Wiemer E.A. Scheper R.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 550-556Google Scholar). Although it has not been firmly proven that the drug-resistance phenotype is directly caused by the overexpression of vaults, some studies have demonstrated that reduction of MVP expression reversed the drug-resistance phenotype, and overexpression of MVP could induce drug resistance (48Kitazono M. Sumizawa T. Takebayashi Y. Chen Z.S. Furukawa T. Nagayama S. Tani A. Takao S. Aikou T. Akiyama S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1647-1653Google Scholar, 49Cheng S.H. Lam W. Lee A.S.

Rome L.H. Moore R.E. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 149-156Google Scholar). Proteins responsible for drug resistance usually belong to the transmembrane transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MDR protein 1 (MRP1), and breast cancer-resistance protein (BCRP), which act by decreasing intracellular drug concentrations (reviewed in Ref. 37Scheffer G.L. Schroeijers A.B. Izquierdo M.A. Wiemer E.A. Scheper R.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 550-556Google Scholar). How vaults mediate drug resistance in cancer cells is unclear. It may act by binding drugs or drug-binding proteins and sequestering them or transporting them to a cellular location where the drug targets are not located. Alternatively, it may act by regulating the function of other proteins indirectly related to drug resistance. PTEN, as an enzyme that dephosphorylates PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, negatively regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and cell growth. Down-regulation of PTEN activity and/or its transient translocalization to membrane will induce uncontrolled cell growth that could result in resistance to drug treatment. Hence, vaults may inhibit PTEN function through their interaction to promote drug resistance in cancer cells. The sequential deletion experiments suggest that the interaction between these two proteins is through the C2 domain of PTEN and the two EF hands of MVP. The pair of EF hands is both necessary and sufficient for the interaction. As described above, vault consists of multiple copies of three proteins, and MVP is the major vault component. Each vault particle contains ∼eight VPARP, two telomerase-associated protein 1, and 96 MVP molecules. Recently, van Zon et al.(42van Zon A. Mossink M.H. Schoester M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Sonneveld P. Wiemer E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 535-541Google Scholar) characterized the function of each structural domain of these three proteins for the assembly of the vault particles. It was found that MVP self-associates through its C-terminal coiled-coil sequence and interacts with VPARP through its N-terminal region. MVP does not directly interact with telomerase-associated protein 1. Because the ratio of VPARP to MVP molecules in the vault particle is 8/96, the N terminus of MVP will not be completely occupied by VPARP. As a result, some of the EF hand motifs may be exposed, making it possible for vault to associate with other proteins. Both the C2 domains and the EF hands are characterized as Ca2+ binding domains although the C2 domain of PTEN seems not to bind Ca2+. We found that thein vitro interaction between PTEN and MVP requires Ca2+, implying that Ca2+ may regulate the association of PTEN with the vault particles in vivo. Protein-protein interaction through C2 domain and EF hands is not a general phenomenon. However, some proteins do contain both the C2 domains and the EF hands, such as the phospholipase C (PLC) family proteins (51Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 255-267Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that the second lobe of the EF hands of PLC-δ1 makes an interaction with its C2 domain (51Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 255-267Google Scholar). The C2 domain of PTEN has structural similarity to that of PLC-δ1 with an root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å for 75 Cα atoms (21Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Google Scholar). It would be interesting to find out whether the EF hands of MVP interact with the C2 domain of PTEN with a mechanism similar to that of the intramolecular interaction of the EF hands and the C2 domain of PLC-δ1.

https://openalex.org/W2075634772,"The cAMP-specific PDE4 family consists of four genes, each expressed as several splice variants. These variants are termed long and short forms depending on the presence or absence of two unique N-terminal domains called upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and 2). UCR1 and UCR2 have been shown to form a module necessary for the activation of PDE4 upon phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA). Here we have uncovered PDE4 oligomerization as a novel function for the UCR1/UCR2 module. Using several different approaches including gel filtration, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, pull-down of differentially tagged PDE constructs, and yeast two-hybrid assay, we show that the long PDE4 splice variant PDE4D3 behaves as a dimer, whereas the short splice variant PDE4D2 is a monomer. Internal deletions of either the C-terminal portion of UCR1 or the N-terminal portion of UCR2 abolishes dimerization of PDE4D3 indicating that both domains are involved in this intermolecular interaction. The dimerization, however, is structurally distinguishable from a previously described intramolecular interaction involving the same domains. PKA phosphorylation and site-directed mutagenesis shown to ablate the latter do not interfere with dimerization.

The second messengers cAMP and cGMP are key molecules for transducing the action of extracellular signals such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and light into the most diverse cell functions, thus playing an important role in a wide array of physiological processes that include vision, cell growth and division, memory, and immune response (1Beavo J.A.

Intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels are determined by the rates of their synthesis by adenylyl cyclases and of their degradation through phosphodiesterases, enzymes that hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond and generate the corresponding 5′-nucleoside monophosphates. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase; CaMK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; ERK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2; LR, linker region; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PKA, cAMP-dependent kinase; UCR, upstream conserved region; aa, amino acids. compose a superfamily of isoenzymes that are divided into 11 PDE families on the basis of their sequence homology and enzymatic properties (2Francis S.H.

They all share a highly conserved catalytic domain of about 270 amino acids fused to additional N- and/or C-terminal sequences that contain distinct domains unique to the members of a PDE family. These terminal domains determine several properties of the PDEs such as the regulation of enzyme activity by post-translational modifications (e.g.phosphorylation by PKA, PKB, ERK2, CaMK, and PKG, Refs. 6Sette C.

A structural feature unique to the cAMP-specific PDE4 family is the presence of two domains N-terminal to the catalytic domain called upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2). The four genes included in the PDE4 family are each expressed as various splice variants that are distinguished as long and short forms depending on the presence of the UCRs (17Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Google Scholar, 18Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

Biol. 2001; 69: 249-315Google Scholar). Long forms contain both UCR1 and UCR2, whereas short forms lack UCR1 but still possess all, or at least a portion, of UCR2. In the long PDE4 splice variants where both domains are present, UCR1 and UCR2 have been shown to interact with each other, and this interaction was thought to be intramolecular (21Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Google Scholar, 22Beard M.B. Olsen A.E. Jones R.E. Erdogan S. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10349-10358Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis further indicated that this interaction may involve positively charged residues in UCR1 (Arg-98 and Arg-101 in PDE4D3) and several negatively charged residues in UCR2 (Glu-146, Glu-147, and Asp-149 in PDE4D3, Ref. 22Beard M.B. Olsen A.E. Jones R.E. Erdogan S. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10349-10358Google Scholar). In these studies, it was demonstrated that the interaction between the two domains constitutes an important module involved in the regulation of the enzyme activity in several different ways. Phosphorylation of a serine residue at the N terminus of UCR1 (Ser-54 in PDE4D3) by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, Ref. 6Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Google Scholar), which causes enzyme activation, alters the interaction between UCR1 and UCR2. As UCR2 may function as an autoinhibitory domain of the catalytic center, a probable mechanism for PDE4 activation is that the PKA phosphorylation leads to an altered UCR1-UCR2 interaction that removes the autoinhibitory effect of UCR2 on the catalytic site (6Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Google Scholar, 21Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Google Scholar, 22Beard M.B. Olsen A.E. Jones R.E. Erdogan S. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10349-10358Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) at the PDE4 C terminus affects the PDE4 enzyme activity in different ways that depend on the presence of the UCRs. Long PDE4 isoforms containing both a complete UCR1 and UCR2 were inhibited by ERK2 phosphorylation whereas the short splice form PDE4D1, which lacks UCR1, was activated (8Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Google Scholar, 23MacKenzie S.J. Baillie G.S. McPhee I. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16609-16617Google Scholar) thus underlining the role of the UCR1/2 module for the regulation of enzyme activity. In our previous report, the possibility was raised that disruption of oligomerization may explain some of the properties associated with UCR1/UCR2 (21Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Google Scholar). Here, we have further investigated the quaternary structure organization of PDE4 splice variants. We demonstrate that long PDE4 splice variants containing both UCR1 and UCR2 form dimers whereas short forms lacking UCR1 are monomers. The domain responsible for enzyme dimerization was mapped to the region between the C terminus of UCR1 (UCR1C) and the N terminus of UCR2 (UCR2N), and engineered deletion of either subdomain ablates dimerization. The dimerization domain involves, therefore, the same domains that were previously shown to interact with each other in an intramolecular interaction (21Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol.

PCR was routinely performed using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To generate a vector for expression of human PDE4D3 in mammalian cell lines, a cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame of PDE4D3 was amplified from a PDE4D3 plasmid that was previously generated in the laboratory (24Nemoz G. Zhang R. Sette C. Conti M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 97-102Google Scholar) using primers P1/P2 and cloned into restriction enzyme sitesEcoRI/SalI of the pCMV5 vector. The construct was completely sequenced to exclude random mutagenesis and was used as a template for all other cloning strategies. To generate constructs encoding nested deletions of the UCR subdomains, theEcoRI/BstEII fragment within the PDE4D3-pCMV5 construct was replaced by ligating the rest of the vector with each of two small fragments that had been generated by PCR and digested with the respective restriction enzymes EcoRI/XbaI andXbaI/BstEII, respectively. The PCR-fragments were amplified with primers P1/P3 and P4/P5, P1/P6 and P7/P5, and P1/P3 and P7/P5 to obtain PDE4D3-ΔUCR1C (Δ80–116), PDE4D3-ΔUCR2N (Δ133–166), and PDE4D3-ΔUCR1C/2N (Δ80–166), respectively. Vectors encoding the various ΔCAT-constructs (Δ599–672) were generated by ligating the BstEII/SalI fragment obtained from the digest of PCR product P1/P5 with theSalI/BstEII vector fragments excised from either the PDE4D3-pCMV5 vector or the PDE4D3-ΔUCR-pCMV5 vectors to generate PDE4D3-ΔCAT and PDE4D3-ΔCAT-ΔUCR constructs, respectively. The single point mutations R98A, R101A, E147A, and D149A were inserted into the PDE4D3-ΔCAT-pCMV5 vector using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In a first round, mutations R98A/R101A were generated using primers P8/P9, and the resulting construct was then used as PCR template for a second mutagenesis using primers P10/P11 to introduce the additional mutations E147A/D149A. Vectors encoding PDE4D2 and PDE4D2-ΔCAT were constructed by ligating each of the two fragments as follows: 1) theEcoRI/BstEII fragment obtained from the digest of the PCR product P12/P5; and 2) the BstEII/EcoRI vector fragment excised from either the PDE4D3-pCMV5 vector or the PDE4D3-ΔCAT-pCMV5 vector to generate PDE4D2 and PDE4D2-ΔCAT, respectively. To design the constructs used in yeast two-hybrid experiments (see Fig. 5 A) cDNAs encoding PDE4D3 fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into either theXhoI/EcoRI restriction enzyme sites of the pGAD10 vector (AD-constructs; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or the EcoRI/SalI restriction enzyme sites of the pAS2.1 vector (BD-constructs, Clontech). For simplicity, only the primers used are given for each construct: AD-UCR2N (P13/P14; aa 132–185); AD-UCR1C (P15/P16; aa 80–116); AD-UCR1C-LR1 (P15/P17; aa 80–132); AD-UCR1C-UCR2N (P15/P14; aa 80–185); BD-UCR1C (P18/P19; aa 80–116); and BD-UCR1C-UCR2N (P18/P20; aa 80–185). The N-terminal Myc-tagged constructs used in Fig. 4 were generated by ligating the following three fragments for each of them: (a) an EcoRI/BstEII-digested PCR product; (b) the BstEII/SalI fragment encoding the catalytic domain and the C terminus of PDE4D3 excised from the PDE4D3-pCMV5 vector; and (c) theEcoRI/SalI-digested pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). The PCR products used as fragments (a) were amplified using primer pairs P21/P5, P22/P5, P23/P5, and P24/P5 to generate Myc-4D3, Myc-4D3-Δ1–79, Myc-4D3-Δ1–131, and Myc-4D3-Δ1–166, respectively. The PCR product amplified with primers P25/P26 (or P27/P26) was cloned into the respective restriction enzyme sites of the pcDNA3.1/V5/His-Topo vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the pcDNA3.1/myc-HisB vector (Invitrogen) to generate PDE4D3-V5/His (or PDE4D2-V5/His) and PDE4D3-Myc/His (or PDE4D2-Myc/His), respectively.Figure 4Mapping of the PDE4D dimerization domain. Vectors encoding N-terminally Myc-tagged full-length PDE4D3 (lanes 1 and 2) as well as three Myc-tagged PDE4D3 constructs with increasing N-terminal deletions (lanes 3–8) were expressed in COS7 cells either alone (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or co-expressed with a V5/His-tagged PDE4D3 construct (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8; see scheme for design of constructs). Cell cultures were transfected, harvested, and lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the cell lysates were then applied to pull-down experiments using the α-V5 mAb that recognizes the V5 tag of the PDE4D3-V5/His construct. Both the immunoprecipitates (two lower panels) as well as the cell lysates used as input for pull-down experiments (two upper panels) were analyzed for the tagged PDE4D constructs by Western blotting using the α-V5 and the α-Myc mAbs. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in all lanes. All data are representative of experiments performed at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MA10 cells (mouse Leydig tumor cells) were grown in Waymouth MB725 medium (pH 7.5) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 1.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 15% horse serum, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. FRTL5 cells (rat thyroid cells) were cultured in Coon's F-12 medium containing 2.6 g/liter NaHCO3, 5% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 1 milliunit/ml TSH. One day before harvest, cells were rinsed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution and cultured for an additional 24 h in Coon's F-12 medium containing 2.6 g/liter NaHCO3, 30 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin to induce quiescence. COS7 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) and Sf9 insect cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium) and Sf900 medium, respectively, each supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27 °C, whereas the three mammalian cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For recombinant expression of PDE constructs in MA10 and COS7 cells, cultures were grown to 50% confluency on 100-mm dishes and then transfected with recombinant vector DNA using the Effectene transfection system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h of further incubation, cells were routinely harvested in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm mycrocystin, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. Protein G-Sepharose was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then loaded with the antibody in a reaction mixture containing 20 μl of protein G Sepharose beads, 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and the respective affinity-purified antibody and was incubated in a rotating mixer for 60 min at 4 °C. The unbound antibody was removed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, and the immobilized antibody was then incubated with the enzyme extracts for 2 h at 4 °C in a rotating mixer. The immunoprecipitate was then separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,000 ×g and was washed three times by resuspension and recentrifugation in the same buffer that was used for the preparation of the cell extracts. After the last centrifugation, the immunoprecipitate was eluted from the Sepharose beads by boiling the samples for 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer. SDS/PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using 8 or 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Protein samples were diluted with 4× concentrated Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, subjected to electrophoresis, and blotted onto Immobilon membranes. Western blot analysis was then performed using the following antibodies: 1) the monoclonal α-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) that recognizes the artificial V5-tag; 2) the monoclonal α-Myc antibody that recognizes the artificial Myc-tag; 3) the monoclonal antibody M3S1 raised against the C-terminal region of PDE4D; and 4) the polyclonal antibody K116 that recognizes the N-terminal domain of all PDE4 subtypes. Immunoreactive bands were detected by using either peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse/anti-rabbit antibodies and the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) or the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse/anti-rabbit antibodies and the corresponding detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA). PDE activity was measured according to the method of Thompson and Appleman (26Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Google Scholar). In brief, samples were assayed in a reaction mixture of 200 μl containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm cAMP, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μCi of [3H]cAMP for 10 min at 33 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 10 mm EDTA in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by heat inactivation in a boiling water bath for 1 min. The PDE reaction product 5′-AMP was then hydrolyzed by incubation of the assay mixture with 50 μg of Crotalus atrox snake venom (Sigma) for 20 min at 33 °C, and the resulting adenosine was separated by anion exchange chromatography using 1 ml of AG1-X8 resin and quantitated by scintillation counting. For gel filtration experiments, cells were harvested in a 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmEGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 20% ethylene glycol, 1 mm AEBSF, and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics). The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min followed by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, and 500 μl of the high speed supernatants were then loaded on a TSK-3000 analytical gel filtration column. The samples were eluted with a 10 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, and 20% ethylene glycol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 500 μl were collected and assayed for PDE activity. Bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa; 85 Å), horse ferritin (440 kDa; 61 Å), bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), rabbit aldolase (158 kDa; 48.1 Å), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa; 35.5 Å), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa; 30.5 Å), horse myoglobin (17 kDa), and cobalamin (1.35 kDa) were used as molecular mass markers. Density gradients from 5 to 33% sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol were prepared in 14 × 89-mm centrifugation tubes (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) using the Jule gradient former (Jule Inc., New Haven, CT). The gradients were stored overnight at 4 °C before they were loaded with 200 μl of the soluble cell extracts (100,000 × gsupernatant) or marker proteins and centrifuged for 36 h at 28,000 rpm (Fig. 3) or 24 h at 40,000 rpm (Fig. 6 B) in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Fractions of 200 μl were then collected starting from the bottom of the tube using a peristaltic pump and analyzed for PDE activity or protein concentration (molecular mass markers). The following proteins were used as molecular mass markers: bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa; 19 S), bovine liver catalase (250 kDa; 11.3 S), rabbit aldolase (158 kDa; 7.3 S), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa; 4.6 S), and chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa; 3.5 S).Figure 6Nested deletion of UCR1C and/or UCR2N ablates PDE4D3 dimerization in gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A, PDE4D3-ΔCAT (○) and PDE4D3-ΔCAT constructs carrying additional nested deletions of either UCR1C (*; deletion of aa 80–116) or UCR2N (▴; deletion of aa 133–166), or carrying single point mutations of the four charged residues previously shown to disrupt the intramolecular interaction between UCR1C and UCR2N (●) were transfected in MA-10 cells. High speed supernatants of the resulting cell homogenates were used for the determination of apparent molecular weights by gel filtration on a TSK 3000 column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These data are representative of experiments performed three times.B, PDE4D3-ΔCAT (●) and PDE4D3-ΔCAT-ΔUCR1C/2N (○), both expressed in COS7 cells, were fractionated by density gradient centrifugation using 5–33% linear sucrose gradients. After centrifugation for 24 h at 40,000 rpm, 200-μl fractions were collected and analyzed for PDE activity. Marker proteins were separated on parallel gradients at the same time (arrows). The data are representative of experiments performed two times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Saccharomyces cerevisae strain Y190 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was co-transformed with a pGAD10 vector construct (encoding the GAL4 activation domain either alone or fused to a PDE4D fragment) and a pAS2.1 vector construct (encoding the GAL4 binding domain either alone or fused to a PDE4D fragment) using the lithium acetate method according to Clontech's yeast two-hybrid protocol. The transformants were then streaked on selection medium plates (-S.D. = selection medium), lacking either leucine and trytophan (-2 S.D.), or lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (-3 S.D.) and incubated for 3–5 days at 30 °C. For qualitative detection of β-galactosidase activity, the colony filter-lift assay was applied according to Clontech's manual. For the photograph shown in Fig. 5 B, the yeast transformants were restreaked on one selection medium plate (-2 S.D.) and analyzed using the colony filter-lift assay. For in vitrophosphorylation experiments, cytosolic supernatants of recombinant PDE constructs expressed in MA10 cells were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mmMgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 1.0 unit of the PKA catalytic subunit.

As a first approach to investigate PDE4 oligomerization, we performed pull-down experiments utilizing differentially tagged PDE4D constructs. For this purpose, two constructs C-terminally tagged with either a V5/His- or Myc/His tag were generated for both PDE4D3 and PDE4D2 as representatives of the PDE4 long and short splice variants, respectively.

In particular, PDK1 plays an important role in regulating the Akt survival pathway by phosphorylating Akt on Thr-308. PDK1 kinase activity was thought to be constitutively active; however, recent reports suggested that its activity is regulated by binding to other proteins, such as protein kinase C-related kinase-2 (PRK2), p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase-2 (RSK2), and heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Here we report that PDK1 binds to 14-3-3 proteins in vivo and in vitrothrough the sequence surrounding Ser-241, a residue that is phosphorylated by itself and is critical for its kinase activity. Mutation of PDK1 to increase its binding to 14-3-3 decreased its kinase activity in vivo. By contrast, mutation of PDK1 to decrease its interaction with 14-3-3 resulted in increased PDK1 kinase activity. Moreover, incubation of wild-type PDK1 with recombinant 14-3-3in vitro decreased its kinase activity. These data indicate that PDK1 kinase activity is negatively regulated by binding to 14-3-3 through the PDK1 autophosphorylation site Ser-241. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a central role in activating the protein kinase A, G, and C subfamily.

These lipids then induce activation of several members of the AGC family of protein kinases including Akt, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), serum, and glucocorticoid–inducible kinases (SGKs), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Activated kinases, then, mediate survival-signal transduction by phosphorylating downstream key regulatory proteins.3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) was originally identified as a kinase that could phosphorylate Akt on its activation loop (residue Thr-308) (4Alessi D.R.

Later studies, however, have showed that PDK1 is not just an Akt kinase but also a kinase phosphorylating p70S6K, SGKs, PKC isoforms, and p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) at the equivalent residues of Thr-308 of Akt (reviewed in Ref. 7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Therefore, PDK1 plays a central role in activating the AGC family of protein kinases. In the case of Akt, the interaction of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate with the pleckstrin homology domain recruits Akt to the plasma membrane and promotes conformational change, which results in phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 by PDK1 and at Ser-473 by an as yet unidentified kinase (so called PDK2) (7Vanhaesebroeck B.

In the case of p70S6K, SGKs, and PKC isoforms, however, the precise mechanisms for PDK1- dependent phosphorylation and activation are not well understood.PDK1 itself is also a member of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases and is phosphorylated on the Ser-241 activation loop (equivalent to Thr-308 of Akt) (7Vanhaesebroeck B.

Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), it is thought to phosphorylate itself at this same site. Further, mutation of Ser-241 to Ala was reported to abolish PDK1 kinase activity, and IGF-I stimulation did not cause further activation of PDK1 (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). According to these results, PDK1 was thought to be constitutively active. Several recent reports, however, suggested that PDK1 kinase activity is controlled by PDK1-associating proteins, such as PKC-related kinase-1 (PRK1)/PRK2 (10Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40400-40406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), PDK1-interacting fragment of PRK2 (11Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The interaction of PDK1 with the PDK1-interacting fragment of PRK2 converts PDK1 from an enzyme that phosphorylates Akt only at Thr-308 into a kinase that phosphorylates both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (11Balendran A.

Further, the association of PDK1 with RSK2 stimulates PDK1 activation and autophosphorylation (12Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Hsp90 participates in stability and signaling of PDK1 (13Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, PDK1 is not a constitutively active kinase but a kinase regulated by other interacting proteins.Members of the 14-3-3 protein family are highly conserved and widely expressed 28–31 kDa proteins that naturally assemble as homodimers or heterodimers. They consists of at least seven isoforms in mammals (β, γ, ε, η, ς, θ, τ, and ζ). The 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to interact with and to regulate proteins controlling a wide array of signaling pathways, including Raf-1, Bad, FKHRL1, and Cdc25c (reviewed in Ref. 14Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Binding of 14-3-3 to its partners depends on phosphorylation of the Ser or Thr residue in the recognition domains. Using peptides derived from Raf-1, Muslin et al. (15Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) identified that the motif optimal for association with 14-3-3 proteins was RSXpSXP, where pS represents phosphorylated Ser and X represents any amino acid. Moreover, using phosphopeptide libraries, Yaffe et al. (16Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) and Rittingeret al. (17Rittinger K. Budman J., Xu, J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) revealed that there are two preferred 14-3-3 binding motifs, RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP, and most of the 14-3-3 partners identified to date contain one of these motifs. It is important to note that several proteins that associate with 14-3-3 proteins do not contain either of these motifs, indicating that 14-3-3 can bind to some variation (e.g. RXXpS in PTPH1 and TH, RX(X)pSXX(X)S in Cbl and PKCμ). Furthermore, 14-3-3 bound to some proteins and peptides in a phosphorylation-independent manner (14Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 18Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar).In the course of searching protein-protein interacting motifs in PDK1, we found four 14-3-3 binding motifs (RXXpS). Thus, we started to examine the interaction between PDK1 and 14-3-3 proteins, and of the five 14-3-3 isoforms we tested, 14-3-3θ and η were found to form a complex with PDK1. Using site-directed mutants, we identified the 14-3-3 recognition site in PDK1. Because the association of PDK1 with 14-3-3 reduced PDK1 kinase activity in vitro andin vivo, we concluded that 14-3-3 negatively regulates PDK1 by complex formation.DISCUSSIONIt is clear that PDK1 plays a central role in activating the AGC subfamily of protein kinases (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 24Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These kinases then mediate intracellular signaling such as cell survival, cell growth, protein synthesis, and gene expression. PDK1 phosphorylates AGC kinase members at the residues equivalent to Thr-308 of Akt (known as activation loop or T-loop) (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). PDK1 is, itself, a member of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases. Thus, PDK1 phosphorylates itself at its activation loop (Ser-241), thereby activating itself (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although PDK1 kinase activity has been thought to be constitutively active and not further activated by growth factor stimulation, recent findings suggest that its activity and its character are controlled by interaction with other proteins. For example, when PDK1 interacts with the PDK1-interacting fragment of PRK2, it is converted to exhibit PDK2-like activity (11Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The association of PDK1 with RSK2 up-regulates PDK1 kinase activity and autophosphorylation (12Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We recently reported that PDK1 binds to Hsp90, and its binding prevents PDK1 from proteasome-dependent degradation and keeps it in a soluble and active conformational state (13Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, PDK1 kinase activity is promoted by phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, presumably by a member of the Src kinase family (25Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R., Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6642-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Here we provide evidence that PDK1 binds to 14-3-3 in vivoand in vitro through the residues surrounding the autophosphorylation site Ser-241 and that the association is achieved only when Ser-241 has been phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Although PDK1 contains other 14-3-3 binding motifs in its amino acid sequence (3RTTS6, 407RSGS410,546RYQS549), site-directed mutagenesis of the target Ser revealed that these sites were not involved in the PDK1–14-3-3 complex formation (Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that 14-3-3 also bound to the S410A-PDK1 mutant in which Ser-410 was converted to Ala although the Ser-410 residue has been reported to be phosphorylated in vivo (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). There may be some conformational state essential for the 14-3-3 binding in addition to Ser phosphorylation in 14-3-3 binding motifs.Among the 14-3-3-binding partners, some proteins, like Raf-1, bind to almost all 14-3-3 isoforms with nearly equivalent affinity (18Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, others, like A20 and Cdc25B, bind to different 14-3-3 isoforms with significantly different affinities (27Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20029-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Mils V. Baldin V. Goubin F. Pinta I. Papin C. Waye M. Eychene A. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We recently reported that p27Kip1 binds to 14-3-3 after Akt-mediated phosphorylation at the COOH-terminal Thr-198 (29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated p27Kip1 could form complexes with 14-3-3θ, η, and ε but not with 14-3-3β and ζ (29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that 14-3-3 isoforms have different affinities to their partners. Among the five isoforms (β, ε, η, θ, and ζ), only 14-3-3θ and η interacted with PDK1, and 14-3-3θ bound more tightly than 14-3-3η (Fig.1 B). The difference among 14-3-3θ, η and other isoforms that accounts for the different affinities for PDK1 is still unclear, since many of the residues that form the ligand-binding groove are conserved in the seven isoforms. However, comparing the residues in 14-3-3θ necessary for the interaction with Raf-1 and PDK1 did reveal some differences. To form a complex with Raf-1, Arg-56, Arg-60, and Arg-127 were necessary (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4), a finding consistent with a previous report (23Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the case of PDK1, Arg-56 and Arg-60 were not essential but Arg-127 was (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, both Arg-56 and Arg-60 are necessary but Arg-127 is not for p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 (Ref.29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). 2N. Fujita, S. Sato, and T. Tsuruo, unpublished observations. These results indicate that the residues necessary for ligand-14-3-3 binding vary with the ligand. Moreover, there may be some residues essential for the association with ligands that are not conserved in the 14-3-3 isoforms. However, we could not exclude the possibility that the differences we observed above were a result of the differences between the ligand that possessed at least two 14-3-3 binding motifs (Raf-1) and the one that had only one (PDK1). The distinct mechanism of isoform-specific interaction is a problem to be solved in future studies.The general mechanisms by which 14-3-3 regulates partner protein functions are 4-fold: 1) regulation of subcellular localization of the target protein; 2) direct regulation of catalytic activity of the binding partner; 3) protection of the ligands from proteolysis or dephosphorylation; and 4) regulation of interaction between bound protein and other molecules. The identified 14-3-3 binding residue of PDK1 (Ser-241) is thought to be phosphorylated by itself and it be essential for its kinase activity (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reporting (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we confirmed that S241A-PDK1 exhibited weak Akt and SGK phosphorylation activity when compared with WT-PDK1 (Fig. 4). We thus generated PDK1 point mutants in which residues other than Ser-241 are mutated (Fig. 3 C) and examined their activity to phosphorylate Akt (Fig. 4 A) or SGK (Fig. 4 C). Mutation of PDK1 to promote 14-3-3 (V243P-PDK1) association exhibited reduced PDK1 kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt and SGK in cells, while mutation of PDK1 to inhibit the interaction (R238E-PDK1) slightly increased its activity (Fig. 4). Moreover, incubation with recombinant 14-3-3θ decreased PDK1 autophosphorylation activity (Fig.5 A) and kinase activity to phosphorylate SGK (Fig.5 B) in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. These results indicate that 14-3-3 is not only a PDK1-associating protein but also a protein that negatively regulates PDK1 kinase activity.Several reports indicate that PDK1 binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate through its pleckstrin homology domain (19Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because mutants of PDK1 deleted in its pleckstrin homology domain have been reported to prevent translocation of Akt, the relocalization of PDK1 from cytosol to the plasma membrane is suggested to play an important role in the recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane and the subsequent Akt activation in stimulated cells (30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PDK1 catalytic activity is not required for the PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane (30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although mutating PDK1 to increase its binding to 14-3-3 (V243P) reduced kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt at Thr-308, the mutation did not affect the binding affinity of PDK1 to Akt (Fig. 4). Therefore, the decrease in kinase activity of V243P-PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt in cells may be caused by down-regulation of its kinase activity but not by suppressing translocation. This notion was supported by the fact that the amount of the phosphorylated form of Myr-Akt was reduced by 14-3-3 protein expression even though Myr-Akt constitutively targeted the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 D). In the case of SGK, translocation to the plasma membrane is not required for PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of SGK at Thr-256 (31Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). SGK phosphorylation at Thr-256 was also suppressed by PDK1 mutation to increase its binding to 14-3-3 (V243P; Fig. 4 C). These results strongly suggest that inhibition of PDK1 activity but not PDK1 translocation is the main mechanism of 14-3-3-mediated inactivation of PDK1-dependent signal transduction. Many growth factors and cytokines have been reported to promote cell survival. Stimulation of cells with these factors activates phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K),1 and activated PI3K generates the phospholipid second messenger molecules phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (1Vanhaesebroeck B.

These lipids then induce activation of several members of the AGC family of protein kinases including Akt, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), serum, and glucocorticoid–inducible kinases (SGKs), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Activated kinases, then, mediate survival-signal transduction by phosphorylating downstream key regulatory proteins. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) was originally identified as a kinase that could phosphorylate Akt on its activation loop (residue Thr-308) (4Alessi D.R.

Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Later studies, however, have showed that PDK1 is not just an Akt kinase but also a kinase phosphorylating p70S6K, SGKs, PKC isoforms, and p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) at the equivalent residues of Thr-308 of Akt (reviewed in Ref. 7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Therefore, PDK1 plays a central role in activating the AGC family of protein kinases. In the case of Akt, the interaction of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate with the pleckstrin homology domain recruits Akt to the plasma membrane and promotes conformational change, which results in phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 by PDK1 and at Ser-473 by an as yet unidentified kinase (so called PDK2) (7Vanhaesebroeck B.

DISCUSSIONIt is clear that PDK1 plays a central role in activating the AGC subfamily of protein kinases (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 24Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These kinases then mediate intracellular signaling such as cell survival, cell growth, protein synthesis, and gene expression. PDK1 phosphorylates AGC kinase members at the residues equivalent to Thr-308 of Akt (known as activation loop or T-loop) (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). PDK1 is, itself, a member of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases. Thus, PDK1 phosphorylates itself at its activation loop (Ser-241), thereby activating itself (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although PDK1 kinase activity has been thought to be constitutively active and not further activated by growth factor stimulation, recent findings suggest that its activity and its character are controlled by interaction with other proteins. For example, when PDK1 interacts with the PDK1-interacting fragment of PRK2, it is converted to exhibit PDK2-like activity (11Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The association of PDK1 with RSK2 up-regulates PDK1 kinase activity and autophosphorylation (12Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We recently reported that PDK1 binds to Hsp90, and its binding prevents PDK1 from proteasome-dependent degradation and keeps it in a soluble and active conformational state (13Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, PDK1 kinase activity is promoted by phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, presumably by a member of the Src kinase family (25Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R., Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6642-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Here we provide evidence that PDK1 binds to 14-3-3 in vivoand in vitro through the residues surrounding the autophosphorylation site Ser-241 and that the association is achieved only when Ser-241 has been phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Although PDK1 contains other 14-3-3 binding motifs in its amino acid sequence (3RTTS6, 407RSGS410,546RYQS549), site-directed mutagenesis of the target Ser revealed that these sites were not involved in the PDK1–14-3-3 complex formation (Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that 14-3-3 also bound to the S410A-PDK1 mutant in which Ser-410 was converted to Ala although the Ser-410 residue has been reported to be phosphorylated in vivo (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). There may be some conformational state essential for the 14-3-3 binding in addition to Ser phosphorylation in 14-3-3 binding motifs.Among the 14-3-3-binding partners, some proteins, like Raf-1, bind to almost all 14-3-3 isoforms with nearly equivalent affinity (18Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, others, like A20 and Cdc25B, bind to different 14-3-3 isoforms with significantly different affinities (27Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20029-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Mils V. Baldin V. Goubin F. Pinta I. Papin C. Waye M. Eychene A. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We recently reported that p27Kip1 binds to 14-3-3 after Akt-mediated phosphorylation at the COOH-terminal Thr-198 (29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated p27Kip1 could form complexes with 14-3-3θ, η, and ε but not with 14-3-3β and ζ (29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that 14-3-3 isoforms have different affinities to their partners. Among the five isoforms (β, ε, η, θ, and ζ), only 14-3-3θ and η interacted with PDK1, and 14-3-3θ bound more tightly than 14-3-3η (Fig.1 B). The difference among 14-3-3θ, η and other isoforms that accounts for the different affinities for PDK1 is still unclear, since many of the residues that form the ligand-binding groove are conserved in the seven isoforms. However, comparing the residues in 14-3-3θ necessary for the interaction with Raf-1 and PDK1 did reveal some differences. To form a complex with Raf-1, Arg-56, Arg-60, and Arg-127 were necessary (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4), a finding consistent with a previous report (23Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the case of PDK1, Arg-56 and Arg-60 were not essential but Arg-127 was (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, both Arg-56 and Arg-60 are necessary but Arg-127 is not for p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 (Ref.29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). 2N. Fujita, S. Sato, and T. Tsuruo, unpublished observations. These results indicate that the residues necessary for ligand-14-3-3 binding vary with the ligand. Moreover, there may be some residues essential for the association with ligands that are not conserved in the 14-3-3 isoforms. However, we could not exclude the possibility that the differences we observed above were a result of the differences between the ligand that possessed at least two 14-3-3 binding motifs (Raf-1) and the one that had only one (PDK1). The distinct mechanism of isoform-specific interaction is a problem to be solved in future studies.The general mechanisms by which 14-3-3 regulates partner protein functions are 4-fold: 1) regulation of subcellular localization of the target protein; 2) direct regulation of catalytic activity of the binding partner; 3) protection of the ligands from proteolysis or dephosphorylation; and 4) regulation of interaction between bound protein and other molecules. The identified 14-3-3 binding residue of PDK1 (Ser-241) is thought to be phosphorylated by itself and it be essential for its kinase activity (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reporting (9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we confirmed that S241A-PDK1 exhibited weak Akt and SGK phosphorylation activity when compared with WT-PDK1 (Fig. 4). We thus generated PDK1 point mutants in which residues other than Ser-241 are mutated (Fig. 3 C) and examined their activity to phosphorylate Akt (Fig. 4 A) or SGK (Fig. 4 C). Mutation of PDK1 to promote 14-3-3 (V243P-PDK1) association exhibited reduced PDK1 kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt and SGK in cells, while mutation of PDK1 to inhibit the interaction (R238E-PDK1) slightly increased its activity (Fig. 4). Moreover, incubation with recombinant 14-3-3θ decreased PDK1 autophosphorylation activity (Fig.5 A) and kinase activity to phosphorylate SGK (Fig.5 B) in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. These results indicate that 14-3-3 is not only a PDK1-associating protein but also a protein that negatively regulates PDK1 kinase activity.Several reports indicate that PDK1 binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate through its pleckstrin homology domain (19Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because mutants of PDK1 deleted in its pleckstrin homology domain have been reported to prevent translocation of Akt, the relocalization of PDK1 from cytosol to the plasma membrane is suggested to play an important role in the recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane and the subsequent Akt activation in stimulated cells (30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PDK1 catalytic activity is not required for the PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane (30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although mutating PDK1 to increase its binding to 14-3-3 (V243P) reduced kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt at Thr-308, the mutation did not affect the binding affinity of PDK1 to Akt (Fig. 4). Therefore, the decrease in kinase activity of V243P-PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt in cells may be caused by down-regulation of its kinase activity but not by suppressing translocation. This notion was supported by the fact that the amount of the phosphorylated form of Myr-Akt was reduced by 14-3-3 protein expression even though Myr-Akt constitutively targeted the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 D). In the case of SGK, translocation to the plasma membrane is not required for PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of SGK at Thr-256 (31Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). SGK phosphorylation at Thr-256 was also suppressed by PDK1 mutation to increase its binding to 14-3-3 (V243P; Fig. 4 C). These results strongly suggest that inhibition of PDK1 activity but not PDK1 translocation is the main mechanism of 14-3-3-mediated inactivation of PDK1-dependent signal transduction. It is clear that PDK1 plays a central role in activating the AGC subfamily of protein kinases (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 24Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr.

These kinases then mediate intracellular signaling such as cell survival, cell growth, protein synthesis, and gene expression. PDK1 phosphorylates AGC kinase members at the residues equivalent to Thr-308 of Akt (known as activation loop or T-loop) (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). PDK1 is, itself, a member of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases.

The association of PDK1 with RSK2 up-regulates PDK1 kinase activity and autophosphorylation (12Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S.

We recently reported that PDK1 binds to Hsp90, and its binding prevents PDK1 from proteasome-dependent degradation and keeps it in a soluble and active conformational state (13Fujita N. Sato S.

Here we provide evidence that PDK1 binds to 14-3-3 in vivoand in vitro through the residues surrounding the autophosphorylation site Ser-241 and that the association is achieved only when Ser-241 has been phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Although PDK1 contains other 14-3-3 binding motifs in its amino acid sequence (3RTTS6, 407RSGS410,546RYQS549), site-directed mutagenesis of the target Ser revealed that these sites were not involved in the PDK1–14-3-3 complex formation (Fig. 3 B). It should be noted that 14-3-3 also bound to the S410A-PDK1 mutant in which Ser-410 was converted to Ala although the Ser-410 residue has been reported to be phosphorylated in vivo (9Casamayor A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated p27Kip1 could form complexes with 14-3-3θ, η, and ε but not with 14-3-3β and ζ (29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that 14-3-3 isoforms have different affinities to their partners. Among the five isoforms (β, ε, η, θ, and ζ), only 14-3-3θ and η interacted with PDK1, and 14-3-3θ bound more tightly than 14-3-3η (Fig.1 B). The difference among 14-3-3θ, η and other isoforms that accounts for the different affinities for PDK1 is still unclear, since many of the residues that form the ligand-binding groove are conserved in the seven isoforms. However, comparing the residues in 14-3-3θ necessary for the interaction with Raf-1 and PDK1 did reveal some differences. To form a complex with Raf-1, Arg-56, Arg-60, and Arg-127 were necessary (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and4), a finding consistent with a previous report (23Thorson J.A., Yu, L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R.

In the case of PDK1, Arg-56 and Arg-60 were not essential but Arg-127 was (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, both Arg-56 and Arg-60 are necessary but Arg-127 is not for p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 (Ref.29Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we confirmed that S241A-PDK1 exhibited weak Akt and SGK phosphorylation activity when compared with WT-PDK1 (Fig. 4). We thus generated PDK1 point mutants in which residues other than Ser-241 are mutated (Fig. 3 C) and examined their activity to phosphorylate Akt (Fig. 4 A) or SGK (Fig. 4 C). Mutation of PDK1 to promote 14-3-3 (V243P-PDK1) association exhibited reduced PDK1 kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt and SGK in cells, while mutation of PDK1 to inhibit the interaction (R238E-PDK1) slightly increased its activity (Fig. 4). Moreover, incubation with recombinant 14-3-3θ decreased PDK1 autophosphorylation activity (Fig.5 A) and kinase activity to phosphorylate SGK (Fig.5 B) in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. These results indicate that 14-3-3 is not only a PDK1-associating protein but also a protein that negatively regulates PDK1 kinase activity. Several reports indicate that PDK1 binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate through its pleckstrin homology domain (19Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell.

Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PDK1 catalytic activity is not required for the PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane (30Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although mutating PDK1 to increase its binding to 14-3-3 (V243P) reduced kinase activity to phosphorylate Akt at Thr-308, the mutation did not affect the binding affinity of PDK1 to Akt (Fig. 4). Therefore, the decrease in kinase activity of V243P-PDK1 to phosphorylate Akt in cells may be caused by down-regulation of its kinase activity but not by suppressing translocation. This notion was supported by the fact that the amount of the phosphorylated form of Myr-Akt was reduced by 14-3-3 protein expression even though Myr-Akt constitutively targeted the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 D). In the case of SGK, translocation to the plasma membrane is not required for PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of SGK at Thr-256 (31Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). SGK phosphorylation at Thr-256 was also suppressed by PDK1 mutation to increase its binding to 14-3-3 (V243P; Fig. 4 C). These results strongly suggest that inhibition of PDK1 activity but not PDK1 translocation is the main mechanism of 14-3-3-mediated inactivation of PDK1-dependent signal transduction. We thank Drs.

Bouloc P. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, lower MgCl2 concentrations in the lysate buffer cause the accumulation of 40 S ribosomal particles and a concomitant reduction in 50 S ribosomal subunits (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This ribosomal defect is also reflected in the significantly decreased translational efficiency of S30 extracts prepared from rrmJdeletion strains (4Caldas T. Binet E. Bouloc P. Richarme G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the absence of Mrm2p, the mitochondrial RrmJ homologue that has recently been identified to modify the corresponding U2791 in 21 S rRNA does not cause a mitochondrial ribosome assembly or stability defect (5Pintard L. Bujnicki J.M. Lapeyre B. Bonnerot C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria in the absence of Mrm2p do, however, reveal instability of their genome, a feature that is often associated with defects in mitochondrial translation (5Pintard L. Bujnicki J.M. Lapeyre B. Bonnerot C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All these observations point to an important role of RrmJ in ribosome biology, and the simplest interpretation of these results is that the ribosome defect that is observed in rrmJ deletion strains is directly caused by the absence of the Um2552 modification in 23 S rRNA. It also is possible, however, that RrmJ has a second methyltransferase-independent function. Such dual function modes for methyltransferases have been observed in the past. For instance, Pet56p, the methyltransferase that is responsible for methylating the other universally conserved residue in mitochondrial 21 S rRNA, has been shown to be essential for thein vivo maturation of the large ribosomal subunit in mitochondria (3Hansen M.A. Kirpekar F. Ritterbusch W. Vester B. RNA. 2002; 8: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This phenotype, however, seems to be independent of the methylation activity of Pet56p, becauseS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) binding mutants of Pet56p, which completely eliminate methyltransferase activity, still support ribosome assembly in vivo (6Lovgren J.M. Wikstrom P.M. J Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In vitro methylation assays have revealed that RrmJ recognizes its methylation target only when the 23 S rRNA is present in 50 S ribosomal subunits (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 2Caldas T. Binet E. Bouloc P. Costa A. Desgres J. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16414-16419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed in studies revealing that Mrm2p modifies mitochondrial 21 S rRNA only when assembled with proteins of the large subunit (5Pintard L. Bujnicki J.M. Lapeyre B. Bonnerot C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that the RrmJ-mediated methylation must occur late in the maturation process of the ribosome (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to other known 23 S rRNA modifications that occur in earlier maturation steps (7Bjoerk G.R. Neidhardt F.C. E. coli and Salmonella. Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 861-880Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of 2′-O-ribose methyltransferases such as RrmJ has not been analyzed experimentally. We have crystallized RrmJ in the presence of its AdoMet cofactor and have solved the structure of the RrmJ·AdoMet complex to a 1.5-Å resolution (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structure of RrmJ with structures of other methyltransferases revealed homology to 1FBN, the fibrillarin homologue from Methanococcus jannaschii (8Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (9Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and vaccinia mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase VP39 (10Hodel A.E. Gershon P.D. Shi X. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). VP39, in particular, shows a highly homologous core domain and an RNA binding groove that shares numerous features with RrmJ (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These structural and sequence comparisons have allowed us and others (11Bujnicki J.M. Blumenthal R.M. Rychlewski L. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 93-99PubMed Google Scholar) to predict which residues in RrmJ might be directly involved in the methyltransfer reaction and to postulate a reaction mechanism. Here, we have prepared a number of site-specific mutants of RrmJ to investigate which residues participate in catalysis. We have conducted phenotypical studies and enzymatic analyzes to characterize the activity of our mutants in vivo and in vitro. We have identified two lysine and one aspartate residues that are important for catalyzing the methyltransfer reaction; RrmJ mutants at these positions show a significant decrease in methyltransferase activity. These mutants allowed us to demonstrate that both the ribosome and growth defects observed in rrmJ deletion mutants are dependent on the methyltransfer activity of RrmJ. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild type rrmJ cloned into pET11a (pHB1) (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was used as template DNA to generate the mutations. The primers used in this study were as follows: K38A, CGTTCCCGTGCCTGGTTTGCACTTGATGAAATACAGCAAAG; D83A, CCGCATCATCGCTTGCGCTCTTCTACCTATGGATCC; D124A, CAGGTTGTCATGTCCGCTATGGCCCCAAACATGAGCGG; K164A, GGTGGCAGTTTTGTAGTGGCGGTGTTCCAGGGCG; E199A, GACTCTTCTCGTGCACGTTCCCGGGCAGTGTATATTGTAGCG; Y201A, CGTGCACGTTCCCGGGAAGTGGCTATTGTAGCGACCGGG. All introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids that were generated and the strains that were used in this study are listed in TableI. For overexpression and purification of the mutant proteins, the plasmids that contained the mutatedrrmJ genes were introduced into JUH47. This strain contained a deletion of the rrmJ gene to prevent the contamination of our purified mutant proteins by small amounts of WT protein. JUH47 was constructed by P1 transduction. The TcR of the Tn10 marker that is 90% linked to rrmΔJ567 (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol.

The transformed strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an A 600 of 0.5 was reached. Then, a 2-ml aliquot of cells was taken, resuspended in 85 μl of 2× SDS-Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 20 min. The proteins were separated on a 14% Tris-glycine PAGE (NOVEX), and RrmJ was visualized using Western blot analysis. To investigate whether the RrmJ mutant proteins are expressed in a soluble form in HB23 cells, cell lysates were prepared (see below), and the presence of RrmJ in the soluble supernatant was determined with Western blot analysis. 2D gel analysis of the protein composition of 50 S ribosomal subunits of HB24 (WT) and of 50 S and 40 S ribosomal particles of HB23 (rrmΔJ567) was performed according to Geyl et al. (12Geyl D. Bock A. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The 40 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits were prepared as described previously (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Analytical polysome profiles of the wild type strain HB24, the rrmJ deletion strain HB23, and HB23 expressing the individual rrmJ mutants were obtained by sucrose gradient centrifugation of the lysates under dissociating salt conditions (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm NH4Cl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The profiles were analyzed as described (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The purification of the RrmJ mutants was performed according to Bügl et al.(1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Slight modifications were applied to optimize the purification protocol. JUH47 strains containing the rrmJ mutant plasmids were grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A 600 = 0.7 at 37 °C. Induction of protein expression and cell lysis was performed as described (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The lysis buffer was 40 mm HEPES/KOH, 150 mmKCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (v/v) glycerol. To purify the RrmJ mutant proteins, a tandem 5-ml HiTrapTM Q-SepharoseTM (AmershamBiosciences) connected to a 5-ml HiTrapTMSP-SepharoseTM (Amersham Biosciences) column was used. The cell lysate was applied (flow rate of 4 ml/min), and after washing the column with lysis buffer the proteins were eluted by applying a linear 300-ml gradient from 150 to 600 mm KCl in lysis buffer. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the RrmJ-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. The purity of the proteins was greater than 95%. The buffer was exchanged to RrmJ storage buffer (40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance using an extinction coefficient of 1.00 for a 1 mg/ml solution at A 280 (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Protein concentration determination was not significantly influenced by the presence of the absorbing cofactor AdoMet in the preparation. This was confirmed by performing a Bradford assay, using the AdoMet-free D83A mutant RrmJ protein as a standard protein (data not shown). To determine the amount of AdoMet present in the various RrmJ mutant preparations, we first generated an AdoMet titration curve. A 23 μm solution of our AdoMet-free D83A mutant RrmJ protein was prepared, and 1 μm AdoMet (ε257 = 15,400 M−1 cm−1) was added per titration step. After each AdoMet addition, theA 280/A 260 ratio of the protein/AdoMet mixture was determined. After volume correction, this ratio was plotted against the amount of titrated AdoMet. Then, theA 280/A 260 ratio of the purified RrmJ mutants was determined, and the amount of bound AdoMet was calculated. 50 S ribosomal subunits of HB23 (rrmΔJ567) were prepared as described previously (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Re-analysis of purified 50 S subunits on sucrose gradients revealed that the preparation is >98% pure. These subunits served as in vitro substrates for wild type RrmJ and the mutant proteins in the methylation assay (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The RrmJ concentrations used in this assay were 20, 100, or 200 nmin 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 85 mmNH4Cl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The initial rate for methylation was measured in the presence of 5 μm 50 S ribosomal subunits and increasing amounts of radioactive [3H]S-adenosyl-l-methionine (85.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). To determine the apparentK m for 50 S ribosomal subunits, the methylation assay was performed in the presence of 50 μm AdoMet and varying concentrations of 50 S ribosomal subunits. To determine the specific activity of wild type RrmJ and the mutant proteins, the assay was carried out using 100 and 200 nm RrmJ mutant protein, 50 μm AdoMet, and either 5 or 8 μm 50 S ribosomal subunits, depending on the RrmJ mutant. The methylation reaction was performed at 37 °C. At defined time points (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min) after initiating the methylation reaction, 8-μl aliquots were taken, and the [3H]methyl incorporation into 23 S rRNA was determined as described (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The slopes of the methyl incorporation versus time plots were calculated, and the initial velocities obtained were plotted against the respective substrate concentration. The curve was then fitted using a single rectangular hyperbola. To analyze the influence of our amino acid substitutions on the methyltransfer activity of RrmJ, we first needed to characterize the enzymatic properties of wild type RrmJ. The apparent V max of the methyltransfer reaction, as well as the apparent K m values for 50 S ribosomal subunits and AdoMet, were determined by in vitromethylation assays using purified RrmJ and radioactively labeled AdoMet. 50 S ribosomal subunits were prepared from the rrmJdeletion strain HB23, because their 23 S rRNA lacks the U2552 methylation catalyzed by RrmJ. We first established assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) in which the rate of [3H]methyl incorporation from [3H]AdoMet into 23 S rRNA was proportional to the RrmJ concentration and linear over more than 150 min (data not shown). Thus, the initial rate measurements represented true initial velocities, and the dependence of the rate on substrate concentration could be measured. Initial velocity data were first obtained with a fixed high concentration of AdoMet (50 μm) and varying concentrations of 50 S ribosomal subunits. The apparent K m value for 23 S rRNA within 50 S ribosomal subunits was determined to be 0.8 + 0.1 μmwith an apparent K cat of 0.064 min−1 at 37 °C (Fig.1 A). This is a significantly higher K m value than the one determined for the mRNA in VP39 (K m = 5 nm) (13Barbosa E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but very similar to the K m value determined for the 23 S rRNA methyltransferase ErmC′ from Bacillus subtilis. ErmC′ has been shown to dimethylate adenine 2058 (E. colinumbering) in naked 23 S rRNA, early in the ribosomal maturation process (13Barbosa E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Denoya C.D. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the apparent K m value for AdoMet, the 50 S ribosomal subunits were kept at saturating concentrations (5 μm), and AdoMet was varied (Fig.1 A, inset). The initial velocity experiments revealed an apparent K m for AdoMet of 3.7 + 0.3 μm and the same K cat of 0.064 min−1. From these results it became clear that RrmJ and the 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase VP39 do not only share a very similar K m for AdoMet, which is 2 μm for VP39 (13Barbosa E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7698-7702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also a similarly low turnover number. The K cat for VP39 has only very recently been determined to be 0.13 min−1 (15Hu G. Oguro A., Li, C. Gershon P.D. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7677-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As is the case for VP39, the RrmJ catalyzed reaction was linear over more than 150 min and, therefore, through more than 10 turnovers (data not shown). This excluded the possibility that the low K catobserved for RrmJ is because of problems to multiple turnovers but may be because of slow chemical steps (15Hu G. Oguro A., Li, C. Gershon P.D. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7677-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or because of accessibility problems of the methylation site in the intact 50 S ribosomal subunits that are used in our in vitro studies (see below). Because of this low turnover number, however, our initial rate measurements that were followed over a 10-min time period need to be considered pre-steady state measurements rather than steady-state measurements. We considered that one possible reason for the heat shock induction of RrmJ could be a possible temperature lability of the enzyme. This would require the overexpression of RrmJ at heat shock temperatures to compensate for the potential loss of function. For this reason, we measured the activity of RrmJ under saturating substrate concentrations over a variety of temperatures (Fig. 1 B). We found that the temperature optimum of the methyltransferase activity of RrmJ was at 55 °C. The decreased activity at temperatures beyond 55 °C is either because of instability of the 50 S ribosomal subunits or because of thermal inactivation of RrmJ. In either case, these results excluded the possibility that the heat shock regulation of RrmJ is based on thermal lability of the enzyme. RrmJ is able to methylate 23 S rRNA in isolated 50 S ribosomal subunits, as well as in 70 S ribosomes (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 2Caldas T. Binet E. Bouloc P. Costa A. Desgres J. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16414-16419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but is unable to methylate naked 23 S rRNA or 23 S rRNA that is present in 40 S ribosomal particles that have been shown to accumulate in cell lysates of rrmJ deletion strains under dissociating salt conditions (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To analyze the substrate requirements of RrmJ in more detail, we performed 2D gel analysis to compare the protein composition of the 50 S ribosomal subunits of the rrmJ deletion strain with that of wild type strains. As shown in Fig.2, all 30 ribosomal proteins were detectable at similar levels in the two strains (Fig. 2, Aand B). These data reveal that the absence of methylation of the highly conserved U2552 does not affect the folding of the 23 S rRNA to an extent that impairs the correct assembly of the 50 S ribosomal subunit. To get some idea how accessible U2552 is in the intact 50 S ribosomal subunit, we performed modeling studies using the crystal structure of the Deinococcus radiodurans 50 S ribosomal subunit (16Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) and RrmJ. Although solvent-accessible, U2552 (E. coli nomenclature) is positioned at the bottom of a deep cleft. Assuming that this conserved residue has the same position in theE. coli 50 S ribosomal subunits, this would make it rather inaccessible for RrmJ methylation and might require the 23 S rRNA to loop out so that RrmJ can gain access. This could certainly be a rate-limiting step that might occur in vitro but might not happen in vivo where RrmJ could methylate precursors whose A-loop is more accessible. This may explain the low turnover numbers we observe in our in vitro methylation reactions where completely assembled 50 S ribosomal subunits are used as substrates. The 40 S ribosomal particles that accumulate under dissociating salt conditions in lysates prepared from rrmJ deletion strains are not in vitro substrates of RrmJ (1Bügl H. Fauman E.B. Staker B.L. Zheng F. Kushner S.R. Saper M.A. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). 2D gel analysis of the 40 S peak reveals that at least seven different ribosomal proteins (L5, L16, L18, L25, L27, L28, L30) are present in significantly diminished amounts compared with 50 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 2,B and C). All of these proteins belong to the group of late assembly proteins (17Nierhaus K.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 739-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). While true ribosome precursors are also detectable under non-stringent, associating salt conditions, these 40 S particles only develop when the salt conditions become stringent. It is therefore more likely that they represent a mixture of destabilized 50 S particles that are lacking various late assembly proteins. Thus, the absence of Um2552 in the A-site of the ribosome appears to destabilize the 50 S ribosomal subunit and leads to premature dissociation of a number of ribosomal proteins probably causing structural changes in the 23 S rRNA that prevents RrmJ from recognizing it as a substrate. Surprisingly little is known about the catalytic mechanism of any 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase. Although a reaction mechanism has been postulated for VP39 on the basis of its crystal structure (18Hodel A.E. Quiocho F.A. Gershon P.D. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases: Structures and Functions. World Scientific, Riveredge, NJ1999: 255-282Crossref Google Scholar), experimental data has not been obtained to support this hypothesis. We have, therefore, decided to combine structural analysis and site-specific mutagenesis to investigate the methyltransfer reaction of RrmJ. The first step in this analysis was to determine which residues are essential for catalysis.

(1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 28542–28548). Previously, we showed that the N-terminal Slp homology domain of Slp4-a interacts with the GTP-bound form of Rab3A, Rab8, and Rab27A both in vitroand in intact cells (Kuroda, T. S., Fukuda, M., Ariga, H., and Mikoshiba, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9212–9218). How Slp4-a·Rab complex controls regulated secretion, and which Rab isoforms dominantly interact with Slp4-a in vivo, however, have remained unknown. In this study, we showed by immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation that three Rabs, Rab3A, Rab8, and Rab27A, and Slp4-a are endogenously expressed in neuroendocrine PC12 cells and localized on dense-core vesicles, and we discovered that the Slp4-a·Rab8 and Slp4-a·Rab27A complexes, but not Slp4-a·Rab3A complexes, are formed on dense-core vesicles in PC12 cells, although the majority of Rab8 is present in the cell body and is free of Slp4-a. We further showed that expression of Rab27A, but not of Rab8, promotes high KCl-dependent secretion of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in PC12 cells, whereas expression of Slp4-a, but not of an Slp4-a mutant incapable of Rab27A binding, inhibits NPY secretion in PC12 cells. In contrast, expression of Slp3-a, but not of Slp3-b lacking an N-terminal Rab27A-binding domain, promotes NPY secretion. These findings suggest that the Slp family controls regulated dense-core vesicle exocytosis via binding to Rab27A.

In contrast, however, functional involvement of the Slp family in Rab27-dependent membrane trafficking (especially in regulated granule exocytosis) remained to be clarified.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro GST pull-down assay showed that the SHD of Slp4-a preferentially binds Rab8 and Rab27A and weakly interacts with Rab3A, whereas other SHDs specifically bind Rab27A (9Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To attempt to determine which Rabs are in vivo binding partners of Slp4-a, we used specific antibodies to search for cell line(s) in which these three Rabs and Slp4-a are endogenously expressed. The specificity of each antibody used in this study (anti-Rab3A, anti-Rab8, anti-Rab27A, and anti-Slp4-a antibodies) was confirmed by immunoblotting with recombinant FLAG-Rabs and recombinant T7-Slps, rabphilin, and Syt I (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–3 and Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–7). The anti-Slp4-a antibody only recognized T7-Slp4-a, not the other Slps, including Slp5, a close homologue of Slp4-a (5Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were found to express all four proteins (Fig. 1 A, lane 4, and 1 B,lane 8). Quantitative analysis indicated that the ratio of the amounts of the three Rabs in descending order was Rab8:Rab3A:Rab27A = 1:0.4:< 0.1 (Fig. 1 A). The level of expression of Slp4-a was lower than in the pancreas (i.e.pancreatic β-cells; data not shown). To investigate whether Slp4-a·Rab complex is actually formed in vivo, an immunoprecipitation experiment was performed using anti-Slp4-a-specific antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Consistent with our previous in vitro binding experiments (9Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Rab8 and Rab27A were found to co-immunoprecipitate with Slp4-a, whereas hardly any Rab3A was detected in the anti-Slp4-a IgG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). In contrast, none of the Rabs were detected in the control IgG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Since the amounts of bound Rab8 and Rab27A were significantly reduced in the absence of GTPγS, Slp4-a should recognize the GTP-bound form of Rab8 and Rab27A even under the in vivo conditions (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when exogenously expressed GST-Slp4-a was used (Fig. 2 B, lane 2): GST-Slp4-a bound both Rab8 and Rab27A but only a trace amount of Rab3A. Although the relative amount of Rab27A was less than 10% of that of Rab8 in PC12 cells, Slp4-a efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Rab27A, indicating that Slp4-a prefers Rab27A to Rab8 or Rab3A as anin vivo binding partner. PC12 cells contain two types of secretory vesicles,i.e. dense-core vesicles and synaptic-like microvesicles, and they are often utilized for analysis of regulated secretion. Since Slp4-a/granuphilin-a was first identified as a protein that specifically associated with insulin-containing dense-core vesicles (4Wang J. Takeuchi T. Yokota H. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28542-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether Slp4-a and three Rabs are localized on the dense-core vesicles of PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, Rab3A (Fig. 3 A,green), Rab8 (Fig. 3 D, green), Rab27A (Fig. 3 G, green), and Slp4-a (Fig. 3,B, E, and H, red) were found to be predominantly localized in the distal portion of neurites, where dense-core vesicles were enriched (Fig. 3, C,F, and I, yellow). Dotted signals for Rab8 were found throughout the cell body in addition to the neurites (Fig. 3 D), whereas the others were almost exclusively expressed in the distal portion of the neurites. Similar expression patterns were observed when Slp4-a or Rabs were exogenously expressed in PC12 cells (data not shown). A subcellular fractionation study was performed to further confirm the presence of Slp4-a and the three Rabs on dense-core vesicles (Fig.4). As expected, Rab3A, Rab27A, and Slp4-a were co-distributed with Syt IX (dense-core vesicle marker (DCV); fractions 5–8) but not with synaptophysin (synaptic-like microvesicle marker (SLMV); fractions 2–4) (29Fukuda M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24499-24505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rab8 was also detected in lighter fractions in addition to the dense-core vesicle-enriched fractions, consistent with the immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3 D). We therefore concluded that the Slp4-a·Rab8 and Slp4-a·Rab27A complexes are indeed formed on dense-core vesicles in intact PC12 cells. Finally, we used an NPY-T7-GST secretion assay to investigate whether the Slp4-a·Rab8 and/or Slp4-a·Rab27A complexes control regulated exocytosis in PC12 cells (see ref. 34Fukuda M. Katayama E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar for details). When Rab27A was transiently coexpressed with NPY in PC12 cells, high KCl-dependent NPY secretion was significantly promoted (Fig. 5 A, closed bar), but the Rab27A expression had no effect on low KCl-dependent NPY secretion (data not shown). The effect of Rab27A should be GTP-dependent because expression of Rab27A(T23N), a dominant negative form that mimics the GDP-bound state, did not promote NPY secretion, consistent with the previous report (14Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast, expression of Rab8 had no significant effect on high KCl-dependent NPY secretion (Fig.5 A, open bar). The slight effect of Rab8 on regulated secretion was not due to its expression levels in PC12 cells because similar amounts of FLAG-Rab8 and -Rab27A were detected in PC12 cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 5 A, inset). Similarly, expression of Rab3A did not promote NPY secretion, as described previously (14Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (data not shown). When Slp4-a was expressed in PC12 cells, high KCl-dependent NPY secretion was significantly reduced (Fig. 5 B, open bar), but it had no effect on low KCl-dependent secretion (data not shown). Interestingly, expression of Slp3-a, a Rab27A-specific Slp exhibiting Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity (1Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Fukuda M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 681-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in PC12 cells strongly promoted high KCl-dependent NPY secretion (Fig. 5 B,closed bar). To further determine whether the effect of Slp4-a (or Slp3-a) expression in high KCl-dependent NPY secretion is indeed Rab27A-dependent, an Slp4-a mutant incapable of Rab27A binding (ΔSHD) was expressed in PC12 cells (Fig.6 A, lane 18). As expected, expression of Slp4-a-ΔSHD completely reversed the inhibitory effect (Fig. 6 B, closed bar). A similar result was obtained for Slp3-b (2Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), an alternatively splicing isoform that lacks an N-terminal SHD (i.e. no significant effect on high KCl-dependent NPY secretion; Fig.6 B, closed bar). We therefore concluded that the observed effect of Slp4-a (or Slp3-a) expression in NPY secretion depends on the presence of the SHD (i.e. Rab27A-binding site). Since deletion of the SHD of Slp4-a also abrogated Rab3A and Rab8 binding (Fig. 6 A, lanes 16 and 17), we could not completely rule out the possibility that the Slp4-a·Rab3A or Slp4-a·Rab8 complex, but not Slp4-a·Rab27A complex, has an inhibitory effect on high KCl-dependent NPY secretion. When Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to resolve this issue, a single amino acid substitution in the SHD1 was found to alter the Rab binding specificity of Slp4-a (Fig. 6 A). Slp4-a(E14A) and Slp4-a(I18A) mutants specifically recognized Rab27A but not Rab3A and Rab8 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–9), whereas the Slp4-a(V21A) mutant recognized both Rab8 and Rab27A but not Rab3A (lanes 10–12). In contrast, a D32A mutation had almost no effect on the Rab binding specificity of Slp4-a (lanes 13–15). If Slp4-a·Rab3A or Slp4-a·Rab8 complex plays a major role in inhibition of high KCl-dependent NPY secretion, expression of a I18A or V21A mutant should reverse the inhibitory effect. However, when these mutants of Slp4-a were expressed in PC12 cells, no difference in high KCl-dependent NPY secretion was detected between the wild-type and mutant Slp4-a (Fig.6 B, open bars). These results strongly indicated that Slp4-a modulates dense-core vesicle exocytosis via binding to Rab27A in PC12 cells. The Slp family (Slp1–5) was defined as proteins with an N-terminal SHD and C-terminal tandem C2 domains (1Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the SHD of the Slp family binds the GTP-bound form of Rab27A (5Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that Rab27A and its effector molecules (Slp4-a and Slp3-a) control dense-core vesicle exocytosis in PC12 cells. Although Slp4-a has been found to interact with Rab3A, Rab8, and Rab27Ain vitro and in overexpression studies (9Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Strom M. Hume A.N. Tarafder A.K. Barkagianni E. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), endogenous Slp4-a in PC12 cells preferentially interacted with Rab27A on dense-core vesicles (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The Slp4-a·Rab8 complex was also observed on dense-core vesicles in PC12 cells, but the majority of Rab8 (especially in the cell body; Fig. 3 F) was free of Slp4-a, and significant amounts of Slp4-a·Rab3A were not detected. In addition, we discovered that expression of Rab27A, but not of Rab8, promoted high KCl-dependent NPY secretion in PC12 cells (Fig. 5 A), whereas expression of Slp4-a and Slp3-a had opposite effects on NPY secretion (Fig. 5 B). These effects should be Rab27A-dependent because Slp mutants incapable of Rab27A binding had no effect on NPY secretion (Fig. 6 B). The opposite effects of Slp4-a and Slp3-a may be attributable to the different biochemical properties of their C2 domains (i.e.the Ca2+-independent phospholipid binding activity of Slp4-a (4Wang J. Takeuchi T. Yokota H. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28542-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) versus the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity of Slp3-a (40Fukuda M. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 681-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) because Ca2+-dependent type Syt I and Ca2+-independent type Syt IV were found to have a positive effect and inhibitory effect, respectively, on transmitter secretion (41Littleton J.T.

While this manuscript was being reviewed, an inhibitory effect of Slp4-a on dense-core vesicle exocytosis has also been reported in pancreatic β-cell lines (44Coppola T. Frantz C. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Hirling H. Regazzi R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), strongly supporting our finding that the Slp4-a·Rab27A complex controls dense-core vesicle exocytosis. Although the function of Slp4-a·Rab8 in PC12 cells is unknown, we speculate that Slp4-a·Rab8 may have a function different from regulated secretion, in which Slp4-a·Rab27A plays a major role. One possible function of Slp4-a·Rab8 may be transport of dense-core vesicles (from the trans-Golgi network to the cell periphery) because Rab8 has been shown to regulate polarized membrane traffic (from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral plasma membrane) in epithelial cells (45Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The function of Slp4-a·Rab8 complex is now under investigation in our laboratory. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate involvement of the Slp family and Rab27A in dense-core vesicle exocytosis in PC12 cells. It will be interesting to determine which Slps function in granule exocytosis in cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as platelets, where granule exocytosis is known to be defective in Rab27A mutant animals (17Menasche G.

Therefore, the apoprotein opsin in these animals has not been exposed to its normal ligand. The Rpe65 −/− mice contain less than 0.1% of wild type levels of rhodopsin. Mass spectrometric analysis of opsin from Rpe65 −/− mice revealed unusually high levels of phosphorylation in dark-adapted mice but no other structural alterations. Single flash and flicker electroretinograms (ERGs) from 1-month-old animals showed trace rod function but no cone response. B-wave kinetics of the single-flash ERG are comparable with those of dark-adapted wild type mice containing a full compliment of rhodopsin. Application (intraperitoneal injection) of 11-cis-retinal to Rpe65 −/−mice increased the rod ERG signal, increased levels of rhodopsin, and decreased opsin phosphorylation. Therefore, exogenous 11-cis-retinal improves photoreceptor function by regenerating rhodopsin and removes constitutive opsin phosphorylation. Our results indicate that opsin, which has not been exposed to 11-cis-retinal, does not generate the activity generally associated with the bleached apoprotein."

Nuclear pre-mRNA processing takes place in the spliceosome, a large complex, consisting of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs)1 and numerous non-snRNP proteins. The precise excision of an intron is accomplished by complementary binding of U1 and U2 snRNP to the 5′ and 3′ splice sites, respectively. A network of proteins then assembles and brings the two splice sites into close proximity (reviewed in Refs. 1Reed R. Palandjian L. Krainer A.R. Spliceosome Assembly: Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 103-129Google Scholar and 2Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The consecutive transesterification steps then generate the mature mRNA. The rearrangements necessary for these two steps make the spliceosome a dynamic particle with varying composition of structural proteins and enzymes (reviewed in Ref. 3Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Investigation of proteins involved in the splicing process has shown that many of them have a modular structure consisting of one or two RNA binding domains, which could be the RNA recognition motif (RRM), K homology domain, zinc knuckle domain, or RGG box, and auxiliary domains, which include Arg/Ser (RS)-rich regions. There is a growing family of RS proteins; the first ones identified were a group of proteins termed SR (serine/arginine) proteins, which contain one or two RRMs, and usually a C-terminal RS domain with many SR dipeptides (reviewed in Refs. 4Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar and 5Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The SR proteins range in size from 20 to 75 kDa, and they are phosphoproteins that can be precipitated by high magnesium ion concentrations. The best characterized members of this group are SF2/ASF, SC35, and SRp20. Other proteins containing RS domains include splicing factors like U2AF65, U2AF35, tra, tra2, U1–70K, and SRm160, which have a modular protein structure distinct from the SR proteins but are otherwise functionally related (reviewed in Refs. 4Fu X.-D.

Interactions between members of the SR protein family are crucial for constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing (9Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 16Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It has been shown that SC35 and SF2/ASF interact with both U1–70K and U2AF35 to bridge 5′ and 3′ splice sites (9Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 17Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L.

In general, SR proteins are thought to recruit the factors necessary for spliceosome assembly through either protein-protein or RNA-protein (enhancer) interactions. Interestingly, some of the RS proteins have been found to bind to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, suggesting they may have a function in the coordination of transcription and splicing (reviewed in Refs. 19Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar and 20Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 697-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions have been shown to be mediated by the RS domain, but this domain also has a role in RNA binding and the modulation of RNA-RNA interactions (6Blencowe B.J. Bowman J.A. McCracken S. Rosonina E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Valcarcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles of the RS domain by SR protein kinase or Clk/Sty kinase play a critical role in splicing (reviewed in Ref. 22Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of SR proteins influences their binding interactions (23Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), distribution within the nucleus, and recruitment to transcription initiation sites (24Misteli T. Spector D.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 135-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,25Misteli T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R198-R200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In plants, little is known about their splicing factors (reviewed in Ref. 26Lorkovic Z.J. Wieczorek Kirk D.A. Lambermon M.H. Filipowicz W. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 160-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, the basic splicing mechanism appears to be the same in both plants and animals (reviewed in Refs. 26Lorkovic Z.J. Wieczorek Kirk D.A. Lambermon M.H. Filipowicz W. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 160-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and 27Brown J.W.S. Simpson C.G. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although plants are not able to recognize animal introns (28Barta A. Sommergruber K. Thompson D. Hartmuth K. Matzke M.A. Matzke A.J.M. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, there seems to be a difference in intron/exon definition in plants, and recent studies have focused on factors that might be important for intron recognition. Generally, plant introns have a higher AU content than exons, and the presence of short U-rich stretches is required for efficient intron removal (29; reviewed in Refs. 26Lorkovic Z.J. Wieczorek Kirk D.A. Lambermon M.H. Filipowicz W. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 160-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and 27Brown J.W.S. Simpson C.G. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, some effort has gone into identification and characterization of proteins, which bind U-rich pre-mRNA sequences (29Gniadkowski M. Hemmings Mieszczak M. Klahre U. Liu H.X. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Domon C. Lorkovic Z.J. Valcarcel J. Filipowicz W. J. Biol.

Y.). 2000; 6: 1610-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SR proteins are known to be crucial for splice site selection in metazoa, and it was therefore important to show that this protein family also existed in plants and had similar functions (33Lopato S. Mayeda A. Krainer A. Barta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3074-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,34Lazar G. Schaal T. Maniatis T. Goodman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7672-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that Arabidopsis has at least two SF2/ASF-like factors termed atSRp30 and atSRp34/SR1, with different expression patterns (35Lopato S. Kalyna M. Dorner S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Barta A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, a family of zinc knuckle-containing SR proteins, similar in their activities to human 9G8 and SRp20, termed atRSZp21, atRSZp22, and atRSZp22a, has been characterized for their splicing and RNA binding activities (36Lopato S. Gattoni R. Fabini G. Stevenin J. Barta A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These proteins have also been shown to interact with a plant U1–70K protein (37Golovkin M. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1637-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a plant-specific family of RS proteins termed the atRSp31 family (including atRSp31, atRSp40, and atRSp41) were shown to act as splicing factors (38Lopato S. Waigmann E. Barta A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To isolate further plant SR proteins we identified a gene fromArabidopsis with high sequence similarity to human SRp55 (39Screaton G.R. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Bell M.V. Plebanski M. Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4336-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) in the RRM region, but differing considerably in other parts of the protein. The encoded protein contains two zinc knuckles inserted into an RS domain followed by an SP domain at the C-terminal end. The protein, termed atRSZ33, is a nuclear phosphoprotein and has no known homolog in metazoa. The protein was found to interact with known plant splicing factors and with a new family of SC35-like proteins suggesting a role in plant spliceosome assembly. TwoArabidopsis EST clones (GenBankTM accession numbers T42174 and T75762) have been found by a data base search to have sequence similarity to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) of the human SRp55 and SRp75 splicing factors (39Screaton G.R. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Bell M.V. Plebanski M. Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4336-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 40Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the entire cDNAs revealed that they were identical, encoding a protein, which we named atRSZ33. A genomic clone encoding atRSZ33 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA as the template with primers derived from the ends of the cDNA. 2.7 kb of the promoter region was isolated using a GenomeWalker kit (Clontech). The nucleotide sequences obtained were verified by comparison with the genomic sequence, which in the meantime appeared in theArabidopsis genome data base corresponding to genesAt2g37340 and At2g37350. No sequence differences were detected, but the predictions of intron/exon regions in theArabidopsis genome data base were wrong. The cDNA of alternatively spliced mRNA was cloned by RT-PCR using mRNA from two-day-old seedlings. EST clones with the same alternative splicing pattern were found in the EST data base (GenBankTM; accession numbers H36789 and N65714). Intron-exon junction sequences were determined by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences. The bait plasmids used for yeast two-hybrid screening were constructed by inserting PCR fragments into plasmid pGBT9 (Clontech). The bait construct used for two-hybrid screening, designated as pBD-RSZ33dSP (atRSZ33 lacking the SP-domain), was generated using primers 5′-AACGAATTCGTGATCTCGGTGGAGTATGC-3′ and 5′-TAGCGGATCCTCAAAGAACCGGACTACGATCTC-3′, containingEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The truncation constructs of atRSZ33 were generated by cloning of the appropriate PCR fragments into EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of pGBT9. To create pRSZ33-GFP, the coding region ofRSZ33 was PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-TGCGGGTCGACAATAAACC ATGCCTCGCTATGATGATCGCTA-3′ and 5′-TATTGCGGATCCAGGAGACTCACTTCCTCTAG-3′. The 5′ primer introduced an SalI restriction site, followed by the plant consensus translation initiation sequence (in italics; the start ATG is in bold), whereas the 3′ primer introduced a BamHI restriction site in place of the stop codon. The PCR fragment was cut with SalI/BamHI and cloned into pDEDH-GFP (41Lambermon M.H., Fu, Y. Wieczorek Kirk D.A. Dupasquier M. Filipowicz W. Lorkovic Z.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4346-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) resulting in pRSZ33-GFP. For overexpression of atRSZ33, atSCL28, atSCL30, and atSCL30a inEscherichia coli the full-length coding regions were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences).EcoRI/SalI fragments encoding atSCL30 and atSCL30a were cut out from pBD-SCL30 and pBD-SCL30a and cloned into the same sites of pGEX-4T-1, resulting in pGST-SCL30 and pGST-SCL30a, respectively. The coding region of atSCL28 was cut out from pBD-SCL28 as an EcoRI/NotI fragment and cloned into the same sites of pGEX-4T-1, resulting in pGST-SCL28. The coding region of atRSZ33 was PCR-amplified using 5′-AACGAATTCATGCCTCGCTATGATG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGAATTCTTAAGGAGACTCACTTCCTC-3′ primers, which introduced EcoRI sites (underlined) in place of start and stop codons, and subsequently cloned into EcoRI-opened pGEX 4T-1, resulting in pGST-RSZ33. To clone full-length atRSZp21, atSRp30,atSRp34/SR1, and atRSZ33 into the yeast expression vector pYX242 (Novagen) fused to the HA tag, the coding regions were PCR-amplified using following primers:atRSZp21, 5′-GTATCACCATGGCGAGGGTTTATGTCGGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCCGGGCACCCCATTGGCATATGG-3′; atSRp30, 5′-GTATCACCATGGGTAGCCGATGGAATCGTAC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCCGGGGATCCAATCCCCAGCTCGT-3′;atSRp34/SR1, 5′-GTATCACCATGGGCAGTCGTTCGAGTAGAACC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCCGGGCCTCGATGGACTCCTAGT-3′; atRSZ33, 5′-GTATCACCATGGCTCGCTATGATGATCGCTATG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCCGGGAGGAGACTCACTTCCTCTAG-3′. Each pair of primers introduced NcoI restriction sites in the place of the start codons and XmaI restriction sites upstream of the stop codons. NcoI/XmaI fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of pYX242, resulting in pRSZp21-HA, pSRp30-HA, pSRp34-HA, and pRSZ33-HA. Promoter and 5′-UTR sequences of atRSZ33 (949 bp) andatRSZp22 (2119 bp) were PCR-amplified using the following primers: atRSZ33, 5′-ATAGTCTAGAACAAACGGAAGTGATTAAACAGTTG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTCTAGATGTCAAGCTGGGGATTGAAGGAGAGC-3′ (XbaI restriction sites), this includes the full 5′-UTR without the first intron; atRSZp22, 5′-GTGGTCGACACAGGAAGTGCAACAGAAGAACCTAG-3′ and 5′-tagcggatcctacttctgtaacctgtcaatggcac-3′ (SalI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively). PCR products were digested with the appropriate enzymes and cloned in front of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene (42Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) in pBI101 plasmid (Clontech). Preparation of the construct for atSRp34/SR1 was described earlier (35Lopato S. Kalyna M. Dorner S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Barta A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The vectors and strains provided in the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System (Clontech) were used to screen the cDNA library in λACT vector, made from random-primed mRNA, isolated from mature Arabidopsisleaves and roots. This library was kindly provided by the DNA Stock Center of Arabidopsis Resource Center (Columbus, OH) and by the National Science Foundation/Department of Energy/U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program, Research Collaboration Group in Plant Protein Phosphorylation (USDA 92-37105-7675). Manipulation of the yeast cells and library screening were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). In short, theSaccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain HF7c was first transformed with the bait vectors and subsequently with the A. thaliana cDNA library. Cells were plated onto 15-cm SD plates (Trp−, Leu−, His−) to select for histidine prototrophy. The His+ colonies were re-streaked on selective medium and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by filters assay. Crude yeast DNA preparations were used to transformE. coli strain DH5α. The sequence from both strands was determined and analyzed by the Genetics Computer Group software package. The pGST-SCL28, pGST-SCL30, pGST-SCL30a, and pGST-RSZ33 plasmids were transformed into the E. coli expression strain BL21-CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene). Overnight cultures grown at 37 °C in LB, in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol, were diluted 100 times and further grown at 37 °C for 3 h. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at anA 600 nm of 1.0 for 2 h at 30 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) and broken with a French press (1,500 p.s.i.). After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C) the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The mixture was transferred into disposable columns and washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Finally, the buffer was exchanged for yeast extraction buffer without NaCl. SR protein constructs in pYX242 were transformed into the yeast strain HF7c and plated on yeast-selective media lacking leucine. A few colonies of each construct were inoculated into 25–50 ml of SD media lacking leucine, and the culture was grown for 2 days at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min, 2,000 rpm) and washed once with ice-cold water. Three cell volumes of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) and 3 cell volumes of glass beads were added to the pellet, and lysis was performed by vortexing four times for 30 s. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, 4 volumes of extraction buffer were added to the glass beads, and the mixture was vortexed once more. The supernatants were mixed together and centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C 15,000 × g. The supernatant from one protein extraction (1 ml) was used for three pull-down assays with the GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were coated with the GST fusion proteins as described above. Two-hundred fifty microliters of extraction buffer without NaCl was added to 50 μl (15-μl bead volume) of the Sepharose beads coated with GST fusion proteins and mixed with 300 μl of yeast extract. The beads were incubated on a rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer, containing 150 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were denatured in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer, and 20 μl was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Inc.). Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures using mouse anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody at a 1:200 dilution. Secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) at 1:10,000 dilution. The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA and Northern blots were carried out as described previously (38Lopato S. Waigmann E. Barta A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Part of the coding region of atRSZ33 (lacking the RS and SP domains) was PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-ATATACCATGGCTCGCTATGATGATC-3′ and 5′-ATATAGGATCCTTACCGCTTTGGACTGCGAG-3′, containingNcoI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pET-3d. Protein overexpression and purification were performed as described previously (36Lopato S. Gattoni R. Fabini G. Stevenin J. Barta A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in chicken and purified as described previously (36Lopato S. Gattoni R. Fabini G. Stevenin J. Barta A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SR proteins were purified from 3-week-oldArabidopsis plants or a 5-day-old Arabidopsiscell suspension culture. Cultivation of plants, suspension culture, and the two-step salt precipitation of SR-proteins were as described (33Lopato S. Mayeda A. Krainer A. Barta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3074-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,36Lopato S. Gattoni R. Fabini G. Stevenin J. Barta A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), except that the 55–65% ammonium sulfate fraction of the whole cell extract was used for the Mg2+ precipitation. Tobacco leaf protoplasts were isolated and transformed (20 μg of plasmid DNA per 106 protoplasts) by the polyethylene glycol method (43Koop H.U. Steinmuller K. Wagner H. Rossler C. Eibl C. Sacher L. Planta. 1996; 199: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Constructs containing fusions ofatRSZ33 and atRSZp22 promoters to β-glucuronidase were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 (44Lazo G.R. Stein P.A. Ludwig R.A. Bio/Technology (N. Y.). 1991; 9: 963-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) by electroporation. A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia, Col-O) plants were transformed by floral dip method (45Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic plants were selected in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin in germination medium (46Valvekens D. VanMontague M. VanLijsebettens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Transgenic plants containing the atSRp34/SR1 promoter-GUS fusion were described earlier (35Lopato S. Kalyna M. Dorner S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Barta A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Plants were grown under long day (16-h light/8-h dark) conditions at 23 °C. Histochemical assays of GUS expression were carried out with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide (Duchefa, The Netherlands) as a substrate and were performed on intact seedlings or excised organs of mature plants as described in a previous study (42Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). The samples were sequentially treated with 70% ethanol for 2–6 h to remove chlorophyll from tissues. GUS staining was performed with plants of T2 or further generation. The sequences were deposited in the EMBL data base, and the accession number are as follows: for atRSZ33, AJ293801; for atSC35,AJ293796; for SCL28, AJ293797; for SCL30,AJ293798; for SCL33, AJ293799; and for SCL30a,AJ293800. To isolate homologs to mammalian SR proteins, the RRM of human SRp55 was used for a data base search of Arabidopsis EST libraries. Two EST clones were identified encoding proteins with significant similarity to SRp55 around the RNP1 and RNP2 submotifs of their RRMs. Sequencing of the entire ESTs revealed that they encoded the same protein of 290 amino acids (Fig.1 A). However, comparison with mammalian SR proteins showed that the sequence similarity was restricted to the RRM domain. The N terminus of the encoded protein consists of an RRM followed by a basic RS-domain (20 Arg and 4 Lys) with multiple RS repeats and two CCHC-type zinc knuckles. (Fig. 1,A and B). In contrast, the C terminus (amino acid residues 198–290) is highly acidic (14 Asp, 5 Glu) and contains 10 SP-dipeptides (Fig. 1, A and B, SP-domain). Due to this domain structure and protein size, it was termed atRSZ33 (A rabidopsis t haliana RS-containingZinc knuckle protein with molecular mass of33kDa). A recent search of the Arabidopsisgenome data base detected a second closely related protein (accession number At3g53500) with 80% identity to atRSZ33, which was named atRSZ32 (Fig. 1 D). Although these two proteins have some structural similarity to the human 9G8 splicing factor and to members of the recently described RSZ family of Arabidopsisproteins, containing one zinc knuckle motif (36Lopato S. Gattoni R. Fabini G. Stevenin J. Barta A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), they seem to be unique plant proteins with no obvious homologs in metazoa. The gene encoding atRSZ33 is situated on the second chromosome and has six introns (Fig. 1 C). The second intron (626 bp) was found to be alternatively spl"

In the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii this function is performed by the subpellicular network, a resilient structure composed of tightly interwoven 10-nm filaments. We report here that this network is assembled at an early stage in the development of daughter parasites. The networks of immature and mature parasites differ dramatically with respect to their stability. Although in immature parasites the network is completely solubilized by detergent, the network in mature parasites is entirely detergent-resistant. Conversion of the detergent-labile to the detergent-resistant network occurs late in daughter cell development and appears to be coupled to proteolytic processing of the carboxyl terminus of TgIMC1, the major subunit of the network filaments. A single cysteine residue in the TgIMC1 carboxyl terminus was found to be essential for this processing event. The dramatic change in resistance to detergent extraction probably reflects an overall change in structural stability of the subpellicular network that accompanies maturation of daughter parasites and allows a switch from an assembly-competent but loose structure to one that is rigid and offers mechanical strength to the mature parasite.

Membrane skeletons, composed of the plasma membrane and its organized underlying coat, are found in many cell types and are essential for mechanical strength and the maintenance of cell shape. Two widely divergent examples are the spectrin-based membrane skeletal system of the erythrocyte and the articulin-based system in the unicellular Euglena. In the erythrocyte, spectrin along with its associated proteins such as ankyrin form a meshwork underlying the plasma membrane (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Google Scholar). In the Euglena, two articulin proteins interact stoichiometrically to form a membrane skeletal system consisting of 40 interdigitating strips (2Huttenlauch I. Peck R.K. Plessmann U. Weber K. Stick R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1909-1919Google Scholar, 3Marrs J.A. Bouck G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1465-1475Google Scholar, 4Dubreuil R.R. Bouck G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1884-1896Google Scholar). Along with the articulins of the Euglena, a number of unique cytoskeletal systems have been described in protists, including the giardins (5Crossley R. Holberton D.V. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 59: 81-103Google Scholar, 6Peattie D.A. Alonso R.A. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2323-2335Google Scholar), assemblins (7Lechtreck K.F. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 705-716Google Scholar), and tetrins (8Honts J.E. Williams N.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 293-302Google Scholar) as well as the components of the subpellicular network, a novel cytoskeletal structure recently identified in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii(9Mann T. Beckers C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 257-268Google Scholar). T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects a wide range of nucleated cells. Human infection with the parasite is generally asymptomatic except in patients with compromised immune systems and during the early stages of pregnancy (10Jackson M.H. Hutchinson W.M. Adv. Parasitol. 1989; 28: 55-105Google Scholar, 11Luft B. Walzer P.D. Genta R.M. Parasitic Diseases in the Compromised Host. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 179-279Google Scholar). Like the other members of the phylum Apicomplexa, such as Plasmodiumsp. or Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma has a number of prominent structural elements. Chief among these is the pellicle, composed of the plasma membrane and the inner membrane complex, flattened membrane cisternae possibly derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (12Scholtyseck E. Hammod D.M. Long P.L. The Coccidia: Eimeria, Isospora, Toxoplasma and Related Genera. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1973: 81-144Google Scholar, 13Chobotar W.M. Scholtyseck E. Long P.L. The Biology of the Coccidia. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1985: 101-165Google Scholar). Recently, we described a filamentous network, the subpellicular network, that is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane complex along the entire length of the parasite. This resilient structure appears to act as the membrane skeleton of the pellicle and thereby lends the parasite the mechanical strength it needs for survival. The subpellicular network is composed of a fine mesh of 10-nm filaments and appears to consist, at least in large part, of two novel proteins, TgIMC1 and TgIMC2, that have some structural similarity to intermediate filaments in animal cells (9Mann T. Beckers C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 257-268Google Scholar). In addition to the subpellicular network, Toxoplasma also possesses a tubulin-based cytoskeleton that lies on the cytoplasmic face of the subpellicular network and consists of 22 subpellicular microtubules, a conoid, and polar ring (14Russell D.G. Sinden R.E. Int. J. Parasit. 1982; 12: 221-226Google Scholar, 15Russell D.G. Burns R.G. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 65: 193-207Google Scholar, 16Nichols B.A. Chiappino M.L. J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 217-226Google Scholar). After invasion of the host cell, the parasite establishes itself inside a vacuole of its own making, the parasitophorous vacuole, and initiates replication. In Toxoplasma, cell division occurs through a specialized form of binary fission, endodyogeny, in which two complete daughter cells are formed within the mother cell. This process begins with the formation of two new conoids and polar rings in close apposition to the nucleus. This is followed by the gradual elongation of the subpellicular microtubules of the daughter cells and acquisition of an inner membrane complex. After nuclear division, the daughter nuclei, along with other organelles, are partitioned between the developing daughter parasites. These continue to enlarge, and as they fill the mother cell, the remaining maternal organelles as well as the inner membrane complex degenerate. At this time, the maternal plasma membrane associates with the inner membrane complex of the daughter cells, generating two parasites with complete pellicles. This unusual mode of replication ensures that the daughter parasites are contained and protected within a fully infectious mother cell until replication is completed (17Goldman M. Carver R. Sulzer A. J. Parasitol. 1958; 44: 161-171Google Scholar, 18Sheffield H. Melton M. J. Parasitol. 1968; 54: 209-226Google Scholar, 19Vivier E. Petitprez A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 329-342Google Scholar). We describe here that the subpellicular network of daughter parasites begins to assemble during an early stage in parasite replication. In addition, we have determined that the subpellicular networks in mother and daughter parasites differ markedly in their stability. Although the network in mother parasites is essentially resistant to extraction with detergent, the same structure in daughter parasites is highly susceptible. The different stabilities may reflect the need of the daughter cell network to remain plastic during growth and the need for the mother cell network to provide mechanical strength. The conversion from a detergent-sensitive to a detergent-resistant network appears to be coupled to the carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing of TgIMC1. These data suggest that T. gondii has developed a unique process to control the assembly and mechanical strength of its membrane skeleton during cell division. This appears specifically designed to allow for the generation of infectious daughter parasites without exposing them to their hostile environment before their membrane skeleton is fully formed and stable. All chemical reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) unless otherwise noted. Pfu Turbo was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen (Alameda, CA). The RH (HXGPRT−) strain of T. gondii (kindly provided by Dr. David Roos, University of Pennsylvania) was maintained by serial passage in confluent cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) 1The abbreviations used are: HFF, human foreskin fibroblasts; HA, hemagglutinin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; DOC, sodium deoxycholate; C-CRD, carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. or VERO cells in α-minimal essential medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Parasites were harvested by syringe passage followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. For the construction of the expression vector pEXP, the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of SAG1 were cloned into pBluescript KS. The SAG1 open reading frame was replaced by a short linker region containing anNdeI site overlapping the original start codon of SAG1 and an NotI site. The HXGPRT selection marker under control of its own promoter was inserted downstream of the SAG1 3′-untranslated region. For the production of vectors containing either an amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal HA tag, pEXP1 was digested with NdeI andNotI, and linkers encoding the HA tag were inserted between these sites. To create amino-terminally tagged proteins the vector pEXP-NtermHA was created using the oligonucleotides 5′-tatgtacccatacgatgttcctgactatgcgggcggatccctcagc-3′ and 5′-ggccgctgagggatccgcccgcatgtcaggaacatcgtagggtaca-3′. In this vector unique BamHI site (underlined) was introduced immediately following the HA tag to allow insertion of the sequence to be tagged. To create carboxyl-terminally tagged proteins, the vector pEXP-CtermHA was generated using the oligonucleotides 5′-tatgctcagtatacccatacgatgttcctgactatgcgggctaagc-3′ and 5′-ggcgcttagcccgcatagtcaggaacatcgtatgggtatactgagca-3′. In this vector a unique Bst1107 (underlined) was introduced immediately preceding the HA tag to allow insertion of the sequence to be tagged. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT). For the production of TgIMC1 with either an amino- or carboxyl-terminal HA tag, the TgIMC1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a full-length cDNA clone and cloned into pEXP-NtermHA or pEXP-CtermHA. To introduce an amino-terminal HA tag into IMC1, PCR was performed using the primer 5′-ggatccatgtttaaggactgcgccgat-3′, which introduces a unique BamHI site (underlined) at the start of the TgIMC1 open reading frame, and 5′-gcggccgcttagcactggcatcggcac-3′, which introduces a NotI site immediately after the TgIMC1 stop codon. To introduce a carboxyl-terminal HA tag, PCR was performed using 5′-gacctccatatgtttaaggactgcgccg-3′, which introduces an NdeI site (underlined) at the start codon of TgIMC1, and 5′-cgaggtatacgcactggcatcggcacac-3′, which introduces aBst1107 site immediately preceding the TgIMC1 stop codon. The resulting constructs were named pHA-IMC1 and pIMC1-HA. Full-length TgIMC1 cloned, as described above, in the pEXP-CtermHA vector was used as the PCR template. An amino-terminal primer that binds in the SAG1 5′-untranslated region, 5′-cacacggttgtatgtcgg-3′, was used with the following carboxyl-terminal primers containing a Bst1107 site (underlined) after the last desired amino acid: IMC1(Δ592–609)-5′-gaggtatacctgggcagcttccggttctggcgctgc-3′; IMC1(Δ595–609)-5′-ctactagtatacgacgcagcactgggcagcttccgg-3′; IMC1(Δ598–609)-5′-ctactagtataccgcgcacatgacgcagcac-3′; IMC1(Δ601–609)-5′-ctactagtatacgccgcagaccgcgcacatgacg-3′; IMC1(Δ605–609)-5′-ctactagtatacaccatcaccgccgcagaccgc-3′. PCR products were gel-purified and inserted between the NdeI and Bst1107 sites of pEXP-CtermHA. The last 333 nucleotide acids of the TgIMC1 open reading frame along with the HA tag were moved from pIMC1-HA and cloned into pBluescript SKII using the restriction sites XmaI and NotI. All point mutations of interest were generated by inverse PCR using this plasmid as template. The mutagenic primers IMC1(C592T)-5′-gcacatgacgcaggtctgggcagcttcc-3′, IMC1(C593T)-5′-gcacatgacggtgcactgggcagcttcc-3′, IMC1(V594G)-5′-gcacatgccgcagcactgggcagcttc-3′, IMC1(M595G)-5′-gcacccgacgcagcactgggcagcttcc-3′ were used with the primer 5′-gcagtctgcggcggtgatggtgtg-3′. The mutagenic primers IMC1(C596T)-5′-accgcggtctgcggcggtgatg-3′, IMC1(A597G)-5′-tgcggggtctgcggcggtgatg-3′ and IMC1(V598G)-5′-tgcgcgggctgcggcggtgatg-3′ were used with the primer 5′-catgacgcagcactgggcagcttcc-3′. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified, recircularized with T4 DNA ligase, and transformed in to Escherichia coli JM109. The mutagenized region of IMC1 along with the HA tag were excised usingBsrGI and NotI and inserted between theBsrGI and NotI sites of pIMC1-HA. For in situ extraction experiments, a sequence containing residues 1–586 of IMC1 was amplified by PCR from the plasmid ptubβ-IMC1-YFP/sagCAT (20Hu K. Mann T. Striepen B. Beckers C.J. Roos D.S. Murray J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 593-606Google Scholar) using a forward primer that binds in the tubulin promoter region, 5′-cgcgcagaagacatccaccaaacg-3′ and a reverse primer, 5′-gtccctaggaactggcttgatcacgtc-3′, which introduces an AvrII site (underlined) after residue 586. The PCR product was gel-purified and digested withBglII and AvrII for cloning into the similar digested ptubβ-IMC1-YFP/sagCAT. Extracellular parasites were transfected with 50 μg of circular plasmid DNA by electroporation in a 2-mm cuvette at 1.5 kV, 25 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The parasites were then added to a confluent monolayer of HFF cells and allowed to invade for 4–5 h. When transfected with derivatives of pEXP, they were subjected to selection using 50 μg/ml xanthine (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). A confluent monolayer of HFF cells in a T75 flask was infected with 3 × 107parasites. The parasites were allowed to invade host cells and replicate for 16–18 h. The normal growth medium was removed, and the parasite-infected cells were incubated 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium, followed by the addition of 0.7 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The incubation was continued for 20–24 h after which the parasites were harvested as usual and washed in normal growth medium containing methionine and cysteine. For each time point one T25 flask with confluent HFF cells was infected with 107 radiolabeled parasites, and coverslips of HFF cells were infected with 105 parasites each. After a 2-h invasion period, all culture supernatants were aspirated and replaced with fresh medium. At the indicated times, a set of infected coverslips was fixed for 5 min in cold methanol and stored at −20 °C, and parasites were harvested from a T25 flask in cold PBS, pelleted, and stored at −20 °C. After collection of the last time point, sequential immunoprecipitations were performed on the sample from each time point using anti-TgIMC1 and anti-TgCDPK1 antisera. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Densitometric analysis of film was performed using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). The extent of parasite replication was determined by counting the average number of parasites per vacuole by phase contrast microscopy (n = 2). For the sample treated with pyrimethamine, the 2-h invasion period was followed by the addition of fresh media containing 1 μm pyrimethamine (Sigma). Confluent monolayers of HFF cells in two T25 flasks were infected with 107 parasites for 16–18 h. The normal growth medium was removed, and the parasite-infected cells were incubated 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium, followed by the addition of 0.7 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences). After a 30-min incubation, one flask was placed on ice. The labeling medium in the second flask was replaced with normal growth medium containing 1 mm methionine and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Infected cells were harvested on ice from both flasks by scraping and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm. TgIMC1 was immunoprecipitated from both samples as described below. Parasite pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS and subjected to three rounds of freezing and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. 900 μl of 2% Triton X-100 in TBS and protease inhibitors were added followed by a 5-min incubation on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with primary antibody for 1 h on ice followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for another hour at 4 °C. Immune complexes were pelleted and washed three times in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The immunoprecipitated proteins were released by resuspension in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. For radiolabeled samples, electrophoresis gels were treated with 0.125 m sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. HFF cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks were infected with 107untransfected Toxoplasma or parasites expressing full-length IMC1 with a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. After 16–20 h, the HFF cells were washed twice with cold TBS and scraped into 2 ml of TBS. Parasites were released by passage through a 25-gauge needle and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. Parasites were solubilized in 1% DOC in TBS for 5 min on ice in the presence of protease inhibitors. The DOC-soluble and insoluble materials were prepared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The DOC-insoluble pellet was again extracted with DOC as above, and the DOC-soluble fractions were pooled. Fractions corresponding to 106 parasites were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 6% gel and immunoblot with anti-TgIMC1 or anti-HA antibodies. Protein preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Where indicated, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with different antisera as described before (22Beckers C.J. Dubremetz J.F. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 947-961Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected using the Super Signal kit from (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunofluorescence on infected parasites, coverslips of confluent or semi-confluent HFF cells were infected with 105 parasites. Parasites were allowed to replicate overnight before being fixed for 5 min in cold methanol. Extracellular parasites washed in PBS were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine coated glass coverslips for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently washed in PBS to remove unbound parasites. Attached parasites were extracted 5 min in 1% DOC in PBS, washed three times in PBS, and fixed for 5 min in cold methanol or first extracted with 1% DOC followed by methanol fixation. Samples were incubated for 30 min in primary antibodies diluted 1:500 (HA) or 1:1000 (anti-IMC1) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Bound antibodies were visualized using fluorescein or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies at the dilutions suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The coverslips were mounted in MOWIOL. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX60, and images were photographed using Kodak T-max 400 film. Individual negatives were scanned using a Nikon LS-2000 scanner (Nikon Corp., Melville, NY), and images were processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Photosystems, Inc., San Jose, CA). To understand the assembly properties of the subpellicular network, we examined the formation of the subpellicular network during endodyogeny. As can be seen in Fig.1, the network of the new daughter cells can first be detected at a very early stage of endodyogeny, prior to any evidence of nuclear division. The mother cell network does not appear to change during assembly of the daughter cell network. Only during the final stages of endodyogeny is there any evidence for disruption of the network in the mother cell, as judged by a reduction in the fluorescence signal in that structure. The proteins that make up the subpellicular network of the mother cell do not appear to be reused during assembly of the network in the daughter cells. TgCDPK1, a cytoplasmic protein kinase, displays a half-life of 32 h over a period encompassing several 8-h Toxoplasma life cycles and is therefore likely reused (Fig. 2). The TgIMC1 in newly invaded parasites, on the other hand, appears to be relatively stable during the first 12 h of intracellular development but is degraded rapidly at the time the first parasite cell divisions become evident (Fig. 2). This result indicates that the proteins that make up the subpellicular network are not recycled and reused for the assembly of the daughter cells but are instead degraded during the late stages of endodyogeny. This conclusion is strengthened by the observation that the inhibition of parasite replication by pyrimethamine prevents TgIMC1 degradation almost completely (Fig.2).Figure 2TgIMC1 is degraded rather than recycled during Toxoplasma cell division. A, the turnover rate of TgIMC1 and its relationship toToxoplasma replication was determined by infecting HFF monolayers with metabolically labeled parasites as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After removal of non-invaded parasites at 2 h, samples were taken approximately every 12 h over a period of 40 h. The average number of parasites per vacuole at each time point was determined to follow parasite replication. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-TgIMC1 antibodies and anti-TgCDPK1 antibodies. Densitometric analysis was performed, and the data were graphed as a fraction of the optical density observed at the 2-h time point. B, to verify that TgIMC degradation is linked to Toxoplasma replication, TgIMC1 was immunoprecipitated after incubation of infected cells for 2 or 24 h in the absence and presence of pyrimethamine (PYR), a potent inhibitor of parasite replication.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the process of studying the effects of the overexpression of TgIMC1 on the morphology of T. gondii, it was necessary to differentiate TgIMC1 produced under control of other promoters from the endogenous protein. Because we did not know whether insertion of an epitope tag would affect TgIMC1, we generated versions of this protein with either an amino- or a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. As can be seen in Fig.3, both forms of the protein are expressed well in T. gondii. In the case of the amino-terminal HA-tagged TgIMC1, the protein is found in the subpellicular network of the growing daughter cells and mature parasites, indicating that it behaves analogous to the normal, endogenous TgIMC1. Although TgIMC1 with a carboxyl-terminal HA tag is also targeted efficiently to the network in growing daughter cells (Fig. 3), it is virtually undetectable in the network of mature parasites (Fig. 3). This observation is most easily explained by the proteolytic removal of the carboxyl terminus of TgIMC1 during daughter cell maturation. To determine if endogenous TgIMC1 actually undergoes proteolytic processing during parasite maturation and where the cleavage site might be, we performed a pulse-chase experiment followed by immunoprecipitation of TgIMC1. As can be seen in Fig.4, pulse-labeled TgIMC1 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa, which decreases by about 5 kDa during the chase period. Precursor and mature TgIMC1 are also detectable by immunoblot analysis in intracellular, actively replicating, parasites (see Fig. 7 A). In extracellular, non-replicating, parasites only the mature form of TgIMC1 is detectable. Take together with the previous observations, these results indicate that TgIMC1 indeed undergoes proteolytic processing at its carboxyl terminus during maturation of the parasite daughter cells.Figure 7Carboxyl-terminal processing affects the detergent solubility of TgIMC1. A, parasites were extracted with 1% DOC, and the total extract (TOT), and detergent-soluble (SN), and insoluble fractions (P) were examined by immunoblot analysis with anti-TgIMC1 antiserum. B, parasites expressing full-length TgIMC1 with a carboxyl-terminal HA tag were extracted with 1% DOC as above and total (TOT), detergent-soluble (SN), and insoluble (P) fractions were analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies to TgIMC1 and the HA tag.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It appears that the carboxyl-terminal processing occurs at a very late stage in daughter cell maturation. Even at the stage of endodyogeny when the daughter cells take up most of the mother parasite cytoplasm, the HA tag is still detectable (Fig. 3). Yet we have only very rarely detected the HA tag in mature parasites. This suggests that carboxyl terminal processing of TgIMC1 occurs at the time of or very shortly after emergence of daughter cells from the mother parasite. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of TgIMC1 had previously revealed that both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of TgIMC1 are relatively rich in cysteine residues (9Mann T. Beckers C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 257-268Google Scholar). The role of these residues and their possible modification by, for example, the addition of lipids has not been determined. To determine whether the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain (C-CRD) played a role in the proteolytic processing of TgIMC1 during endodyogeny, we generated a mutant TgIMC1 in which amino acids 592–609, comprising the entire C-CRD, was deleted and replaced by the HA tag. As can be seen in Fig.5, the mutant TgIMC1 was expressed inToxoplasma and targeted correctly to the inner membrane complex of daughter parasites. But unlike the full-length TgIMC1, the HA tag was not cleaved during maturation of the daughter cells and was present in mature cells. To determine more precisely which residues in the C-CRD are essential for carboxyl-terminal processing, we generated a nested set of carboxyl-terminal deletions of TgIMC1 that were fused to an HA tag. These constructs were transfected intoToxoplasma, and removal of the HA tag during parasite cell division was monitored. As can be seen in Fig. 5, carboxyl-terminal processing is still observed in the absence of residues 595–609 but not in the original deletion mutant in which amino acids 592–609 are removed. This finding implies that one or more of residues 592, 593, and 594, in the sequence Cys-Cys-Val, are essential for carboxyl-terminal processing to occur. The role of the individual amino acids in this sequence was determined by the generation of TgIMC1 mutants in which residues 592–596 of the C-CRD were altered individually. As can be seen in Fig. 5, mutation of most residues of this domain did not have a detectable effect on proteolytic processing of TgIMC1 with the exception of the residue 593. Mutation of this cysteine to a threonine (C593T) resulted in a complete loss of carboxyl-terminal processing of TgIMC1, indicating it is essential. Carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing could perform a number of roles in the parasite. However, our observation, that this processing event appears to occur immediately prior to completion of cell division, suggests it plays a role in the final maturation step of Toxoplasma daughter cells. One obvious change that needs to occur in the subpellicular network of replicating parasites upon maturation is the conversion of a plastic structure, which can be expanded and remodeled during growth of the daughter cells and is, therefore, inherently unstable, to a rigid and stable structure that can protect the mature parasite in its extracellular travel from host cell to host cell. To determine if there is indeed a detectable difference in the properties of the network in mature and immature parasites, we transfected Toxoplasma with a construct containing amino acid residues 1–586 of TgIMC1 fused to YFP. This construct does not undergo carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing during parasite maturation (Fig. 6 A) and can therefore be used to visualize the network in all stages of parasite cell division. We first identified parasites carrying daughter cells microscopically and subsequently extracted these by the addition of deoxycholate (DOC), a d"

A human binding protein, whose mRNA is expressed primarily in kidney, heart, and transverse colon, is shown here to be a CRBP family member (human CRBP IV), according to amino acid sequence, phylogenetic analysis, gene structure organization, and x-ray structural analysis. Retinol binding to CRBP IV leads to an absorption spectrum distinct from a typical holo-CRBP spectrum and is characterized by an affinity (K d = ∼200 nm) lower than those for CRBP I, II, and III, as established in direct and competitive binding assays.

The 2-Å resolution crystal structure of human apo-CRBP IV is very similar to those of other structurally characterized CRBPs. The side chain of Tyr60 is present within the binding cavity of the apoprotein and might affect the interaction with the retinol molecule.

In all these proteins, 10 β-strands (A−J) and two α-helices (I and II) fold to form a well-defined β-barrel, the internal cavity of which contains the binding site for the hydrophobic ligand.

A recent in vivo study has shown that retinol esterification and intercellular retinol transfer between liver cells are strongly impaired in CRBP I-null mice, suggesting a key role of CRBP I in these two processes (19Ghyselinck N.B. Bavik C. Sapin V. Mark M. Bonnier D. Hindelang C. Dierich A. Nilsson C.B. Hakansson H. Sauvant P. Azais-Braesco V. Frasson M. Picaud S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). CRBP II, a protein essentially confined to the small intestine, supports efficient retinol esterification (15Herr F.M. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6748-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that CRBP II is involved specifically in the intestinal absorption and/or metabolism of retinoids.Recently, a putative CRBP, human CRBP III, has been identified, heterologously expressed, and structurally characterized (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This protein has been shown to interact specifically with retinol in vitro, producing a characteristic absorption spectrum quite similar to those of rat holo-CRBP I and II. A murine iLBP, the amino acid sequence of which suggests that it belongs to the CRBP family, has also been recently identified and heterologously expressed (21Conforti L. Tarlton A. Mack T.G.A., Mi, W. Buckmaster E.A. Wagner D. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11377-11382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 22Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L.

This protein, which was designated murine CRBP III (22Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol.

We report here the identification, ligand binding, tissue distribution, and crystal structure of a human putative CRBP, which is very closely related phylogenetically to murine CRBP III.DISCUSSIONCRBPs are cytoplasmic retinol-binding proteins that are thought to play an important role in retinol uptake, storage, and metabolism. Mammalian CRBP I and II are the best-characterized members of the CRBP family. The absorption spectra of rat CRBP I and II complexed with their endogenous ligand, all-trans-retinol, have been found to be quite similar and are characterized by a peculiar fine structure (36Ong D.E. Chytil F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 828-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1476-1482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two putative CRBPs, which were both designated CRBP III but are two distinct CRBP types, have been identified and heterologously expressed: human CRBP III (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and murine CRBP III (21Conforti L. Tarlton A. Mack T.G.A., Mi, W. Buckmaster E.A. Wagner D. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11377-11382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,22Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L.

Although retinol has been proposed to be the endogenous ligand of these two putative CRBPs, the demonstration that these proteins bind the vitamin physiologically is still lacking. The evidence that retinol is their endogenous ligand is based upon the following observations. Amino acid sequence analyses have revealed a significantly higher identity with the CRBP family members than with the other iLBPs. The binding of retinol to the apoproteins has been reported to produce an absorption spectrum typical of a retinol-CRBP complex in the case of human CRBP III (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and an increase in retinol fluorescence in the case of murine CRBP III (22Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1353-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The x-ray molecular model of CRBP III closely resembles the CRBP I and II molecular models (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite the replacement of Gln108, which is hydrogen-bonded to retinol in holo-CRBP I and II (5Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Winter N.S. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), by a His residue in human CRBP III, the side chain of this residue is properly positioned within the binding cavity of apo-CRBP III, such that it has the potential to hydrogen bond the vitamin in the holoprotein (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A binding protein, human CRBP IV, which is related most closely to murine CRBP III, is shown here to belong to a distinct CRBP subfamily and to exhibit rather distinct ligand binding properties.The recent completion of the draft sequence of the human genome has allowed the analysis of the gene structure organization for the human CRBP types, including human CRBP IV. The gene structure organization for human CRBPs is very similar to that reported for both CRABPs (38Mansfield S.G. Cammer S. Alexander S.C. Muehleisen D.P. Gray R.S. Tropsha A. Bollenbacher W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6825-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and FABPs (39Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 277-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and consists of three exons of similar size separated by four introns of variable size. Notably, the size of translated exon sequences and intron position for the human CRBP IV gene are virtually identical to those of the other human CRBP genes. A phylogenetic tree for CRBPs has also been obtained, showing the relationships between a number of CRBPs. While being consistent with the existence of a clear phylogenetic relatedness among a number of binding proteins that may thus be associated with the CRBP family, taken together, these data support the notion that such proteins, including those from remote species, belong to clearly distinct CRBP subfamilies.A rather low binding affinity of human CRBP IV for all-trans-retinol, as compared with the other CRBP types, has been determined in both direct and competitive binding assays. The estimated K d value for CRBP IV (K d = ∼200 nm) is significantly higher that those determined previously for mammalian CRBP I (K d as low as 0.1 nm; Refs. 40Li E. Qian S.J.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), CRBP II (K d = ∼10 nm; Ref. 42Levin M.S. Locke B. Yang N.C., Li, E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17715-17723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CRBP III (K d = ∼60 nm; Ref. 20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and is more similar to that reported for the orthologous murine CRBP III (K d = ∼109 nm; Ref. 22Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1353-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After incubation with CRBP IV, the synthetic retinoid 13-cis-retinol gives rise to an UV-visible absorption spectrum close to that of the all-trans-retinol-CRBP IV complex, albeit red-shifted by about 5 nm (data not shown). It is worth noting that a similar red shift is also observed for the spectrum of the 13-cis-retinol-CRBP I complex compared with that of the all-trans-retinol-CRBP I complex. Instead, the spectra obtained with all-trans- and 13-cis-retinaldehyde and all-trans-retinoic acid were close to those of the unbound compounds in the aqueous medium. These results are consistent with the observation that 13-cis-retinol binds to murine CRBP III, whereas retinoic acid and retinaldehyde isomers, as well as fatty acids, fail to bind to this binding protein (22Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1353-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).At variance with the tissue distribution of murine CRBP III mRNA, for which heart, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and mammary gland have been found to be the richest organs (21Conforti L. Tarlton A. Mack T.G.A., Mi, W. Buckmaster E.A. Wagner D. Perry V.H. Coleman M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11377-11382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 22Vogel S.

It is worth considering, however, that distinct mRNA tissue distributions for another CRBP type (CRBP I) were also observed in humans (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the rat (1Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar). Instead, in both humans and the rat, CRBP II mRNA expression is confined essentially to the small intestine (1Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar, 20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and CRBP IV points to distinct roles for these two putative CRBPs concomitantly present in this organ.The apo and holo structures of rat CRBP I and II have been determined previously. Whereas the analysis of the solution structure of rat CRBP I (9Franzoni L. Lücke C. Pérez C. Cavazzini D. Rademacher M. Ludwig C. Spisni A. Rossi G.L. Rüterjans H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21983-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the x-ray structure of rat CRBP II (6Winter N.S. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) did not reveal significant structural differences between the apo and holo states of these two proteins, conformational changes affecting several protein regions have been reported for rat CRBP II in solution (7Lu J.Y. Lin C.L. Tang C.G. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1179-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Lu J.Y. Lin C.L. Tang C.G. Ponder J.W. Kao J.L.F. Cistola D.P. Li E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, significant conformational differences, involving βC-βD and βE-βF turns, have been found for the apo and holo crystal structures of a zebrafish CRBP (34Calderone V. Folli C. Marchesani A. Berni R. Zanotti G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with the existence of a remarkable amino acid sequence identity between human CRBP IV and the other CRBP family members, the tertiary structure of human apo-CRBP IV is highly similar to those of previously characterized CRBPs. As in the case of other CRBPs, crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction were obtained from bacterially expressed CRBP IV not supplemented with any ligand during purification and crystallization procedures. However, a continuous electron density was visible inside the central cavity of the β-barrel of apo-CRBP IV, as also observed in the case of human apo-CRBP III (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This density is likely to be due to the presence in the binding cavity of nonspecific, possibly hydrophobic, ligand/ligands to which CRBP IV became exposed during heterologous expression. Due to the partial occupancy of the retinol-binding site by such compounds in place of the endogenous ligand, the structure of the presumed apo form of CRBP IV we have obtained is likely to be more similar to that of a holoprotein than to that of an apoprotein.Because of the instability of the retinol-CRBP IV complex during the course of protein crystallization, crystals of holo-CRBP IV could not be obtained, and therefore, the mode of binding of retinol to CRBP IV could not be established on a structural basis. The finding of an absorption spectrum of holo-CRBP IV rather different from those of the other holo-CRBPs suggests a relatively different mode of binding of the vitamin. Consistent with the results of binding experiments with the CRBP I/Q108H and CRBP IV/H108Q mutants, the modification of the absorption spectrum of the retinol-CRBP IV complex is not attributable to the presence of a His residue at position 108. The crystal structure of apo-CRBP IV has revealed a position of the side chain of Tyr60 incompatible with the orientation of the retinol β-ionone ring, within the binding cavity, that has been established previously for holo-CRBP I and II (5Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Winter N.S. Bratt J.M. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An accommodation of the β-ionone ring inside the binding cavity compatible with the presence of the Tyr60 side chain might be responsible for the observed modification of the holo-CRBP IV absorption spectrum. However, it is worth mentioning that in the case of a crystalline zebrafish, apo-CRBP side chains of residues of β-turns βC-βD and βE-βF, as well as the side chain of Tyr60, are present within the cavity of the apoprotein and that such side chains are displaced from the binding cavity on ligand binding (34Calderone V. Folli C. Marchesani A. Berni R. Zanotti G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A similar conformational change, albeit limited to the side chain of Tyr60, might also accompany the binding of retinol to human apo-CRBP IV. A rather distinct mode of binding of retinol to CRBP IV, together with a moderately low binding affinity, might represent a peculiar property of this binding protein. Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient that plays a key role in vision, cell growth and differentiation, and embryonic development. Because of its chemical instability and quite low solubility in the aqueous medium, the retinol molecule needs to be bound by specific binding proteins in body fluids and within the cell. Cytoplasmic carriers of the retinol molecule are monomeric proteins of ∼15.5 kDa, the cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs)1 (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 283-318Google Scholar and 2Li E. Norris A.W. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). They belong to a superfamily of small cytoplasmic proteins that interact specifically with hydrophobic ligands, the intracellular lipid-binding proteins (iLBPs). Besides CRBPs, well-characterized members of the iLBP superfamily are the cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPs) and the fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs). Despite the fact that members of the different protein families may possess a low sequence identity, a basic structural motif has been found for the iLBPs characterized thus far (for reviews, see Refs. 3Banaszak L.

Biochem. 1998; 30: 53-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In all these proteins, 10 β-strands (A−J) and two α-helices (I and II) fold to form a well-defined β-barrel, the internal cavity of which contains the binding site for the hydrophobic ligand. The properties of rat CRBP I and II have been investigated extensively (1Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine.

It has been proposed that CRBP II is involved specifically in the intestinal absorption and/or metabolism of retinoids. Recently, a putative CRBP, human CRBP III, has been identified, heterologously expressed, and structurally characterized (20Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M.

The LGICs are involved in mediating fast neurotransmission in the central nervous system but play different roles, which is reflected in their different ion selectivities. GABAARs and GlyRs are anion-selective whereas the nAChRs and 5-HT3Rs are cation-selective (3Karlin A. Akabas M.H.

Each subunit has a large extracellular N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain containing four transmembrane segments, designated M1–M4, connected by relatively short loops. The extracellular N-terminal domains are believed to form the agonist binding sites, whereas the transmembrane domains form the channel; with the five M2 domains being the primary lining of the ion-conducting pore of the receptor (11Imoto K.

All the data support a hypothesis of a predominant α-helical structure of the M2 domains with a slight kink in the center. The pore was found to be widest at the extracellular end narrowing toward the cytoplasmic side (12Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Akabas M.H. Kaufman C.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The selectivity filter and gate was found to be at the intracellular end of the M2 domains and to include a part of the M1–M2 loop (16Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Differences between the individual LGICs were observed, but in general both anions and cations can enter the extracellular vestibules, charge selection occurs at a more intracellular position than 13′, and the gate is constituted by amino acids in positions −3′ to 2′ (see Fig. 1). Besides the structural homology, the LGICs also show considerable sequence homology, particularly in the pore forming domains. This suggests a common quaternary structure of the channels, irrespective of the charge of the permeating ion, with charge selection being accommodated through minor alterations of the overall design of the channel. The first example of conversion of the ion selectivity filter of a member of the LGICs was provided by Galzi et al.(18Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1992; 359: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). By conducting a series of mutations of the homomeric nAChR α7, it was demonstrated that mutating three residues was sufficient to alter the ion selectivity from cationic to anionic: A proline insertion at position −2′, a mutation of the adjacent glutamate (E-1′A) near the intracellular border of the M2 domain, and a mutation in the central part of the M2 domain (V13′T) (see Fig. 1). Moreover, the ion selectivity of the homomeric 5-HT3AR and that of the homomeric GlyR α1 have been changed by the same or inverse set of mutations, respectively (19Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. French C.R. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 247-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Gunthorpe M.J. Lummis S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10977-10983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar), thereby proving that charge selection is indeed a function of minor alterations in the M1–M2 loop and in the M2 domains of all LGICs. This evidence has all been established using members of the LGICs that are capable of assembling into homomeric receptors. However, the majority of the LGICs are known to function as heteromeric complexes consisting of up to four different subunits. The predominant GABAAR subtypes in the central nervous system are believed to consist of two α subunits, two β subunits, and one γ subunit (8Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5414-5424Google Scholar, 9Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mossier B. Togel M. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in vitro, receptors composed of only α and β subunits are believed to consist of two α and three β subunits (9Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the underlying principle and actual location of the ion selectivity filter have been unequivocally resolved, the question still remains as to how this knowledge extends to the heteromeric receptors. The present study provides the first example of conversion of the ion selectivity of a heteromeric receptor, namely the GABAAR α2β3γ2. As for other LGICs, the selectivity filter was shown to be located at the intracellular border of the M2 domain. However, the different subunits were shown to have different roles in defining the ion selectivity. A number of data sets ascribed a unique role of the β3 subunit in the determination of the ion selectivity. This raises important questions as to the function of the individual subunits in a pentameric receptor. The GABAA receptor subunits α2, β3, and γ2L were cloned from human hippocampus poly(A)+ mRNA (Clontech) using reverse transcriptase-PCR. First-strand cDNA was obtained using oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length cDNA sequences were obtained by PCR reactions using the Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the specific primer sets (MWG Biotech) listed below. α2 s, 5′-AGAGCGGCGGTGATGAAGACAAAATTGAACAT-3′; α2 as, 5′-TACATCCCAAAGATAACATGGGTCTCAATTCA-3′; β3 s, 5′-CCGGGGCGCGGCGGAGGGATGTG-3′; β3 as, 5′-TTGACAGGCAGAGTAATATTTCACTCAGTGTT-3′; γ2 s, 5′-CTGCAACCAAGAGGCAAGAGGCGAGAG-3′; γ2 as, 5′-CCATATCAGTAAAACCCATACCTCCTCACAGG-3′. The cDNAs were cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene) and positive clones were sequenced bidirectionally. The α2 subunit was sub-cloned into the pNS1z vector, the β3 subunit was sub-cloned into the pNS1n vector, and the γ2L subunit was sub-cloned into the pZeoSV vector (Invitrogen). The pNS1n and pNS1z vectors are customized vectors derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with expression under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, whereas the pZeoSV vector uses the SV40 promoter. Using site-directed mutagenesis (23Slilaty S.N. Fung M. Shen S.H. Lebel S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), aHindIII site was introduced in the loop between the M1 and M2 domains and a Bsu36I site was introduced in the loop between the M2 and M3 domains in all receptor subunits.HindIII and Bsu36I sites at other positions within the cDNAs were eliminated without affecting the amino acid sequence. Briefly, plasmids were uracilated by means of theEscherichia coli line RZ1032, and uracilated plasmids were used as the template for introducing mutations by means of mutagenic oligonucleotides and T7 DNA polymerase. An aliquot from the mutagenesis reaction was transformed into the E. coli line XL1-Blue, and mutated plasmids were identified by introduction or elimination of restriction sites. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to eliminate native restriction sites were: β3-HindIII, 5′-CAAAGGCAGAAGAAGCTGGCAGAAAAGACAGCC-3′; β3-Bsu36I, 5′-GCATGATGGACCTCCGCAGATACCCCCTGGACGAG-3′; γ2-Bsu36I, 5′-GACTCCAAAAGTTCCCGAGGGTGATGTCAC-3′; γ2-Bsu36I, 5′-GTGGTGTAGGCCCTACGCTTGACAATTGATGCTG-3′. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to introduce restriction sites were: α2-HindIII, 5′-GTCATTCTCTCCCAAGTAAGCTTCTGGCTTAACAGAG-3′; α2-Bsu36I, 5′-CTCGGAATTCTCTCCCTAAGGTGGCTTATGCAACTG-3′; β3-HindIII, 5′-CGATTCTGTCGTGGGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAATTATGATG-3′; β3-Bsu36I, 5′-CGGGAGACCTTGCCTAAGGTCCCCTATGTCAAAGC-3′; γ2-HindIII, 5′-CGTCCTATCCTGGGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAATAAGGATG-3′; γ2-Bsu36I, 5′-CGGAAATCGCTCCCTAAGGTCTCCTATGTC-3′. A set of chimeric GABAAR subunits was constructed in which the M2 domains were moved from one subunit to another by restriction digestion and ligation. The plasmids were digested by the restriction enzymes HindIII and Bsu36I, and fragments were separated using gel-electrophoresis and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Chimeric subunits were ligated using the rapid ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To create chimeric GABAARs with non-GABA M2 domains, two approaches were used. In the first approach overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the entire M2 domains were annealed and elongated using Expand DNA polymerase. The elongation conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and ending with an incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. The synthetic M2 domains were digested with HindIII and Bsu36I and ligated with the cDNA of a GABAAR subunit. The oligonucleotides used were: α7 M2 s, 5′-CAGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAACAAGGACTCCGGCGAGAAGATCTCCCTGGGCATCACCGTGCTGCTGTCTC-3′; α7 M2 as, 5′-CAGTCCTTAGGCAGGCTCTCGGCCACCAGCAGCATGAACACGGTCAGAGACAGCAGCACGG-3′; α2-E s, 5′-AGTAAGCTTCTGGCTTAACAGAGAATCTGTGGAGCGTACGGTGTTTGGAGTCACCACTGTCCTGAC-3′; α2 DSG-EK s, 5′-AGTAAGCTTCTGGCTTAACAGAGACTCCGGCGAGAAGACTGTGTTTGGAGTCACCACTGTCCTGAC-3′; α2 M2 as, 5′-CCACCTTAGGGAGAGAATTCCGAGCACTGATGCTTAGAGTTGTCATTGTCAGGACAGTGGTG-3′; β3-E s, 5′-GGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAATTATGATGCATCTGAACGCGTTGCCCTCGGGATCACCACTGTCCTGAC-3′; β3 SG-EK s, 5′-GGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAATTATGACTCCGGCGAGAAGGTTGCCCTCGGGATCACCACTGTCCTGAC-3′; β3 M2 as, 5′-GGACCTTAGGCAAGGTCTCCCGAAGGTGGGTGTTGATGGTTGTCATTGTCAGGACAGTGGTG-3′; γ2-E s, 5′-GGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAATAAGGATGCTGTTGAGCGTACGTCTTTAGGTATCACCACTGTCCTGAC-3′; γ2 SG-EK s, 5′-GGTAAGCTTCTGGATCAATAAGGACTCCGGCGAGAAGACATCTTTAGGTATCACCACTGTCCTGAC-3′; γ2 M2 as, 5′-AGACCTTAGGGAGCGATTTCCGGGCAATGGTGC- TGAGGGTGGTCATTGTCAGGACAGTGGTG-3′. In the second approach mutants were created using site-directed mutagenesis as described above. The oligonucleotides used were: β3 SG-E s, 5′-GACTCGGGCGAGAGAGTTGCCCTCGGGATC-3′; β3 G-EK s, 5′-CTGGATCAATTATGACGCAGGCGAGAAGGTTGCC-3′; β3 G-E s, 5′-CTGGATCAATTATGACGCAGGCGAGAGAGTTGCCCTCGGGATC-3′. Introduction of the Bsu36I site in the hGABAAR β3 subunit led to the I25′V mutation, which turned out to affect receptor function. This was reversed using the oligonucleotide: β3 V25′I, 5′-GAGACCTTGCCTAAGATCCCCTATGTCAAAGCC-3′. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and by DNA sequencing All constructs were expressed in CHO-K1 cells (ATCC no. CCL61). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 mm HEPES and 2 mm Glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-proline (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air and passaged twice a week. CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with the plasmids described above and a plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein using the LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Binding experiments and electrophysiological measurements were performed 24–48 h after transfection. Membranes were prepared from CHO-K1 cells expressing recombinant GABAAR subunits. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), trypsinized, washed twice in Tris-citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.1), and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g. Membranes were resuspended in membrane wash buffer (20 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.025% (w/v), NaN3, and various protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 2 mmbenzamidine chloride, 0.1 mm benzethonium chloride, 50 units/ml bacitracin, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor)) and centrifuged for 30 min at 177,000 ×g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in binding assay buffer (20 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl) to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and homogenized just before use. Binding was performed with 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, or 300 nm of [3H]muscimol (20 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in triplicate in a final volume of 250 μl containing 200 μg of protein, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm GABA (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and labeled membranes were harvested on a Brandel cell harvester using GF/B filters (Whatman). The filters were washed with 3 × 4-ml binding assay buffer, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Membranes were resuspended in Tris-citrate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.1) and centrifuged for 10 min at 22,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Tris-citrate buffer to a protein concentration of 100–200 μg/ml. Binding was performed with 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 6 nm [3H]flumazenil (87 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in triplicate in a final volume of 550 μl containing 50–100 μg of protein, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm clonazepam (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 40 min, and labeled membranes were harvested using rapid filtration over GF/C filters (Whatman). The filters were washed with 2 × 5-ml Tris-citrate buffer, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Membranes were resuspended in Tris-citrate buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 22,000 ×g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm KCl to a protein concentration of 200–400 μg/ml. Binding was performed in triplicate with 5 nm [35S]TBPS (89 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.6 μm GABA in a final volume of 550 μl containing 100–200 μg of protein, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 200 μm picrotoxin (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 20–22 °C for 150 min, and labeled membranes were harvested using rapid filtration over GF/C filters. The filters were washed with 2 × 5-ml 20 mmKH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mm KCl, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. K d and B max values were calculated from a one-site binding equation using GraphPad Prism software. All experiments were performed under voltage clamp using conventional whole-cell patch clamp methods (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15140) Google Scholar) at 20–22 °C. The EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Electronics) was controlled by a Macintosh G3 computer via an ITC-16 interface. The experimental conditions were defined by the Pulse-software accompanying the amplifier, and data were sampled at 1 kHz and low pass-filtered at 333 Hz. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Modulohm) using a horizontal electrode puller (Zeitz Instrumente). The pipette was filled with an intracellular solution containing 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2. The pipette electrode was a chloridized silver wire, and the reference electrode was a silver chloride pellet electrode (In Vivo Metric) fixed to the experimental chamber. The electrodes were zeroed with the open pipette in the bath just prior to sealing, and the pipette resistances were 1.6–2.6 MΩ. Coverslips with cells were transferred to a 15-μl experimental chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus). Transfected cells were identified by the emission of green fluorescence when exposed to UV-light. After gigaseal formation, the whole-cell configuration was attained by suction. Cells were continuously superfused at a rate of 2.5 ml/min with an extracellular solution (Na-R) containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4. Chloride permeability was addressed using an extracellular solution (Gluconate-R) with a low chloride concentration containing 5 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 135 mm sodium gluconate, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4. When Gluconate-R was used, the electrodes were zeroed in this solution. Cation permeability was addressed using an extracellular solution (NMDG-R) with a low sodium concentration containing 14 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 126 mm NMDG, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. Liquid junction potentials were estimated using the Henderson liquid junction potential equation. The cells were voltage-clamped at −60 mV and the holding current was monitored for 30 s at the start of each experiment to ensure a stable baseline. The I-V experiments were performed by holding the cells at potentials of −60, −50, −40, −30, −20, −10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV and recording the currents activated by 3 or 30 μm GABA at each membrane potential. GABA-containing solutions were delivered to the chamber through a custom-made gravity-driven U-tube, the tip of which was placed ∼50 μm from the cell. In general, GABA was applied for 0.5–1 s every 30–40 s. Currents were measured at the peak of the response, and I-V plots were fitted to a polynomial function using GraphPad Prism software. Reversal potentials (V rev) were estimated from I-V plots covering two to three membrane potentials on each side of the reversal potentials for each cell. I-V curves and reversal potentials were corrected for the estimated liquid junction potentials. When evaluating the effect of modulators, cells were preincubated with the modulator for at least 10 s before GABA was applied. The effects of the modulators Zn2+ (ZnCl2, Sigma), bicuculline (Sigma), and diazepam (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were quantified against the GABA response evoked prior to addition of the modulator. Results are presented as mean ± S.E.M., and comparisons were made using a two-tailed t test. Wild type and mutated GABAARs were characterized with respect to ligand binding properties and by electrophysiological experiments. I-V curves were recorded in different extracellular solutions and the reversal potentials (V rev) were estimated from the curves. Anion permeability was assessed by measuring the change in reversal potential when switching from a high (Na-R) to a low (Gluconate-R) extracellular chloride concentration, and cation permeability was assessed by measuring the change in reversal potential when switching from a high (Na-R) to a low (NMDG-R) extracellular sodium concentration. Data from the electrophysiological measurements for the wild type (wt) GABAAR values α2β3γ2 and α2β3 are presented in TableI. As expected for chloride-selective channels, the reversal potentials were sensitive to changes in the concentration of extracellular anions. Replacement of 90% of the extracellular chloride ions by the less permeable gluconate ion resulted in a shift in reversal potentials in the range of 39–43 mV. The permeability of the gluconate ion has been shown to be ∼10% of the chloride permeability in GABAARs (4Fatima-Shad K. Barry P.H. Proc. R. Soc. London. 1993; 253: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); using this value, the expected shift in reversal potential is +43 mV according to the Nernst equation. Reduction of the extracellular sodium concentration by replacement of 90% of the extracellular sodium by the less permeable NMDG ion did not change the reversal potentials significantly, indicating that wt GABAARs are cation-impermeable.Table IElectrophysiological characterization of the wt GABAA receptors α2β3 and α2β3γ2α2 subunitβ3 subunitγ2subunitWhole-cell currents at −60 mV evoked by 30 μmGABAV revnNa-RGluconate-RNMDG-RpA/pFmVα2β3γ21200 ± 511−3.4 ± 0.739.7 ± 2.4−6.5 ± 2.04α2β3344 ± 113−1.6 ± 0.837.1 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.43The reversal potentials were estimated from I-V curves (3 μm GABA) recorded in Na-R, Gluconate-R, or NMDG-R.

Binding of the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol and of the GABAA pore blocker [35S]TBPS were observed for both receptors (Table II). Binding of the benzodiazepine binding site antagonist [3H]flumazenil was observed for the α2β3γ2receptor but not for the α2β3 receptor, which is consistent with the location of the benzodiazepine binding site at the interface between the α and γ subunits (25Günther U.

By aligning the M2 domains of several members of the LGIC family, we observed (Fig.1), that the GABAAR M2 domains are not identical for the subunits α2, β3, or γ2. To investigate whether a GABAAR consisting of subunits with identical M2 domains would be functional, a set of “internal” chimeric GABAAR subunits was designed. The chimeras were expressed in combination with either wt or chimeric GABAAR subunits. As shown in Table III, substituting the M2 domains of the α2 or γ2 subunits with that of either the α2, β3, or γ2 subunits did not affect the receptors with respect to GABA-evoked whole-cell currents and reversal potentials in either Na-R or Gluconate-R. In contrast, substituting the M2 domain of the β3 subunit with that of the α2 or γ2 subunits invariably led to non-functional receptors. Interestingly, when the M2 domains of both the α2 and γ2 subunits were substituted with that of the β3 subunit, a GABA-evoked current could be measured, but it was reduced by an order of magnitude with respect to amplitude. Interchanging the M2 domains did not affect binding affinity of the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]flumazenil for any of the chimeras (Table III). These data show that it is possible to make functional receptors with identical M2 domains.Table IIICharacterization of internal chimeras and chimeras with the M2 domain of nAChR α7α2 subunitβ3 subunitγ2subunitWhole-cell currents at −60 mV evoked by 30 μmGABAV revK dNa-RGluconate-Rn[3H]FlumazenilnpA/pFmVnmα2M2γ2β3γ2516 ± 433−0.1 ± 0.740.1 ± 0.0231.7 ± 0.73α2β3M2γ2γ2No current52.9 ± 0.43α2M2γ2β3M2γ2γ2No current54.9 ± 0.03α2M2β3β3γ2425 ± 264−2.9 ± 0.735.5 ± 0.234.4 ± 0.13α2β3γ2M2β3403 ± 91−1.6 ± 0.436.0 ± 0.132.0 ± 0.73α2M2β3β3γ2M2β345 ± 11−4.6 ± 0.0335.5 ± 0.633.1 ± 0.33α2β3M2α2γ2No current53.6 ± 0.63α2β3γ2M2α2304 ± 178−1.3 ± 0.136.3 ± 0.532.2 ± 0.63α2β3M2α2γ2M2α2No current51.7 ± 0.23α2M2α7β3γ2No current5NDaND, not determined.α2β3M2α7γ2No current5NDα2β3γ2M2α7613 ± 213−3.0 ± 2.641.7 ± 4.03NDα2M2α7β3M2α7γ2M2α7No current5NDThe reversal potentials were estimated from I-V curves (30 μm) recorded in Na-R and Gluconate-R to identify mutant receptors with changed chloride selectivity.

We show here that anti-mitogenic signaling of a GPCR, the bradykinin B2 receptor, involves a novel direct protein-protein interaction. The antiproliferative effect of bradykinin was accompanied by a transient increase in protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we observed that an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) located in the C-terminal part of the B2 receptor interacted specifically with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. The interaction was confirmed in primary culture renal mesangial cells by co-immunoprecipitation of a B2 receptor·SHP-2 complex. The extent of the interaction was transiently increased by stimulation with bradykinin, which was accompanied by an increase in specific SHP-2 phosphatase activity. Mutational analysis of the key ITIM residue confirmed that the B2 receptor ITIM sequence is required for interaction with SHP-2, SHP-2 activation, and the anti-mitogenic effect of bradykinin. Finally, in mesangial cells transfected with a dominant-negative form of SHP-2, bradykinin lost the ability to inhibit cell proliferation. These observations demonstrate that bradykinin inhibits cell proliferation by a novel mechanism involving a direct protein-protein interaction between a GPCR (the B2 receptor) and SHP-2.

Activation of these seven-transmembrane receptors is known to induce a large panel of biological reactions, among which the stimulation of cell proliferation has been extensively studied (1Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 259-270Google Scholar, 2van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Google Scholar, 3Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M.

Mitogenic GPCR signaling involves G protein-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), recruitment of arrestin in the activation Grb2/Sos, or tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) transactivation by a still largely unknown mechanism (5Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar). In contrast, only recently have anti-mitogenic effects of GPCRs been discovered (6Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Bland K.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 70-84Google Scholar, 7Lopez F. Ferjoux G. Cordelier P. Saint-Laurent N. Esteve J.-P. Vaysse N. Buscail L. Susini C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5692-5699Google Scholar). The bradykinin B2 receptor is a GPCR that is either mitogenic or anti-mitogenic, depending on the experimental conditions. Bradykinin induces proliferation of quiescent cells via B2 receptor activation (9Goldstein R.H. Wall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9263-9268Google Scholar, 10Owen N.E. Villereal M.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 979-985Google Scholar, 11Godin C. Smith A.D. Riley P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 117-122Google Scholar). In contrast, under proliferating conditions, bradykinin is antiproliferative in a variety of different cell types, including breast stromal cells, arterial smooth muscle cells, and mesangial cells (12Patel K.V. Schrey M.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 334-340Google Scholar, 13Dixon B.S. Dennis M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C7-C20Google Scholar, 14Alric C. Pecher C. Schanstra J.P. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 85-93Google Scholar). In renal mesangial cells, this antiproliferative effect of bradykinin is associated with both dephosphorylation of tyrosine residue-containing proteins (15Alric C. Pecher C. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 45: 57-62Google Scholar) and increased total tyrosine phosphatase activity (14Alric C. Pecher C. Schanstra J.P. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 85-93Google Scholar). Furthermore, in A431 cells, bradykinin increases tyrosine phosphatase activity, diminishes tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and reduces epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK activity (16Graness A. Hanke S. Boehmer F.D. Presek P. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 441-447Google Scholar). These effects strongly suggest activation of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in anti-mitogenic bradykinin signaling, but the way by which PTP activity is modulated is not known. We have identified a consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitor motif (ITIM) (17Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Google Scholar) in the B2 receptor (Fig.1), which suggests possible PTP activation via a direct protein-protein interaction between the B2 receptor and the PTP. Upon phosphorylation of the key tyrosine residue in the ITIM sequence, ITIM-bearing receptors (first characterized in hematopoietic receptors) (17Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Google Scholar) recruit the Src homology-2 (SH2) domains of phosphatases via a direct protein-protein interaction. This interaction activates the phosphatase, which consequently modifies phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades. The B2 receptor ITIM is located at the interface of the C-terminal part of the seventh transmembrane region and the C-terminal intracellular tail of the bradykinin B2 receptor and is 100% conserved in man, mouse, rabbit, rat, and pig (Fig. 1). The PTPs that potentially interact with the B2 receptor ITIM sequence and that modify the cellular tyrosine phosphorylation content are the cytoplasmic PTPs SHP-1 and SHP-2. These PTPs contain two N-terminal SH2 domains capable of interacting with an ITIM sequence and one C-terminal tyrosyl phosphatase domain (18Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Google Scholar). SHP-1 is expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells, whereas SHP-2 is ubiquitously expressed (19Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar). SHP-1 is described as a negative regulator of signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation (20Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9624-9629Google Scholar, 21Marrero M.B. Venema V.J., Ju, H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Google Scholar), whereas SHP-2 both negatively and positively regulates proliferation signaling pathways (21Marrero M.B. Venema V.J., Ju, H. Eaton D.C. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1216-C1223Google Scholar, 22Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Google Scholar). In this study, using BIAcore technology, mutational analysis, co-immunoprecipitation studies, and a dominant-negative SHP-2 mutant, we show the existence of a novel direct protein-protein interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM sequence of the B2 receptor and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. The presence of a functional B2 receptor ITIM sequence and catalytically active SHP-2 is necessary to mediate the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin. Primary culture mesangial cells were obtained and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (23Emond C. Bascands J.-L. Pecher C. Cabos-Boutot G. Pradelles P. Regoli D. Girolami J.-P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 190: 381-392Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, α-minimal essential medium, Ham's F-12 medium, streptomycin, penicillin, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Invitrogen. Bradykinin and chemical products were from Sigma. Anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), and anti-B2 receptor monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-total ERK1 polyclonal antibodies were from Promega and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. A 1782-bp fragment of mouse shp-2 cDNA (a gift from Dr. C. Nahmias, Institut Cochin, Paris, France) was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CAG GAATTC CAT GAC ATC CGC GGA AGA TGG TTT CAC CC-3′ (theEcoRI site is underlined) and 5′-GGC CGCTCGAGT TCA TCT GAA ACT TTT CGC TGT TGC ATC AGG CC-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined) and cloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) via EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites. The PCR-amplified sequence of this construction was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domains of SHP-2 was a gift from Dr. C. Nahmias. The constructs coding for different GST fusion proteins containing total SHP-1 or the SH2 domains of SHP-1 were constructed as previously described (24D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Google Scholar). The GST-phosphatase fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by induction with 0.25 nm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified as previously described (25Vely F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daeron M. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at −80 °C. Protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Surface plasmon resonance analysis of real-time PTP binding to B2 receptor ITIM peptides was performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB). Synthetic biotinylated peptides containing the bradykinin B2 receptor ITIM sequence (SCLNPLVYVIVGKRF, key ITIM residues are in boldface), tyrosyl-phosphorylated or non-tyrosyl-phosphorylated, were immobilized on separate channels of streptavidin-coated carboxymethylated dextran chips (BIAcore AB) at 60 resonance units. A control synthetic killer cell inhibitory receptor peptide was used (DEQDPQEVTYAQLNH, key ITIM residues are in boldface). Different concentrations (1–200 nm) of purified recombinant phosphatases were passed over the immobilized peptide surface at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 25 °C for 300 s in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% polysorbate. After each binding assay, sensor chips were regenerated by two pulses of 5 μl of 0.01% SDS. The level of phosphotyrosine residues in phosphorylated peptides was verified using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The association and dissociation curves (sensorgrams) corresponding to binding of phosphatases to the ITIM peptides were used to determine association, dissociation, and affinity constants with BIAevaluation Version 3.1 software (BIAcore AB). A 1.5-kb XbaI/XbaI cDNA fragment of the rat wild-type B2 receptor (a gift from Dr. J. B. Pesquero, Department of Biophysics, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-Escola Paulista Medicina, São Paulo, Brazil) was cloned into the bicistronic expression vector pRCEN1 (a gift from Dr. H. Prats, INSERM U397, Toulouse, France). A rat mutant B2 receptor (Y307F, mutation in the ITIM sequence) was constructed with oligonucleotides 5′-CCG CTG GTG TTC GTA ATT GTG GGC AAG CGC-3′ and 5′-GCG CTT GCC CAC AAT TAC GAA CAC CAG CGG-3′ (mutations are underlined) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). cDNA for the human wild-type B2 receptor cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was obtained as described (26Pizard A. Marchetti J. Allegrini J. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1309-1315Google Scholar). A human mutant B2 receptor (Y305A, mutation in the ITIM sequence) was constructed with oligonucleotide 5′-C CCA GTG GTG GCC GTG ATC GTG G-3′ (the Y305A mutation is underlined) using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (second version, Clontech). Mutations were verified by sequencing. For stable transfection, CHO-DG44 and CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the different constructs as described previously (27Pizard A. Blaukat A. Muller-Esterl W. Alhenc-Gelas F. Rajerison R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12738-12747Google Scholar), followed by selection with G418. Stable and functional B2 receptor expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and bradykinin-induced prostaglandin E2 release as described previously (28Bascands J.-L. Marin Castano M.E. Bompart G. Pecher C. Gaucher M. Girolami J.-P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 81-89Google Scholar) and bradykinin-induced MAPK activation by Western blotting. For reverse transcription-PCR analysis, mRNA was extracted from frozen cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and transcribed and amplified to cDNA as described (28Bascands J.-L. Marin Castano M.E. Bompart G. Pecher C. Gaucher M. Girolami J.-P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 81-89Google Scholar). No B2 receptors could be detected in mock-transfected CHO-DG44 cells in [3H]bradykinin binding studies. In three clonal cell lines stably transfected with the wild-type and Y307F mutant B2 receptors, receptor densities (B max) and affinity constants (K d) were 619 ± 17 and 608 ± 21 fmol/mg and 0.26 ± 0.10 and 0.58 ± 0.17 nm, respectively. Human wild-type SHP-2 and C459S mutant SHP-2 (30Rivard N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Google Scholar) cloned into pcDNA3 were gifts from Dr. C. Nahmias. G418 selection was used to obtain stably transfected mesangial cells. Two and three clonal cell lines were studied for wild-type SHP-2 and dominant-negative SHP-2, respectively. Semiconfluent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 100 nm bradykinin in medium or with medium only at 37 °C. Cells were collected and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.36 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.01% leupeptin, and 0.01% aprotinin). The mixture was gently agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by collection of the supernatant. 500 μg of soluble proteins were incubated with 1.5 μg of antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was incubated for 2 h with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads prewashed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The mixture was then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and resuspended in 32.5 μl of Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting or washed with 500 μl of PTP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and resuspended in 400 μl of PTP buffer containing genistein at 10 μm for PTP activity determination. Solubilized or immunoprecipitated proteins in Laemmli buffer (incubated for 6 min at 100 °C) were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane; and immunoblotted with anti-SHP-1 (1:500 dilution), anti-SHP-2 (1:2500), anti-B2 receptor (1:500), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:3000), or anti-total ERK1 (1:1500) antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL immunodetection (Amersham Bioscience) and quantified by densitometric analysis. The poly(Glu,Tyr) substrate (Sigma) was phosphorylated with [γ-33P]ATP as described (31Olcese L. Lang P. Vely F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Blery M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretta L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534Google Scholar). 2.5 μg of total lysate (in 60 μl of PTP buffer) or SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (200 μl of the 400 μl described above) were incubated with 30,000 cpm of 33P-labeled poly(Glu,Tyr) in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 volume of ice-cold 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, 1 volume of ammonium molybdate was added to 1 volume of supernatant, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Then, 2 volumes of isobutyl alcohol/toluene (50:50) were added, and the solution was thoroughly mixed. The amount of inorganic γ-33P extracted using this method was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Falcon) at 10,000 cells/well and cultivated for 48 h with different media containing 0, 10 or 15% of FCS as indicated in the various experiments. The cells were then stimulated with medium containing 100 nmbradykinin or with medium only. Cell growth was measured after 24 h by counting cells with a Coulter counter ZM (Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France). Depending on the culture conditions, activation of the bradykinin B2 receptor either stimulates (0.5% FCS, quiescent cells) or inhibits (15% FCS, proliferating cells) mesangial cell proliferation (15Alric C. Pecher C. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 45: 57-62Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of cell proliferation by bradykinin is accompanied by a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular protein (14Alric C. Pecher C. Schanstra J.P. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 85-93Google Scholar). To investigate whether PTP activity could be involved in the bradykinin-induced decrease in total tyrosine phosphorylation, we determined the time course of total PTP activity in bradykinin-stimulated quiescent and proliferating mesangial cells. In quiescent cells, bradykinin had no effect on total tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 2 A). However, under these conditions, bradykinin increased global tyrosine phosphoprotein levels (Fig. 2 B), whereas it induced cell proliferation by 27 ± 4% (Fig. 2 C). In comparison, addition of FCS for 24 h to quiescent mesangial cells increased cell proliferation by 90 ± 6% (data not shown). In contrast, in proliferating cells, bradykinin inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 2 F) and induced a rapid (0.5 min) 25 ± 7.5% increase in PTP activity, followed by a progressive decrease in PTP activity to the basal value at 5 min (Fig.2 D). This increase in PTP activity was accompanied by a decrease in total tyrosine phosphoprotein content (Fig. 2 E). These results suggest that the antiproliferative effects of bradykinin can be mediated by the modification of PTP activity. The B2 receptor possesses a highly conserved ITIM sequence (LVY307VIV) (Fig. 1) located on the cytoplasmic side of the seventh transmembrane domain region, which suggests a possible interaction with the SH2 domains of a PTP. Therefore, using surface plasmon resonance, we investigated whether recombinant SHP-1 or SHP-2 can interact with synthetic peptides containing the ITIM sequence of the B2 receptor. For this, we purified recombinant GST-PTP fusion proteins from E. coli. Protein purity as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining was ∼95% for the different preparations (data not shown). A clear interaction between the immobilized phosphorylated ITIM peptide and SHP-2 was observed, whereas no significant binding was found for SHP-1 (Fig. 3 A). The lack of binding of SHP-1 to the B2 receptor ITIM peptide was not caused by the quality of the SHP-1 preparation because SHP-1 bound to a tyrosine-phosphorylated killer cell inhibitory receptor ITIM peptide (Fig. 3 D) (31Olcese L. Lang P. Vely F. Cambiaggi A. Marguet D. Blery M. Hippen K.L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. Moretta L. Cambier J.C. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4531-4534Google Scholar). Neither SHP-2 nor SHP-1 bound to the non-tyrosine-phosphorylated B2 receptor ITIM peptide (Fig.3 B). SHP-2 lacking the phosphatase domain was still able to bind to the phosphorylated ITIM peptide (Fig. 3 A,SHP-2 ( SH2 )) with 10-fold lower affinity compared with the complete SHP-2 enzyme (Table I). Binding of recombinant SHP-2 was dose-dependent (1–200 nm) (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the PTP SHP-2 (but not SHP-1) is able to directly bind, via SH2 domains, to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM sequence of the bradykinin B2 receptor.Table IKinetic constants of SHP-2 and SHP-1 binding to the phosphotyrosyl B2 receptor ITIM peptide determined by surface plasmon resonanceK onK offK Dm−1s−1s−1nmSHP-2 (SH2)9.22 × 10458.2 × 10−363.1SHP-21.25 × 1046.9 × 10−35.51SHP-1 (SH2)NDNDNDSHP-1NDNDNDValues were calculated from 10 different association and dissociation curves using different tyrosine phosphatase concentrations (1–200 nm).

To determine whether the interaction between the B2 receptor ITIM sequence and SHP-2 also exists in a physiologically relevant cell context, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments on primary culture mesangial cell lysates prepared from proliferating cells, followed by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates. The B2 receptor is known to be present in rat mesangial cells (23Emond C. Bascands J.-L. Pecher C. Cabos-Boutot G. Pradelles P. Regoli D. Girolami J.-P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 190: 381-392Google Scholar), and we identified the presence of SHP-2 in this cell type by Western blot analysis (Fig.4 A). Immunoblotting with anti-B2 receptor antibodies of immunoprecipitates from cell lysates using anti-SHP-2 antibodies revealed co-immunoprecipitation of the B2 receptor and SHP-2 (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, immunoprecipitation with SHP-1, present in small amounts in mesangial cells compared with SHP-2 (Fig. 4 A), did not result in co-immunoprecipitation of the B2 receptor (Fig. 4 B). The interaction in mesangial cells between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-B2 receptor antibodies and immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitate with anti-SHP-2 antibodies (Fig. 4 B). The specificity of the antibodies was verified with nonimmune serum (data not shown). These experiments show that SHP-2 (and not SHP-1) is associated with the B2 receptor in non-bradykinin-stimulated proliferating mesangial cells. To determine whether the basal interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 could be modified by bradykinin treatment, proliferating mesangial cells were incubated for different periods with the B2 receptor agonist bradykinin. As shown in Fig. 5(A and C), bradykinin induced a rapid and significant increase in B2 receptor·SHP-2 complex formation 30 s after initiation of bradykinin treatment (240 ± 12% association compared with basal association), followed by dissociation of the complex at 2 min (59 ± 16% association). 10 min after stimulation with bradykinin, the association between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 returned to a value close to the basal B2 receptor/SHP-2 association (87 ± 14%). Stripping and reblotting of the membrane with anti-SHP-2 antibodies showed that the amount of immunoprecipitated SHP-2 was comparable between the samples. The interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 is thus dynamically modified by B2 receptor stimulation. The increased B2 receptor/SHP-2 binding observed 30 s after bradykinin treatment correlated with a rapid and transient increase in specific SHP-2 activity (Fig. 5 E). SHP-2 activity increased 30 s after bradykinin addition to 125 ± 1.5%, followed by a progressive decrease in SHP-2 activity, reaching 72 ± 14% of the basal value at 10 min. A basal interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 was also observed in quiescent mesangial cells, but was significantly less important than in proliferating cells (Fig. 5, B, lanes 1 and3; and D, bars 1 and 3). Moreover, in quiescent mesangial cells, bradykinin induced only a modest recruitment of SHP-2 to the B2 receptor, which was comparable to the level of the basal interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 in proliferating mesangial cells (Fig. 5, B, lanes 2and 3; and D, bars 2 and3). In contrast to proliferating mesangial cells, this reduced bradykinin-induced SHP-2 recruitment to the B2 receptor in quiescent mesangial cells did not result in specific SHP-2 activation (data not shown). Specific SHP-2 activity was inhibited (by 55 ± 8% at 10 min) by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (Fig. 5 F). Taken together, these results suggest that bradykinin-induced recruitment of SHP-2 by the B2 receptor activates SHP-2 phosphatase activity in proliferating mesangial cells. Mutational analysis was performed to confirm the existence of a direct interaction between the bradykinin B2 receptor and SHP-2. CHO-DG44 cells expressing no functional B2 receptors and transfected with different rat B2 receptor constructs (mock-transfected, wild-type, and ITIM-mutated (Y307F)) were used. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig.6 A) and bradykinin-induced prostaglandin E2 production (Fig. 6 B) and MAPK activation (Fig. 6 C) of the different clones showed that the Y307F mutation did not change the expression or the functionality of the mutant receptor. Moreover, bradykinin induced proliferation only in quiescent wild-type and Y307F cells (data not shown). Furthermore, these experiments confirmed the absence of the B2 receptor in mock-transfected CHO-DG44 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of the B2 receptor (data not shown). These different clones are thus suitable tools to study the role of the ITIM sequence in the interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2. Using immunoprecipitation, we observed that mutation of the key ITIM residue (Y307F) abolished the interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 (Fig. 7 A) and bradykinin-induced SHP-2 activation (Fig. 7 C). As observed in primary culture mesangial cells, a clear basal interaction between the wild-type B2 receptor and SHP-2 was detected in transfected CHO-DG44 cells, which was transiently increased by bradykinin treatment (Fig. 7 B), although this activation was slightly delayed compared with that in mesangial cells. This was accompanied by a transient increase in specific SHP-2 activity (Fig. 7 D). CHO-DG44 cells stably transfected with the B2 receptor were used to determine the contribution of the interaction between the bradykinin B2 receptor and SHP-2 to the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin. The three different clones were cultivated in the presence of FCS (10%) and treated with and without bradykinin (100 nm) for 24 h, followed by cell number determination. Bradykinin treatment inhibited cell proliferation by 33 ± 6% in wild-type cells, whereas it was without effect in mock-transfected and Y307F cells (Fig.7 E). Because the B2 receptor ITIM sequence is highly conserved among species, we investigated whether mutation of the ITIM sequence of the human B2 receptor results in the same phenotype. In a CHO-K1 cell line expressing the human wild-type B2 receptor, a 24 ± 4% inhibition of cell proliferation was observed after bradykinin treatment, whereas this effect was absent in cells expressing the human mutant B2 receptor (Fig. 7 F). Human B2 receptor expression as determined by [3H]bradykinin binding was comparable between the human wild-type and Y305A mutant clones and close to the values observed in primary culture mesangial cells (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate the critical role of the rat and human B2 receptor ITIM sequences in the interaction between the receptor and SHP-2, SHP-2 activation, and transduction of antiproliferative bradykinin signals. Finally, to confirm the importance of SHP-2 in the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin, we used mesangial cells (which express the B2 receptor and SHP-2) stably transfected with different SHP-2 constructs: mock-transfected, wild-type, and a dominant-negative mutant in which the active-site cysteine at position 459 was mutated to serine, resulting in a catalytically inactive PTP (C459S) (30Rivard N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Google Scholar). The three different clones were cultivated in the presence of FCS (10%) and treated with and without bradykinin (100 nm) for 24 h, followed by cell number determination. As previously described for untransfected mesangial cells (15Alric C. Pecher C. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 45: 57-62Google Scholar), bradykinin inhibited cell proliferation in mock-transfected mesangial cells by 36%. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of bradykinin was even larger (48%) in mesangial cells overexpressing wild-type SHP-2. In contrast, bradykinin was without effect on proliferation of mesangial cells transfected with the dominant-negative mutant form of SHP-2 (Fig.8 A). In these cells, bradykinin still increased the interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2, but the interaction was not transient as with wild-type SHP-2 and was sustained for at least 10 min (Fig. 8 B). As expected in these cells, bradykinin was without effect on specific SHP-2 activity (Fig. 8 C). These results confirm involvement of SHP-2 in the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin. Activation of the bradykinin B2 receptor, which belongs to the GPCR family, inhibits cell proliferation. This inhibitory effect is associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphatase activity and a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation (14Alric C. Pecher C. Schanstra J.P. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 85-93Google Scholar, 15Alric C. Pecher C. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 45: 57-62Google Scholar). In this study, we show for the first time a direct protein-protein interaction between a GPCR and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. This interaction is directly involved in the anti-mitogenic effects of bradykinin. A highly conserved ITIM sequence located at the interface of the C-terminal part of the seventh transmembrane region and the C-terminal intracellular tail of the B2 receptor was identified. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, this type of sequence potentially recruits SH2 domain-containing phosphatases. Using surface plasmon resonance, we found that a phosphorylated B2 receptor ITIM peptide bound with nanomolar affinity (comparable to the affinity of SHP-2 for the ITIM peptide of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) (32Hua C.T. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Jackson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28332-28340Google Scholar) to the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, but not to SHP-1. This interaction was confirmed in primary culture mesangial cells and in CHO cells by mutational analysis of the key ITIM residue Tyr307. This selective affinity for one of the two tyrosine phosphatases suggests that the amino acid sequence adjacent to the ITIM may be important for selective binding of SHP-2 SH2 domains. Selective tyrosine phosphatase binding (i.e. SHP-1 or SHP-2) was also observed for other ITIM-bearing receptors, including the mutant killer cell inhibitory receptor (33Bruhns P. Marchetti P. Fridman W.H. Vivier E. Daeron M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3168-3175Google Scholar) and Fcγ receptor IIB (34Famiglietti S.J. Nakamura K. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 35-40Google Scholar). The B2 receptor and SHP-2 were found to interact in unstimulated primary culture mesangial cells. This basal interaction suggests ITIM tyrosine phosphorylation of part of the B2 receptor population in the absence of B2 receptor agonist and might correspond to the low spontaneous receptor activity (measured by phosphoinositide hydrolysis) observed for the human B2 receptor in HEK293 cells (35Fathy D.B. Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29603-29606Google Scholar). This basal interaction between the B2 receptor and SHP-2 was transiently increased after stimulation with bradykinin and correlated with a rapid and transient increase in specific SHP-2 phosphatase activity. The kinetics and amplitude of total PTP activity and specific SHP-2 activity were very similar, suggesting that SHP-2 represents the unique PTP activated by bradykinin B2 receptor stimulation under proliferating conditions. The phosphatase activity of SHP-2 in the absence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated binding partner is inhibited by binding of its N-terminal SH2 domain to the phosphatase domain. It has been shown that, upon ITIM receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, the N-terminal SH2 domain changes partners and activates the SHP-2 activity of the enzyme (18Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Google Scholar, 36Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Google Scholar). The close correlation between SHP-2 binding and phosphatase activation suggests that binding of SHP-2 to the B2 receptor disrupts the intramolecular interaction and activates the enzyme. The current data are the first example of direct recruitment and subsequent activation of a tyrosine phosphatase by a GPCR. Such a direct protein-protein interaction of an intracellular protein (other than G proteins) with GPCRs has been observed for endothelial nitric-oxide synthase with the B2, AT1, and endothelin receptors (37Marrero M.B. Venema V.J., Ju, H., He, H. Liang H. Caldwell R.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 335-340Google Scholar); for neuronal nitric-oxide synthase with the B2 receptor (38Golser R. Gorren A.C. Leber A. Andrew P. Habisch H.J. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Venema R.C. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5291-5296Google Scholar); for c-Src with the β3-adrenergic receptor (39Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Google Scholar); and for phospholipase Cγ1 with the AT1 and B2 receptors (40Venema R.C., Ju, H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Google Scholar, 41Venema V.J., Ju, H. Sun J. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. Venema R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 70-75Google Scholar). Although a direct interaction between an intracellular protein and a GPCR was found in all of these studies, only two of them identified the actual sequence motif involved in this interaction: a YIPP motif in the C-terminal domain of the AT1 receptor for phospholipase Cγ1 (40Venema R.C., Ju, H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Google Scholar) and proline-rich motifs (PXXP) in the third intracellular loop and C terminus of the β3-adrenergic receptor for c-Src (39Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Google Scholar). We propose here the involvement of an ITIM sequence in the direct interaction between a GPCR and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Mutation of the key tyrosine residue of the B2 receptor ITIM sequence abolished the interaction between SHP-2 and the B2 receptor and the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin. How does B2 receptor-induced SHP-2 activation inhibits TKR-induced cell proliferation? SHP-2 has been shown to both negatively and positively modify TKR-activated signaling pathways. SHP-2 negatively regulates insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling by direct dephosphorylation of the activated insulin receptor in the presence of SHPS-1 (42Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Google Scholar) or dephosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (43Myers Jr., M.G. Mendez R. Shi P. Pierce J.H. Rhoads R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26908-26914Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that SHP-2 is involved in growth hormone receptor, JAK2, and STAT5B (signaltransducer and activator oftranscription) dephosphorylation and inhibition of JAK2 activation (44Stofega M.R. Herrington J. Billestrup N. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1338-1350Google Scholar). Therefore, SHP-2 seems to negatively regulate TKR signaling when bound to phosphorylated TKRs or phosphorylated associated proteins. In contrast to this negative SHP-2 signaling, the role of SHP-2 as a positive regulator of TKR cell proliferation has been described. It has been suggested that SHP-2 plays a role in insulin-like growth factor-1- and other growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation through MAPK activation, but SHP-2 substrates linking SHP-2 to MAPK activation have not been identified, although it is probably located upstream of Ras (22Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Google Scholar,45Shi Z.Q., Yu, D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell.

Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Google Scholar). In analogy with the above-described model of the negative role of SHP-2 in TKR signaling, we propose that the B2 receptor, a novel ITIM-bearing receptor, can activate SHP-2, which subsequently dephosphorylates serum-activated TKR and/or downstream effectors. The resulting effect is inhibition of TKR-induced cell proliferation. This hypothesis is supported by this study and by the observation that bradykinin induces epidermal growth factor receptor (16Graness A. Hanke S. Boehmer F.D. Presek P. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 441-447Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor 2C. Pecher and J.-P. Girolami, personal communication. dephosphorylation, which is accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphatase activity (14Alric C. Pecher C. Schanstra J.P. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 85-93Google Scholar, 16Graness A. Hanke S. Boehmer F.D. Presek P. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 441-447Google Scholar). We thus suggest the existence of negative cross-talk,i.e. transinactivation, between a GPCR and TKR signaling via activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation. This hypothesis is confirmed by the loss of the antiproliferative effect of bradykinin in cells expressing a dominant-negative form of SHP-2. This transinactivation is in sharp contrast with the well known mitogenic GPCR effects involving TKR transactivation (5Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Google Scholar). In conclusion, concerning the B2 receptor, bradykinin mitogenic effects are mediated by classical G protein-dependent pathways (15Alric C. Pecher C. Bascands J.-L. Girolami J.-P. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 45: 57-62Google Scholar), whereas the anti-mitogenic effect of bradykinin is mediated via a novel pathway involving a direct protein-protein interaction, as described in this study.

https://openalex.org/W2145094965,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates genes important for male development and reproductive function. The main determinants for the transactivation function lie within the structurally distinct amino-terminal domain. Previously we identified an interaction between the AR-transactivation domain (amino acids 142–485) and the general transcription factor TFIIF (McEwan, I. J., and Gustafsson, J.-Å. (1997) Proc. Natl.

Both the amino-terminal 136 amino acids and the carboxyl-terminal 155 amino acids of RAP74 interacted with the AR-transactivation domain and were able to rescue basal transcription after squelching by the AR polypeptide. Competition experiments demonstrated that the AR could interact with the holo-TFIIF protein and that the carboxyl terminus of RAP74 represented the principal receptor-binding site. Point mutations within AR-transactivation domain distinguished the binding sites for RAP74 and the p160 coactivator SRC-1a and identified a single copy of a six amino acid repeat motif as being important for RAP74 binding. These data indicate that the AR-transactivation domain can potentially make multiple protein-protein interactions with coactivators and components of the general transcriptional machinery in order to regulate target gene expression.

In the absence of hormone, the receptor is sequestered in the cytosol with molecular chaperone proteins, which dissociate upon hormone binding. The hormone-bound receptor translocates to the nucleus and is targeted to specific genes through the recognition and binding to the DNA response element, 5′-AGA/TACA/TnnnT/AGTTCT/C-3′, which in turn leads to activation of gene transcription (3Adler A.J.

In addition to the well characterized DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD), regions of the proteins important for transactivation have been mapped to the amino-terminal domain (NTD; 18–21). These studies have revealed a modular nature for the AR-transactivation domain, with the region between amino acids 142 and 485, containing the TAU-1/AF-1 and TAU-5/AF-5 determinants, being critical for receptor-dependent activation (20Jenster G. van der Korput H.A.

TFIIF recruits TFIIE and TFIIH to the preinitiation complex (PIC) and interacts directly with the RNA polymerase II enzyme and prevents pausing of the enzyme during subsequent transcription elongation (37Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8372-8382Google Scholar, 38Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J-M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol.

Previously, we have demonstrated that the isolated transactivation function of the human AR, amino acids 142 to 485, interacts with the large subunit of TFIIF, termed RAP74, and that this interaction was capable of reversing AR-dependent squelching of basal transcription under cell-free conditions (29McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that binding of RAP74 results in the AR-transactivation domain adopting a protease-resistant conformation (40Reid J. Kelly S.M. Watt K. Price N.C. McEwan I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20079-20086Google Scholar). In the present study we have extended these observations to map the region(s) of RAP74 involved in this interaction with the AR. Using a series of deletion constructs of RAP74 we show that sequences within both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of the protein are sufficient to bind the AR-transactivation function and to reverse receptor-dependent squelching of transcription. In the context of the holo-TFIIF, the carboxyl-terminal binding site may be the main binding site. Introduction of point mutations into the AR-transactivation domain revealed that sequences near the amino terminus are important for RAP74 binding. These mutations fail to disrupt the interaction of the AR with the p160 coactivator protein SRC-1a. Thus, TFIIF and SRC-1a interact with distinct regions of the AR-transactivation domain. The implications of these findings for AR-dependent gene regulation are discussed. Bacterial expression plasmids pET-AR4, encoding amino acids 142–485 of the human AR-NTD, and pET-AR4M5 have been described previously (29McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar, 40Reid J. Kelly S.M. Watt K. Price N.C. McEwan I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20079-20086Google Scholar). Bacterial expression plasmids for the AR4 mutant proteins M6 and M7 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides described in TableI and the QuikChangeTM(Stratagene) system. The yeast expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning PCR products of the full-length AR-NTD (termed AR1, amino acids 1 to 528), AR4, and AR4M5 into pRS315-LexA (see Ref. 41Almlölf T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Google Scholar; a gift from Prof. A. P. H. Wright, Södertörns Högskola University College) containing introducedHindIII and XhoI sites. Fragments of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1a, were amplified by PCR using the plasmid pCR-hSRC-1a (a gift from Prof. B. W. O'Malley, Baylor College of Medicine) and subcloned into a modified pET-19b plasmid. All plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme digests and DNA sequencing of the insert. Expression plasmids pET-23d/RAP74 1–517, 1–136, 1–296, 136–258, 258–356, and 363–517 encoding fragments of RAP74 (42Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. J. Biol.

RAP74 1–136 was purified from the insoluble fraction by dissolving the cell pellet material in 8 m urea and subsequent Ni2+-NTA-affinity chromatography. The purified AR proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm sodium acetate, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The RAP74 proteins, except RAP74 1–136, were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 250 mm sodium acetate, 5% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. RAP74 1–136 was dialyzed against 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 500 mm sodium acetate, 5% glycerol, and1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were estimated against BSA standards using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Untagged RAP30 was expressed in BL21 (pLys) cells and purified from the insoluble cell fraction by urea extraction. TFIIF was reconstituted by mixing RAP30 and RAP74 full length or RAP74ΔC in buffer containing 8 murea and then dialyzing successively against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, containing 4 or 0 m urea. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. TFIIF was then eluted with 200 mm imidazole and checked by SDS-PAGE analysis before dialysis against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 250 mm sodium acetate, 5% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. RAP74 and SRC-1a polypeptides were synthesized in vitro using a coupled-rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Note, the RAP74 polypeptides show anomalous mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This has been observed previously (42Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27035-27044Google Scholar) and most likely reflects the high percentage of charged amino acids present in RAP74. Purified recombinant AR4 and mutant proteins in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were allowed to adsorb to the surface of a ScintiStrip microtiter plate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a concentration of 200 nm per well. Control wells were incubated with 200 nm BSA in the same buffer. The solutions were subsequently removed, and the wells were blocked overnight with binding buffer + 5 mg/ml BSA before incubating with binding buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA and35S-radiolabelled RAP74 or SRC-1a polypeptides. After extensive washing with binding buffer + 1 mg/ml BSA, the bound radiolabelled proteins were counted directly using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences MicroBeta counter. For each labeled protein, binding to AR4 or receptor mutants was measured relative to the BSA only control. The relative binding was then plotted with BSA = 1. A cell-free transcription assay based on a yeast nuclear extract was used to analyze AR-mediated squelching of basal transcription and subsequent reversal of squelching by RAP74 polypeptides. The in vitrotranscription reactions were carried out as previously described (29McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar). The yeast strain W303–1A (MATα, ade2–1, can1–100,his3–11, 15, leu2–3, 112,trp1–1, ura3–1) was transformed with the reporter plasmid pLGZ-2LexA (see Refs. 41Almlölf T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Google Scholar and 43Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Google Scholar; a gift from Prof. A. P. H. Wright, Södertörns Högskola University College) and pRS315-LexA, pRS315-AR4-LexA, or pRS315-M5-LexA using the lithium acetate method (44Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic defined medium −leucine, −uracil agar plates. Colonies were then selected and inoculated into 10 ml of synthetic defined medium containing 2% galactose to induce expression of recombinant proteins and grown at 30 °C. After 24–48 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using glass beads and mechanical shaking in Z buffer (100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4·7 H20), supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The soluble protein fraction was then recovered by centrifugation and protein concentration determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the substrate o-nitrophenol β-d-galactopyranoside as previously described (41Almlölf T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Google Scholar, 43Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Google Scholar). A 405 was measured at 0, 10, and 20 min using microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California), and β-galactosidase activity was expressed as nmol ofo-nitrophenol β-d-galactopyranoside converted per minute per mg protein. Response was calculated as specific activity = (reaction volume (ml) × ΔA405) ÷ (0.0016 × extract volume (ml) time (min) × protein (mg/ml)). Work from a number of laboratories has highlighted the importance of the AR-NTD in gene activation (see Introduction). A region of the AR-NTD, amino acids 142–485 (termed AR4), retains at least 65% of the activity of the full length NTD when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain in a yeast reporter gene assay (Fig. 1). This activity can be abrogated by the introduction of two point mutations, I181N/L182N, originally described by Miesfeld and co-workers (21Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26772-26778Google Scholar) as impairing the activity of the full-length rat AR (Fig. 1 B). The reduction in activity of AR4M5 was not caused by reductions in the level of protein synthesized (data not shown). In a protein-protein proximity-based assay, significant binding was observed between the subunits of the basal transcription factor TFIIF and the AR4 polypeptide (29McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar). In an attempt to better understand the mechanism of gene activation by the AR we have mapped the regions of RAP74, the large subunit of TFIIF, involved in this interaction. The AR transactivation function (AR4, amino acids 142–485) was expressed in bacteria and purified too greater than 80% (Fig.2 A). Full length RAP74 or deletion fragments were synthesized in vitro and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine (Fig.2 B) and incubated with AR4 or BSA control, previously adsorbed to the surface of a scintillant-impregnated microtiter plate. After extensive washing, the bound radioactivity was measured directly and the relative binding calculated for each fragment. Fig.2 C shows, as expected, binding of the full length RAP74 (amino acids 1–517) to AR4. Significantly, equally strong binding was seen with the amino-terminal 136 amino acids (1–136) and the carboxyl-terminal 155 amino acids (363–517) of RAP74, whereas fragments corresponding to central portions of the protein, amino acids 136–258 and 258–356, showed reduced or no binding to AR4, respectively. Thus, the AR-transactivation function (AR4) is capable of interacting with multiple regions of RAP74.Figure 2The AR-TAD interacts with the N and C-terminal regions of RAP74. A, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrlamide gel of recombinant AR4 purified by nickel-NTA-affinity chromatography. B, the RAP74 polypeptide (amino acids 1–517) and deletion fragments transcribed and radiolabelled in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). C, binding of RAP74 polypeptides to immobilized AR4 is shown relative to BSA controls set at 1. The results are the means ± S.D. for at least four observations from two or more independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously we showed that the addition of the isolated receptor transactivation function to a cell-free transcription system results in a concentration-dependent squelching of basal transcription and that recombinant TFIIF (RAP30 + RAP74) could rescue transcriptional activity (29McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar). To test the functional significance of the interactions observed with the RAP74 fragments in the proximity assay, recombinant RAP74 and deletion fragments were expressed in bacteria and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (Fig.3 A). The ability of these proteins to reverse AR4-dependent squelching was then tested. Fig. 3 B shows that addition of 15 pmol of AR4 alone squelches basal transcription by up to 65%. In the presence of the full length RAP74 or the carboxyl-terminal fragment (amino acids 363–517) levels of basal transcription are restored to approximately control levels. The amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–136) has only a modest affect on the overall transcription level, whereas the central region of RAP74 (amino acids 258–356) has little or no effect on the level of transcription. As a control, the possible effects of recombinant RAP74 fragments on basal transcription were investigated. Fig. 3 C shows that all RAP74 polypeptides have an inhibitory (i.e. squelching) effect on basal transcription. Of particular note is the fact that the amino-terminal and to a lesser degree the carboxyl-terminal fragments have the severest effect. Therefore, the ability of recombinant RAP74 polypeptides to reverse squelching is more accurately reflected by the ratio of basal transcription in the presence and absence of AR4. Thus, both the carboxyl-terminal (ratio = 1.48) and amino-terminal (ratio = 1.06) regions of RAP74 are capable of reversing the inhibitory effects of AR4 (ratio = 0.34), whereas the central region (ratio = 0.36) is clearly not (Fig. 3 D). The above binding and functional analysis suggested a role for interactions between the AR and the large subunit of TFIIF. Native TFIIF is thought to be a tetramer of RAP30 and RAP74 subunits, which form a heterodimer. The interaction of RAP30 with RAP74 has been mapped to the amino-terminal domain of the large subunit and would overlap with one of the receptor binding sites (see Ref. 42Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27035-27044Google Scholar). To test whether the AR could interact with the holo-TFIIF, a competition binding assay was carried out using TFIIF reconstituted with full length RAP74 or a C-terminally deleted RAP74 polypeptide (Fig. 4 A). Fig.4 B shows that holo-TFIIF competed efficiently for AR binding to both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments of RAP74. TFIIF containing a C-terminally truncated RAP74 subunit (TFIIFΔC) failed to compete for binding of AR4 to the carboxyl-terminal RAP74 polypeptide but did compete for binding to the amino-terminal region of RAP74, albeit by a reduced amount. Taken together, the data from the competition studies suggest that AR4 binding with RAP74 is maintained in holo-TFIIF and that the carboxyl-terminal region of RAP74 is the major site of interaction. We (45Reid, J., Structural and Functional Analysis of the Amino-terminal Transactivation Domain of the Human Androgen ReceptorPh.D. Thesis, 2001, University of Aberdeen.Google Scholar) and others (31Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar, 32Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3440-3450Google Scholar) have shown that the AR-NTD interacts with members of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family. We have mapped the binding of the AR4 polypeptide to the CTD of SRC-1a (Fig.5, A and B). Modest, but reproducible binding of the full-length SRC-1a to AR4 was observed, whereas the carboxyl-terminal 465 amino acids showed a robust interaction (Fig. 5 C). The amino-terminal and central region of SRC-1a failed to show any significant binding with AR4 (Fig.5 C). These data are in good agreement with Bevan et al. (33Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Google Scholar) and Irvine et al. (46Irvine R.A., Ma, H., Yu, M.C. Ross R.K. Stallcup M.R. Coetzee G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 267-274Google Scholar) and emphasize that the interaction of SRC-1a with the AR-NTD is independent of the NR boxes (LXXLL motifs). In an attempt to identify the residues within the receptor transactivation function that are involved in the binding to RAP74 and SRC-1a, a series of point mutations was created within AR4 (Fig.6, A and B). M5 is equivalent to a double point mutation originally described by Chamberlain et al. (21Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26772-26778Google Scholar), which significantly disrupted the transactivation activity of the full length rat AR and the AR4 polypeptide (Fig. 1 B). Mutations M6 and M7 represent double serine mutations within a six-amino acid repeat motif, PSTLSL. Mutation of the serines in the amino-terminal repeat (Ser-159/Ser-162) significantly impaired the interaction with RAP74, reducing binding by 65% (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, mutation of the carboxyl-terminal repeat (Ser-340/Ser-343) or the hydrophobic residues isoleucine 181 and leucine 182 had only a modest (30% reduction) or no effect on RAP74 binding, respectively (Fig. 6 C). None of the mutations tested disrupted interactions of AR4 with the coactivator protein SRC-1a-CTD (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these data indicate that the amino-terminal region of AR4 is important for TFIIF (RAP74) binding and that a repeat motif, PSTLSL, plays a role in this interaction. Furthermore, TFIIF and SRC-1a interact with distinct regions of the AR-transactivation domain. Steroid receptors and related proteins have been shown to regulate transcription at multiple steps through a diverse range of protein-protein interactions. Thus, the DNA-bound receptor recruits complexes with enzymatic activity that result in alterations in chromatin structure through ATP hydrolysis or histone modifications (see Ref. 47McEwan I.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 369-373Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, these receptors have been shown to directly enhance preinitiation complex assembly through interactions with coactivators and/or basal transciption factors. In the present report we further characterize the interaction between the AR-NTD and the general transcription factor TFIIF. Mapping studies revealed that sequences in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of RAP74 are capable of interacting with the receptor transactivation function. Although both regions reversed AR-dependent squelching of transcription, the carboxyl-terminal fragment appeared more efficient. Because the amino-terminal of RAP74 is important for binding to the small subunit of TFIIF, RAP30, it is tempting to speculate that the carboxyl-terminal interacting site is the more relevant, and competition experiments with reconstituted TFIIF support this conclusion. Point mutations introduced into the AR4 polypeptide implicated an amino-terminal six-amino acid repeat sequence as being important for RAP74 binding. Interestingly, the wild-type motif is predicted to be β-sheet, wheras the mutated sequence is α-helical. 2J. Reid and I. McEwan, unpublished observations. In contrast, RAP74 binding was relatively refractory to mutations in a more carboxyl-terminal repeat of this motif, which is predicted to be helical in nature even for the wild-type sequence, suggesting that the conformation of this motif is a critical determinant in RAP74 binding. Recently, we have reported that the AR-transactivation domain folds into a more compact, protease-resistant conformation in the presence of structure-stabilizing solutes (40Reid J. Kelly S.M. Watt K. Price N.C. McEwan I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20079-20086Google Scholar). Significantly, a similar protease-resistant conformation is adopted upon binding RAP74, consistent with a protein-protein induced conformational change (40Reid J. Kelly S.M. Watt K. Price N.C. McEwan I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20079-20086Google Scholar). There is an increasing list of proteins that interact with the AR-NTD and that may play important roles in androgen-dependent gene regulation. These include the CREB-binding protein (35Aarnisalo P.

The principal sequences appear to map with the main transactivation function. However, Alen et al. (31Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar) found that mutating the isoleucine and leucine residues corresponding to M5 to alanine appeared to disrupt amino- and carboxyl-terminal interactions. It is worth noting that the alanine mutations will not alter structure whereas the asparagine double mutation, used in the present study, disrupts the helical structure in this regions (21Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26772-26778Google Scholar, 40Reid J. Kelly S.M. Watt K. Price N.C. McEwan I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20079-20086Google Scholar). This result may explain why the AR4M5 mutant polypeptide is compromised for receptor-dependent transactivation in the absence of the LBD (Fig. 1 B). The AR-transactivation domain can potentially make multiple protein-protein interactions with a number of the above target proteins, in addition to TFIIF (RAP74), including, p160 coactivators, the cell-cycle regulatory protein cyclin E1, the transcription factors SMAD3 and STAT3, the novel coactivator ART-27, and the corepressor SMRT. The binding site for p160 steroid receptor coactivators has been mapped to amino acids 360–494 (33Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Google Scholar, 46Irvine R.A., Ma, H., Yu, M.C. Ross R.K. Stallcup M.R. Coetzee G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 267-274Google Scholar), which includes the carboxyl-terminal region of AR4 and is consistent with the lack of effect of M5, M6, and M7 on SRC-1a binding. Sequences within the carboxyl terminus of AR4 are also likely to be important for SMAD3 (amino acids 333–563) and STAT3 (amino acids 234–538) binding (50Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118Google Scholar,58Ueda T. Bruchovsky N. Sadar M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7076-7085Google Scholar). ART-27 is a novel 157-amino acid protein identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen that was shown to interact with amino acids 153–366 in the AR-NTD (57Markus S.M. Taneja S.S. Logan S.K., Li, W., Ha, S. Hittelman A.B. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 670-682Google Scholar). The binding site for the corepressor SMRT has recently been mapped to the same region (amino acids 171–328), although more carboxyl-terminal sequences also play a role in binding (60Dotzlaw H. Moehren U. Mink S. Cato A.C.B. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Baniahmad A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 661-673Google Scholar). Thus, the binding sites for ART-27 and SMRT within the AR-transactivation domain potentially overlap with the binding site for TFIIF and it will be interesting to determine whether these proteins can affect the function of the AR through modulation of the AR-TFIIF interaction. TFIIF has been reported to be a target for a number of cellular and viral activators (61Joliot V. Demma M. Prywes R. Nature. 1995; 373: 632-635Google Scholar, 62Martin M.L. Lieberman P.M. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2110-2118Google Scholar, 63Lipinski K.S. Esche H. Brockmann D. Virus Res. 1998; 54: 99-106Google Scholar, 64Kim J.B. Tamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar) and is unique among the general transcription factors because it plays an active role during multiple steps of the eukaryotic transcription cycle, including initiation, promoter escape, and elongation. TFIIF stabilizes the binding of the RNA polymerase during PIC assembly and recruits the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIH (see 37 and references therein). In an elegant series of cross-linking studies, TFIIF was shown to mediate bending of the promoter DNA around the PIC, and this may be important for open complex formation by allowing access for TFIIH helicase activity (38Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J-M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed a role for TFIIF in cooperation with TFIIE and TFIIH to overcome stalling of the RNA polymerase after the formation of the initial phosphodiester linkage (39Yan Q. Moreland R.J. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35668-35675Google Scholar). Thus, by targeting RAP74, the AR can potentially regulate gene expression at multiple stages of transcription and may act to recruit TFIIF to PIC and/or early elongating complex (Fig. 7). Alternatively, because the AR-binding sites within RAP74 map to regions involved in protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions, it is tempting to speculate that the receptor may compete for TFIIF interactions with components of the PIC and/or DNA and thus lead to release of the RNA polymerase during initiation. Recently we have shown a role for the AR during the initiation and/or promoter escape steps and subsequently during transcription elongation. 3A. Ball and I. McEwan, manuscript in preparation. Interestingly, the interaction with TFIIF was found to be important for the early steps during the transcription cycle (initiation and/or promoter escape) but not for elongation per se.3 Ongoing experiments are addressing the functional consequences of the AR-TFIIF interaction during the early steps of the transcription. Recently, Brown and co-workers (65Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Google Scholar) using a ChiP assay demonstrated the agonist-dependent recruitment of the AR, p160 coactivator, CREB-binding protein, and RNA polymerase II to the promoter and enhancer of the PSA gene. In contrast, in the presence of the antagonist Bicalutamide, the AR, the corepressors SMRT and N-CoR, and HDAC2 are recruited to the promoter (65Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Google Scholar). In the present study, we have mapped the interactions of the AR-transactivation domain with both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of RAP74. Significantly, in a competition assay with holo-TFIIF the carboxyl-terminal fragment of RAP74 appeared to be the principal site of interaction. Mutational analysis of the AR-transactivation domain identified a six-amino acid repeat as playing a role in receptor binding. Taken together, the above studies reveal the potential for the AR-transactivation domain to form multi-protein complexes involving general transcription factors and coactivators, which may be disrupted by corepressor binding. The precise composition of a given activator complex may depend on the promoter and/or cell type, providing an opportunity for specificity and fine regulation of gene expression by androgens.

https://openalex.org/W2028980458,"Abacavir has been shown to select for multiple resistant mutations in the human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) pol gene. In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanism of resistance in response to abacavir, and nucleoside analogs in general, a set of reverse transcriptase mutants were studied to evaluate their kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and removal. It was found that, similar to the multidrug-resistant mutant reverse transcriptase (RT)Q151M, the mutations L74V, M184V, and a triple mutant containing L74V/Y115F/M184V all caused increased selectivity for dGTP over the active metabolite of abacavir (carbovir triphosphate). However, the magnitude of resistance observed in cell culture to abacavir in previous studies was less than that observed to other compounds. Our mechanistic studies suggest that this may be due to carbovir triphosphate decreasing the overall effect on its efficiency of incorporation by forming strong hydrophobic interactions in the RT active site. Unlike RTAZTR, no increase in the rate of ATP- or PPi-mediated chain terminator removal relative to RTWT could be detected for any of the mutants. However, marked decreases in the steady-state rate may serve as a mechanism for increased removal of a chain-terminating carbovir monophosphate by increasing the time spent at the primer terminus for some of the mutants studied. The triple mutant showed no advantage in selectivity over RTM184V and was severely impaired in its ability to remove a chain terminator, giving no kinetic basis for its increased resistance in a cellular system. Biochemical properties including percentage of active sites, fidelity, and processivity may suggest that the triple mutant's increased resistance to abacavir in cell culture is perhaps due to a fitness advantage, although further cellular studies are needed to verify this hypothesis. These data serve to further the understanding of how mutations in RT confer resistance to nucleoside analogs.

Although almost all aspects of the HIV-1 life cycle have been targeted (1De Clercq E. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 2491-2517Google Scholar, 2De Clercq E. Clin. Microbiol.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2369-2381Google Scholar), a majority of the drugs that have been effective in clinical trials are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, treatment with NRTIs is limited by their toxicity to the host (often through their interaction with mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (4Parker W.B. Cheng Y.-C. J.

Other factors that affect the ability of these inhibitors to reduce viral replication are uptake, transport, metabolism, and incorporation of the drug. All clinically used nucleoside analogs lack 3′-hydroxyl groups and are metabolically activated by host cellular kinases to their triphosphate forms. Compounds currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration are β-d-(+)-3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT or zidovudine), β-d-(+)-2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxythymidine (D4T or stavudine), β-l-(−)-2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC or lamivudine), β-d-(+)-2′,3′-dideoxycytidine, β-d-(+)-2′,3′-dideoxyinosine, (1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropyl-amino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol succinate (abacavir or ziagen), and (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy-propyl)adenine (PMPA). HIV-1's high rate of replication and the lack of proofreading by RT during viral replication leads to frequent mutations (9Preston B.D. Poiez B. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Google Scholar, 10Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Google Scholar, 11Ji J. Loeb L.A.

Venzon D.J. Mitsuya H. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1207-1213Google Scholar). The mutations that are responsible for conferring nucleoside drug resistance are primarily clustered in three regions of the protein as illustrated in Fig. 1. These include the dNTP binding site (region II), the site near the n + 1 templating base (region III), and the putative ATP binding site (region I). These mutations have been shown to cause resistance by two distinct mechanisms. The first mechanism of resistance appears to be related to a change in the incorporation of the activated drug into the replicating viral genome. These mutations are often found to be in direct contact with the incoming dNTP in the active site of RT and impede nucleotide analog incorporation and thereby show altered reaction kinetics (Fig. 1, region II) (20Feng J.Y.

This has been best illustrated by steric hindrance interfering with 3TCTP binding in the active site of HIV-1 RT containing a Met184 to Val mutation (20Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Google Scholar, 26Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Google Scholar, 27Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Google Scholar). Additionally, other mutations have also been noted that contact then + 1 templating base and appear to cause resistance at the level of incorporation by repositioning the active site in an unfavorable orientation for analog incorporation (Fig. 1, region III) (28Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D., Jr., Lu, X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13965-13974Google Scholar). The second mechanism of resistance appears to involve removal of the chain-terminator. RT does not contain 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity in the same sense as traditional polymerases, but the reverse of the forward reaction catalyzed by the polymerase active site can serve to remove a 3′ chain-terminating compound. The largest amount of work done to understand this mechanism of resistance is in the case of AZT resistance. AZT-resistant mutations occur in a pocket that is connected to the triphosphate binding region of the active site (Fig.1, region I) (33Huang H. Verdine G.L. Chopra R. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar, 34Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Google Scholar, 43Fitzgibbon J.E. Howell R.M. Haberzettl C.A. Sperber S.J. Gocke D.J. Dubin D.T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 153-157Google Scholar). Reports have shown that AZT-resistant mutations, in the absence of causing large changes in incorporation (25Vaccaro J.A. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14189-14194Google Scholar, 35Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14064-14070Google Scholar), may cause an increase in the rate of pyrophosphorolysis (36Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Google Scholar) and ATP-mediated removal (34Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Google Scholar, 37Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M., So, A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Google Scholar). There are some conflicting reports on whether the kinetic rate of pyrophosphorolysis is in fact increased by AZT-resistant mutations, and mounting evidence suggests that there is no increase in the rate of removal by PPi (34Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Google Scholar). It may be argued, however, that this does not mean that PPi does not play a role in AZT resistance. Studies have shown that there is a slower rate of primer-template release by the AZT-resistant mutant (38Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Google Scholar) and a tendency to form a stable complex, less sensitive to inhibition by the presence of the next correct nucleotide, at the incorporated AZTMP nucleotide (39Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F., So, A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Google Scholar). Accordingly, this may increase the overall amount of removal by prolonging the time RT spends at the 3′ terminus no matter what the removing agent (PPi or ATP) and in the absence of any marked change in the kinetic rate of removal. These results taken together suggest that both modes of removal may be active in vivo (40Lennerstrand J. Hertogs K. Stammers D.K. Larder B.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7202-7205Google Scholar), although further studies are needed to clarify inconsistencies in the literature. To better understand resistance to the Food and Drug Administration-approved compound abacavir and the mechanism of resistance to NRTIs in general, transient kinetic methodology was employed with abacavir's active metabolite (CBVTP, Fig. 2) (41Faletto M.B. Miller W.H. Garvey E.P., St. Clair M.H. Daluge S.M. Good S.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1099-1107Google Scholar) and a subset of mutants found in an in vitro drug selection study (17Tisdale M. Alnadaf T. Cousens D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1094-1098Google Scholar). Conclusions were further tested using a clinically relevant multidrug-resistant mutant (Q151M (16Shafer R.W. Kozal M.J. Winters M.A. Iversen A.K. Katzenstein D.A. Ragni M.V. Meyer III, W.A. Gupta P. Rasheed S. Coombs R. et al.J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 722-729Google Scholar)) and an AZT-resistant mutant (RTAZTR, D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q (14Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1158Google Scholar, 15Kellam P. Boucher C.A. Larder B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1934-1938Google Scholar)). Our study looked at both incorporation and removal (by PPi and ATP) along with other biochemical properties of these mutants. Results showed that the resistance of mutants seen in cell culture could not always be explained by incorporation alone. None of the abacavir-selected mutants showed increases in PPi- or ATP-mediated removal rates, but some had significantly slower primer-template release rates, which is discussed as a possible mode of facilitating nucleotide removal. Abacavir's resistance profile, in light of the large number of mutations coupled with the relatively small changes in biological and kinetic behavior, may best be described as “minimization of resistance rather than avoidance.” This, in part, may be the result of CBVTP's inability to effectively mimic dGTP and a dampening of the overall reaction kinetics by strong hydrophobic interactions in the RT active site. RTWT, RTY115F, RTAZTR, and RTM184V clones were generously provided by Stephen Hughes, Paul Boyer, and Andrea Ferris (NCI-Frederick). RTL74V and RTQ151Mclones were created from the Hughes clone and kindly provided by Phillip Furman, Joy Feng, and Jerry Jeffrey (Triangle Pharmaceuticals). The triple mutant L74V/Y115F/M184V (RTCBVR) was made by sequentially adding mutations to the Hughes RTM184V clone using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. All RT clones were sequenced to verify correct sequence. The N-terminal histidine-tagged heterodimeric p66/p51 enzymes were purified as previously described (47Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14056-14063Google Scholar, 48Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 55-63Google Scholar). dGTP was purchased from AmershamBiosciences. The (−)-CBVTP was generously provided by Dr. William B. Parker (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL). The compound was further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography utilizing a gradient from 20 to 60% 1 mEt3NH+(HCO3)− in water and an Amersham Biosciences ion exchange column (mono Q HR 5/5). Its identity was verified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The concentration of purified CBVTP was determined using the extinction coefficient ε253 = 13,260m−1 cm−1 (49White E.L. Parker W.B. Macy L.J. Shaddix S.C. McCaleb G. Secrist III, J.A. Vince R.

The 23-, 30-, and 31-mer DNAs and 45-mer RNA were 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) as previously described (50Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Biospin columns for the removal of excess [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Bio-Rad. Annealing of the DNA primers (D23, D30, D31, or D30-CBVMP) and 45-mer DNA and RNA templates were carried out by adding a 1:1.4 molar ratio of purified primer to 45-mer at 90 °C for 5 min, 50 °C for 10 min, and ice for 10 min. The annealed primer and template were then analyzed using 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to ensure complete annealing. Concentrations of the oligonucleotides were estimated by UV absorbance at 260 nm using calculated extinction coefficients. Rapid chemical quench experiments were performed as previously described with a KinTek Instruments model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (47Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14056-14063Google Scholar, 50Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Google Scholar). A pre-steady-state kinetic analysis was used to examine the incorporation and removal of dGMP or CBVMP into a DNA/DNA or DNA/RNA duplex. To analyze rates of incorporation of less than 2 s−1, single-turnover experiments were used. The reactions were carried out by rapid mixing of a solution containing the preincubated complex of 250 nm HIV-1 RT (active site concentration) and 50 nm 5′-labeled DNA/DNA duplex with a solution of 10 mm MgCl2 and varying concentrations of the next correct dNTP in the presence of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, at pH 7.8 and 37 °C (all concentrations represent the final concentration after mixing). Single-turnover experiments were also used to study removal, misincorporation, and processivity. Misincorporation was studied in the same manner, except the DNA 31-mer primer was used to allow for the observation of incorporation of dGMP opposite a templating dTMP. In processivity experiments, elongation of the 23-mer DNA with the 45-mer DNA or RNA template was followed in the presence of 125 μm (final) of all four dNTPs. Polymerization was quenched at various time points by the addition of 0.3 m (final) EDTA. Single-turnover conditions were also used to study the removal of chain-terminating nucleotides. Either 2 mm PPi(J.T. Baker catalogue no. 3850-1) or 3.2 mm ATP (Sigma catalogue no. A2383) were mixed with a solution containing 250 nm HIV-1 RT prebound to 50 nm 5′-labeled chain-terminated DNA/DNA duplex with 10 mmMgCl2 in the presence of 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, at pH 7.8 and 37 °C (all concentrations represent the final concentration after mixing). Removal studies using the original D45/D31 template-primer were unsuccessful in that no removal of a chain-terminating CBVMP and the D31-mer (containing dGMP at the 3′ terminus) was only extended under these conditions. The observed incorporation may have been due to ribonucleotide incorporation or a small amount of deoxynucleotide contamination. The inefficient nucleotide-dependent removal when the next correct incorporation is complementary to the removing nucleotide has been previously noted (51Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E., So, A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Google Scholar). In order to alleviate this problem, the templating base was changed from dTMP to dGMP in the D45-mer template for removal studies. To obtain observed rates of incorporation for faster reactions and to measure the steady-state rate of incorporation, pre-steady-state burst experiments were used. Pre-steady-state bursts were done under the same conditions as those described for a single-turnover experiment, except the amount of primer-template (300 nm final) was in 3-fold excess of enzyme (100 nm active sites final). Products were analyzed by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Bio-Rad GS525 molecular imager. Data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph version 3.09 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Results from pre-steady-state burst experiments were fit to a burst equation: [Product] = A(1 − exp(−k obsd t) +k ss t), where A represents the amplitude of the burst that correlates with the concentration of active enzyme, k obsd is the observed first-order rate constant for dNTP or analog incorporation, andk ss is the observed steady-state rate constant. Data from single-turnover incorporation experiments were fit to a single exponential equation: [Product] = A(1 − exp(−k obsd t)). L74V incorporation of CBVMP into a DNA/DNA primer-template showed two exponential phases of incorporation, and data were fit to a double exponential equation [Product] = A 1(1 − exp(−k obsd1 t)) +A 2(1 − exp(−k obsd2 t)). Although double exponential behavior under single-turnover conditions has been previously noted (22Ray A.S. Yang Z. Shi J. Hobbs A. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5150-5162Google Scholar), L74V incorporation of CBVMP was unique in that it could be observed under pre-steady-state burst conditions. Single-turnover removal experiments were fit to a single exponential decay: [Product] =A(exp(−k obsd t)). The dissociation constant (K d) of dNTP binding to the complex of RT and primer-template during dNMP incorporation was calculated by fitting the observed rate constants at different concentrations of dNTP to the following hyperbolic equation:k obsd = (k pol[dNTP])/(K d + [dNTP]), where k pol is the maximum first-order rate constant for dNMP incorporation and K d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of dNTP with theE·DNA complex. Errors reported represent the deviation of points from the curve fit generated by KaleidaGraph or were calculated by standard statistical analysis (52Skoog D.A. Leary J.J. Principles of Instrumental Analysis. 4th Ed. Saunders College Publishing, New York1992Google Scholar). In the current study, we compare the activities of RTWT and a number of drug-resistant mutants in terms of incorporation and removal of dGMP and CBVMP (CBVTP shown in Fig.2) into model oligonucleotide substrates (Table I). Experiments were also done to further characterize the effects of some of the mutations on biochemical properties such as misincorporation and processivity. A series of pre-steady-state bursts and single-turnover experiments were conducted in order to determine the kinetic parameters for correct and incorrect single nucleotide incorporation directed by a DNA or RNA template. Kinetic constants determined include the maximum rate of incorporation (k pol) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d). From these values, the incorporation efficiency was calculated (k pol/K d) and used as a means for comparing different substrates and enzymes. The observed rate of dNMP removal from the end of a terminated chain was also determined at a single concentration of PPi(k pyro) and ATP (k ATP). This information was used as a quantitative basis for understanding these RT mutants and how their presence may confer resistance to abacavir. When primer-template is in slight excess over RT, the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation during the first enzyme turnover as well as multiple turnovers can be examined. During the incorporation of all natural dNMPs by RT, this results in the observation of a burst of product formation, as prebound substrate is turned over, followed by a linear phase reflecting the overall rate-limiting step of product release (50Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Google Scholar). All of the RT mutants showed a burst of product formation during incorporation of dGMP (an example of a burst of CBVMP incorporation is shown in Fig.4 A). The amplitude of the fast phase of product formation can be directly correlated to the amount of active enzyme, and when compared with the total protein concentration (determined by absorbance at 280 nm), the percentage of active protein can be calculated. These analyses showed that none of the mutants had a significantly lower active site concentration than RTWT (25%) and that many had different activity depending on the primer-template (Fig.3). During DNA-directed polymerization, RTL74V and RTCBVR(L74V/Y115F/M184V) showed the highest percentage of active sites (around 40%). During RNA-directed polymerization, RTM184Vand RTCBVR showed the highest level of activity (around 50%). RTCBVR was the only protein with at least a 10% higher percentage of active sites during both DNA- and RNA-directed polymerization than RTWT.Figure 3Percentage of active sites for DNA- and RNA-directed DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT mutants. Values obtained by comparing the concentration of protein obtained by absorbance at 280 nm and the amplitude of pre-steady-state burst experiments looking at either DNA- or RNA-directed dGMP incorporation. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presence of a pre-steady-state burst during the incorporation of an analog suggests that it is being incorporated by a similar kinetic mechanism as natural nucleotides. A pre-steady-state burst of product formation was observed for the incorporation of CBVMP by RTWT and all mutants studied (CBVMP incorporation by RTCBVR shown in Fig.4 A). To better understand the effect of mutations at positions 74, 115, and 184 both alone and in combination and a multidrug-resistant mutation at position 151 (locations of mutations shown in Fig. 1), pre-steady-state incorporation studies were carried out. By fitting the observed rates of nucleotide incorporation (k obsd) for DNA- and RNA-directed polymerization at different concentrations of dGTP for each of the RT mutants to hyperbolic curves, the maximum rates of dGMP incorporation (k pol) and the binding constants for dGTP (K d) were obtained. Fig. 4 shows the typical kinetic data obtained and how it is quantitated during transient kinetic studies (in this case the DNA-directed incorporation of CBVMP by RTCBVR). First, a pre-steady-state burst is done to determine whether, like a natural nucleotide, the rate-limiting step follows chemistry (Fig. 4 A). A set of single-turnover experiments were then done at varying nucleotide concentrations to determine the observed rate (Fig. 4 B), and the observed rates were then plotted against nucleotide concentration and fit to a hyperbolic curve to determine the K d andk pol (Fig. 4 C). In general, thek pol values for different mutants were all equal to or faster than those obtained for RTWT incorporation of dGMP; however, th"

To explore the role of this domain in regulation of receptor activity, we subjected the juxtamembrane domain of the murine platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β receptor to alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The mutant receptors were expressed in Ba/F3 cells and tested for constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation, association with phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and their ability to induce cell survival and proliferation in the absence of interleukin-3. The mutant receptors accumulated to similar levels and appeared to undergo a normal PDGF-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Alanine substitutions at numerous positions located throughout the juxtamembrane domain caused constitutive receptor activation, as did an alanine insertion in the membrane-proximal segment of the juxtamembrane domain and a six-amino acid deletion in the center of the domain. It is possible to model the PDGF receptor juxtamembrane domain as a short α-helix followed by a three-stranded β-sheet very similar to the known structures of WW domains. Strikingly, the activating mutations clustered in the central portions of the first and second β strands and along one face of the β-sheet, whereas the loops connecting the strands were largely devoid of mutationally sensitive positions. These findings provide strong support for the model that the activating mutations in the juxtamembrane region stimulate receptor activity by disrupting an inhibitory WW-like domain.

Binding of a soluble ligand to the extracellular domain of these receptors typically induces receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic catalytic domain. This tyrosine phosphorylation stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and generates binding sites for signaling proteins containing SH2 domains. Although ligand-induced dimerization is an important trigger of receptor activation, receptor activity is also subject to additional levels of regulation. For example, the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is located between the transmembrane domain and the kinase domain, has been implicated in regulation of receptor enzymatic activity (e.g. see Ref. 1Baxter R.M.

The type III family of RTKs is defined by the presence of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic kinase domain that is interrupted by a kinase insert segment (see Fig. 1). The cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain is highly conserved between different members of this receptor family (Fig. 1), which include the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) α and β receptors, the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor, the stem cell factor receptor (c-kit), and FLT-3. Recently, a variety of tumors in humans and animals have been shown to harbor activating mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of c-kit and FLT-3. Various juxtamembrane c-kit mutations have been detected in sporadic and hereditary mast cell tumors, sinonasal lymphomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (7Hirota S. Isozaki K. Moriyama Y.

Most of these mutations are located in the membrane-proximal segment of the juxtamembrane domain, as is an activating mutation in a form of v-kit (14Herbst R. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 369-379PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT-3 are present in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (15Nakao M.

Naoe T. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane c-kit and FLT-3 mutations recovered from tumors often result in increased receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and the mutant receptors confer growth factor independence in various test cell systems. There has been little systematic mutational analysis of the juxtamembrane domain of the type III RTKs. We reported previously that mutation of a juxtamembrane valine to alanine at position 536 in the murine PDGF β receptor caused constitutive receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (3Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The biological activity of this mutant was tested in Ba/F3 cells, a murine hematopoietic cell line devoid of endogenous PDGF β receptor that normally requires interleukin-3 (IL-3) for survival and growth (17Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 18Drummond-Barbosa D.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutively active PDGF β receptor juxtamembrane mutant but not the wild-type PDGF β receptor allowed Ba/F3 cells to proliferate after IL-3 deprivation (3Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activation of the PDGF β receptor by this mutation did not depend on the ability of the receptor to bind PDGF and was associated with increased dimerization of the receptor and constitutive association with several SH2 domain-containing signal transduction proteins. Alanine substitutions at the homologous position also activated c-kit, the CSF-1 receptor, and the human PDGF α and β receptors. Maet al. (19Ma Y. Cunningham M.E. Wang X. Ghosh I. Regan L.

The molecular basis for receptor activation by the juxtamembrane mutations in type III RTKs is not known. The two tyrosines located in the center of the juxtamembrane domain are phosphorylated in response to treatment with ligand, thereby generating binding sites for SH2 domain signaling proteins (20Alonso G.

Although mutation of these tyrosines to phenylalanine severely impairs ligand-induced PDGF β receptor kinase activity in porcine aortic endothelial cells and human hepatoma cells (1Baxter R.M.

We noted previously that the sequence of the juxtamembrane domain of type III RTKs resembled the consensus sequence of a WW domain (3Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a modular protein-protein interaction domain present in many signaling proteins (23Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here we carried out a systematic alanine-scanning mutational analysis of the juxtamembrane domain of the murine PDGF β receptor and identified a number of positions that, when mutated, resulted in constitutive receptor activation. The results of this analysis, combined with molecular modeling, strongly suggest that the juxtamembrane sequence of the type III RTKs constitutes an inhibitory WW-like domain that can be disrupted by a large variety of mutations, resulting in receptor activation. pRV-mPR-V536A was described previously (3Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). pmPRRV-3, a pLXSN-based retroviral vector carrying the wild-type murine PDGF β receptor (24Petti L.M. Reddy V. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7318-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template in standard site-directed mutagenesis reactions (Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) to generate mutants PR-I532A, PR-R533A, PR-W561A, and PR-P564A. The other juxtamembrane mutations were subcloned as SacII fragments into the SacII site of pLXSN-mPR-ΔJM, a mutant in which DNA encoding the wild-type juxtamembrane domain from the proline at position 528 to the arginine at position 565 was deleted and replaced with a unique SacII site. These SacII fragments were generated either by polymerase chain reaction using a mutagenic primer or by annealing oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation. These procedures did not alter the protein sequence at the ends of the insertion. The DNA sequence of the entire juxtamembrane domain was determined for each mutant. Details of mutation construction are available from the authors on request. Retroviral vectors were packaged by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of BOSC or Phoenix-Amphos packaging cells (obtained from the ATCC) (24Petti L.M. Reddy V. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7318-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, virus-containing supernatants were harvested and used to infect Ba/F3 cells (obtained from Alan D'Andrea, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), which were maintained in RPMI/IL-3 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI conditioned medium to provide IL-3, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics). Cell lines expressing the various wild-type and mutant receptors were established as described before (18Drummond-Barbosa D.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼105 colony-forming units of retrovirus were incubated with 1 × 106 cells in 10 ml of RPMI/IL-3 containing 4 mg/ml of Polybrene for 2 days. 1 ml of the cells was then transferred into 10 ml of RPMI/IL-3 containing 1 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). After three-four passages into medium containing G418, mock-infected cells had died, and pooled stable drug-resistant cell lines were obtained from infected cells. IL-3 independence tests were performed as described previously (24Petti L.M. Reddy V. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7318-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Ba/F3 derivative cell lines were grown in RPMI/IL3 medium to density of ∼105cells/ml, harvested by low speed centrifugation, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were transferred to a T-25 flask containing 10 ml of RPMI/No IL-3 medium (RPMI 1640 formulated as above but without WEHI conditioned medium) at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/ml. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 to 7 days, and viable cells were counted by using a hemocytometer to assess cell proliferation. For each IL-3 test, cells expressing wild-type PDGF β receptor and PR-V536A were included as controls. The number of viable cells is expressed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 as the percentage of cells arising in cultures expressing PR-V536A. The results determined for multiple cell lines of each genotype were averaged, and the standard deviation is shown.Figure 6IL-3-independent proliferation of additional juxtamembrane mutants. IL-3 independent proliferation was determined as in Fig. 3. WT, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells grown in medium containing IL-3 were harvested by low speed centrifugation and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Protein extracts were obtained by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation assay-MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin. Saturating amounts of PDGF receptor antiserum were added to ∼500 or 1000 μg of extracted protein, respectively, for detection with anti-PDGF receptor or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. For immunoprecipitation, antibodies were incubated with extracts at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) (50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 165 mm NaCl, 10% bovine serum albumin) and incubation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed five times with NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and electrophoresed on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (18Drummond-Barbosa D.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfer to nitrocellulose, total PDGF β receptor was visualized by probing with rabbit anti-PDGF receptor antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase protein A, and tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF β receptor was visualized with PY100 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase. Following detection by ECL+ (AmershamBiosciences), bands were visualized, and fluorescent intensity was measured on a Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, actively growing cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended, and incubated in RPMI/IL-3 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay-MOPS buffer. 50 μg of extracted protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF receptor antiserum, electrophoresed, and transferred to filters as described above. To detect phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase associated with the PDGF β receptor, Western blotting was performed as described previously using anti-rat phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase rabbit polyclonal serum (catalog number 06-195; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1:1000 dilution (18Drummond-Barbosa D.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of PDGF to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF β receptor, 4 × 107 cells were serum-starved and harvested as described above. Recombinant human PDGF-BB (catalog number 13244-033; Invitrogen) was added at 50 ng/ml for 15 min at room temperature and then protein extracts were obtained. PDGF β receptor immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting were performed as above. The homology model of the WW domain was made using the program Modeler (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The juxtamembrane domain sequence was aligned manually against the sequence of the designed WW domain whose structure has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (28Macias M.J. Gervais V. Civera C. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The program derives spatial restraints from the reference structure. The modeled structure is optimized using conjugate gradient energy minimization followed by restrained simulated annealing molecular dynamics. The figures were generated with the program InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The secondary structure was defined by the Kabsch-Sander algorithm, which is based on hydrogen bonding patterns. To analyze the role of the juxtamembrane domain in regulation of PDGF β receptor activity, we performed an alanine-scanning mutational analysis of this region. We generated and analyzed a panel of mutants carrying single alanine substitutions at residues Arg-529 through Trp-561, a sequence that comprises almost the entire juxtamembrane domain of the murine PDGF β receptor. Tyr-547 and Tyr-549, which when phosphorylated are recognized by SH2 domain proteins such as src family kinases (21Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), were both changed to alanines in the mutant PR-Y547A/Y549A to eliminate any contribution of the binding of SH2 proteins to the juxtamembrane domain (Fig. 1). We did not mutate Ser-541 or Ser-542, because these residues appear to be inserted relative to c-kit and the CSF-1 receptor, even though the juxtamembrane sequences of these receptors are otherwise quite homologous to the PDGF β receptor (Fig. 1). Each of the mutants was cloned into a retrovirus vector containing a G418 resistance gene and introduced into Ba/F3 cells. Stable cell lines expressing the various receptors were generated by infection followed by selection for G418. The wild-type PDGF β receptor and PR-V536A, the original activated mutant, were used as controls. The expression and phosphotyrosine content of the mutant receptors were analyzed by immunoblotting. Detergent extracts of cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF β receptor antibody and blotted with either the same antibody (to assess PDGF β receptor levels) or an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (to assess the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors). The mature and the more rapidly migrating precursor forms of the exogenous PDGF β receptor were expressed at similar levels in all the cell lines (representative examples are shown in the top panel of Fig.2). Thus, none of the mutations had a significant effect on receptor stability or processing. To determine whether the mutations induced constitutive activation of the PDGF β receptor, we examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptors in the absence of ligand stimulation (Fig. 2). The wild-type PDGF β receptor and many of the mutant receptors did not display significant tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, the previously identified activated mutant PR-V536A contained high levels of phosphotyrosine, as did PR-Y530A, PR-W534A, PR-I537A, PR-L555A, PR-Y557A, and the double mutant PR-Y547A/Y549A. PR-E531A and PR-D551A displayed a modest increase in tyrosine phosphorylation compared with the wild-type receptor. Similar results were obtained when independent cell lines established with the same mutant were tested or when a single cell line was tested in multiple independent blots (data not shown). The results shown in Fig. 2 were quantitated and are summarized in Fig. 3. For this analysis, tyrosine phosphorylation of PR-V536A was measured simultaneously with each group of mutants and was arbitrarily set at 100%. As another measure of receptor activation, we used co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether the tyrosine-phosphorylated alanine substitution mutants formed stable complexes with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, which associates via its SH2 domain with specific phosphotyrosines in the kinase insert region (25Heldin C.-H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF receptor antiserum and then subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with anti-p85 antiserum. As shown in Fig.4, the wild-type PDGF β receptor did not associate with significant amounts of p85 unless the cells were treated with PDGF prior to extraction. Similarly, representative inactive mutants PR-K535A and PR-I548A did not constitutively associate with p85. In contrast, all of the activated mutants constitutively associated with p85. As a biological measure of constitutive receptor activation, we assessed the ability of the PDGF β receptor mutants to allow IL-3-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. As expected, cells expressing wild-type PDGF β receptor did not proliferate following IL-3 removal, whereas cells expressing PR-V536A survived and proliferated to high density. The extent of IL-3-independent proliferation of cells expressing each mutant receptor was compared with the proliferation of PR-V536A cells tested in the same experiment. The averaged results obtained with multiple, independently derived cell lines for each mutant are shown in Fig. 3. The original activated mutant, PR-V536A, and several additional mutants, namely PR-Y530A, PR-W534A, PR-I537A, PR-L555A, and the double mutant PR-Y547A/Y549A, conferred IL-3 independence. Cells expressing PR-Y557A displayed a more variable IL-3-independent phenotype but in general grew to a lower saturation density or with a longer lag period than did cells expressing PR-V536A. The other mutants failed to confer significant IL-3 independence. There was an excellent correlation between the level of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the various mutant receptors and their ability to confer IL-3 independence (Fig. 3). In particular, PR-Y530A, PR-W534A, PR-V536A, PR-I537A, PR-L555A, PR-Y557A, and PR-Y547A/Y549A displayed substantially elevated phosphotyrosine and conferred IL-3 independence. Two mutants, PR-E531A and PR-D551A, which induced slightly elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, failed to allow significant IL-3-independent growth. No mutants induced IL-3 independence in the absence of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, substitution of alanine at ∼25% of the positions in the juxtamembrane region conferred IL-3 independence and increased receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and constitutive complex formation with phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. Furthermore, these activating positions were scattered throughout the juxtamembrane region. To explore the requirements for receptor activation in more detail, we tested the effects of several other mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of the PDGF β receptor. Mutations near Val-536 activated the receptor, but an alanine substitution at the adjacent lysine 535 did not activate (Fig. 3). To test whether the receptor was activated by mutations that reversed the charge of this lysine or reduced rotational freedom at this position, lysine 535 was replaced with aspartic acid and proline to generate PR-K535D and PR-K535P, respectively, and the mutant receptors were tested as described above. Even though the alanine substitution at position 535 did not activate the receptor, proline and aspartic acid at this position did activate, as assessed by induction of IL-3 independence and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (see Fig.5 and Fig.6). Because insertion of a single amino acid alters the relative orientation of the α-helical segments upstream and downstream of the site of insertion, we tested whether the insertion of an additional alanine residue in the juxtamembrane domain resulted in receptor activation. An alanine residue was inserted between positions 532 and 533 and between 544 and 545 to generate mutants PR-I532-A-R533 and PR-G544-A-H545, respectively (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 6, cells expressing PR-G544-A-H545 did not proliferate after IL-3 removal, but cells expressing PR-I532-A-R533 proliferated well in the absence of IL-3. Similarly, PR-G544-A-H545 did not contain significant levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas PR-I532-A-R533 displayed high tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Thus, the PDGF β receptor was activated by an alanine insertion in the membrane-proximal segment of the juxtamembrane region but not by an insertion near the middle of the region. Finally, we constructed and tested a mutant receptor, PR-ΔB2, containing a six-amino acid deletion (residues 546 to 551) that removed the central tyrosines and flanking amino acids (Fig. 1). This mutant receptor was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and induced IL-3 independence, indicating that deletion of the central portion of the juxtamembrane domain caused receptor activation (see Fig. 5 and Fig.6). The exogenous PDGF β receptor was expressed at similar levels in cells expressing each of the mutants described in this section (data not shown). The analysis described above identified several mutant receptors that did not confer IL-3 independence or display increased tyrosine phosphorylation. To establish that the juxtamembrane mutations did not merely inactivate the tyrosine kinase activity of these mutants or prevent their proper localization, we tested the ability of PDGF to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild-type receptor and the mutant PDGF β receptors that harbored non-activating mutations. Cells expressing these receptors were deprived of serum for 24 h and then treated with PDGF-BB or left untreated. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF receptor antiserum and immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. The mature, cell-surface form of the non-act"

To ascertain the elements that determine 2-thiolation in tRNA, systematic site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the tRNAAspgene.

The roles of modified nucleosides in tRNA function are important and wide-ranging. They are known to include codon recognition, reading-frame maintenance, stabilization of the tertiary structure, and serving as identity determinants for amino acid specificity (1Curran J.F. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 493-516Google Scholar). The melting temperatures of tRNAs from the extreme thermophileThermus thermophilus sp. are 3–10 °C higher than those of corresponding tRNA species from the mesophilic bacteriumEscherichia coli, a feature that cannot be explained solely by the higher G-C pair content in Thermus tRNAs (2Watanabe K. Oshima T. Iijima K. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analyses of modified nucleosides in tRNAs from T. thermophilus revealed a thermophile-specific sulfur-containing modified nucleoside that was identified as 2-thioribothymidine (s2T)1 (2Watanabe K. Oshima T. Iijima K. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Watanabe K. Oshima T. Saneyoshi M. Nishimura S. FEBS Lett. 1974; 43: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a 2-thiolated derivative of 5-methyluridine (ribothymidine (T)) located at position 54 in the T loop of almost all tRNAs (4Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Because s2T54 is also present in tRNA from hyperthermophilic Archaea such as Pyrococcus furiosus, which contains about 0.77 mol % of s2T when cultured at 100 °C (5Kowalak J.A. Dalluge J.J. McCloskey J.A. Stetter K.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7869-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), 2-thiolation of T54 is postulated to be a common modification responsible for the thermostabilization mechanism of tRNA in both thermophilic eubacteria and Archaea. The 2-thiolation of T54 increases along with elevation of the cultivation temperature without any changes in other modifications such as 1-methyladenosine at position 58 (m1A58) or 2′-O-methylguanosine at position 18 (Gm18) (6Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); more than half of the tRNAs in T. thermophilusHB8 cells grown at more than 80 °C were found to contain s2T54 instead of T54, whereas at 50 °C only a small proportion had s2T. In addition, the tRNA melting temperature increased concomitantly with increases in the s2T content (6Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that 2-thiolation of T54 is responsible for the thermostability of T. thermophilus tRNA under diverse cultivation temperatures, thereby ensuring the thermal adaptation of protein synthesis. The temperatures of the inflection point in the specific CD signal (7Watanabe K. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 1703-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and in the characteristic chemical shift in the NMR spectra of s2T in T. thermophilus tRNA (8Davanloo P. Sprinzl M. Watanabe K. Albani M. Kersten H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1571-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) show a good match with the melting temperature monitored by UV absorbance, suggesting a close correlation between the local conformation of s2T54 and the structural stability of tRNA. The mechanism of tRNA structure stabilization conferred by s2T has been elucidated by proton NMR analysis (9Watanabe K. Yokoyama S. Hansske F. Kasai H. Miyazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); the ribose puckering of s2T preferentially takes the C3′-endo-gg-anti conformation as do all residues in A-form RNA because of the steric effect of the bulky 2-thiocarbonyl group toward the 2′-hydroxyl group. This inherent rigidity of s2T54 gives stability to the elbow region formed by D loop-T loop interaction, resulting in the thermostability of the overall tRNA tertiary structure (10Yokoyama S. Watanabe K. Miyazawa T. Adv. Biophys. 1987; 23: 115-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although s2T54 is clearly a key modification for tRNA stability and function at elevated temperatures, information on its biosynthesis is very limited. Features that remain to be elucidated include the sulfur donor, modification enzymes or related genes, and the tRNA structural elements necessary for 2-thiolation. A genetic approach is, thus, indispensable for the characterization of this modification. Using the leuB gene as a selective marker, some of the present authors recently developed a host-vector system forT. thermophilus (11Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that facilitates studies on the thermostability of proteins or RNAs from the bacterium. Here, we describe the detection of 2-thiolation activity in vivo in a reporter tRNA expressed using this T. thermophilushost-vector system. A systematic mutation analysis enabled us to characterize 2-thiolation in the maturation process of the tRNA and to identify the structural requirements for 2-thiolation at position 54. T. thermophilus TTY1 (a ΔleuBΔpyrE strain derived from T. thermophilus HB27) (11Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host strain throughout.E. coli JM109, DH5α, and MC1061 were used as hosts for the genetic manipulation of plasmids. Rich and minimal media for T. thermophilus were used according to the literature (12Takada T. Akanuma S. Kotsuka T. Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2737-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uracil (20 μg/ml) was supplied to the minimal medium. T. thermophilus was cultured at 70 °C in all the experiments. A T. thermophilus HB8 tRNAAsp gene with an altered sequence (tRNAAsp*) was designed so that tRNAAsp* could be discriminated from the intrinsic tRNAAsp and other tRNAs in the cells by Northern hybridization (Fig. 1). The putative promoter/terminator sequences from the T. thermophilus HB8 tRNASer gene (GenBankTM accession number:X07394) were attached to the designed tRNAAsp* so it would be expressed in T. thermophilus cells. A synthetic DNA fragment comprising the tRNAAsp* operon (about 300 bp; Fig.1 A) was constructed from 6 DNA fragments in the following manner. The 5′-half of the operon was synthesized by the Klenow reaction with the primer set 5I-F and 5I-R, each of which has an overlapping 16-bp complementary sequence at its 3′ terminus. The 3′-half was synthesized in the same way with the primers 3I-F and 3I-R. These two half-fragments were ligated using the primers 5F and 3R, respectively corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-termini of the operon. The ligated DNA fragment was then introduced into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). To confirm the correctness of the construction, the tRNA operon in the resultant plasmid (pCR-XL-tRNAAsp*) was sequenced by an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A tRNA expression plasmid for T. thermophilus (pEx-Asp*) was constructed by excising the tRNAAsp* gene from pCR-XL-tRNAAsp* by double digestion with EcoRI and EcoRV and introducing it into the same sites of theE. coli-T. thermophilus shuttle vector pT8leuB(11Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T. thermophilus TTY1 (11Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed by the tRNA expression vectors as described in the literature (13Koyama Y. Hoshino T. Tomizuka N. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 338-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on minimal medium plus uracil plates at 70 °C.

Plasmids harboring 24 tRNA variants were prepared using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Target mutations were introduced into the plasmids using 30-mer forward primers and the complementary reverse primers, both of which possessed the target mutation in the middle section. pCR-XL-tRNAAsp* and pCR-XL-tRNAAsp*(U8A) were exploited as template plasmids for mutagenesis. After the sequences of these tRNA variants were confirmed by a DNA sequencer (as above), the tRNA operons were inserted into pT8leuBto construct the respective tRNA expression vectors. Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method as described in the literature (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoretic analysis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea. The RNA bands separated in the gel were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). Northern blotting was performed using the following 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for tRNAAsp* and its precursors: AS-1 (34-mer), 5′-CGCGGTGTAC CCGACTCGAA CGGGCGATCT CGGT-3′; AS-2 (17-mer), 5′-CGCGGTGTAC CCGACTC-3′; AS-5′ (15-mer), 5′-TACACCGCAA GTGCC-3′; AS-3′ (25-mer), 5′-TCGCCGGGGC CTTTTGGCGC GGTGT-3′. The positions of AS-1, AS-5′, and AS-3′ are shown in Fig. 1 B. Membranes on which 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes hybridized with the corresponding tRNAs and their precursors were exposed to an imaging plate followed by analysis using a BAS1000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Systems). About 1000 A 260 units of total RNA were obtained by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) from a 3L late log-phase culture of the TTY1 transformant expressing tRNAAsp*. Total RNA was fractionated on a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (1 × 40 cm) with a linear gradient of NaCl and MgCl2 consisting of 500 ml of elution buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2) and elution buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 450 mm NaCl, and 16 mm MgCl2) with gravitational flow. Fractions containing tRNAAsp* were determined by dot-hybridization using the DNA probe AS-1, combined, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in a binding buffer (1.2 m NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 15 mm EDTA). To procure tRNAAsp* on its own, the solid-phase DNA probe method (15Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was employed using a 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotide with a sequence identical to that of the DNA probe AS-1. The tRNAAsp* obtained was further purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified tRNAAsp* was sequenced by the method of Donis-Keller (16Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Partial enzymatic digestion was carried out with the following base-specific RNases: RNase T1 (Amersham Biosciences), RNase U2 (Seikagaku Kogyo), RNase PhyM (Amersham Biosciences), and RNase CL3(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Digested fragments were electrophoresed separately in lanes on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel along with the undigested control and alkaline-hydrolyzed tRNAs. Modified nucleotides were identified by the post-labeling method (17Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with an electrospray ionization source and a MAGIC 2002 liquid chromatography system (Michrom BioResources) was used to analyze RNA fragments digested with RNase T1. Purified tRNAAsp* (0.4 μg) was digested with RNase T1 (2.5 units) in 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.3) at 37 °C for 1 h, and the digest was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Oligonucleotides produced by RNase T1 digestion were detected by LC/MS in the negative ion mode as described by Qiu and McCloskey (18Qiu F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: e20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following slight modifications. An ODS reversed-phase column (Inertsil ODS3, 1.0 × 200 mm; GL Sciences) was used. The solvent system, consisting of 0.4 m 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (pH 7.0, adjusted with triethylamine) in H2O (A) and 50% methanol (B) was used as follows: 15–95% B in 0–15 min, 95% B for 15–25 min, 95–15% B in 25–26 min. Negative ions were scanned over an m/z range from 620 to 2000. The 2-thiolation at position 54 in tRNAAsp* and its precursor were detected by retardation in an electrophoretic system consisting of a 10% polyacrylamide gel (10 × 12 × 0.1 cm3) containing 7 m urea polymerized in the presence of 25 or 100 μm[(N-acryloylamino)phenyl]mercuric chloride (APM), which was synthesized as described by Igloi (19Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1.6–3.2 μg) was resolved on the APM gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 0.2 m β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h to reduce and/or break the sulfur linkages formed between the thiolated-RNA and the APM in the gel. The RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) by blotting using TBE Buffer, which was hybridized with the 5′-32P-labeled DNA probes for tRNAAsp* or its precursor. The retarded band resulting from the presence of thiocarbonylated nucleotides in RNA was visualized by a Fuji BAS1000 bioimaging analyzer. The 5′ end of the precursor tRNAAsp* was determined by the primer extension technique. Total RNA from TTY1/pT8leuBor TTY1/pEx-Asp* (U8A/G19C) was heat-denatured and annealed with the 5′-32P-labeled primer RT-1 (15-mer), 5′-CAACTACACC TACAC-3′. Reverse transcription was performed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Toyobo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the initiation position of the transcription, the primer extension product was electrophoresed together with the dideoxy sequencing products of the template plasmid pCR-XL-tRNAAsp*(U8A) using the same primer (RT-1) on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. To detect activity of the s2T (54)-thiolase in T. thermophilus cells and to investigate its recognition elements in tRNA in vivo, we first expressed an artificial tRNA gene encoded on a plasmid. We selected T. thermophilus HB8 tRNAAsp as our model tRNA species because the presence of s2T at position 54 has been verified in this tRNA (20Keith G. Yusupov M. Briand C. Moras D. Kern D. Brion C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We introduced mutations at 11 base pairs in the acceptor, anticodon, and T stems of tRNAAsp (Fig.1 B) so that the resultant tRNA (named tRNAAsp*) could be discriminated from the native tRNAAsp by Northern hybridization using the DNA probes for tRNAAsp*. The tRNAAsp* gene was integrated into the tRNASer operon from T. thermophilus strain HB8 by replacing the tRNASer gene, as depicted in Fig. 1,A and B). The reason for employing this strategy is that the tRNASer operon is the only T. thermophilus tRNA gene reported so far that includes both 5′- and 3′-adjacent apparent promoter and terminator sequences. The tRNAAsp* operon was synthesized by PCR using six DNA oligos and ligated into the EcoRI and EcoRV sites of anE. coli-T. thermophilus shuttle vector, pT8leuB(11Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an expression vector for tRNAAsp* (pEx-Asp*). Total RNA from cells of E. coli JM109 harboring pEx-Asp* was separated by 10% denaturing PAGE followed by Northern hybridization with the probe AS-2. Two distinct RNA bands associated with tRNAAsp* could be observed (Fig.2 A). The longer band (asterisk), which appeared in close proximity to 5 S rRNA, was considered to be a precursor of tRNAAsp*. The shorter band, located in the E. coli class I tRNA cluster, was presumed to be the mature form of tRNAAsp*. The result demonstrated that the tRNA operon from T. thermophilus could function even in E. coli cells, which can be explained by the fact that the promoter sequence of this gene (TTGACG (−35)/TACACT (−10) (Fig. 1 A) is similar to the E. coli tRNA promoter consensus sequence (TTGACA (−35)/TATAAT (−10) (21Inokuchi H. Yamao F. Söll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 17-30Google Scholar). However, the heterologous expression of Thermus tRNA in E. coli cells resulted in strong accumulation of the tRNA precursor (∼70% of the total expression), indicating that the slight disparity with the consensus sequence and the high copy number of the shuttle vector derived from pUC118 in E. coli cells (22Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar, 23Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) may have led to the tRNA precursor being produced too abundantly to be processed sufficiently by tRNA maturases such as RNase P (24Altman S. Kirsebom L. Talbot S. Söll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 67-78Google Scholar) or 3′ ribonucleases (25Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 67-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When the expression of tRNAAsp* in T. thermophilus was examined by Northern hybridization with the probe AS-1 (Fig. 2 B), tRNAAsp* originating from the vector was detected mainly in the mature form, although as much as 30% of the total product was observed as the putative precursor (asterisk). Judging from the intensity of the Northern blotting, the expression of total RNA in T. thermophiluscells was lower than that in E. coli cells. This can be accounted for by the likely low copy number of pEx-Asp* in T. thermophilus, because this expression vector has a replication origin derived from pTT8, whose copy number is about eight (26Hishinuma F. Tanaka T. Sakaguchi K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1978; 104: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our next task was to determine whether tRNAAsp* expressed in T. thermophilus cells was processed normally and modified in the same manner as the native tRNA and, in particular, whether or not it contained s2T. To isolate tRNAAsp*, total RNA from T. thermophiluscells harboring pEx-Asp* was fractionated by anion exchange column chromatography so as to enrich the fractions that included tRNAAsp*. In this step, we were able to successfully concentrate the tRNAAsp* fractions and exclude those containing the precursor. tRNAAsp* was then purified to homogeneity by solid-phase DNA probing (Fig.3 A). End-labeling with32P and sequencing by Donis-Keller's enzymatic digestion method (Fig. 3 B) showed that the purified tRNAAsp* had the expected sequence, including both the 5′ and 3′ ends. Abnormalities in the bands suggested the presence of some modified residues (the expected modifications are parenthesized in Fig.3 B). The primary sequence of tRNAAsp* was further determined by post-labeling and LC/MS analysis, which enabled us to identify 7 post-transcriptional modifications at 8 positions: 4-thiouridine (s 4 U) at position 8, pseudouridine (Ψ) at positions 13 and 55, 2′-O-methylguanosine (Gm) at position 18, dihydrouridine (D) at positions 20 and 20a, 1-methyladenosine (m 1 A) at position 58, ribothymidine (T) at position 54, and 2-thioribothymidine (s 2 T) at position 54 (Fig.3 C). The post-labeling method clearly identified both T and s2T at position 54 (data not shown), which is consistent with a previous report that s2T is derived from a partial modification of T induced by the cultivation temperature (6Watanabe K. Shinma M. Oshima T. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The presence of s2T at position 54 was further examined by LC/MS with RNase T1-digested fragments of tRNAAsp* (Fig. 4). Although the fragment s2TΨCGp was clearly detected at retention time 20.1 min as singly and doubly charged ions, the fragment TΨCGp was hardly detected even though the LC/MS was highly sensitive, suggesting that tRNAAsp* preferentially possesses s2T at position 54.Figure 4Mass spectrometric analysis of oligonucleotides derived from tRNAAsp*.

We thus successfully detected s2T synthesis activityin vivo. Because the procedures we employed to detect s2T54 are unsuitable for routine assays of multiple samples, we searched for a simpler method that does not require purification of the expressed tRNA. Igloi (19Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) reports an affinity electrophoresis system in which a polyacrylamide gel is co-polymerized with APM. In this system, which was reported to be successful in detecting tRNA with the s4U or 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification (19Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the electrophoretic mobility of thiolated tRNAs is retarded compared with that of non-thiolated tRNAs due to the specific interaction between the thiocarbonyl group and the mercuric compound. By combining this technique with Northern hybridization using a probe specific for the relevant tRNA, the thiolated nucleosides in a particular tRNA species can be detected (27Emilsson V. Naslund A.K. Kurland C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4499-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We therefore used this approach to identify the 2-thiouridylation at position 54 in tRNAAsp* expressed inT. thermophilus cells. When APM gel electrophoresis was performed, specific retardation of tRNAAsp* was observed (data not shown). However, because tRNAAsp* has 2 thiouridines, s4U8 and s2T54, this retardation would have been mediated by both of them. To differentiate gel retardation due to 2-thiolation at position 54 from that caused by s4U8, we first eliminated s4U8 from the expressed tRNAAsp* by introducing a U to A point mutation at position 8 in the expression vector pEx-Asp*. As shown in Fig. 5 A(lanes 1 and 4), the mutant tRNAAsp*(U8A) without the s4U8 modification was expressed in T. thermophilus cells in its mature form together with a few possible precursors from the resultant plasmid (pEx-Asp*(U8A)). Total RNA from this mutant strain was subjected to APM gel electrophoresis using two APM concentrations, 25 and 100 μm (+ and ++, respectively, in Fig. 5). In the gels stained by ethidium bromide (lanes 2 and 3), most of the intrinsic tRNAs exhibited strong retardation due to s4U8. Furthermore, when compared with the 5 S rRNA band, which contains no thiolated nucleotides, the tRNA cluster was retarded in accordance with the concentration of APM. Next, the band corresponding to the expressed tRNAAsp*(U8A) was detected by Northern hybridization using the probe AS-1 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4–6). Slight but significant retardation concomitant with the increment in the APM concentration could be observed. This was thought to be almost certainly caused by the presence of the 2-thio group at position 54 in tRNAAsp*(U8A) given that band retardation due to 2-thiolation at position 54 is likely to be much less than the strong retardation resulting from 4-thiolation of U8. This interpretation is supported by the reported successful detection of the other 2-thiouridine derivative, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, by the APM method (19Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed band retardation did actually derive from 2-thiolation at position 54, we constructed another mutant vector, tRNAAsp*(U8A/U54A), in which a U to A point mutation was introduced at position 54 in addition to that at position 8. As shown in Fig. 5 B (lanes 7 and 10), tRNAAsp*(U8A/U54A) was expressed in its mature form together with a large accumulation in the precursor form, indicating that the U54A mutation had an inhibitory effect on tRNA maturation. In the presence of APM, the bands corresponding to the mature form of tRNAAsp* (U8A/U54A) (lanes 11 and 12) appeared at the same position as the bands for tRNAAsp*(U8A) and tRNAAsp*(U8A/U54A) on the gels without APM (lanes 4 and 10, respectively). Moreover, no difference in mobility was observed even when the concentration of APM was increased (lanes 11 and12). The above results clearly demonstrated that the retardation of tRNAAsp*(U8A) in APM gel electrophoresis actually resulted from the presence of the 2-thio group at position 54 in the tRNA and confirmed the feasibility of using this simple assay system to investigate the sequence requirements of tRNA for in vivo2-thiolati"

The crystal structure shows that its six domains are arranged in three pairs with a pseudo-ternary axis. Both the holo and apo forms of human ceruloplasmin were studied by size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering in solution. The experimental curve of the holo form displays conspicuous differences with the scattering pattern calculated from the crystal structure. Once the carbohydrate chains and flexible loops not visible in the crystal are accounted for, remaining discrepancies suggest that the central pair of domains may move as a whole with respect to the rest of the molecule. The quasisymmetrical crystal structure therefore appears to be stabilized by crystal packing forces. Upon copper removal, the scattering pattern of human ceruloplasmin exhibits very large differences with that of the holoprotein, which are interpreted in terms of essentially preserved domains freely moving in solution around flexible linkers and exploring an ensemble of open conformations. This model, which is supported by the analysis of domain interfaces, provides a structural explanation for the differences in copper reincorporation into the apoprotein and activity recovery between human ceruloplasmin and two other multicopper oxidases, ascorbate oxidase and laccase. Our results demonstrate that, beyond catalytic activity, the three-copper cluster at the N-terminal-C-terminal interface plays a crucial role in the structural stability of human ceruloplasmin.

Ceruloplasmin (ferro-O2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.16.3.1) is a circulating copper protein found in vertebrate plasma, which belongs to the family of multicopper oxidases together with ascorbate oxidase and laccases. In humans it accounts for 95% of plasma copper and seems to play an important role in iron metabolism and homeostasis by virtue of its capacity to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, which allows the subsequent incorporation of the latter into apotransferrin (1Osaki S.

Besides, the protein was shown to exert an antioxidant activity (5Gutteridge J.M.C. Richmond R. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 269-272Google Scholar) because of its ability to scavenge superoxide radicals (6Vassiliev V.B. Kachurin A.M. Soroka V.N. Biochemistry (Eng. Transl. Biokimiya). 1988; 53: 1756-1761Google Scholar), a function also strongly dependent on the presence of copper in the hCp molecule (7Kachurin A.M. Vassiliev V.B. Soroka V.N. Biochemistry (Eng. Transl. Biokimiya). 1989; 54: 26-31Google Scholar, 8Vassiliev V.B. Kachurin A.M. Beltramini M. Rocco G.P. Salvato B. Gaitskhoki V.S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 65: 167-174Google Scholar). More recently, a glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity was detected and associated with a different active site involving Cys-699 (9Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12104-12110Google Scholar). hCp is a single chain of 1046 amino acids (10Takahashi N. Ortel T.L. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 390-394Google Scholar). It normally binds six copper ions (11Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar), which are classified in three different types according to their spectroscopic properties (12Malmström B.G. Williams R.J.P. Da Silva J.R.F. New Trends in Bioinorganic Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1978: 59-77Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallography structure determined at 3.1-Å resolution reveals that the polypeptide chain is folded in six similar domains arranged in three pairs forming a triangular array around a pseudo 3-fold axis (13Lindley P.F. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammar B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Google Scholar) (see the schematic diagram in the inset to Fig. 1). The mononuclear type 1 copper sites in domains 4 and 6 involve 2 His, 1 Cys, and 1 Met as copper ligands, whereas in the type 1 site of domain 2 the Met residue is missing. One type 2 copper and the binuclear type 3 copper form a trinuclear cluster binding a dioxygen molecule activated in the peroxide form. The trinuclear cluster is surrounded by four pairs of His residues equally contributed by the N-terminal domain 1 and the C-terminal domain 6, with Cu-N distances of ∼2.1 Å. Two residues are bound to the type 2 copper and three residues coordinate each copper atom of type 3 (11Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar, 13Lindley P.F. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammar B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Google Scholar). Recently, the kinetics of CN−-dependent conversion of holo-hCp into the apoprotein were investigated, yielding some insight into the relative affinities of metal ions in the molecule (8Vassiliev V.B. Kachurin A.M. Beltramini M. Rocco G.P. Salvato B. Gaitskhoki V.S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 65: 167-174Google Scholar). Type 1 and type 2 Cu2+ appear to be most sensitive to the treatment, whereas type 3 Cu2+ are more tightly bound. Copper-depleted hCp becomes unable both of oxidizing its in vitro substrates p-phenylenediamine ando-dianisidine and of scavenging O2˙¯ anions. Subsequent copper reincorporation into CN−-treated samples shows that both the final copper content and the recovered enzymatic activity are strongly dependent on the amount of copper left bound to the protein (8Vassiliev V.B. Kachurin A.M. Beltramini M. Rocco G.P. Salvato B. Gaitskhoki V.S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 65: 167-174Google Scholar). In particular, the removal of type 3 copper ions is essentially irreversible. Previous studies, including determination of sedimentation coefficients (14Kasper C.B. Deutsch H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2325-2337Google Scholar), electrophoretic mobility (15Zakharova E.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Google Scholar), and spectroscopic analysis using UV absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) (17De Filippis V. Vassiliev V.B. Beltramini M. Fontana A. Salvato B. Gaitskhoki V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 119-123Google Scholar) indicated that the conformation of apo-hCp is different from that of the holoprotein. The authors of the latter study proposed that upon removal of copper, the protein acquires typical “molten globule” properties, although the presence of a significant fine structure in the near UV CD spectrum and of an efficient tyrosine to tryptophan energy transfer was taken as an indication that the copper-free protein still retains a significant amount of residual tertiary structure (17De Filippis V. Vassiliev V.B. Beltramini M. Fontana A. Salvato B. Gaitskhoki V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 119-123Google Scholar). In a molten globule state, the secondary structure is largely preserved with concomitant loss of precise side chain packing leading to a less compact conformation exposing hydrophobic moieties to the solvent (18Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995: 243-300Google Scholar). To characterize further the conformational differences between holo- and apo-hCp, the two protein forms have been studied using size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) in solution. The latter method provides information about the global conformation of macromolecules (19Vachette P. Svergun D.I. Fanchon E. Geissler E. Hodeau J.L. Regnard J.R. Timmins P.

Proteins. 1997; 27: 110-117Google Scholar) or studies of the molten globule state of proteins (22Kataoka M. Hagihara Y. Mihara K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 591-596Google Scholar, 23Segel D.J. Eliezer D. Uversky V. Fink A.L. Hodgson K.O. Doniach S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15352-15359Google Scholar). The results presented here show that hCp undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement upon copper removal. The SAXS pattern of apo-hCp suggests that the protein explores a large ensemble of open conformations in which the two pairs of domains at each end of the protein, which remained essentially intact, are fairly free to move in solution while still being connected to the central pair by flexible linkers. For the holo form of the protein, indications of rigid body movements of the central pair of domains with respect to the other two domains have been obtained. Human holo-hCp was isolated from the pooled sera of healthy individuals following the procedure already described (24Prozorovski V.N. Rashkovetski L.G. Vassiliev V.B. Shavlovski M.M. Neifakh S.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1982; 19: 40-53Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was checked spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance ratioA 610/A 280 that was ≥0.046, indicating a purity level of at least 95–96%. To prepare the apoprotein, holo-hCp was first fully reduced by dialysis for 2 h against 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 20 mm ascorbic acid and then incubated at 20 °C for 12 h in the presence of CN− (0.25 mm) and EDTA (10 mm). The reaction was stopped by dialysis against 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (2 changes for 6 h each). The resulting apoprotein contained less than 1% residual copper as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a value of 1.61 mg−1 cm2 for the extinction coefficient (25Gill S.G. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were determined using a Hewlett-Packard model HP 8452A spectrophotometer. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a TSK G3000SW analytical column (7.5 × 600 mm) eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1 with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 mNaCl. The absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 226 nm. Typically, 20–50 μg (10–25 μl) of holo- and apo-hCp in the same elution buffer were loaded onto the column by using a Rheodine model 8125 valve connected to a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HPLC system, model 410-BIO. Chromatographic data were collected and processed using the CHROM3 software run on a 7700 professional computer. SAXS measurements were performed on the small angle x-ray scattering instrument D24 at LURE using synchrotron radiation from a bending magnet of the storage ring DCI. The instrument, the data acquisition system (26Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S.M. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Sect. A. 1986; 249: 399-407Google Scholar), and the evacuated cell (27Dubuisson J.M. Decamps T. Vachette P. J. Appl. Cryst. 1997; 30: 49-54Google Scholar) have already been described. The wavelength of the monochromatic (Δλ/λ = 10−3) x-ray beam was adjusted to 1.488 Å (absorption K-edge of Ni). All samples were measured in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. To ensure the monodispersity of the samples for R g determination, a solution of holo (respectively, apo)-hCp was loaded onto a size exclusion (SE) HPLC column and eluted in the above buffer. The top fraction of the peak corresponding to monomeric hCp was collected and immediately examined by SAXS. The protein concentration of each fraction was in the range of 1 to 3 mg ml−1. Wide angle data are weak but much less sensitive to the presence of a small amount of oligomer. They were recorded using solutions at a concentration of 125 mg ml−1 (holo-hCp) and 45 mg ml−1(apo-hCp). The radius of gyration (R g) was determined using the Guinier approximation (28Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar): I(s) = I(0)·exp((−4π2/3)R g22s2), where I(0) is the scattering intensity at zero scattering angle. I(0)/c is proportional to the molecular weight of the protein. The complete scattering curves used for further analysis were obtained by splicing small angle, low concentration data with the wide angle, high concentration curve after proper scaling. The distance distribution function p(r) corresponds to the distribution of distances between any 2 volume elements within one particle. It has been determined using the indirect Fourier transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (29Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Cryst. 1992; 25: 495-503Google Scholar). This function provides an estimate of the radius of gyration derived through the following relationship. Rg2=∫r2p(r)dr2∫p(r)drEquation 1 The ab initio shape determination was performed using the dummy atom model (DAM) method (30Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Google Scholar) as implemented in the program DAMMIN. A sphere of diameterD max is filled by densely packed small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r 0 ≪D max. The DAM structure is defined by a configuration vector X assigning an index to each atom corresponding to solvent (0) or solute particle (1Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Google Scholar). In keeping with the low resolution of the solution scattering data, the method starts from a random configuration and searches for a configuration X minimizingf(X) = χ2+ αP(X), where α > 0 is a positive parameter and the penalty term P(X) ensures that the DAM has low resolution with respect to the packing radius r 0. To remove the scattering contribution because of the internal fluctuations undesirable for the shape analysis, a constant was subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity decays as s−4 following Porod's law (31Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Google Scholar) for homogeneous particles. This procedure yields an approximation of the shape scattering curve (i.e. the scattering because of the excluded volume of the particle filled by constant density) and this data is used in the ab initioanalysis. The atomic coordinates of the holo-hCp were taken from the Protein Data Bank (32Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Google Scholar) and are available in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data bank (13Lindley P.F. Card G. Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Reinhammar B. Selin-Lindgren E. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 454-463Google Scholar), entry 1kcw. The scattering from the crystallographic structure was calculated using the program CRYSOL (33Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Cryst. 1995; 28: 768-773Google Scholar), which takes the scattering from the solvation shell into account and fits the experimental scattering curve using two adjustable parameters, the excluded volume of the particle and the contrast of the hydration layer δρb= ρb − ρs, (here, ρs and ρbdenote the scattering length densities of the bulk and bound solvent, respectively). The values of δρb found for models of the holo and apo conformations ranged from 0.02 to 0.04 el. Å−3, values commonly encountered with other proteins. The structure is not complete, because three external loops corresponding to residues 339–346, 475–482, and 885–891 could not be resolved in the structure any more than the 6 C-terminal residues. This is most likely because of a great mobility of these parts of the molecule that cancelled out their contribution to the diffraction intensities, making them invisible to x-rays as it were. Because they are very mobile, their precise conformation and location is not a critical issue, and certainly not when it comes to determining their contribution to the SAXS pattern, i.e. at low resolution. Therefore, these missing parts were modeled using the software Turbo-FRODO (34Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar) and the scattering pattern calculated and fitted against the experimental curve of the holo-hCp. The complete sequence of the carbohydrate chains are reported by Rydèn (35Rydèn L. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 37-100Google Scholar). As can be seen in Table I, they comprise one biantennary oligosaccharide constituting two of three chains and a triantennary oligosaccharide constituting the third of the three chains observed on average on the molecule of hCp. However, hCp is heterogeneous in the degree of glycosylation, which varies from two to four chains per protein molecule (35Rydèn L. Lontie R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 37-100Google Scholar). Finally, the biantennary or the larger triantennary oligosaccharide can be found attached at the same site, implying that a microheterogeneity also exists at this level. The three-dimensional structure of a fragment of carbohydrate chain containing nine hexose units bound to a protein was found in the structure of an Fc fragment (36Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1fc1). The missing terminal sialic acid was found in a structure of influenza virus neuraminidase (37Varghese J.N. Smith P.W. Sollis S.L. Blick T.J. Sahasrabudhe A. McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Colman P.M. Structure. 1998; 6: 735-746Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 2qwb). The complete biantennary and triantennary chains were built using Turbo-FRODO. No particular care was taken during the process to respect a precise stereochemistry of the sugar chains thus built, because this is of no consequence on the resulting scattering pattern, which only depends on the general position of the chain with respect to the protein. The same program was used to add the various chains to the glycosylation sites. The chains were placed in an arbitrary position well exposed to the solvent, because their high mobility makes them likely to explore a fairly large volume around the attachment site with no privileged orientation or position. Their contribution to the scattering is thus that of an average conformation. Molecules with one triantennary chain and from one to three biantennary oligosaccharides were obtained in this way and used for calculations.Table IStructure of the oligosaccharide chains of hCP: (a) biantennary oligosaccharide and (b) triantennary oligosaccharide (35Rydèn L.

The first step made use of the program Turbo-FRODO already mentioned to create extended conformations of the molecule. The central pair of domains was kept fixed during the whole process and considered as associated with the coordinate frame. The three domain pairs are defined as follows: domain {1,2} amino acid residues 1–338; domain {3,4} amino acid residues 339–702; domain {5,6} amino acid residues 703–1046. The domain pair {5,6} was rotated around an axis parallel to they axis of the coordinate frame passing through the N(H) of residue 703, whereas domain pair {1,2} was rotated around an axis parallel to the x axis passing through the C(O) atom of residue 338. These rotations were a simple means of describing rigid body movements of the domains around one extremity of the linker connecting them to the central domain. The second step of the model search made use of the program ASSA (38Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Google Scholar) running on an SGI Indigo2 work station. As input, the program uses the atomic coordinate files of proteins in PDB format and the scattering amplitudes of the corresponding protein calculated using CRYSOL. Given two such proteins and the experimental scattering pattern of the (1:1) complex between them, their mutual position and orientation can be interactively optimized so as to fit the scattering data. In the specific case of the apo-hCp, the protein was divided in two parts: the first one comprising the pairs of domains {1,2} and {3,4} was kept fixed, whereas the position and orientation of {5,6} was adjusted. Here again, only rotations around the Cα of residue 703 were considered, so as to allow for rigid body movements of {5,6} without disrupting the main chain connectivity. In a second run, the roles of protein domains {1,2} and {5,6} were exchanged and the process was repeated. No further refinement was required. Domain interfaces have been analyzed using the Protein-Protein Interaction Server by J. Thornton and S. Jones ((39), available at www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/index.html). For ascorbate oxidase (AO) only monomer A was considered (40Messerschmidt A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank entry 1a02. Atomic coordinates for laccase are also available from the Protein Data Bank, entry 1a65 (41Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Oestergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Google Scholar). Among the various parameters characterizing the interface that are returned by the program, we have considered here the number of hydrogen bonds, the accessible surface area (ASA), the gap volume calculated, and the gap index. The accessible surface area is calculated using the Lee and Richards algorithm (42Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Google Scholar) and is defined as the surface mapped out by the center of a probe sphere of radius 1.4 Å rolled around the van der Waals surface of the protein. For a given interface, the value is calculated for each partner in isolation and within the complex before computing the difference. The value of the interface ASA given in Table II is the sum of the differences for both partners. The gap volume between the two interacting domains is calculated using the program SURFNET (43Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1991; 13: 323-330Google Scholar). Finally, the gap index is defined as the ratio of the gap volume to the interface ASA. This index is a measure of the complementarity of the interacting surfaces. Its mean value over a panel of homodimers and heterocomplexes is 2.20 (respectively, 2.48) with a standard deviation of 0.87 (1.02) and maximal values of 4.43 (5.17) (39Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc.

Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Cryst. 2001; 34: 527-532Google Scholar). This routine explores all six translational and rotational parameters to optimize the fit of the calculated pattern to the experimental scattering curve. The results of analytical gel filtration, reported in Fig. 1, provide evidence that apo-hCp has a larger hydrodynamic volume as compared with that of the holoprotein, indicating that removal of copper ions leads to a more expanded structure. This observation is consistent with the results of a previous comparison of the physicochemical characteristics of the holo and apo forms indicating that copper depletion induces a conformational change interpreted at the time as possibly leading to the molten globule state (17De Filippis V. Vassiliev V.B. Beltramini M. Fontana A. Salvato B. Gaitskhoki V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 119-123Google Scholar). The second, minor peak on the low molecular weight side of the apo-hCp elution profile is most likely because of some limited proteolysis, suggesting a greater sensitivity of the protein after copper extraction. This had already been suggested by the marked difference in half-life between circulating hCp in the holo form (5.5 days) (45Gitlin D. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1960; 185: 693Google Scholar) and the apo form with a much shorter half-life of about 5 h (46Matsuda I. Pearson T. Holzmann N.A. Pediatr. Res. 1974; 8: 821-824Google Scholar). The radius of gyration of hCp in the holo and apo forms was calculated using the Guinier approximation from the range of scattering vectors within 2πsRg < 1.3 (31Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Google Scholar) (Fig.2 a). The concentrations (c) were sufficiently low to make interparticle interactions negligible in the buffer used. The R g values derived from the Guinier analysis are 32.5 ± 0.5 and 45.2 ± 0.5 Å for the holo- and apo-hCp, respectively. The values of I(0)/c for various samples of holo- and apo-hCp were identical within experimental error, as expected for two proteins with the same molecular mass, showing that the apo-hCp solution used for SAXS experiments was free from protein degradation. Further analysis was performed in terms of the distance distribution function p(r) (Fig. 2 b) determined for holo- and apo-hCp as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their qualitative comparison suggests that the conformation of the holo-hCp is globular (p(r) is essentially symmetric with respect to the most frequent distance), whereas that of the apo-hCp is rather anisometric. Quantitatively, the maximum dimension of the holo form D max is equal to 110 ± 5 Å, whereas the apo form is significantly larger (D max ="
https://openalex.org/W2158639483,"A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify binding partners of Mlf1, an oncoprotein recently identified in a translocation with nucleophosmin that causes acute myeloid leukemia. Two proteins isolated in this screen were 14-3-3ζ and a novel adaptor, Madm. Mlf1 contains a classic RSXSXP sequence for 14-3-3 binding and is associated with 14-3-3ζ via this phosphorylated motif. Madm co-immunoprecipitated with Mlf1 and co-localized in the cytoplasm. In addition, Madm recruited a serine kinase, which phosphorylated both Madm and Mlf1 including the RSXSXP motif. In contrast to wild-type Mlf1, the oncogenic fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-MLF1 did not bind 14-3-3ζ, had altered Madm binding, and localized exclusively in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of Madm in M1 myeloid cells suppressed cytokine-induced differentiation unlike Mlf1, which promotes maturation. Because the Mlf1 binding region of Madm and its own dimerization domain overlapped, the levels of Madm and Mlf1 may affect complex formation and regulate differentiation. In summary, this study has identified two partner proteins of Mlf1 that may influence its subcellular localization and biological function.

It was initially identified in a t(3;5)(q25.1;q34) translocation betweenMLF1 on chromosome 3 and nucleophosmin (NPM) on chromosome 5, which generates the chimeric molecule NPM-MLF1(1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar). Significantly, overexpression of wild-type MLF1 in acute myeloid leukemias, not involving the t(3;5), is associated with progression toward a malignant phenotype (2Matsumoto N. Yoneda-Kato N. Iguchi T. Kishimoto Y. Kyo T. Sawada H. Tatsumi E. Fukuhara S. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1757-1765Google Scholar). The murine homologue of MLF1 (Mlf1) (3Hitzler J.K. Witte D.P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Naeve C.W. Look A.T. Morris S.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 53-59Google Scholar) was isolated independently as a gene expressed when J2E erythroleukemia cells (4Klinken S.P. Nicola N.A. Johnson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8506-8510Google Scholar) undergo a spontaneous phenotypic change to display morphological and biochemical features of monocytoid cells (5Keil U. Busfield S.J. Farr T.J. Papadimitriou J. Green A.R. Begley C.G. Klinken S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 439-448Google Scholar); therefore, the gene was termed Hls7 forhemopoietic lineage switch gene 7 (6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). Significantly, enforced expression ofMlf1/Hls7 in the parental erythroleukemia cells recapitulated the original phenotypic change and prevented erythropoietin-induced maturation (6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic expression of Mlf1/Hls7 in normal hemopoietic progenitors enhanced myeloid colony formation at the expense of erythroid colonies. From these studies, it was concluded that Mlf1 is normally involved in the phenotypic determination of hemopoietic cells and that its dysregulation is important in leukemogenesis. Analysis of the Mlf1 sequence identified no recognizable motifs or domains, except for a characteristic RSXSXP binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (3Hitzler J.K. Witte D.P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G.

This serine phosphorylation appears essential for 14-3-3 binding, although other non-canonical binding sites have also been identified in molecules such as Cbl (9Liu Y.C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Google Scholar) and p53 (10Waterman M.J.F. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L.F. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 family of proteins is expressed in a broad range of organisms and is highly conserved throughout evolution. These molecules bind and influence the activity of numerous diverse proteins, including Raf, BAD, Cdc25c, p53, Cbl, Bcr, and Bcr-Abl (10Waterman M.J.F. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L.F. Halazonetis T.D.

Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Google Scholar); as a consequence, they have been implicated in regulating the onset of cell division, apoptosis, and differentiation. 14-3-3 proteins control the activity of their partner molecules, in part, by sequestering them from their site of action and by serving as bridging molecules that promote dimerization of associated proteins (16Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Google Scholar). In an attempt to decipher the biological function of Mlf1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify molecules that associate with the protein. Predictably, a 14-3-3 family member (14-3-3ζ) was shown to associate with Mlf1 in this screen. In addition, a novel adaptor molecule (Madm, MLF1-adaptormolecule) was isolated. Madm associates with a kinase that phosphorylates serine residues in Madm itself and the RSXSXP motif of Mlf1. These data indicate that Madm is involved in 14-3-3-mediated regulation of Mlf1. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, L40 (MATa,his3Δ200, trp1–901,leu2–3,112,ade2,LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3,URA::(lexAop)8-lacZ,GAL4) was used in a yeast two-hybrid procedure essentially as described by Vojtek et al. (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenburg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 1993: 205-214Google Scholar). The complete Mlf1 open reading frame was subcloned into pBTM116 (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenburg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 1993: 205-214Google Scholar) to generate a LexA DNA-binding domain fusion. The L40 strain was transformed with pBTM116-Mlf1 and used to screen a pVP16 cDNA library made from mRNA prepared from the lymphohemopoietic progenitor cell line, EML C.1 (18Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Google Scholar). An EML C.1 cDNA library in λzapII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened for full-length Madm using the 220-bp Madm yeast two-hybrid fragment as a probe. After a full-length clone was isolated (GenBankTMaccession number AF302138), databases (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ) were searched using FASTA and BLAST programs of the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) software package. A glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein consisting of the first 55 amino acids of Madm was expressed in Escherichia coli using pGEX-2T (19Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified, and antisera were raised in rabbits. COS cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) constructs expressing Mlf1 and/or Madm using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and harvested 24 h posttransfection. Protein lysates were prepared using 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 0.5 mg of protein lysate with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with specific antibodies before detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular fractionation studies were performed essentially as described by Zhang et al. (20Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the RSXSXP motif of MLF1 were synthesized (26MRQMIRSFSEPFGRDL41) with the second serine residue (Ser34) either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated. Peptides conjugated to Sepharose beads were incubated with cell lysates before separation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on transiently transfected COS cells fixed with acetone:methanol (1:1). Protein localization was detected using antibodies against Madm, Mlf1, or a Myc epitope tag, followed by an anti-IgG Alexa-Fluor 488 secondary antibody or an anti-IgG Alexa-Fluor 546 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Alternatively, cells were transfected with a pEGFP-C2 plasmid containing Madm (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which expressed Madm with green fluorescent protein fused at the N terminus of the molecule. DNA was counterstained with Hoechst 33258 and visualized on an MRC 1024 UV laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Kinase assays were performed on Madm immunoprecipitates essentially as described previously (21Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.4 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and radioactivity was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphorylation of the MLF1-S34 peptide (MRQMIRSFSEPFGRDL) by Madm immunoprecipitates was detected as described above. To determine phosphorylation statusin vivo, transiently transfected COS cells were incubated with 100 μCi/well of phosphoric acid (H332PO4). The cells were lysed, and protein immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. For [32P]phosphoamino acid analysis, in vitrokinase assays were performed, and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride after separation by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled Madm or phosphorylated substrates were excised, hydrolyzed, and analyzed by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (22Hardin S.C. Wolniak S.M. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 344-346Google Scholar). The PA317 packaging cell line (23Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Google Scholar) was transfected with linearized constructs of the MSCV-neo 2.2 vector (24Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138Google Scholar) alone or MSCV expressing Madm with a C-terminal Myc tag. M1 cells were then infected with the amphotrophic viral supernatants as described previously (21Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Google Scholar). Expression of exogenous Madm transcripts was determined by Northern blotting, while immunoblotting was employed to detect Myc-tagged Madm. Differentiation of M1 cells was initiated by addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and monitored for Cd11b surface expression by flow cytometry (Beckman-Coulter Epics XL/MCL) using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Chemi-Con, Temecula, CA). In an attempt to identify proteins that interact with Mlf1, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. Table I shows that Mlf1 interacted with numerous molecules, including a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins viz 14-3-3ζ, which was isolated as two separate clones. Other molecules that associated with Mlf1 in this screen included eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3, p42 subunit), protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (PIN, also known as dynein light chain, LC8), calcyclin-binding protein, nucleolin, and several uncharacterized proteins; each of these were identified once in the screen.Table IMlf1-interacting proteins identified in a yeast two-hybrid screenCloneHomologous to:GenBank™M5114-3-3ζ (100%)BAA11751M4Dynein light chain 1 (LC8), cytoplasmic protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (PIN) (100%)BAB27516M28Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (p42 subunit) (100%)AAF14221M86Calcyclin-binding protein (100%)AAC16757M62Nucleolin (100%)NP-035010M58Similar to heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U; scaffold attachment factor A; nuclear matrix protein (82%)XP-058496M2, M44, M70, M79, M86Novel Open table in a new tab To confirm the interaction between Mlf1 and 14-3-3ζ biochemically, COS cells were transfected with an Mlf1-expressing construct since endogenous Mlf1 protein expression is below the limits of detection. Fig. 1 A shows that when lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-14-3-3ζ antibodies, Mlf1 specifically co-purified with endogenous 14-3-3ζ. In addition, Mlf1 co-immunoprecipitated with 14-3-3ζ in J2E erythroleukemia cells expressing retrovirally driven Mlf1 (data not shown). These results corroborated the interaction between Mlf1 and 14-3-3ζ in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Both murine and human MLF1 contain a classic RSXSXP motif for 14-3-3 binding (1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar, 3Hitzler J.K. Witte D.P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Naeve C.W. Look A.T. Morris S.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 53-59Google Scholar, 6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). To determine if this region mediates the interaction between MLF1 and 14-3-3ζ, two peptides spanning this motif were generated (26MRQMIRSFSEPFGRDL41) with serine 34 either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated. Data displayed in Fig.1 B show that endogenous and recombinant 14-3-3ζ associated with the phosphorylated peptide only. Moreover, only the phosphorylated peptide was able to disrupt the MLF1/14-3-3 complex (Fig.1 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MLF1 and 14-3-3ζ associate via the RSXSXP motif of MLF1 and that phosphorylation is essential for this interaction. The binding of 14-3-3ζ to the fusion protein NPM-MLF1 was also investigated. Immunoprecipitation experiments from COS cells expressing FLAG-tagged NPM-MLF1 demonstrated that NPM-MLF1 did not bind 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 1 D) or that the interaction was extremely weak. Therefore, despite retaining the RSXSXP motif, the leukemogenic fusion protein NPM-MLF1 differed biochemically from the wild-type MLF1. These data suggest that the inability of NPM-MLF1 to associate with 14-3-3 may occur due to conformational changes produced by the fusion of NPM to MLF1. One of the novel clones that associated with Mlf1 in the yeast two-hybrid screen (Clone M44) contained a 220-bp cDNA fragment, which had no homology to sequences in the database at the time of isolation and was named Madm for Mlf1-adaptor molecule. This fragment was used to screen an EML C.1 cDNA library, and a 2153-bp cDNA was isolated. An open reading frame of 1608 bp was identified, encoding a putative 535-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 60 kDa (Fig.2 A). The probable initiating ATG was in the characteristic context for a translation start site (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8131Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequence encoded by Madm using the Swiss-Prot data base revealed similarities with a variety of protein kinases, and a consensus kinase domain was identified (26Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Google Scholar). However, the conserved ATP-binding motif (GXGXXG), found in conventional protein kinases (27Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Google Scholar), was not present in this protein (Fig. 2). Intriguingly, a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) was present within the kinase domain, as well as a potential nuclear export signal (NES) (Fig. 2), indicating that the protein may shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, Madm contains several potential phosphorylation sites in the vicinity of both the NLS and NES. These include protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at Ser102, Ser157, and Thr165, as well as a casein kinase II phosphorylation site at Thr171, suggesting that phosphorylation may play a role in regulating Madm subcellular localization. In addition, the N-terminal region of Madm is rich in glutamic acid and serine residues, which could potentially bind SH2 modules in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner (28Joung I. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5991-5995Google Scholar). Northern blotting analysis and whole mount in situhybridization demonstrated that Madm was expressed in all murine tissues and hemopoietic cell lines studied; moreover, the levels of mRNA were comparable in all samples analyzed (data not shown). Isolation of murine genomic clones revealed that the gene contains 18 exons, spanning 11 kb (Fig. 2 B). Examination of the promoter region identified possible transcription factor binding sites typical of a ubiquitously expressed gene (data not shown). Sequence comparisons of Madm shown in Fig.3 revealed that it had 51% amino acid identity with an uncharacterized protein from Drosophila melanogaster (AF145690) and 36% identity with a predicted protein from Caenorhabditis elegans (CAA99887), suggesting evolutionary conservation. Recently, a human homologue of Madm was submitted to GenBank as nuclear receptor binding protein (NM-013392) because it contained two LXXLL putative nuclear receptor binding motifs (29Hooper J.D. Baker E. Ogbourne S.M. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Genomics. 2000; 66: 113-118Google Scholar). The human clone contains an open reading frame of identical size to Madm and shares 98% amino acid identity (Fig. 3). To investigate the interaction between Madm and Mlf1 further, COS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing full-length Mlf1 and Myc-tagged Madm. Fig.4 A shows a 65-kDa band for tagged Madm, which is close to the predicted molecular mass of 60 kDa. Significantly, transfection of both Madm and Mlf1 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins. A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation in cells expressing HA-tagged Mlf1 and full-length Madm supported these observations (data not shown). These data confirm the association between Madm and Mlf1 identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Mlf1 has been shown previously to be localized primarily in the cytoplasm, but also within nuclear spots (1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar, 6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was employed to determine the subcellular localization of Madm and whether this overlapped with Mlf1. Fig. 4 B shows that Madm could be detected mainly in the cytoplasm of transfected COS cells, with some expression in the nucleus. Biochemical analyses of nuclear and cytosolic fractions confirmed that Madm was present in both compartments (Fig. 4 C). Co-localization with Mlf1 was observed primarily in the cytoplasm, especially in the perinuclear region including centrosomes (Fig. 4 D). Therefore, Madm and Mlf1 associate in the yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitate, and share subcellular locations. To characterize the domains required for the Madm and Mlf1 interaction, a series of deletion mutants was generated and tested in both yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Fig.5 A summarizes the data from yeast two-hybrid experiments and shows that amino acids 406–479 of Madm, encoded by the cDNA fragment originally identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen, were able to bind Mlf1. Similarly, deletion mutants of Mlf1 were examined for their Madm-binding ability in yeast. Wild-type Mlf1 and a C-terminal deletion to residue 227, bound Madm (Fig. 5 B). The inability of the 1–163 mutant to bind Madm suggested that amino acids between 163 and 227 were important for this association. However, a mutant consisting of amino acids 122–267 did not bind Madm, indicating that regions in the N terminus of Mlf1 were also required for interaction. Furthermore, the 39–267 mutant was able to bind Madm, whereas the 82–267 mutant did not. Collectively these data indicate that a combination of residues between amino acids 39–82 and 163–227 are involved in the Madm association. These findings were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from COS cells where expression of the mutant proteins was demonstrated. Binding of the fusion molecule NPM-MLF1 to Madm was also ascertained using co-immunoprecipitation experiments from COS cells. The full-length NPM-MLF1 and a C-terminal-truncated protein were able to interact with Madm (Fig. 5 C). In addition, deletion of amino acids 281–362 of NPM-MLF1 (corresponding to amino acids 121–202 of MLF1) retained Madm binding; however, removal of the N-terminal residues of MLF1 present in the fusion protein (corresponding to amino acids 17–120 in the normal MLF1 protein) prevented binding. From these data, it appears that Mlf1 and NPM-MLF1 share an N-terminal region that interacts with Madm, but that the second, C-terminal, region identified in MLF1 may be dispensable for NPM-MLF1 interaction with Madm. Although Madm has a consensus kinase domain, it lacks a typical ATP-binding motif (Fig. 2); it was, therefore, important to determine whether Madm was a genuine kinase. When bacterially produced Madm was subjected to an autokinase assay there was no protein phosphorylation, indicating an absence of catalytic activity (data not shown). This observation was also supported by the inability of mammalian-expressed Madm to autophosphorylate under the reducing conditions of in-gel kinase assays. However, when immunoprecipitated from transfected COS cells, full-length Madm and several deletion mutants, including a Madm construct lacking the kinase-like domain, were phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assays (Fig.6 A). These data suggested that a separate kinase was precipitating with, and phosphorylating, Madm. Indeed, the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was increased 3–7-fold when added to kinase assays containing Madm immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 A). In addition, the kinase recruited by Madm was able to phosphorylate co-precipitated Mlf1 (Fig.6 B). The in vivo phosphorylation status of Madm, Mlf1, and the fusion NPM-MLF1 were investigated in transfected COS cells. When the cells were labeled with [32P]phosphoric acid, all three proteins were phosphorylated (Fig. 6 C). Phosphoamino acid analysis of Madm, Mlf1, and NPM-MLF1, following in vivophosphorylation, revealed that these proteins were phosphorylated on serine residues (Fig. 6 D). Preliminary studies have excluded several well characterized kinases as the Madm-associated kinase, including protein kinase A, protein kinase C, Akt, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase. It was concluded from these experiments that Madm recruits a serine kinase that phosphorylates both Madm and Mlf1. As MLF1 contains a consensus 14-3-3 binding site and Madm binds a serine kinase, we postulated that Madm may mediate phosphorylation of the RSXSXP motif in MLF1. To determine whether the Madm/kinase complex was capable of phosphorylating this domain, the peptide26MRQMIRSFSEPFGRDL41 was used in an in vitro kinase assay. Fig. 6 E shows that in addition to the phosphorylation of Madm seen in transfected COS cells, a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of the MLF1 peptide bearing the 14-3-3 binding site occurred. Although a limited amount of peptide phosphorylation by endogenous kinase(s) was observed in non-transfected COS cells, phosphorylated peptide levels were 4–6-fold higher with the exogenous Madm complex. These data demonstrate that Madm binds a kinase capable of phosphorylating the RSXSXP motif of MLF1. Phosphorylation of the RSXSXP motif of Raf1 (8Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Google Scholar) was also observed with the Madm complex but not the non-canonical 14-3-3 binding site of Cbl (14Robertson H. Langdon W.L. Thien C.B.F. Bowtell D.D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 240: 46-50Google Scholar) (data not shown). Preliminary experiments with the yeast two-hybrid system indicated that Madm was capable of homodimerization (data not shown). To confirm that Madm could also dimerize in mammalian cells, Madm constructs tagged with either Myc or HA were co-transfected into COS cells. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies, followed by appropriate immunoblotting, confirmed that Madm was indeed able to self-associate (Fig.7 A). Data presented in Fig.7 B indicate that the region of Madm involved in homodimerization overlapped with the Mlf1-binding domain. This observation suggests that Madm and Mlf1 may form multimeric complexes, or alternatively, compete for binding sites. We have previously shown that Mlf1 overexpression in M1 monoblastoid cells enhances differentiation induced by LIF, as measured by surface Cd11b expression (6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). To determine the impact of Madm on myeloid maturation, the full-length cDNA was introduced into M1 cells using the MSCV retroviral vector. Despite large amounts of viral RNA being generated, Madm protein levels increased no more than 50–80% (Fig. 8, A and B). However, in marked contrast with M1 cells overexpressing Mlf1 (Ref. 6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholarand data not shown), all clones expressing exogenous Madm displayed lower Cd11b levels in the absence of LIF or when exposed to suboptimal concentrations of the cytokine (Fig. 8 C). Some clones persisted with lower Cd11b expression even at higher concentrations of LIF. These results demonstrate that modest alterations to the concentration of Madm can influence the maturation of M1 cells and that increasing the intracellular content of Madm had the opposite effect to Mlf1 on differentiation. Mlf1 is a recently described oncoprotein (1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar). It is able to influence hemopoietic lineage commitment and reprogram erythroleukemic cells to develop a monoblastoid phenotype (6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). The importance of Mlf1 is highlighted by (i) the t(3;5) translocation, which exposes the leukemogenic potential of the molecule, and (ii) overexpression of wild-type Mlf1 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, which correlates with poor prognosis and reduced survival (1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar, 2Matsumoto N. Yoneda-Kato N. Iguchi T. Kishimoto Y. Kyo T. Sawada H. Tatsumi E. Fukuhara S. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1757-1765Google Scholar). In this manuscript we describe two molecules that interact with Mlf1,viz. 14-3-3ζ and Madm. The identification of 14-3-3ζ as an Mlf1 partner protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmation by co-immunoprecipitation was not surprising as the only recognizable domain in Mlf1 is the 14-3-3 binding motif, RSXSXP (3Hitzler J.K. Witte D.P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Naeve C.W. Look A.T. Morris S.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 53-59Google Scholar, 6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Mlf1 is serine-phosphorylated in vivo and the phosphorylated motif associated with 14-3-3ζ, but not the unphosphorylated form. 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in many diverse functions, and their role in promoting cytoplasmic localization of some partner proteins is well documented, e.g. phosphorylation of cdc25c by Chk1 results in 14-3-3 binding, which masks an NLS and retains cdc25c in the cytoplasm (30Peng C.-Y. Graves P.R. Ogg S. Thoma R.S. Byrnes M.J., Wu, Z. Stephenson M.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 197-208Google Scholar, 31Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Google Scholar). It is possible, likewise, that phosphorylation of the RSXSXP motif in Mlf1 promotes 14-3-3 binding, thereby sequestering the molecule in the cytoplasm and restricting its access to the nucleus. This model is consistent with primary localization of wild-type Mlf1 in the cytoplasm, with small amounts detected in punctate nuclear bodies (1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar, 6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar, 32Yoneda-Kato N. Fukuhara S. Kato J.-Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3716-3724Google Scholar). Importantly, although the NPM-MLF1 fusion protein is phosphorylated in vivo, it no longer binds 14-3-3ζ. Because the fusion junction is only 13 residues from the RSXSXP motif, it is conceivable that structural alterations may inhibit the binding of 14-3-3ζ. Madm is a novel adaptor molecule for Mlf1. The co-localization of Madm and Mlf1 suggests that these two proteins are intimately associated, especially in the perinuclear area. Although Madm has a clearly defined kinase domain, it does not contain a characteristic ATP-binding region (29Hooper J.D. Baker E. Ogbourne S.M. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Genomics. 2000; 66: 113-118Google Scholar). While a number of kinases that lack this domain have been identified, including Chk1 and cdc7 (33Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Google Scholar, 34Patterson M. Sclafani R.A. Fangman W.L. Rosamond J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1590-1598Google Scholar), our data indicate that Madm does not possess the catalytic activity of a kinase. Indeed, Hooper et al. considered that the human homologue of Madm was unlikely to possess functional kinase activity because it lacked 7 of the 15 highly conserved kinase domain residues (29Hooper J.D. Baker E. Ogbourne S.M. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Genomics. 2000; 66: 113-118Google Scholar). However, Madm does recruit a serine kinase that phosphorylates both Madm and Mlf1. Specifically, the Madm-associated kinase was able to phosphorylate the RSXSXP motif of Mlf1. Phosphorylation of the comparable motif in Raf1 by the Madm-kinase complex indicates that Madm may act as a more global adaptor involved in phosphorylating other 14-3-3 interacting proteins. The extremely high degree of Madm conservation between mouse and human (98% identity) is noteworthy. In addition, Mlf1 shares 79% identity with the human homolog, and 14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved among all species (35Aitken A. Collinge D.B. van Heusden B.P. Isobe T. Roseboom P.H. Rosenfeld G. Soll J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 198-501Google Scholar). This may indicate that Madm-Mlf1–14-3-3ζ complexes serve evolutionarily conserved functions. The opposing effects of Madm and Mlf1 on M1 cell differentiation are significant. Whereas expression of exogenous Mlf1 potentiated M1 maturation (6Williams J.H. Daly L.N. Ingley E. Beaumont J.G. Tilbrook P.A. Lalonde J.-P. Stillitano J.P. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5559-5566Google Scholar), differentiation was inhibited when the level of Madm was raised only 50–80%. This modest increase in the concentration of Madm had a marked impact on the capacity of myeloid cells to mature and was contrary to the effects of Mlf1. As the dimerization domain of Madm overlapped with the Mlf1-binding region, altering the Madm/Mlf1 ratio is likely to affect complex formation between these proteins. The composition of these complexes may, in turn, dictate the progress of terminal differentiation. It is unlikely that these effects were solely due to gross mRNA overexpression because equivalent amounts of retroviral transcripts were detected in M1 cells expressing the vector alone (data not shown). Madm contains a bipartite NLS, as well as an NES. Confocal microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that Madm was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating it may shuttle between the compartments. It is interesting to note that Madm has a potential phosphorylation site within the NLS, which could possibly regulate transport to the nucleus as seen with IFI-16 (36Briggs L.J. Johnstone R.W. Elliot R.M. Xiao C.Y. Dawson M. Trapani J.A. Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 69-77Google Scholar) and APC (20Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Google Scholar). The presence of two nuclear receptor binding motifs introduces the tantalizing prospect of specific functions for Madm within the nucleus. There are several possible reasons for the leukemogenic actions of NPM-MLF1. One likely explanation is the inappropriate cellular compartment occupied by the fusion protein (1Yoneda-Kato N. Look A.T. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Raimondi S.C. Cohen K.J. Carroll A.J. Morris S.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 265-275Google Scholar, 32Yoneda-Kato N. Fukuhara S. Kato J.-Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3716-3724Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type Mlf1, NPM-MLF1 is found almost exclusively in the nucleus. Data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that NPM-MLF1 is unable to associate with 14-3-3ζ and that the C-terminal Madm-binding domain is compromised. These observations suggest that the NPM portion of the fusion protein sterically hinders 14-3-3 binding and interferes with the Madm interaction. As a consequence, NPM-MLF1 may not be sequestered in the cytoplasm and is transported into the nucleus by the NLS within NPM. We postulate that the two partner proteins of Mlf1 described in this study play a pivotal role in regulating its subcellular localization and potentially its function. Madm recruits a serine kinase that phosphorylates the RSXSXP motif of Mlf1, thereby promoting 14-3-3ζ binding. Complexes involving Mlf1, Madm, and 14-3-3ζ are likely to influence the distribution of these proteins in the cell and affect their ability to differentiate. We are grateful to Professor M. Berndt (Baker Medical Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia) for the generous gift of the anti-14-3-3ζ antibody."

We report here the inhibitory effect of RON on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cyclooxygenase (Cox)- 2 expression in mouse macrophages. In RON-expressing macrophages treated with macrophage stimulating protein, LPS-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was significantly reduced.

Transcriptional studies indicated that RON activation inhibits LPS-induced luciferase activity driven by the Cox-2 gene promoter. To determine whether RON activation affects LPS-induced NF-κB pathway, which is important for Cox-2 expression. Western blot analyses were performed showing that RON activation inhibits LPS-induced IκBα degradation. The decreased IκBα degradation was due to reduced IκBα phosphorylation at Ser-32 as determined by IκBα (Ser-32) phosphor-antibody. Moreover, we found that LPS-induced IKKβ activity, an enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of IκBα, was inhibited upon RON activation. Interestingly, these inhibitory effects were not regulated by RON-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. These results suggest that RON activation inhibits LPS-induced macrophage Cox-2 expression.

The partial disruption of the RON gene (knockout, RON−/+) significantly increases the inflammatory reactions in vivo after LPS challenge (23Correll P.H. Iwama A. Tondat S. Mayrhofer G. Suda T.

Machman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar, 27Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). One of them is PGE (28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 29Smith W.L. Gavavito R.M. Dewitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). The production of PGE depends on the activity of cyclooxygenases (Cox). Two isoforms of the Cox enzyme, Cox-1 and Cox-2, have been identified, and are coded by two distinct genes (28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 29Smith W.L. Gavavito R.M. Dewitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). Cox-1 is expressed constitutively in most types of cells and is involved in many physiological functions (28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar,30O'Neill G.P. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cox-2 is an inducible enzyme (24Muraoka R.S. Sun W.Y. Colbert M.C. Waltz S.E. Witte D., P. Degen J.L. Friezner Degen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Many inflammatory stimuli, including LPS are capable of inducing Cox-2 expression in different cell types, particularly in macrophages (24Muraoka R.S. Sun W.Y. Colbert M.C. Waltz S.E. Witte D., P. Degen J.L. Friezner Degen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Barrios-Rodiles M. Tiraloche G. Chadee K. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 963-969PubMed Google Scholar). Increased Cox-2 synthesis by tissue macrophages is responsible for the accumulation of large amounts of PGE in local tissues (28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Secreted PGE, especially PGE2, promotes inflammation by increasing vascular permeability and vasodilatation and by directing cell migration into the site of inflammation through the induction of inflammatory cytokines (24Muraoka R.S. Sun W.Y. Colbert M.C. Waltz S.E. Witte D., P. Degen J.L. Friezner Degen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Simon L.S. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106 (suppl.): 37S-42SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Clinically, increased PGE synthesis is associated with numerous pathophysiological conditions during inflammation (32Simon L.S. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106 (suppl.): 37S-42SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, controlling PGE synthesis is a critical element in regulating inflammatory reactions during bacterial infection, tissue injury, and autoimmune responses.The present studies were aimed at determining the effect of MSP-induced RON activation on LPS-induced Cox-2 expression in murine macrophages. At present, information related to the functions of MSP in regulating macrophage Cox-2 expression is not available. Because MSP inhibits LPS-induced macrophage NO production (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 4950-4959PubMed Google Scholar) and NO has the ability to regulate Cox-2 expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages (33Clancy R. Varenika B. Huang W. Ballou L. Attur M. Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Patel R. Attur M.G. Dave M. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4191-4197PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether MSP inhibits LPS-induced Cox-2 expression. The data presented in this study demonstrated that MSP is a potent inhibitor of the Cox-2 gene expression in macrophages stimulated with LPS.DISCUSSIONThe purposes of this investigation were to determine whether MSP-induced RON activation inhibits LPS-induced Cox-2 expression in macrophages and to study the potential mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect. MSP regulates macrophage functions through its stimulatory and inhibitory activities (43Leonard E.J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects include the RON-mediated inhibition of macrophage iNOS expression induced by LPS and inflammatory cytokines (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W. Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14027-14031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen Y.-Q. Fisher J.H. Wang M.-H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4950-4959PubMed Google Scholar). This effect is considered essential for RON attenuation of inflammatory reactions and septic shock induced by LPS and other agents in vivo(19Iwama A. Wang M.-H. Yamaguchi N. Ohno N. Okano K. Sudo T. Takeya M. Gervais F. Morissette C. Leonard E.J. Suda T. Blood. 1995; 86: 3394-3403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kurihara N Iwama A. Tatsumi J. Ikeda K. Suda T.

Dermatol. 1998; 111: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence showing that MSP-induced RON activation also inhibits LPS-induced Cox-2 expression and its associated PGE2 production in macrophages. As demonstrated by our results, RON activation inhibits LPS-induced PGE2production, reduces Cox-2 protein expression, blocks Cox-2 mRNA expression, and suppresses the transcriptional activation of the Cox-2 gene promoter. Moreover, our data demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of MSP is probably mediated by RON-transduced signals that inhibit LPS-stimulated signaling components that in turn activate the NF-κB pathway. We also show that LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα was inhibited upon MSP treatment. Moreover, MSP inhibits the kinase activity of IKKβ, which is the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of IκBα (40Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Because Cox-2 and associated PGE2 are critical in regulating inflammatory reactions (24Muraoka R.S. Sun W.Y. Colbert M.C. Waltz S.E. Witte D., P. Degen J.L. Friezner Degen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), the inhibition of Cox-2 expression upon RON activation may represent a novel mechanism by which MSP regulates inflammatory activities of macrophages during bacterial infection, tissue injury, and autoimmune responses.The inhibitory effects of MSP on LPS-induced production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages are largely unknown. To date, NO has been the only known inflammatory mediator reported to be inhibited by MSP in macrophages (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W. Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14027-14031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Smith W.L. Gavavito R.M. Dewitt D.L. J. Biol.

Previous studies demonstrated that MSP had no effect in vitro on LPS-induced production of cytokines such as MCP-1 (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W. Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14027-14031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo studies using RON knockout mice further demonstrated that the production of iNOS and NO by macrophages was significantly increased upon LPS challenge, however, LPS-induced IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 were not affected (23Correll P.H. Iwama A. Tondat S. Mayrhofer G. Suda T. Bernstein A. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 1-15Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Muraoka R.S. Sun W.Y. Colbert M.C. Waltz S.E. Witte D., P. Degen J.L.

Degen S.J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). From these in vitro and in vivo data, it was concluded that MSP is an endogenous factor that selectively inhibits LPS-induced iNOS synthesis, but not cytokine production (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W.

The present finding that RON activation inhibits Cox-2 expression proves that the inhibitory effect of MSP is not limited to LPS-induced iNOS and NO production. Cox-2 and PGE2 are also targets of MSP. The effects of MSP on iNOS and Cox-2 are particularly interesting with regard to biochemical and biological properties of these two proteins (28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 44Nussler A.K. Billar T.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Both proteins are inducible forms of enzymes that are not expressed in unactivated macrophages. After induction, both enzymes are continuously synthesized, which results in the production of a large amount of NO or PGE2 (28Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 44Nussler A.K. Billar T.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not know why MSP inhibits these two inducible forms of enzymes but has no affect on LPS-induced production of several cytokines such as MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6. Nevertheless, our results indicate that MSP could have broadly inhibitory activities on LPS-stimulated macrophages. Thus, it will be of interest in the future to use microarray techniques to analyze the inhibitory effect of MSP at global levels on LPS-induced gene expression in macrophages.MSP-induced inhibition of Cox-2 expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages seems to act at different levels. We have shown that expression of the Cox-2 protein is significantly inhibited as is evident by Western blot analysis. The levels of Cox-2 protein are only about 20% of those induced by LPS. The Cox-2 mRNA expression induced by LPS was also reduced, as determined by Northern blot techniques. Moreover, we demonstrated that in transient transfection experiments, the LPS-induced luciferase activities driven by the Cox-2 gene promoter were also reduced. We cannot exclude the possibility that MSP-induced RON activation transduces signals that may affect Cox-2 expression by increasing the degradation of the Cox-2 protein, reducing the stability of the Cox-2 mRNA, and blocking the Cox-2 gene promoter activity. Such inhibitory effects are very similar to those observed in MSP-mediated inhibition of iNOS expression (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W. Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol.

Correll P.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6606-6613PubMed Google Scholar). MSP suppresses iNOS protein expression, inhibits iNOS mRNA translation, and affects iNOS gene transcription (5Wang M.-H. Cox G.W.

It is likely that decreased Cox-2 expression at protein and mRNA levels is caused by the inhibition of Cox-2 gene promoter activity, which blocks Cox-2 gene transcription.Signaling pathways involved in LPS-induced Cox-2 expression have been studied extensively (37Wadleigh D.J.

It is now known that Cox-2 gene transcription is activated through different pathways, including the NF-κB pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, and others (34Patel R. Attur M.G. Dave M. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4191-4197PubMed Google Scholar,43Leonard E.J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 183-192PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nussler A.K. Billar T.R. J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These pathways act in unison to achieve the optimal levels of Cox-2 gene transcription activation. The roles of NF-κB pathways in LPS-induced Cox-2 expression are controversial. Studies of transcriptional activation of the Cox-2 gene promoter have indicated that the NF-κB-binding sites in the promoter regions are not required for the optimal Cox-2 reporter gene expression (34Patel R. Attur M.G. Dave M. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4191-4197PubMed Google Scholar). However, the majority of reports show that LPS-activated NF-κB is required for Cox-2 expression (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 45D'Acquisto F.

Commun. 1999; 263: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB is associated with increased Cox-2 expression (41Kojima M. Morisaki T. Izuhara K. Uchiyama A. Matsunari Y. Katano M. Tanaka M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1225-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Blocking NF-κB activities by chemical inhibitors such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate decreased Cox-2 expression (46Liu S.F., Ye, X. Malik A.B. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Suppression of NF-κB translocation to the nucleus by synthetic peptide inhibitors also blocks LPS-induced Cox-2 expression (47Pistritto G. Franzese O. Pozzoli G. Mancuso C. Tringali G. Preziosi P. Navarra P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recent studies further demonstrated that NF-κB cooperates with other transcription factors in induction of Cox-2 gene transcription (47Pistritto G. Franzese O. Pozzoli G. Mancuso C. Tringali G. Preziosi P. Navarra P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the NF-κB pathway is necessary and important in LPS-induced Cox-2 expression in macrophages.NF-κB activation is tightly regulated by inhibitor protein IκBs, (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε) that sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine residues in IκBs, particularly in IκBα, initiates polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBα, which releases NF-κB into the nucleus for DNA binding (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 40Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBα is mediated by the large IKK complex (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar,40Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). LPS is known to activate IKK, which phosphorylates IκBα (46Liu S.F., Ye, X. Malik A.B. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The IKK complex contains two closely related kinase subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and two accessory proteins, IKKγ and IKAP (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 40Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin.

Recent studies have shown that IKKβ is the kinase subunit responsible for the phosphorylation of IκBα in LPS-activated macrophages (48O'connell M.A. Bennett B.L. Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30410-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Previous studies have found that RON activation inhibits LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and its DNA-binding activity to NF-κB-binding sites (22Liu Q-P. Fruit K. Ward J. Correll P.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6606-6613PubMed Google Scholar). The data from our present study confirm these findings. We showed that MSP inhibits LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. We also found that IKKβ activity was significantly reduced as determined in the in vitro kinase assay. These results suggest that RON activation impairs LPS-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. Thus, the inhibition of NF-κB could be one of the mechanisms by which RON activation inhibits Cox-2 expression. Considering the fact that the blocking of NF-κB is also involved in RON-mediated inhibition of iNO"

The primary role of caspase-1 (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-converting enzyme, ICE protease) is to mediate immune and inflammatory reactions by catalyzing the maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18.

Sukhova G.K. Foster D. Kisiel W. Libby P. Schobeck U. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1535-1544Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-inflammatory action, PI-9 acts as an anti-apoptotic protein by inhibiting the serine protease, granzyme B (3Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Kumar S. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Google Scholar). Granzyme B is found in granules produced by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. CTLs and NK cells use perforin- and granzyme B-containing granules and the FAS mediated pathway to destroy neoplastic cells, or cells infected with intracellular pathogens (10Nagata S.

In target cells, granzyme B induces apoptosis in part by proteolytically cleaving several inactive pro-caspases and thereby converting them into their active forms (12Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B.

A recent study described a close correlation between the level of expression of PI-9 or its mouse orthologue, SPI-6, and the ability of several tumor cell lines to evade apoptosis mediated by CTL and NK cells. These data led the investigators to suggest a role for elevated expression of PI-9 in the ability of some tumors to evade immune attack (6Medema J.P. de Jong J. Pettenburg L.T.C. Verdegaal E.M.E.

Because PI-9 is likely to play an important role in modulating inflammation and apoptosis, the regulation of PI-9 gene expression is of particular interest. Previously, we showed that PI-9 is an estrogen-inducible gene in human liver and in HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells (8Kanamori H. Krieg S. Mao C. DiPippo V.A. Wang S. Zajchowski D.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5867-5873Google Scholar). PI-9 gene transcription is induced by binding of estrogen-estrogen receptor complex to a unique downstream estrogen-responsive unit (16Kreig S.A. Kreig A.J. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1971-1982Google Scholar). In the course of that work we identified a consensus activator protein-1 (AP-1) site at −308 and showed that deletion of the AP-1 site did not alter estrogen induction of PI-9. Here we report that further analysis of the PI-9 promoter region identifies three potential imperfect nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) sites. AP-1 and NF-κB are ubiquitous transcription factors and pleiotropic regulators of the inducible expression of numerous genes involved in the modulation of processes important in inflammatory and host defense events (17Zen K. Karsan A. Stempien-Otero A. Yee E. Tupper J., Li, X. Eunson T. Kay M.A. Wilson C.B. Winn R.K. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28808-28815Google Scholar, 18Koj A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 84-94Google Scholar). The AP-1 transcription factor is a heterodimer composed of members of the Fos, Jun, and Fra families of proto-oncogenes. In different cell and promoter contexts, AP-1 alters gene expression in response to growth factors, cytokines, oxidative stress, and phorbol esters (19Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Google Scholar, 20Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar, 21Johnson P.F. McNight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of the Rel family of proteins, p65 (Rel A), p50/p105, c-Rel, p52/100, and Rel B (21Johnson P.F. McNight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Google Scholar, 22Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by extracellular signals such as cytokines, phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and oxidative stress leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor, IκB, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA sites in the promoter regions of target genes, and activate their transcription (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 24Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goedder D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Google Scholar). The ability of PI-9 to modulate inflammatory and apoptotic events and the presence of putative NF-κB and AP-1 elements upstream of the PI-9 transcription initiation site led us to examine the ability of agents that modulate inflammation to regulate PI-9 gene expression. The pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, and other pro-inflammatory agents including LPS and TPA induced PI-9 mRNA and protein in liver cells. Using transient transfection of reporter gene constructs containing mutationally inactivated NF-κB and AP-1 sites, we found that the NF-κB sites at −135 and −88 and the AP-1 site at −308 are all necessary for efficient IL-1β induction of PI-9. Binding studies and gel shift assays showed that after treatment of the cells with IL-1β, c-Jun, JunD, and c-Fos bind to the AP-1 site. After IL-1β treatment, the p50/p65 NF-κB heterodimer binds to the two NF-κB sites. Using a construct derived from a cellular gene induced by estrogen and pro-inflammatory agents, we show that a pro-inflammatory agent (IL-1β) suppresses estrogen induction. Despite PI-9 anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β produced as a result of caspase-1 action was a potent inducer of PI-9 in several human cell lines. This study suggests a novel form of end-product regulation. IL-1β strongly induces PI-9, which in turn inhibits caspase-1, blocking the formation of additional active IL-1β. The full-length PI-9 promoter cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase gene in the plasmid pGL3-Basic (16Kreig S.A. Kreig A.J. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1971-1982Google Scholar) was used to generate mutations in the AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites. Mutations were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the presence of 1 m betaine (Sigma). In each case, the AP-1 or NF-κB sequences of the PI-9 promoter were mutated to a HindIII site. The ERU was mutated at the imperfect estrogen response element with a two-base change and at one of the consensus estrogen response element half sites by creating aHindIII site. The mutations in the ERU primer are underlined: 5′-CGGGGCGGACTGGCAGGACCCTGAAGCTTCCCTGCTCCCAGC-3′. All constructs were verified by sequencing using the BIG DYE terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Twenty-four hours before transfection, HepG2 cells (and HepG2ER7 cells, generously provided by Dr. D. Zajchowski (8Kanamori H. Krieg S. Mao C. DiPippo V.A. Wang S. Zajchowski D.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5867-5873Google Scholar)) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% charcoal dextran-treated fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transfections were carried out using calcium phosphate coprecipitation in 12-well plates with 50 ng of PI-9-luciferase construct, 15 ng of pRLSV40 (Promega, Madison, WI) as internal standard, and 1.9 μg of pTZ18U as carrier. In experiments using moxestrol, 25 ng of CMVhER was used. After 14–16 h, the transfected cells were shocked with 20% glycerol and placed in medium with or without mediators as indicated in the figure legends. In transient transfection experiments using pyrrolidine dithiobicarbamate (PDTC), HepG2 cells were treated with 240 μm PDTC. Cells were harvested and assayed using the dual-luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). HeLa cells were cultured under the same conditions as HepG2 cells. However, transfections were performed using Lipofectin Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following DNA concentrations: 50 ng of PI-9 promoter-luciferase construct, 10 ng of pRLSV40, and 0.3 μg of PTZ18U. Transfected cells were incubated with or without 5 ng/ml IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 h, and dual luciferase assays were performed. MCF-7 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Hanks' salts, 10 mm Hepes, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 540 ng of PI-9 promoter-luciferase construct, 10 ng of pRLSV40, and 0.8 μg of pTZ18U. After the addition of liposomes, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml IL-1β for 24 h before harvesting the cells. CHO-S cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000, with 25 ng of PI-9 promoter-luciferase construct, 10 ng of pRLSV40, and 0.8 μg of pTZ18U. Total RNA from HepG2ER7 cells and from Daudi cells (maintained in RPMI, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamate, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin) treated with TPA, IL-1β, or LPS for the indicated times (see Figs. 1 and 2) was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and treated with RNase-free DNase for 15 min at 37 °C followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, 5 μm random hexamer primers, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions at 37 °C for 1 h. A 1-μl aliquot of the reverse transcription reaction was used for thermocycling. Each PCR reaction contained 12.5 μl of 2× Taqman master mix (PE Biosysytems, Foster City, CA), 300 nm forward and reverse primers, and 200 nm PI-9 probe (5′-fam-catacacaagggaaatgccctttaaaataaacca-tamra-3′) (fam, 6-carboxyfluorescein; tamra, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) in 25 μl of total volume. For the internal control, 18 S rRNA was used containing both control primers and probe (PE Biosystems, Foster city, CA). Detection and data analysis were carried out on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system.Figure 2TNF-α and TPA induce PI-9 expression. A, HepG2 cells were transfected with our native human PI-9 promoter (−1482 to +314)-luciferase construct (16Kreig S.A. Kreig A.J. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1971-1982Google Scholar) with the indicated concentrations of TNF-α for 24 h and then assayed for luciferase activity. Fold induction represents the increase in luciferase activity in response to TNF-α with the vehicle-treated sample (0.1% BSA) set equal to 1. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate transfections. B, HepG2ER7 were treated at the indicated times with 20 nmTPA. RNA was isolated from HepG2ER7 and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins from TPA-treated HepG2ER7 cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using polyclonal antibody to recombinant PI-9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred using the trans-blot semi-dry transfer cell (Fisher) at 15 V for 15 min. The membrane was blocked overnight with 3% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween followed by a 1-h incubation with the primary PI-9 polyclonal antibody diluted 1:2,000 in 1% nonfat milk and 0.2% Tween in phosphate-buffered saline. After a 15-min wash (PBS with 0.05% Tween), the membrane was incubated for 1 h with the secondary goat-anti rabbit antibody diluted at 1:10,000. Following a 1-h wash, antigen-antibody complexes were detected using West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Nuclear extract from HepG2 cells was prepared as described previously (25Andrews N.C. Faller D.V Nucleic Acids Research. 1991; 19: 2499Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected after centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin and kept on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and vortexed for 10 s, and the nuclear pellet was recovered after centrifugation at 13, 000 × g for 10 s at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin and incubated on ice for 20 min with shaking. Nuclear extract was retained after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). To measure AP-1 or NF-κB activation and their interaction with sites of the PI-9 promoter, competition experiments were performed using the Trans-AM AP-1 c-Jun and NF-κB p50 kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, an oligonucleotide containing either a consensus AP-1 or NF-κB site immobilized on a 96-well plate was incubated with 5 μg of untreated or 1.5 h of IL-1β (5 ng/ml)-treated HepG2 nuclear extract in the presence of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing as competitor either an AP-1 or NF-κB site from the PI-9 promoter or a mutated version of the site. Binding specificity was tested in competition assays using a 60-fold excess of either the AP-1 or the NF-κB site from the PI-9 promoter or its respective mutated site. Antibody specific to either c-Jun or p65 was added followed by the addition of a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. c-Jun and p65 activation was measured at 450 nm. The AP-1 and NF-κB sites of the PI-9 promoter used as competitors were: AP-1 (−317 to −297), 5′-ccgtgtgactcagtgtctctt-3′; NF-κB (−144 to −121), 5′-tggttctaagtgaatcccccatat-3′; NF-κB (−97 to −74), 5′-agacccatgggaccttcccactgg-3′. The mutated AP-1 and NF-κB sequences used as competitors were 5′-cgcttgaggagtcggccggaa-3′ and 5′-agttgaggccactttcccaggc-3′, respectively. Double-stranded oligonucleotides of the same AP-1 and NF-κB sites used in the transcription factor binding assays were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Gel supershift assays were carried out by incubating 20 μg of nuclear extract from HepG2 cells in 10 mm Hepes, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6 μg of BSA on ice for 15 min. A total of 50, 000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe was then added, and the binding reaction (20 μl) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After binding, 4 μg of antibody was added and incubated for 1 h on ice. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) except for the p50 and c-Fos antibody purchased from Calbiochem and Geneka (Montreal, Québec), respectively. Previously we identified a consensus AP-1 site at −308 of the PI-9 promoter region (16Kreig S.A. Kreig A.J. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1971-1982Google Scholar). We examined the PI-9 promoter for other transcription factor binding sites potentially involved in controlling PI-9 gene expression. Three potential NF-κB sites at −1078, −135 and −88 were identified (Fig. 1 A). The site at −135 differs from the consensus NF-κB binding sequence by 1 nucleotide, whereas the other 2 sites differ from the consensus NF-κB sequence by 2 nucleotides. Because pro-inflammatory agents regulate the expression of many genes involved in inflammatory processes through AP-1 and NF-κB proteins (26Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Google Scholar, 27Ni A. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2784-2791Google Scholar, 28Kordula T. Bugno M. Rydel R.E. Travis J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22201-22208Google Scholar), we tested the ability of the pro-inflammatory agents IL-1β and LPS to induce expression of the native cellular PI-9 gene and protein in an estrogen receptor-positive clone (HepG2ER7 (8Kanamori H. Krieg S. Mao C. DiPippo V.A. Wang S. Zajchowski D.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5867-5873Google Scholar)) of HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells and in a well studied B cell line, Daudi cells. Using quantitative real-time PCR to measure PI-9 mRNA levels, IL-1β induced cellular PI-9 mRNA in HepG2ER7 cells by ∼6-fold (Fig. 1 B). We previously used Northern blot analysis to show that estrogen induction of PI-9 mRNA is rapid, and PI-9 mRNA levels remain elevated for at least 1 day (8Kanamori H. Krieg S. Mao C. DiPippo V.A. Wang S. Zajchowski D.A. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5867-5873Google Scholar). Induction of PI-9 mRNA by IL-1β also was rapid, with a 4–5-fold induction in 4 h. Induction was maximal at ∼6-fold at 8 h, and PI-9 mRNA remained fully induced through the 24 h of the experiment (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis showed that IL-1β induced PI-9 protein within 4 h and that PI-9 levels remained elevated for at least 48 h (Fig.1 B). Cells of the immune system contain high levels of PI-9 (3Bird C.H. Sutton V.R. Sun J. Hirst C.E. Novak A. Kumar S. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6387-6398Google Scholar, 31Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B., De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Google Scholar). To determine whether the cellular PI-9 gene was still inducible in these cells, we looked at the ability of the widely studied pro-inflammatory agent, LPS, to induce PI-9 in a well studied B cell line, Daudi cells. LPS activation of caspase-1 leads to IL-1β secretion in several systems (32Schumann R.R. Belka C. Reuter D. Lamping N. Kirschning C.J. Weber J.R. Pfeil D. Blood. 1998; 91: 577-584Google Scholar, 33Puren A.J. Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2256-2261Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether this important pro-inflammatory agent would elicit induction of the anti-inflammatory protein, PI-9. LPS treatment of Daudi cells elicited a progressive induction of PI-9 mRNA, which increased in level throughout the 24 h of the experiment (Fig. 1 C). LPS induced PI-9 mRNA >7-fold and strongly induced PI-9 protein (Fig.1 C). Thus, a rapid and robust induction of PI-9 mRNA and protein is elicited by the pro-inflammatory agents, IL-1β and LPS. We further analyzed induction of PI-9 by another pro-inflammatory agent that often acts through AP-1 and NF-κB sites, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with a construct containing the PI-9 promoter region, driving the expression of a luciferase reporter gene (16Kreig S.A. Kreig A.J. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1971-1982Google Scholar), and exposed to varying concentrations of TNF-α. TNF-α elicited a concentration-dependent 4–5-fold increase in PI-9 promoter activity, with induction reaching a plateau at 5 ng/ml TNF-α (Fig.2 A). LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α are all agents related to inflammatory processes. It was of interest to determine whether a different class of regulatory agents known to work through AP-1 and NF-κB sites could also regulate PI-9 expression. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the phorbol ester, TPA, a well known tumor promoter, induced PI-9 mRNA ∼7-fold and strongly induced PI-9 protein in HepG2ER7 cells (Fig.2 B). These data demonstrate that cellular PI-9 gene expression is regulated by diverse agents known to act through NF-κB and AP-1 sites. To characterize the roles of the three putative NF-κB sites and of the AP-1 site in induction of PI-9 gene expression, we constructed a series of plasmids containing mutations that inactivate the AP-1 and NF-κB sites. We transiently transfected the PI-9 promoter constructs into HepG2 cells and examined the ability of IL-1β (at 5 ng/ml) to induce PI-9 expression (Fig. 3). Because none of the mutant promoters we tested exhibited increased basal expression of PI-9 (data not shown), a reduced fold induction by a transfected mutant promoter is due to less IL-1β-induced expression than is seen with the wild-type promoter. Mutational ablation of the putative NF-κB element at −1078 had a minimal effect on IL-1β induction, indicating that this element does not play a significant role in IL-1β regulation of PI-9. In contrast, mutational ablation of the putative NF-κB sites at either −135 or at −88 reduced IL-1β induction of PI-9 by ∼60%. Mutation of both of the proximal NF-κB sites resulted in a modest further reduction of the IL-1β response. The effect of mutational inactivation of the AP-1 site at −308 was similar to the effect of mutating individual NF-κB sites, with PI-9 expression reduced by ∼55% relative to the wild-type promoter. These data indicate that the two proximal imperfect NF-κB elements and the consensus AP-1 site all contribute to IL-1β induction of PI-9 gene expression. Mutational inactivation of both NF-κB sites and the AP-1 site completely abolished IL-1β induction and reduced basal PI-9 promoter activity to extremely low levels (Fig. 3). Consistent with a role for both the proximal NF-κB sites and the AP-1 site in IL-1β induction of PI-9, the inhibitor of IκB degradation, pyrrolidine dithiobicarbamate, suppressed IL-1β inducibility of PI-9 by ∼60% but did not completely abolish induction (data not shown). To test whether proteins in nuclear extracts from IL-1β-induced HepG2 cells exhibit enhanced interaction with the AP-1 and NF-κB sites in the 5′-flanking region of the PI-9 promoter, we used a quantitative antibody-based assay to detect and quantify binding by c-Jun and p65, members of the AP-1 and NF-"

PDZ domains are composed of short sequences (80–100 amino acids) that have been implicated in a range of protein:protein interactions. The PDZ-like domain of Tsp may be involved in binding to the extreme COOH-terminal sequence of its substrate, whereas the HtrA PDZ domains are involved in subunit assembly and are predicted to be responsible for substrate binding and subsequent translocation into the active site. E. coli has a system of protein quality control surveillance mediated by the ssrA-encoded peptide tagging system. This system tags misfolded proteins or protein fragments with an 11-amino acid peptide that is recognized by a battery of cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteases as a degradation signal. Here we show that both HtrA and Tsp are able to recognize the ssrA-encoded peptide tag with apparent K D values of ∼5 and 390 nm, respectively, and that their PDZ-like domains mediate this recognition. Fusion of the ssrA-encoded peptide tag to the COOH terminus of a heterologous protein (glutathioneS-transferase) renders it sensitive to digestion by Tsp but not HtrA. These observations support the prediction that the HtrA PDZ domains facilitate substrate binding and the differential proteolytic responses of HtrA and Tsp to SsrA-tagged glutathioneS-transferase are interpreted in terms of the structure of HtrA.

This system uses a series of proteases to target misfolded or damaged proteins by recognition of an 11-amino acid peptide tag, which is added to the COOH terminus by a mechanism that requires thessrA-encoded RNA. The ssrA RNA has 363 nucleotides and can form a tRNA-like structure that is chargeable with alanine. In a model proposed by Keiler et al. (1Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Papayannopoulos I.A.

After the contribution of the ssrA-encoded alanine, translation switches to a short open reading frame in ssrA that encodes the COOH-terminal peptide tag degradation signal.

The wild-type repressor domain, which is not degraded, contains the polar COOH-terminal sequence Arg-Ser-Glu-Tyr-Glu, whereas the variant repressor protein contains the apolar sequence Trp-Val-Ala-Ala-Ala, and it is this that allows degradation by Tsp (1Keiler K.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and was originally identified as a heat shock-induced protein. It is located on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane and has the conserved triad of His, Ser, and Asp residues that is characteristic of the serine proteases. Homologues of HtrA have been found in a wide range of species including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast, and humans. A natural substrate for HtrA is the periplasmic MalS protein, but HtrA is also able to use β-casein as a proteolytic substrate in vitro as the latter is largely unordered in solution (11Hu S.I.

At low temperatures HtrA acts predominantly as a chaperone and in vitro is able to stimulate the refolding of chemically denatured proteins. The proteolytic activity associated with HtrA predominates at high temperatures. Null mutants in the htrA gene are thermosensitive and have a decreased ability to degrade abnormal periplasmic proteins. A mutant form of HtrA in which Ser210has been changed to Ala is correctly folded but proteolytically inactive, and has a reduced ability to suppress the thermosensitive phenotype in a strain deleted for the wild-type htrA gene. These observations link the loss of proteolytic activity with the thermosensitive phenotype (13Lipinska B. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J.

Transcription of the htrA gene is highly regulated by a complex interaction with inner membrane proteins and a more global system of phosphoprotein phosphatases (22Missiakas D. Raina S. Trends Biochem.

Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). HtrA monomers are composed of three domains, an NH2-terminal protease/chaperonin domain and two PDZ1 domains (PDZ1 and 2). PDZ domains are composed typically of 80–100 amino acids and have been reported in many proteins involved in a range of protein:protein interactions. The acronym PDZ derives from three eukaryotic proteins (post-synaptic density (PSD) protein,disc large and zo-1 (zonula occludens)) in which they were first described (24Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In the HtrA multimer, 12 PDZ domains form mobile side walls, with PDZ1 domains interacting with one another suggesting they function as the main gatekeeper to the inner chamber (23Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Tsp contains a single PDZ-like domain (1Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Papayannopoulos I.A. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and is a member of a family of proteases (clan SF, family 41; Ref. 25Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Hopsu-Havu V.K. Jarvinen M. Kirscke H. Proteolysis in Cell Functions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1997: 13-21Google Scholar) that includes the Scenedesmus obliquus D1 COOH-terminal processing protease (D1P). The structure of the S. obliquusD1P has been determined, and its β-domain shows a high degree of similarity at the secondary and tertiary structural level with the PDZ domains of the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor gene product (D1gA), nitric-oxide synthase, and the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (26Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Liao D.I. Qian J. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that the PDZ domains of HtrA are also involved in substrate binding, thereby directly coupling substrate binding and translocation within the HtrA multimer. It is speculated that this coupled binding and translocation may be facilitated by the PDZ domains acting as tentacular arms capturing substrates and transferring them into the inner cavity (23Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).To address the prediction that the HtrA PDZ domains facilitate substrate binding, we tested the ability of HtrA and a protease (Tsp) with no chaperonin activity to bind to the ssrA-encoded peptide. Here we show that Tsp and HtrA bind to the isolatedssrA-encoded peptide via their PDZ-like domains. Tsp and HtrA bind the SsrA peptide with different affinities (K D for Tsp = 390 nm;K D for HtrA = 4.9 nm) and fusion of this peptide to the GST protein enhances proteolysis by Tsp but not HtrA. Escherichia coli has a system of quality control surveillance monitoring proteins located in the cytoplasm and periplasm. This system uses a series of proteases to target misfolded or damaged proteins by recognition of an 11-amino acid peptide tag, which is added to the COOH terminus by a mechanism that requires thessrA-encoded RNA. The ssrA RNA has 363 nucleotides and can form a tRNA-like structure that is chargeable with alanine. In a model proposed by Keiler et al. (1Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Papayannopoulos I.A. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), SsrA charged with alanine can bind to stalled ribosomes. After the contribution of the ssrA-encoded alanine, translation switches to a short open reading frame in ssrA that encodes the COOH-terminal peptide tag degradation signal. This system provides a general quality control mechanism to dispose of incomplete protein fragments and avoid the build-up of ribosomes stalled on defective mRNA molecules (2Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J.

Cytoplasmic proteases that respond to this system are largely ATP-dependent (e.g. the ClpXP and ClpAP proteases) whereas SsrA-tagged proteins with signal sequences are directed to the periplasm and degraded there by ATP-independent proteases. Tsp is a periplasmic serine protease of E. coli that was purified on the basis of its ability to degrade a variant of the NH2-terminal domain of the bacteriophage lambda repressor. The wild-type repressor domain, which is not degraded, contains the polar COOH-terminal sequence Arg-Ser-Glu-Tyr-Glu, whereas the variant repressor protein contains the apolar sequence Trp-Val-Ala-Ala-Ala, and it is this that allows degradation by Tsp (1Keiler K.C.

A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Tsp preferentially degrades substrates that are not stably folded, by digestion at several sites that have broad primary sequence specificity (1Keiler K.C. Silber K.R. Downard K.M. Papayannopoulos I.A. Biemann K. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tsp is thought to bind to the COOH terminus of the protein in question, with no proteolysis occurring until spontaneous unfolding makes the polypeptide available to the protease active site (2Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2589-2593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). HtrA (also known as DegP) is a second periplasmic protease of E. coli, which can also act as a chaperone (11Hu S.I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and was originally identified as a heat shock-induced protein. It is located on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane and has the conserved triad of His, Ser, and Asp residues that is characteristic of the serine proteases. Homologues of HtrA have been found in a wide range of species including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast, and humans. A natural substrate for HtrA is the periplasmic MalS protein, but HtrA is also able to use β-casein as a proteolytic substrate in vitro as the latter is largely unordered in solution (11Hu S.I. Carozza M. Klein M. Nantermet P. Luk D. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34406-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Pallen M.J. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). At low temperatures HtrA acts predominantly as a chaperone and in vitro is able to stimulate the refolding of chemically denatured proteins. The proteolytic activity associated with HtrA predominates at high temperatures. Null mutants in the htrA gene are thermosensitive and have a decreased ability to degrade abnormal periplasmic proteins. A mutant form of HtrA in which Ser210has been changed to Ala is correctly folded but proteolytically inactive, and has a reduced ability to suppress the thermosensitive phenotype in a strain deleted for the wild-type htrA gene. These observations link the loss of proteolytic activity with the thermosensitive phenotype (13Lipinska B. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Transcription of the htrA gene is highly regulated by a complex interaction with inner membrane proteins and a more global system of phosphoprotein phosphatases (22Missiakas D. Raina S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 59-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a protease-deficient mutant HtrA has been determined, and is a hexamer formed by staggered association of trimeric rings; the proteolytic sites are located in a central cavity that is only accessible laterally (23Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2088402706,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein γ (C/EBPγ) is an ubiquitously expressed member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors that has been shown to be an inhibitor of C/EBP transcriptional activators and has been proposed to act as a buffer against C/EBP-mediated activation. We have now unexpectedly found that C/EBPγ dramatically augments the activity of C/EBPβ in lipopolysaccharide induction of the interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 promoters in a B lymphoblast cell line. This activating role for C/EBPγ is promoter-specific, neither being observed in the regulation of a simple C/EBP-dependent promoter nor the TNFαpromoter.

These findings suggest a unique role for C/EBPγ in B cell gene regulation and, along with our previous observation of the ability of C/EBP basic region-leucine zipper domains to confer lipopolysaccharide inducibility of interleukin-6, suggest that the C/EBP leucine zipper domain has a role in C/EBP function beyond allowing dimerization between C/EBP family members.

Williams S.C. Yaniv M. Tronche F. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). These proteins dimerize through their leucine zippers and bind to DNA through their adjacent basic regions. C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε can activate in vivo transcription from promoters that contain a consensus binding site: 5′-T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G)-3′ (2Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). At this time, the reported in vitro binding activities of C/EBPα, β, γ, δ, and ε are nearly identical, but the variety of C/EBP isoforms and their potential for heterodimer formation could provide a large repertoire of transcription factors with complex in vivo regulatory features. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have been implicated in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines as well as other gene products associated with the activation of macrophages and the acute phase inflammatory response (reviewed in Ref. 3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). For example, the promoter regions of the genes for interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, lysozyme, hemopexin, haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein, serum amyloid A1, A2, A3, complement C3, and C-reactive protein all contain C/EBP binding motifs (3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have both been shown to activate a reporter gene controlled by the IL-6 promoter in transient expression assays (2Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S.

We have previously demonstrated that the stable expression of C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε in a B lymphoblast cell line is sufficient to confer lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inducibility of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) expression (5Bretz J.D.

The basis for this redundancy among C/EBP isoforms lies with the requirement of only the well-conserved C/EBP bZIP domain for this activity (8Hu H.-M. Tian Q. Baer M. Spooner C.J. Williams S.C.

We have found that C/EBPβ is overwhelmingly present as a heterodimer with C/EBPγ in B lymphoblasts dependent upon C/EBPβ for LPS-induced IL-6 expression (8Hu H.-M. Tian Q. Baer M. Spooner C.J.

C/EBPγ is most highly expressed in immature B cells, although its expression is rather ubiquitous (9Parkin S. Baer M. Copeland T.D. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Its binding specificity is similar to that of other C/EBP family members (10Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but it has a truncated structure. C/EBPγ lacks known activation domains and is essentially a C/EBP bZIP domain (11Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consistent with this structure, it has been shown to inhibit C/EBP transcriptional activators (9Parkin S. Baer M. Copeland T.D. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23563-23572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to act as a “buffer” for C/EBP activators (11Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4371-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this model, C/EBPγ prevents the activation of C/EBP-dependent gene expression under conditions where the abundance of classical C/EBP activators is low. Activation of C/EBP-dependent genes would occur only when the abundance of C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε exceeded a threshold. It has been proposed that the predominance of C/EBPγ over C/EBPβ in early B cells prevents transcription of C/EBP-dependent genes, whereas increased expression of C/EBPβ in mature cells, or in cells stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines or LPS, is permissive for expression (12Cooper C.L. Berrier A.L. Roman C. Calame K.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5049-5058PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to the notion of C/EBPγ as an inhibitor, there have been studies suggesting an activation function for C/EBPγ. An activating role for C/EBPγ has been reported in transcription from immunoglobulin heavy chain promoters (13Cooper C. Johnson D. Roman C. Avitahl N. Tucker P. Calame K.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3225-3231PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pan Q. Petit-Frere C. Stavnezer J. Hammarstrom L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C/EBPγ has also been implicated in β-globin (15Wall L. Destroimaisons N. Delvoye N. Guy L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16477-16484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and pp52 (16Omori S.A. Smale S. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Wall R. J. Immunol. 1998; 159: 1800-1808Google Scholar) gene expression. Whether C/EBPγ functions as an activator or an inhibitor, both its lack of expression and overexpression have consequences in vivo. C/EBPγ-deficient mice have defects in natural killer cell cytotoxic activity and interferon γ production (17Kaisho T. Tsutsui H. Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Kawai T. Yoshida N. Nakanishi K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moderate erythroid overexpression of C/EBPγ in transgenic mice increases γ-globin expression relative to β-globin, while high level expression blocks erythropoiesis (18Zafarana G. Rottier R. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5856-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that heterodimers between C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ predominate in lymphoblasts dependent upon C/EBPβ for LPS-induced IL-6 expression (8Hu H.-M. Tian Q. Baer M. Spooner C.J. Williams S.C.

Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23563-23572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), led us to further explore the role of C/EBPγ in regulating IL-6 transcription. In this report, we have unexpectedly found that C/EBPγ dramatically augments the activity of C/EBPβ in LPS induction of IL-6 in a B lymphoblast cell line. This activating role for C/EBPγ is promoter-specific, being observed for the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters, but neither for a simple C/EBP-dependent promoter nor theTNFα promoter. C/EBPγ activity also shows cell type-specificity, with stimulatory activity in a B lymphoblast and no effect in a macrophage cell line. Studies with chimeric C/EBP proteins implicated the formation of a heterodimeric leucine zipper between C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ as the critical structural feature required for C/EBPγ stimulatory activity. Our current findings suggest a unique role for C/EBPγ in B cell gene regulation and, along with our previous observation of the ability of C/EBP bZIP domains to confer LPS inducibility of IL-6, suggest that the C/EBP leucine zipper domain has a role in C/EBP function beyond allowing dimerization between C/EBP family members. P388 cells are murine B lymphoblasts (19Bauer S.R. Holmes K.L. Morse III H.C. Potter M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4695-4699PubMed Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection; CCL 46). P388-Cβ cells and P388-Neo cells have been described previously by Hu et al.(6Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). WEHI-231 cells are murine B cells (20Gutman G.A. Warner N.L. Harris A.W. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1981; 18: 230-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection; CRL 1702). P388D1(IL1) cells are macrophages (19Bauer S.R. Holmes K.L. Morse III H.C. Potter M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4695-4699PubMed Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection; TIB 63). P388 cells and their derivatives were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. WEHI-231 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. P388D1(IL1) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All IL-6 inductions were conducted with LPS derived from Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5 (Sigma) added to 10 μg/ml. Transient transfections were conducted with 2 × 106 cells, 4 μg of DNA, and 8 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) in 1.2 ml of Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen). The DNA was comprised of 1 μg of a promoter-reporter, C/EBP expression vector, and pMEX plasmid to total 4 μg. The quantities of C/EBP expression vectors are as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were incubated in the transfection mixture for 5 h followed by the addition of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented to 15% with fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the medium of certain transfections was supplemented with 10 μg/ml LPS. After 4 h in the presence or absence of LPS, transfected cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed for luciferase activity by using the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and for β-galactosidase activity by using the Luminescent β-galactosidase Genetic Reporter System II (Clontech). For transient transfections, C/EBPs were expressed from pMEX (21Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), which utilizes the Moloney murine sarcoma virus promoter. NF-κB p65 was expressed form pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), which utilizes the cytomegalovirus promoter (from N. Rice, NCI-Frederick). C/EBPβ-GCNLZ has been described previously (22Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). C/EBPγ-ΔNco was constructed by religating pMEX-C/EBPγ after restriction digestion with NcoI. C/EBPγ-βLZ was constructed by introducing anXhoI site at nucleotide position 283 in the C/EBPγ gene by site-directed mutagenesis. The XhoI-HindIII fragment bearing the leucine zipper was removed from this pMEX-C/EBPγ plasmid and replaced with an analogous fragment (nucleotides 703–831) from a rat C/EBPβ vector in which an XhoI site had been inserted between the basic region and leucine zipper. The forms of C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ used in this manuscript are depicted in Fig.1. The IL-6 promoter-reporter consists of the murine IL-6promoter (23Tanabe O. Akira S. Kamiya T. Wong G.G. Hirano T.

DEI4(−35alb)LUC (21Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) is also derived from pXP2 (24Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) and contains four copies of the DEI element upstream of the albumin minimal promoter. The TNFα promoter-reporter contains sequences extending to −1260 of the TNFα promoter inserted into the luciferase vector, pXP1 (23Tanabe O. Akira S. Kamiya T. Wong G.G. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J.

The SV40 early promoter-reporter is a commercial product, pβgal-Control (Clontech), where the SV40 early promoter and enhancer sequences are cloned upstream and downstream, respectively, of the lacZ gene. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNAs were electrophoresed through 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels. Transfers to membranes were hybridized and washed to high stringency in 40 mm sodium phosphate/1% SDS/1 mm EDTA at 65 °C. Hybridization probes were prepared with a random priming kit (Invitrogen) with the incorporation of 5′-[α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The IL-6 probe was a 0.65 kb murine cDNA (from N. Jenkins and N. Copeland, NCI-Frederick). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was a 1.3 kb rat cDNA (28Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M., El Salrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur J. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described below. The extracts (50 μg) were adjusted to 1× Laemmli sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar) and processed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to Protran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (AmershamBiosciences). Nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 15 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 20 s at 4 °C. Proteins were extracted from nuclei by incubation at 4 °C with vigorous vortexing in buffer C (420 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant extract was collected and stored at −70 °C. The EMSA probes were double-stranded oligonucleotides containing an optimal C/EBP binding site (5′-GATCCTAGATATCCCTGATTGCGCAATAGGCTCAAAGCTG-3′ annealed with 5′-AATTCAGCTTTGAGCCTATTGCGCAATCAGGGATATCTAG-3′), a murine IL-6 C/EBP binding site (5′-CTAAACGACGTCACATTGTGCAATCTTAATAAGGTT-3′ annealed with 5′-TGGAAACCTTATTAAGATTGCACAATGTGACGTCGT-3′), and a murine albumin DEI binding site (5′-TCGACTATGATTTTGTAATGGGGC-3′ annealed with 5′-TCGAGCCCCATTACAAAATCATAG-3′). These probes were labeled with the incorporation of 5′-[α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Klenow DNA polymerase. Underlined sequences correspond to the C/EBP binding motifs. DNA binding reactions were performed at room temperature in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 6 μl of nuclear extract (1 mg/ml in buffer C) and 5 μl of 5× binding buffer (20% (w/v) Ficoll, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol). The remainder of the reaction mixture contained KCl to a final concentration of 50 mm, Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.1%, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 200 pg of probe (unless otherwise noted), bromphenol blue to a final concentration of 0.06% (w/v), and water to volume. For supershifts, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the binding reaction. Samples were electrophoresed through 5.5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 160 V. Rabbit antibodies specific to the carboxyl terminus of C/EBPγ and the amino terminus of C/EBPγ were prepared against synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequences (9Parkin S. Baer M. Copeland T.D. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23563-23572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-C/EBPα (14AA), rabbit anti-C/EBPβ specific to the carboxyl terminus (C-19), rabbit anti-C/EBPδ (C-22), rabbit anti-C/EBPε (C-22) and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-C/EBPβ specific to the amino terminus has been described (21Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we found C/EBPβ to be predominantly in heterodimers with C/EBPγ in P388 B cells that are dependent upon transfected C/EBPβ expression for LPS induction of IL-6 and MCP-1 (Refs. 8Hu H.-M.

We also found both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ to be in heterodimers with C/EBPγ in WEHI-231, a B cell line that has been used in several studies of IL-6 expression (30Hobbs M.V. McEvilly R.J. Koch R.J.

In order to further test the entry of C/EBPβ into C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers, a C/EBPβ expression vector was transiently transfected into P388 cells over a range of quantities, including those that effectively transactivated the IL-6promoter following LPS stimulation (see Fig.3 A). EMSA of nuclear extracts of the transfected cells revealed that C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers were the predominant binding species at all quantities tested (Fig.3 C). Apparently, C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers formed at the expense of C/EBPγ homodimers at lower quantities of vector (Fig.3 C; 0.5, 1, 2 μg). C/EBPβ homodimers were observed only at higher vector quantities, where C/EBPγ homodimers were no longer observable (Fig. 3 C; 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 μg). The fact that the major C/EBP species observed with LPS-stimulation were C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers is inconsistent with an inhibitory role for C/EBPγ in the LPS induction of IL-6 expression.Figure 3C/EBP β is a more potent activator of LPS-induced IL-6 transcription under conditions of added C/EBP γ expression, and C/EBP γ stimulates LPS-inducedIL-6 transcription when expressed with C/EBP β. Furthermore, C/EBPβ preferentially forms heterodimers with C/EBPγ. A, transient transfections were carried out in duplicate with (+gamma) and without (−gamma) 0.5 μg of C/EBPγ vector, with the microgram quantities of C/EBPβ vector and LPS treatment as indicated. Luminometer values were normalized for expression from a co-transfected SV40 early promoter β-galactosidase reporter. These values were then normalized to a relative value of 1 for cells receiving neither a C/EBP expression vector nor LPS. The data presented are the mean of three experiments ± S.E. B, transient transfections of P388 cells were carried out in duplicate with microgram quantities of expression vectors and LPS treatment as indicated. Luminometer values were normalized for expression from a cotransfected SV40 early promoter-β-galactosidase reporter. These values were then normalized to a relative value of 1 for the cells receiving C/EBPβ expression vector and treated with LPS. The data presented are the mean of seven experiments ± S.E. C, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts of P388 cells transiently transfected with increasing quantities (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 μg) of pMEX-C/EBPβ. The EMSA of the 12-μg transfectants also was performed with binding reactions that included normal rabbit IgG (N), carboxyl terminus-specific anti-C/EBPβ (β), or carboxyl terminus-specific anti-C/EBPγ (γ). Arrows labeled β:β, β:γ, and γ:γ indicate the positions of C/EBP·DNA complexes.Arrows on the right also indicate supershifts. The C/EBPβ·β complex is supershifted by only C/EBPβ-specific antibody, the C/EBPγ·γ complex by only C/EBPγ-specific antibody, and the C/EBPβ·γ complex by both C/EBPβ-specific and C/EBPγ-specific antibodies. A weak, nonspecific background species co-migrating with C/EBPβ·γ is evident in the 0-μg lane. D, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts of P388 cells transiently transfected with pMEX control vector, 0.25 μg of pMEX-C/EBPβ, and 0.25 μg of pMEX-C/EBPβ with increasing quantities (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μg) of pMEX-C/EBPγ. The EMSA of the 4-μg pMEX-C/EBPγ transfectants also was performed with binding reactions that included normal rabbit IgG (N), carboxyl terminus-specific anti-C/EBPβ (β), or carboxyl terminus-specific anti-C/EBPγ (γ). Arrows labeled β:γ and γ:γ indicate the positions of C/EBP·DNA complexes.Arrows on the right also indicate supershifts. The C/EBPγ·γ complex is supershifted by only C/EBPγ-specific antibody and the C/EBPβ·γ complex by both C/EBPβ-specific and C/EBPγ-specific antibodies. Two unidentified slower migrating species that are not modulated by transfection and are reactive with C/EBPγ-specific antibody are evident in control and experimental lanes. E, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts of P388 cells transiently transfected with pMEX control vector, 2 μg of pMEX-C/EBPβ, or 2 μg of pMEX-C/EBPβ plus 0.5 μg pMEX-C/EBPγ.Arrows labeled β:β, β:γ, and γ:γ indicate the positions of C/EBP·DNA complexes. The radioactivity associated with C/EBPβ homodimers and C/EBPβ·γ heterodimers was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the ratio of C/EBPβ·γ to C/EBPβ·β is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C/EBPγ by itself is clearly not an activator of theIL-6 promoter because its presence in P388 cells is not sufficient to allow LPS induction of IL-6. However, our observations suggested that C/EBPγ-containing heterodimers might activate theIL-6 promoter in LPS-stimulated cells. To test this notion, we performed transient transfections of increasing quantities of C/EBPβ vector with and without added expression of C/EBPγ (Fig.3 A). C/EBPγ augmented LPS-induced expression from theIL-6 promoter at all quantities of C/EBPβ expression vector used. This is very surprising for a factor generally believed to be a transdominant inhibitor of C/EBP activators (10Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). If C/EBPγ acted as an inhibitor, C/EBPβ would be expected to induce less luciferase expression in the presence of added C/EBPγ, rather than more luciferase expression. In fact, 0.5 μg of C/EBPβ vector with 0.5 μg of C/EBPγ vector is twice as effective as 1 μg of C/EBPβ vector alone. This is consistent with C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers being more potent activators than C/EBPβ homodimers. Presumably, overexpression of C/EBPγ drives more C/EBPβ into heterodimers than would occur at endogenous levels of C/EBPγ expression. When EMSA was performed upon nuclear extracts prepared from P388 cells transiently transfected with C/EBPβ expression vector with and without added C/EBPγ expression vector, a higher ratio of C/EBPβ:γ heterodimer to C/EBPβ homodimer is indeed observed in cells transfected with C/EBPγ expression vector (2.2 as opposed to 1.3) (Fig.3 E). To further test the ability of C/EBPγ to promote formation of C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers, a constant quantity of C/EBPβ expression vector was transiently transfected into P388 cells with and without C/EBPγ expression vector over a range of quantities including those that effectively transactivated the IL-6 promoter following LPS stimulation (see Fig. 3 A). An EMSA of nuclear extracts of the transfected cells revealed that C/EBPβ:γ heterodimers became apparent and increased in abundance with increasing quantities of C/EBPγ (Fig. 3 D). The stimulatory effects of C/EBPγ were also observed in transient transfections where increasing amounts of C/EBPγ expression vector were added to a constant amount of C/EBPβ expression vector. These transfections were performed with LPS stimulation, and the expression vectors were cotransfected with an IL-6 promoter-reporter. C/EBPγ clearly augmented the ability of C/EBPβ to mediate LPS induction of the IL-6 promoter (Fig. 3 B). C/EBPγ activity was observed even when the C/EBPγ vector was transfected at a 8-fold excess over C/EBPβ vector, although C/EBPγ by itself exhibited no activity (data not shown). Our results therefore suggest that C/EBPγ, rather than functioning as an inhibitor to low levels of C/EBPβ activity, actually augments that activity on the IL-6promoter. In contrast to the stimulatory effects observed when C/EBPγ was cotransfected with C/EBPβ in LPS-induced IL-6 expression, C/EBPγ actually inhibited the modest activation"

These results reveal that partial activation is caused by isomerization along other double bonds in more rigid 6-locked retinal isomers and protonation of key residues by lowering pH in 11-<i>cis</i>-6-ring-Rhos. Full activation is not achieved, because isomerization does not induce a complete set of conformational rearrangements of Rho.

https://openalex.org/W2056233726,"Abstract Retinal cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is a key enzyme in vertebrate phototransduction. Rod PDE contains two homologous catalytic subunits (Pαβ) and two identical regulatory subunits (Pγ). Biochemical studies have shown that amphibian Pαβ has high affinity, cGMP-specific, non-catalytic binding sites and that Pγ stimulates cGMP binding to these sites. Here we show by molecular cloning that each catalytic subunit in amphibian PDE, as in its mammalian counterpart, contains two homologous tandem GAF domains in its N-terminal region. In Pγ-depleted membrane-bound PDE (20–40% Pγ still present), a single type of cGMP-binding site with a relatively low affinity (K d ∼ 100 nm) was observed, and addition of Pγ increased both the affinity for cGMP and the level of cGMP binding. We also show that mutations of amino acid residues in four different sites in Pγ reduced its ability to stimulate cGMP binding. Among these, the site involved in Pγ phosphorylation by Cdk5 (positions 20–23) had the largest effect on cGMP binding. However, except for the C terminus, these sites were not involved in Pγ inhibition of the cGMP hydrolytic activity of Pαβ. In addition, the Pγ concentration required for 50% stimulation of cGMP binding was much greater than that required for 50% inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis. These results suggest that the Pαβ heterodimer contains two spatially and functionally distinct types of Pγ-binding sites: one for inhibition of cGMP hydrolytic activity and the second for activation of cGMP binding to GAF domains. We propose a model for the Pαβ-Pγ interaction in which Pγ, by binding to one of the two sites in Pαβ, may preferentially act either as an inhibitor of catalytic activity or as an activator of cGMP binding to GAF domains in frog PDE."

Whereas inhibition of cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin A2-Cdk2 by p27Xic1 has been linked to cell cycle arrest and prevention of apoptosis in embryos irradiated post-MBT, distinct roles for these complexes during apoptosis are evident in embryos irradiated pre-MBT. Cyclin A2 is cleaved by caspases to generate a truncated complex termed ΔN-cyclin A2-Cdk2, which is kinase active, not inhibited by p27Xic1, and not sensitive to degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. Moreover, ΔN-cyclin A2-Cdk2 has an expanded substrate specificity and can phosphorylate histone H2B at Ser-32, which may facilitate DNA cleavage. Consistent with a role for cyclin A2 in apoptosis, the addition of ΔN-cyclin A2-Cdk2, but not full-length cyclin A2-Cdk2, toXenopus egg extracts triggers apoptotic DNA fragmentation even when caspases are not activated. Similarly, cyclin D1 is targeted by caspases, and the generated product exhibits higher affinity for p27Xic1, leading to reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) during apoptosis.

Consistent with a role for cyclins in apoptosis, cyclin E overexpression greatly sensitizes cells to radiation, whereas its inhibition by a dominant-negative Cdk2 blocks cell death (9Mazumder S. Gong B. Almasan A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Mazumder S. Gong B. Chen Q. Drazba J.A. Buchsbaum J.C. Almasan A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2398-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, neuronal apoptosis is accompanied by changes in Cdk activity and cyclin D expression (13Freeman R.S. Estus S. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and expression of the CKIs p16, p21, and p27 or dominant-negative forms of Cdk4 and -6 inhibits death in sympathetic neurons caused by NGF withdrawal (14Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D-type cyclins, which are activated by rearrangement or amplification in several tumors, interact with two distinct catalytic partners, Cdk4 and Cdk6, to yield different holoenzymes that are expressed in tissue-specific patterns (for review, see Ref. 15Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB, a tumor suppressor gene product) and regulate the G1/S transition in the cell cycle (16Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, cyclin D1 expression, both at the mRNA and protein levels, starts at the time of mid-blastula transition (MBT)1 during early development, although Cdk4 is already present in oocytes. Cyclin A is a key regulatory protein involved in both S phase and the G2/M transition of the cell cycle through its association with Cdk2 and Cdc2, respectively. Two types of cyclin A, A1 and A2, have been described in Xenopus (17Howe J.A. Howell M. Hunt T. Newport J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cyclin A1 is present in unfertilized eggs and in early cleavage stages and disappears rapidly after the MBT. Cyclin A2 protein is very low in early embryos, increases rapidly at the MBT, and reaches a constant level in adult tissues (17Howe J.A. Howell M. Hunt T. Newport J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1164-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It shows a greater similarity to human cyclin A than toXenopus cyclin A1. Interestingly, in Xenopus embryos cyclin A1 activity has been implicated in a dramatic change in the response to DNA damage at the MBT. When ionizing radiation is administered any time before the MBT, Xenopus embryos initiate apoptosis after the MBT and exhibit prolonged activation of cyclin A1-Cdk2 (18Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Hensey C. Gautier J. Mech. Dev. 1997; 69: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 20Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, if ionizing radiation is given after the MBT, apoptosis is prevented by multiple mechanisms, including the inactivation of proapoptotic components, activation of antiapoptotic elements, and arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 (21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The latter is a direct consequence of an increased amount of the Cdk inhibitor p27Xic1, which binds to and inhibits both cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin A2-Cdk2 complexes. This promotes a delay in the G1/S transition, allowing more time for DNA repair, and blocks apoptosis, which might occur if S phase were initiated with damaged DNA (21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nearly all programmed cell death is executed by a family of aspartate-directed cysteine proteases known as caspases (for review, see Ref. 22Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Many proteins targeted by caspases are involved in RNA splicing, DNA repair, and scaffolding of proteins in the cytosol and nucleus, although in most cases their exact roles in execution of the apoptotic program remain unclear. Emerging evidence has also identified protein kinases as caspase targets. Some of these kinases are activated indirectly through caspase action on other substrates, but an increasing number have been found to be directly cleaved by caspases, leading to modulation of their catalytic activity (for review, see Ref.23Bokoch G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whereas the caspase-cleaved forms of PAK2, MAPK kinase kinase, focal adhesion kinase, protein kinase Cδ, protein kinase Cθ, and calmodulin kinase II are active, cleavage of DNA-protein kinase, Raf-1 and Akt during apoptosis correlates with loss of activity. Other studies show that histones become phosphorylated in response to apoptosis-inducing signals (24Ajiro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). The timing of phosphorylation of histone H2B on Ser-32 coincides with the initiation of DNA fragmentation seen at early stages of apoptosis. Some evidence supports a role for protein kinase Cδ in histone H2B phosphorylation inasmuch as it is cleaved by caspases and phosphorylates histone H2B at Ser-32 (26Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Here we show that apoptosis in Xenopus is associated with cleaved forms of cyclin A2-Cdk2 and cyclin D1-Cdk4 generated by caspase activation. Both cleaved forms exhibit alterations in their kinase activity and in regulation by inhibitory proteins. In addition, the cleaved form of cyclin A2-Cdk2 contributes to nuclear apoptosis, and the cleaved form of cyclin D1-Cdk4 binds p27Xic1 with higher affinity, leading to reduced phosphorylation of pRB during apoptosis. Eggs were fertilized in vitro as described previously (27Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (28Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis. North-Holland, Amsterdam1975Google Scholar). For time-course experiments, embryos were irradiated at either stage 6 or stage 9, collected at the indicated times, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Embryos were homogenized and processed for pull-down analysis as described (18Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,29Su J.Y. Rempel R.E. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10187-10191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). γ-Irradiation was performed by exposing embryos to 20 gray (2000 rads) from a 60Co source as described (18Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Metaphase II-arrested cytostatic factor (CSF) extracts were prepared from Xenopuseggs as described (30Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Extracts were supplemented at time 0 with 500 μm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, and demembranated sperm nuclei (1000 nuclei/μl) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, at which time the extracts were in interphase. Recombinant proteins or buffer was then added to these extracts, and 2-μl aliquots were removed at regular intervals and analyzed for apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy after formaldehyde fixation (3.7% formaldehyde, 48% glycerol) and staining with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in 1× MMR (100 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8). The assay was performed according to conditions described previously (20Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Embryos were irradiated at either stage 6 or stage 9 and collected at different times after irradiation. In substrate cleavage assays, 35S-labeled Xenopuscyclin D1 or cyclin A2 translated in vitro (TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) was added at a 1:10 dilution into an extract volume equivalent to one embryo. Samples were incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots of 3 μl were withdrawn at various times and diluted with 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The cleavage products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Caspase inhibitors (N-acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde (DEVD),N-acetyl-LEHD-aldehyde (LEHD),N-acetyl-IETD-aldehyde (IETD),N-acetyl-YVAD-aldehyde (YVAD),N-acetyl-VEID-aldehyde (VEID); BIOMOL Research Laboratories) were added to apoptotic extracts (250 nm final concentration) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C before the addition of the radiolabeled Xenopus cyclin. Xenopus Cdk2 and p27Xic1 were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase, and the kinase dead form of Cdk2 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis to change Asp-145 to Asn. Xenopus cyclin A2 and ΔN-cyclin A2 were cloned into pVL1392 and pBac-2cp (Novagen), respectively. Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses expressing either Xenopuscyclin A2 or ΔN-cyclin A2 together with GST-Cdk2 or cyclin D1 or ΔC-cyclin D1 together with GST-Cdk4 with or without p27Xic1, and the complex was purified as described (31Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). p13Suc1 beads were produced as described previously (27Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For affinity labeling of active caspases (32Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Frigon Jr., N. Tatar E. Tung J.S. Bryant K. Takahashi A. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), aliquots of an interphase extract treated with either buffer, cytochrome c, or ΔN-cyclin A2-Cdk2 were incubated with 1 μm biotinylated affinity reagent zEK(bio)D-aomk (Peptides International) for 10 min at 37 °C, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were stained with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem; 1:300 dilution) for 3 h at room temperature, and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cleavage of cyclin A2-Cdk2, cyclin A2-Cdk2-p27Xic1, cyclin D1-Cdk4, and cyclin D1-Cdk4-p27Xic1 was analyzed by incubating 250 ng of each complex with 15 units/μl of the indicated recombinant caspase (caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-10, BIOMOL Research laboratories). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots of 5 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cyclin antibody. Caspase-2, -3, and -7 activities were measured with the specific caspase colorimetric substrate QuantiPakTM from BIOMOL Research Laboratories usingN-acetyl-VDEAD-p-nitroanilide,N-acetyl-DEVD-p-nitroanilide, andN-acetyl-DQMD-p-nitroanilide, respectively. For assays in crude extracts, embryos were homogenized in assay buffer, and samples corresponding to 3 embryos were used for each time point. Assay mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C before measurement of absorbance at 405 nm with a LabSystems MultiSkan MS microtiter plate reader. All measurements were repeated in triplicate for each time point, and the mean ± S.E. is reported. Phosphorylation of histones H2A, H2B, H3, H4 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by cyclin-Cdk complexes was carried out as described for histone H1 phosphorylation (27Rempel R.E. Sleight S.B. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by cyclin D1-Cdk4 was carried out as described previously (21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A peptide encompassing Ser-32 of bovine histone H2B, (amino acids 27–34; KKRKRSRK) was synthesized by the HHMI Protein Chemistry Facility at the University of California, San Francisco. A phosphospecific antibody to Ser-32 in histone H2B was a kind gift of Dr. David Allis (University of Virginia). Phosphoamino acids were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and 3.5 on Kodak cellulose thin layer plates as described (33Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes with F12 medium containing 10% bovine serum (Invitrogen). Nuclei from ∼107 cells were isolated essentially as described (34Ausubel F.M. Cannon F.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 45: 487-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, nuclei (1000 nuclei/μl) were added to 100 μl of CSF-released extract and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before the addition of recombinant proteins. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mmCaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 10 min at room temperature, layered onto a sucrose cushion (2 m sucrose, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and centrifuged for 45 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. The nuclei were resuspended by gentle vortexing in 200 μl of Krishan's stain and further dispersed by pipetting. Another 200-μl volume of Krishan's stain was added, and the samples were kept overnight at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was performed with a Coulter Epics-XL flow cytometer in the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Our previous results showed that G1 arrest of the cell cycle occurs during prevention of apoptosis in embryos irradiated after the MBT. The G1 arrest is a direct consequence of an increased level of p27Xic1, which binds to and inhibits both Cdk2 and Cdk4 complexes (21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Embryos irradiated before the MBT undergo apoptosis beginning several hours after the MBT. We studied here whether cyclin-Cdk complexes are implicated in the induction or execution of apoptosis in Xenopus embryos irradiated before the MBT. Initially, cyclin A2-Cdk2 and cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes were examined after irradiation in vivo because cyclins A1 and E are largely degraded after the MBT, and cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes are not active during apoptosis (18Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Hartley R.S. Rempel R.E. Maller J.L. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, Stack and Newport (20Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) report that cyclin A2 is cleaved by caspases in response to prolonged activation of the DNA replication checkpoint by hydroxyurea. However, its possible role in apoptosis has not been examined. Embryos were irradiated at either stage 6 (pre-MBT) or stage 9 (post-MBT) and collected at different times. Extracts were incubated with p13Suc1 beads, which specifically bind Cdk2 and Cdc2 complexes, and the bound complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-cyclin A2 antibody. Cyclin A2 was cleaved in embryos irradiated before the MBT (Fig.1 A, upper panel), whereas cleavage of cyclin A2 did not occur in embryos irradiated post-MBT (data not shown). No cleavage of cyclin B was evident in embryos irradiated before or after the MBT (data not shown). The cleaved form of cyclin A2 was present as a doublet, probably the result of phosphorylation, as it migrated as one band when p13Suc1precipitates were incubated with acid phosphatase (data not shown). In addition, the formation of the cleaved product correlates in time with the appearance of the apoptotic phenotype during the onset of gastrulation in irradiated embryos, including chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and membrane blebbing (18Anderson J.A. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The presence of the cyclin A2 fragment on p13Suc1 bead precipitates indicates that the cleaved form of cyclin A2 is still able to bind its Cdk2 partner. Because our previous work suggested that inhibition of both cyclin A2-Cdk2 and cyclin D1-Cdk4 by p27Xic1contributes to G1 arrest and prevention of apoptosis in post-MBT-irradiated embryos (21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether cyclin D1 might also be cleaved in apoptotic embryos. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of cyclin D1 in embryos irradiated before the MBT revealed the appearance of a cleavage product at the onset of gastrulation (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). As was the case with cyclin A2 (20Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the cleavage could also be observed if cell-free lysates of embryos undergoing apoptosis were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled cyclin D1 (Fig.1 B). Further studies were devoted to determining which proteases are responsible for cleavage of each cyclin. Initial attention was focused on caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent proteases that cleave substrates C-terminal to a conserved aspartate residue (22Goyal L. Cell. 2001; 104: 805-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Caspase assays with specific colorimetric substrates (36Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 37Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) revealed that caspase-2, -3, and -7 activity was increased after the MBT (Fig.1 C) at the time when cyclin D1 and A2 cleavage occurs (Fig.1 A). To investigate directly whether caspases are responsible for cyclin cleavage, we monitored the degradation of radiolabeled cyclins added to apoptotic extracts in the presence of specific caspase inhibitors. Inhibitor selectivities are based on the high specificity of each caspase for a cleavage site flanked by residues N-terminal to aspartate (37Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Treatment of embryo extracts with the inhibitor DEVD prevented cyclin A2 and D1 cleavage, whereas no effect was observed with any other inhibitor tested (Fig.2, A and B). These results suggest that the cleavage of cyclins A2 and D1, which occurs after irradiation, might be due to members of the caspase-3 subfamily. One prototypical consensus site of cleavage for caspase-3 is situated in the C-terminal region of Xenopus cyclin D1 at position 275–278 (DEVD) (37Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The truncated form of cyclin D1, termed ΔC-cyclin D1, generated in vivo after caspase activation (Fig. 1 A), has a molecular weight identical to that observed after in vitro caspase cleavage (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, whereas the cleavage site of cyclin A2 has an Asp residue in the P4 position, the overall sequence (87DEPD90) does not represent a prototypical caspase-3 consensus sequence (37Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). This motif was changed to AEPD (A2D87A), DEPA (A2D90A), and AEPA (A2D87A/D90A), respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were analyzed for cleavage in the cell-free assay. Wild-type cyclin A2 (A2) was cleaved, whereas cleavage of A2D87A, A2D90A, and A2D87A/D90A was not detected (Fig. 2 C). Asp-90 is the same cleavage site identified in cyclin A2 when embryos undergo apoptosis after prolonged hydroxyurea treatment (20Stack J.H. Newport J.W. Development. 1997; 124: 3185-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified cyclin-Cdk complexes produced in Sf9 cells were then used to examine whether they are direct substrates for caspases. These fusion proteins were incubated with various caspasesin vitro, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin A2 and D1 antibodies. Fig.2 D, upper panel, shows that cyclin A2 is efficiently cleaved by caspases-2, -3, and -7 but not by caspases-6, -8, and -9, and cyclin D1 cleavage was evident only with caspases-3 and -7 (Fig. 2 D, lower panel). The appearance of the fragments could be effectively prevented by preincubating the purified proteins with DEVD-CHO before the in vitro cleavage assay (data not shown). We previously reported that the Xenopus Cdk inhibitor p27Xic1 binds to and inhibits cyclin A2-Cdk2 beginning shortly after irradiation post-MBT, when no caspase activity is detected (21Finkielstein C.V. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, eventually caspase activation and apoptosis occur in such embryos if DNA repair is not complete. Structural studies indicate that p27Xic1 binds to both cyclin A and Cdk2 in the complex (38Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether caspases can cleave cyclins A2 and D1 when the complexes are associated with p27Xic1. To assess this question, purified cyclin-Cdk and cyclin-Cdk-p27Xic1 complexes produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells were incubated with caspase-3 and tested for cyclin cleavage by immunoblotting. Caspase-3 is able to cleave cyclins A2 and D1 bound to their Cdk partner in vitroeven when the complex is associated with p27Xic1 (Fig.2 E). Because p27Xic1 is not a caspase substrate, 2C. V. Finkielstein, L. G. Chen, and J. L. Maller, unpublished data. the simplest interpretation of this result is that p27Xic1 does not protect the complex from caspase-mediated cleavage. Cleavage of cyclin A2 at Asp-90 also removes the destruction box required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation and, thus, might ensure the persistence of the cleaved complex. To examine this possibility directly, we used a cell-free system based on extracts fromXenopus unfertilized eggs arrested at metaphase of meiosis II by a calcium-sensitive activity named cytostatic factor (CSF), which stabilizes MPF activity. The addition of calcium triggers CSF release, resulting in cyclin A and B degradation, a decline in MPF activity, and entry into interphase of the first mitotic cycle. When cycloheximide was also added to these extracts, de novo synthesis of cyclins was prevented, and the extracts remained in interphase (interphase extracts). Purified cyclin A2-Cdk2 or ΔN-cyclin A2-Cdk2 were added to a CSF-arrested extract, and the level of various cyclin components was assess"

To examine whether Cys7 and Cys11 are spatially proximate to Cys58 and Cys60 of the same subunit or of the other subunit, homodimers with the same cysteine mutation in each subunit and heterodimers containing different cysteine mutations in the two subunits were reacted with 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione, which cross-links thiol groups that are within 3–6 Å of each other. Cys7 or Cys11 cross-linked only with Cys58 or Cys60 on the other subunit. The data demonstrate that Cys7 and Cys11 from one monomer are within 3–6 Å of either Cys58 or Cys60 in the other monomer. The results of this study strongly indicate that each of the two Cd(II) binding sites in the CadC homodimer is composed of Cys7 and Cys11 from one monomer and Cys58 and Cys60 from the other monomer. The Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 CadC is a homodimeric repressor that binds Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) and regulates expression of the cadAC operon. CadC binds two Cd(II) ions per dimer, with a tetrathiolate binding site composed of residues Cys7, Cys11, Cys58, and Cys60. It is not known whether each site consists of residues from a single monomer or from residues contributed by both subunits. To examine whether Cys7 and Cys11 are spatially proximate to Cys58 and Cys60 of the same subunit or of the other subunit, homodimers with the same cysteine mutation in each subunit and heterodimers containing different cysteine mutations in the two subunits were reacted with 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione, which cross-links thiol groups that are within 3–6 Å of each other. Cys7 or Cys11 cross-linked only with Cys58 or Cys60 on the other subunit. The data demonstrate that Cys7 and Cys11 from one monomer are within 3–6 Å of either Cys58 or Cys60 in the other monomer. The results of this study strongly indicate that each of the two Cd(II) binding sites in the CadC homodimer is composed of Cys7 and Cys11 from one monomer and Cys58 and Cys60 from the other monomer. The cadCA operon from Staphylococcus aureusplasmid pI258 confers resistance to the cations of the soft Lewis acids Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) (1Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Google Scholar). This operon encodes CadC (2Endo G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4437-4441Google Scholar), a 27-kDa trans-acting, homodimeric repressor that negatively regulates expression of CadA, a P-type Cd(II)/(Pb(II)/Zn(II)-translocating ATPase (3Tsai K.J. Yoon K.P. Lynn A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Google Scholar, 4Tsai K.J. Linet A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 267-270Google Scholar). CadC has been shown to bind two soft metal ions per dimer in a site composed of cysteine residues (5Busenlehner L.S. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Rosen B.P. Wong M.D. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4426-4436Google Scholar, 6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how these two metal binding sites are organized within the dimer. CadC is a member of the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins (7Xu C. Rosen B.P. Sarkar B. Metals and Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-19Google Scholar). This family includes members such as the As(III)/Sb(III)-responsive ArsR repressor of the ars operon of Escherichia coli plasmid R773 (8San Francisco M.J. Hope C.L. Owolabi J.B. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 619-624Google Scholar), the Zn(II)-responsive repressors SmtB from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC7942 (9Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 921-925Google Scholar), and ZiaR fromSynechocystis PCC6803 (10Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Google Scholar). These proteins share the conserved sequence ELCV(C/G)D, where the cysteine residues are believed to be essential in metal sensing in ArsR, ZiaR, and CadC (Fig. 1). CadC, ZiaR, and SmtB each have an additional 25–40 amino acids at their N terminus with additional cysteine residues that may play a role in conferring metal ion specificity. Evidence that CadC residues Cys7, Cys58, and Cys60 are required in vivo for metal binding is derived from two-plasmid green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; dibromobimane, 4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. reporter assays and in vitro restriction enzyme protection assays (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies indicated that four cysteine thiolates are involved in Cd(II) binding as a tetrathiolate complex formed by four cysteine residues with a Cd(II)-S distance of 2.5 Å (5Busenlehner L.S. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Rosen B.P. Wong M.D. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4426-4436Google Scholar). In such a structure the four sulfur atoms can be predicted to be ∼4.5 Å from each other. Neither Cys11 nor Cys52 is conserved in CadC repressors, and neither is required for activity either in vivo or in vitro(6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar), so the fourth cysteine residue in the tetrathiolate complex has not been identified with certainty. However, modeling CadC on the structure of the SmtB aporepressor (11Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Google Scholar) suggests that Cys52is 15–18 Å from Cys58 and Cys60. Moreover, assuming the validity of the model, Cys52 would be predicted to be buried, and its thiolate would not be solvent-accessible. These considerations imply that the fourth cysteine residue is Cys11. CadC is a homodimer with two metal binding sites. By construction of heterodimers with one wild-type and one mutant subunit, we have shown that both metal binding sites are required for derepression in vivo and release from the operator DNA in vitro (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). These sites could be composed of Cys7, Cys11, Cys58, and Cys60 from the same monomer (intrasubunit model) (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, in each site Cys7 and Cys11 could be contributed by one monomer, and Cys58 and Cys60 from the other monomer (intersubunit model) (Fig. 2 B). Intersubunit sites have been proposed (13Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Google Scholar), but no supporting data have been presented. The equivalent residues in the N terminus of SmtB are not visible in the crystal structure, so the location of CadC residues Cys7 and Cys11 cannot be predicted. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we constructed a series of homodimeric single, double, triple, and quadruple cysteine mutants of CadC and examined the ability of (4,6-bis(bromomethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1,5-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-3,6-diene-2,8-dione (dibromobimane) to form intersubunit cross-links. Dibromobimane is a fluorogenic, homobifunctional thiol-specific cross-linking reagent that becomes highly fluorescent when both of its alkylating groups react with cysteine residues that are within 3–6 Å of each other (14Kosower N.S. Newton G.L. Kosower E.M. Ranney H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 622: 201-209Google Scholar). Thus, dibromobimane can be used as a molecular ruler to identify cysteine residues that are in close proximity in a metal site (15Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24465-24470Google Scholar). Although the wild-type CadC forms fluorescent dimers, a quadruple mutant lacking Cys7, Cys11, Cys58and Cys60 did not. All single mutants formed fluorescent dimers. Double mutants lacking either Cys7 and Cys11 or Cys58 and Cys60 did not form dimers. To demonstrate unambiguously that Cys7 or Cys11 interacts intermolecularly with Cys58 or Cys60, heterodimers were constructed with two mutant subunits such that each monomer of the dimer had only a single cysteine residue. Dimers were formed by reaction with dibromobimane only when one subunit contained either Cys7 or Cys11 and the other contained only Cys58 or Cys60. This definitely demonstrates that Cys7 and Cys11 in one subunit are ∼4.5 Å of Cys58 and Cys60 in the other subunit. The data are consistent only with an intersubunit model of a tetrathiolate metal binding site composed of Cys7 and Cys11 from one subunit and Cys58 and Cys60 from the other (Fig.2 B). For most experiments cultures of E. coli strain JM109(DE3) bearing the indicated plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Kanamycin (40 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (40–80 μg/ml), and ampicillin (125 μg/ml) were added as required. For in vivoassay of the ability of mutant cadC genes to controlgfp expression, cultures of E. colistrain BL21(DE3) zntA::kmbearing the indicated plasmids were grown in a basal salts medium (17Poole R.K. Williams H.D. Downie J.A. Gibson F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1865-1874Google Scholar). Dibromobimane was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. The pMW1 series plasmids were constructed in pET28a (K mr) (Novagen) (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis using either the Altered SitesTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) or a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The pMW1 series includes mutants C7G, C11G, Y12W, C58S, C60G, D61A, H103A, C58S/C60S, C7G/C11S, and Y12W/C7A/C58S/C60S. Note that a Y12W derivative was constructed to introduce a tryptophan residue for future use as an intrinsic spectroscopic probe into CadC and does not affect CadC function. 2M. D. Wong and B. P. Rosen, unpublished results. For the purposes of this study, it is used interchangeably with Tyr12-containing CadCs. The pYSC2 series (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar) was constructed by similar methodology in pET28b (K mr) (Novagen), which includes six histidine codons at the 3′-OH end. The pYSC2 series includes triple mutants C7A/C11S/C58A and C7A/C11S/C60A and the quadruple mutant C7A/C11S/C58S/C60S. The pYSCM series plasmids (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar) were constructed in pACYC184 (18Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Google Scholar) (Cmr) using similar methodology and include mutants C7A/C58S/C60S and C11S/C58S/C60S. All CadC mutants were sequenced with a Beckman Coulter CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis System to ensure that additional mutations were not introduced. To produce CadC heterodimers containing one wild-type and one mutant subunit, the genes for both subunits were coexpressed in the same cells of E. coli JM109(DE3) that had been cotransformed with a pYSC2 series plasmid and a pYSCM series plasmid, which are compatible with each other (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). The gene for red-shifted GFP (19Delagrave S. Hawtin R.E. Silva C.M. Yang M.M. Youvan D.C. Bio/Technology (N. Y.). 1995; 13: 151-154Google Scholar) was used as a reporter for monitoring the regulatory properties of the cadC gene product, as described previously (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar). Briefly, cells contained two plasmids: pYSG1 (Apr) hadgfp controlled by the cad operator/promoter, and pYSCM series plasmids carried cadC genes under control of the T7 promoter. Expression from the cad promoter was quantified from the fluorescence of red-shifted GFP with an emission wavelength of 507 nm and excitation wavelength of 470 nm in an SLM-Aminco Series 2 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence intensity of GFP-containing cells was normalized to the fluorescence of cells carrying plasmids pYSG1 and pACYC184, which do not produce CadC. Growth of cells and induction of the genes for homodimers or heterodimers were performed as previously described (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). To produce heterodimers, LB medium with kanamycin (40 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml) was inoculated with a single colony of E. coli JM109(DE3) bearing two plasmids in which one cadC gene was in the background of plasmid pACYC184 and the other in the background of plasmid pET28b. The cadC gene expressed from pACYC184 did not encode a six-histidine tag, whereas the cadC expressed in the background of the pET28b plasmid contained the sequence for a six-histidine tag. The overnight cultures of these cells were used to inoculate 4 liters of prewarmed LB medium at 37 °C. At an absorbance of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, the cells were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with a buffer consisting of 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 0.137 m NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3, at 4 °C. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until use. CadC homodimers and heterodimers were purified as described previously (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar) using buffers purged with argon. Protein solutions were sparged with argon for 0.5 h before applying to a 5-ml Probond Ni-affinity column (Clontech). Proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient from 20 to 500 mm using an Automated Econo System (Bio-Rad). The eluates were collected in tubes containing small amounts of concentrated EDTA and DTT such that the final concentrations were each 10 mm. Purified wild-type and mutant CadC proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 16% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 100 V (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar) followed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody to CadC (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA) (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar) using anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the secondary antibody. The membranes were also probed with monoclonal antibody to a C-terminal six-histidine tag directly conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). CadC binding to the cad promoter was assayed by protection of the single SspI site in the cad DNA from digestion (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). Deprotection was examined by the addition of salts of soft metals. In some experiments CadC was removed by extraction with an equal volume of phenol. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, following which they were mixed with 4 μl of a 6× sample solution (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, and 40% (w/v) sucrose in H2O) and electrophoresed on 1.4% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 100 V for 60 min at 23 °C. Following electrophoresis the gels were soaked in 1 mm MgSO4 for 30 min at 23 °C to remove excess ethidium bromide and photographed on a transilluminator using a Kodak DC120 scientific digital system. Immunoblot analysis of agarose gels was performed as described above for polyacrylamide gels. Cross-linking studies with dibromobimane were described previously (15Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24465-24470Google Scholar). Purified wild-type CadC and mutants were incubated with 70 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature and dialyzed three times with 500 volumes of a buffer consisting of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.25 mm EDTA in an anaerobic glovebox to remove DTT. The proteins were quantified by using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) based on the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). CadCs (16 μm) were incubated with 0.3 mm dibromobimane (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 4 °C. The reactions were quenched with either 20 μm DTT or 0.3 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (Sigma), which was found to lower nonspecific cross-linking and fluorescence. Samples were analyzed by 16% SDS-PAGE. The gels were visualized under UV light at 365 nm and then stained with Coomassie Blue (GelCode® Blue Stain Reagent, Pierce). Purified wild-type CadC migrates primarily as a monomer on SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 A, lane 1). If care is not taken to prevent oxidation, some CadC migrates as a non-reducible dimer (5Busenlehner L.S. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Rosen B.P. Wong M.D. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4426-4436Google Scholar). When treated with dibromobimane, the majority of protein migrated at the position of a CadC dimer (Fig.3 A, lane 2). The upper band reacted with antibody to CadC (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) and was fluorescent (Fig. 3 C, lane 2), demonstrating that it is a CadC dimer-bimane adduct. The fact that the fluorescent dimer was resistant to SDS denaturation strongly indicates that the cross-linking had occurred between cysteine residues on opposite subunits, as the intersubunit model would predict. The monomer also developed fluorescence slowly, which could result from formation of bimane adducts between Cys7 and Cys11 and/or between Cys58 and Cys60. In contrast, a quadruple mutant lacking Cys7, Cys11, Cys58, and Cys60 did not dimerize when reacted with dibromobimane (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 4), showing that bimane adduct formation requires CadC thiolates. Additionally, the monomer of the quadruple mutant did not develop fluorescence, even though it retains Cys52. As shown below, the quadruple cysteine mutant bound to cad operator/promoter DNA, indicating that it does not have gross structural alterations. However, the quadruple mutant did not respond to addition of Cd(II), as shown below, consistent with the role of the cysteine residues in metal binding (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar). Mutant CadCs C7G, C11G, C58S, and C60G have been shown to bind to the cad operator/promoter in vivo andin vitro (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar). Although there was no apparent effect of the C11G mutation, alteration of Cys7, Cys58, and Cys60 each resulted in loss of metal responsiveness. These four mutant CadCs were purified and reacted with dibromobimane (Fig.4). Elimination of any of the four did not prevent dimerization by reaction with dibromobimane; in each case formation of a fluorescent dimer was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). This result could only occur if dimers were formed between cysteine residues on opposite subunits. Two double mutants were constructed with substitutions of either the first two cysteines residues (C7G/C11S) or the second pair of cysteines (C58S/C60S). Both mutant proteins reacted with dibromobimane to form fluorescent monomers, but neither protein dimerized with dibromobimane treatment (Fig. 5). Similarly, a triple mutant, C7A/C58S/C60S, which contains only Cys11, did not dimerize when treated with dibromobimane (data not shown). CadC heterodimers have been engineered in which one binding site was wild-type and the other had substitutions of the cysteine residues (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). These heterodimers retained their ability to bind tocad operator/promoter DNA but did not respond to addition of Cd(II), Pb(II), or Zn(II). Those results demonstrated that both subunits in the CadC dimer must have functional metal binding sites for derepression. In this study heterodimers, in which the two subunits had different mutations and one subunit had a histidine tag, were purified. For convenience, a terminology for the heterodimers is used in which the first mutation is in the non-histidine-tagged subunit and the second is in the histidine-tagged subunit, and the residue number indicates which cysteine remains. For example, a “Cys7-Cys58” CadC heterodimer indicates the non-histidine-tagged subunit has only Cys7, whereas the histidine-tagged subunit has Cys58. Four heterodimers were purified, Cys7-Cys58, Cys7-Cys60, Cys11-Cys58, and Cys11-Cys60. To examine the ability of the CadC heterodimers to bind to thecad operator/promoter DNA and to respond to Cd(II), a restriction protection assay was used (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). This assay measures DNA binding by the ability of CadC to protect the single SspI site contained within the cad operator/promoter from digestion with SspI. In this assay a 4.6-kbp plasmid that has two SspI sites, one within the 108-bp cadoperator/promoter fragment and the other in the vector, is digested with SspI. This generates two restriction fragments of 3.6 and 1 kbp (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). In the presence of purified wild-type CadC, the plasmid is cut only once by SspI, generating a single 4.6-kbp fragment (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). Binding of Cd(II) induces dissociation, producing two fragments (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). We have noted that both fragments produced by SspI in the presence of CadC and Cd(II) (Fig. 6 A, arrows c and d) consistently migrate more slowly than the equivalent fragments in the absence of CadC (Fig. 6 A,arrows a and b). SmtB, a Zn(II)-responsive homologue of CadC, has been shown to remain on the DNA after derepression by Zn(II) (23Kar S.R. Lebowitz J. Blume S. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13378-13389Google Scholar). The possibility that CadC remains bound to the DNA following Cd(II) binding was examined in two ways. First, the proteins on the agarose gel were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then immunoblotted with anti-CadC (Fig. 6 B). CadC remained bound to both SspI fragments. Second, following SspI digestion, the DNA was extracted with phenol to remove CadC (Fig.6 A, lanes 4 and 5). The two restriction fragments then migrated with the same mobility as the control (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). Thus, under the conditions of this assay CadC remains bound not only to thecad operator/promoter following binding of Cd(II) but also binds to the half sites independently. It should be pointed out that this assay uses high concentrations CadC; whether the repressor remains bound to the operator/promoter in vivo following derepression is not known. Binding of the Cys11-Cys60 heterodimer (Fig.6 C, lane 5) to the cadoperator/promoter DNA was compared with the wild-type (Fig.6 C, lane 3) and quadruple cysteine homodimers (Fig. 6 C, lane 7). Each of the three CadCs protected the DNA from SspI digestion (Fig. 6 C,lanes 3, 5, and 7), showing that the homodimer quadruple cysteine mutant and the heterodimer having only Cys11 on one subunit and Cys60 on the other was able to bind to the DNA. However, both types of mutants were unable to respond to Cd(II) (Fig. 6 C, lanes 6 and8). Although Cd(II) resulted in deprotection by the wild-type (Fig. 6 C, lane 4), there was no effect of Cd(II) with either homodimeric or heterodimeric mutants (Fig.6 C, lanes 6 and 8). Note that in this assay the digests were extracted with phenol prior to electrophoresis, so that all of the bands migrated with the mobility of CadC-free DNA (arrows a and b). Although the data are shown for only the Cys11-Cys60 heterodimer, the Cys7-Cys58, Cys7-Cys60, and Cys11-Cys58 CadCs gave equivalent results. The fact that heterodimeric mutants retain the ability to bind to thecad operator/promoter indicates that these CadCs have sufficient native conformation to recognize their DNA binding site. The definitive test of intramolecular versus intermolecular models was ability of heterodimeric CadC mutants to form bimane-dimer adducts following reaction with dibromobimane (Fig.7). If the metal binding site was composed of cysteine residues from the same subunit (intramolecular model), then a heterodimer with (for example) only Cys7 on one subunit and (for example) only Cys58 on the other subunit should not form a bimane-dimer adduct (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, this Cys7-Cys58 heterodimer should form a fluorescent cross-linked dimer if the binding site is formed by residues from both subunits (intermolecular model) (Fig.7 B). In the absence of dibromobimane, each of the four heterodimers dissociated into monomers on SDS-PAGE. The two types of subunits could be differentiated by immunoblotting with anti-CadC (Fig.7, C and D, lanes 1 and 5), which reacts with both subunits (arrows a and b), or anti-His tag (Fig. 7, C and D, lanes 3 and 7), which reacts only with the larger histidine-tagged subunit (arrow a). Each of the four heterodimers formed a dimer when treated with dibromobimane (Fig.7, C and D, lanes 2, 4,6, and 8), which clearly support the intermolecular model: Cys7 and Cys11 on one subunit form bimane adducts with Cys58 and Cys60 on the other subunit. Thus each of the four cysteines thiolates must be within 3–6 Å of each other. The residues that contribute to the metal binding site in members of the ArsR family is a question of some interest. The above arguments make the assumption that the soft metal ion binding site in CadC has only the four protein ligands, Cys7, Cys11, Cys58, and Cys60. In ArsR only three cysteine residues appear to be necessary for binding of As(III) or Sb(III) (24Shi W., Wu, J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Google Scholar). However, in SmtB, residues contributing oxygen and/or nitrogen ligands may be involved in Zn(II) binding (11Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Google Scholar, 25VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Google Scholar). Asp64 of SmtB is a Hg(II) ligand in the crystal structure and has been proposed to be part of the Zn(II) binding site (11Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Google Scholar). The corresponding residue is conserved as either an aspartate or glutamate in members of the ArsR family and could contribute an oxygen ligand for metal binding. In CadC this is Asp61. For this reason the effect of an D61A mutation was examined in vivo and in vitro (Fig.8). In vivo the mutatedcadC gene repressed expression of a gfp gene under control of the cad operator/promoter, and Pb(II) derepressed reporter gene expression, showing that the mutation did not alter the biological activity of CadC. Similar results were obtained with Cd(II) and Zn(II) (data not shown). The ability of purified D61A to bind to cad operator/promoter DNA in vitro was examined with an SspI protection assay (Fig. 8 B). The mutant protein protected the DNA, and addition of 20 μm Cd(OAc)2 produced deprotection with both wild-type and mutant. Pb(II) and Zn(II) similarly produced deprotection (data not shown). In SmtB His105 and His106 are required residues (26Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Google Scholar) and are possible nitrogen-donating residues. These residues are located in a helix located in the dimerization domain of SmtB. CadC residue His103 corresponds to SmtB residue His106, so it is possible that it forms part of a metal binding site in CadC. Recently a second binding site for harder metals was identified at the interface of the two subunits of CadC (13Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Google Scholar). Although this site has been proposed to be an evolutionary relic, its participation in the biological activity of CadC has not been examinedin vivo. To examine whether His103 is required for CadC metal responsiveness, the alanine-substituted mutant H103A was constructed. The ability to respond to Pb(II) in vivo was examined using the gfp reporter assay. H103A repressed GFP expression in the absence of Pb(II) and derepressed in the presence of Pb(II) (Fig. 8 A). In the SspI restriction enzyme protection assay, purified H103A CadC bound to cad promoter DNA, and addition of Cd(II) resulted in deprotection (Fig.8 B). The H103A mutant also responded to addition of Zn(II), both in vivo and in vitro (data not shown). Thus neither Asp61 nor His103 are essential for CadC function. Members of the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins are homodimers with soft metal binding sites (7Xu C. Rosen B.P. Sarkar B. Metals and Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-19Google Scholar). In ArsR, an As(III)/Sb(III)-responsive repressor, the metal site is composed of Cys32, Cys34, and Cys37, located at the first helix of the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (24Shi W., Wu, J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Google Scholar). Binding of metal has been proposed to distort the helix, resulting in dissociation of the repressor from the DNA (7Xu C. Rosen B.P. Sarkar B. Metals and Genetics. Plenum Press, New York1999: 5-19Google Scholar). Because the three cysteines are adjacent in the primary sequence, and there is no N-terminal extension with additional cysteine residues in ArsR, it is reasonable to conclude that each subunit has an As(III)/Sb(III) binding site composed of the three cysteines from the same ArsR monomer. The situation is more complex in SmtB and CadC. One issue is that they may have more than one type of metal binding site. In SmtB two types of sites are observed in the crystal structure (11Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Google Scholar). One site is similar to the ArsR binding site in that it includes Cys61 (25VanZile M.L. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11818-11829Google Scholar), which corresponds to Cys32 in ArsR and Cys58 in CadC, both of which are required for biological activity of their respective repressors (6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar, 27Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Google Scholar). It also includes Asp64, which corresponds to Asp35 in ArsR and Asp61 in CadC (11Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Google Scholar). To examine whether CadC residue Asp61 plays a role in metal sensing, a D61A mutant was created and was shown to respond to Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II), both in vivo andin vitro (Fig. 8). Thus Asp61 is not required for the biological activity of CadC. The other putative metal binding site in SmtB is at the dimer interface (11Cook W.J. Kar S.R. Taylor K.B. Hall L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 337-346Google Scholar) and includes His106, which is essential for biological activity (26Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Google Scholar). In CadC His103 corresponds to SmtB residue His106. Recently CadC has been reported to have a second metal binding site proposed to be at the dimer interface (13Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Google Scholar). From extrapolation from in vitro results it was suggested that this site is not required for CadC function in vivo. In this report His103 was changed to alanine. In vivoH103A repressed expression of GFP under control of the cadoperator/promoter, and addition of Pb(II), Cd(II), or Zn(II) produced normal derepression (Fig. 8). This confirms that a site containing His103 is not involved in the biological activity of CadC. A larger question is whether each of the two soft metal ion binding sites in CadC is composed entirely of residues from a single subunit or whether both subunits contribute residues to each site. CadC has two tetrathiolate binding sites per dimer for Cd(II) composed of four cysteine residues, Cys7, Cys11, Cys58, and Cys60 (5Busenlehner L.S. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Rosen B.P. Wong M.D. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4426-4436Google Scholar, 6Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14955-14960Google Scholar, 13Busenlehner L.S. Weng T.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. Giedroc D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 685-701Google Scholar). Both CadC metal binding sites are required for its metalloregulatory properties (12Sun Y. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1323-1329Google Scholar). There are two possible ways in which the metal binding sites could be constructed: all four cysteine residues could be derived from a single CadC subunit (intrasubunit model, Fig. 2 A) or Cys7 and Cys11 from one subunit could form a metal binding site with Cys58 and Cys60 from the other subunit (intersubunit model, Fig. 2 B). As discussed above, the homologous ArsR repressor most likely has intrasubunit binding sites composed of three cysteine residues within a single subunit. On the other hand, intersubunit metal ion binding sites occur in other regulatory proteins. The unrelated homodimeric ArsD As(III)/Sb(IIII)-responsive repressor appears to have four intersubunit binding sites (28Li S. Rosen B.P. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Walmsley A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25992-26002Google Scholar). In the MerR regulator, the single Hg(II) binding site is composed of cysteine residues from both subunits of the homodimer (29Helmann J.D. Ballard B.T. Walsh C.T. Science. 1990; 247: 946-948Google Scholar). Thus both models are reasonable possibilities. The N terminus of apo-SmtB is not visible in the crystal structure, and therefore that structure sheds little light on the structure of the soft metal ion binding sites in the homologous CadC. To evaluate the intrasubunit possibility, CadC was modeled on the SmtB structure with the missing N-terminal residues added as an extended structure, where Cys7 and Cys11 were manually aligned with Cys58 and Cys60 on the same monomer (Fig.2 A). In this model the N terminus was just barely long enough to bring the two pairs of cysteines residues into proximity with each other. Thus, if the intrasubunit model were correct, the N terminus of CadC might be too extended to have secondary structure. Because modeling alone cannot answer the question, an experimental approach was applied to determine the distance between the two pairs of cysteine residues. From the bond angles and distances in model compounds (30Rao C.P. Dorfman J.R. Holm R.H. Inorg. Chem. 1986; 25: 428-439Google Scholar) and proteins with known tetrathiolate Cd(II) binding sites (31Archer M. Carvalho A.L. Teixeira S. Moura I. Moura J.J. Rusnak F. Romao M.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1536-1545Google Scholar), the four sulfur ligands should be ∼2.5 Å from the Cd(II) and 4.5 Å from each other. Cd K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Cd(II)·CadC complex showed a distance of 2.53 Å between metal and sulfur atoms. To examine whether the distance from the sulfur atoms of Cys7 or Cys11 on one subunit could be within 4.5 Å of the sulfur atoms of Cys58 or Cys60 on the other subunit, we used the well-known molecular ruler dibromobimane, which forms a fluorescent adduct linking two thiols that are more than 3 Å but less than 6 Å from each other (32Mornet D., Ue, K. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1658-1662Google Scholar). Wild-type CadC formed fluorescent dimers upon treatment with dibromobimane (Fig. 3). These dimers were resistant to reduction and denaturation with DTT and SDS, consistent with cross-linking between cysteines on the opposite subunits. If cross-linking had occurred between cysteines on the same subunit, only fluorescent monomers would be expected upon denaturation. In fact, both fluorescent monomers and dimers were observed, which might suggest that dibromobimane could produce both intra- and intersubunit cross-links. However, bimane labeling of double mutants that have only Cys7 and Cys11 or Cys58 and Cys60 produced fluorescent monomers but no dimers (Fig. 5). Thus the formation of fluorescent monomers is more likely due to cross-linking of Cys7 with Cys11, and Cys58 with Cys60, within one monomer than to formation of an intrasubunit soft metal ion binding site. However, unambiguous confirmation of the intersubunit model comes from the ability to generate heterodimers with a single cysteine residue in each monomer. Because dibromobimane cross-linking occurred in heterodimers with the four possible combinations of cysteine residues (Fig. 7), both Cys7 and Cys11 on one monomer must be within the range of 4.5 Å of either Cys58 or Cys60 in the other monomer. The most reasonable interpretation of these results is that the two soft metal binding sites in the CadC homodimer are both assembled from Cys7and Cys11 on one monomer and Cys58 and Cys60 on the other monomer. Addendum—We thank Dr. Giedroc for pointing out that the partially oxidized apo-CadC dimer was characterized by an inter- or intrasubunit disulfide bond between Cys7 or Cys11 and Cys58 (not Cys60).

ApoB synthesis is constitutive, and post-translational mechanisms modulate its secretion. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) increased apoB secretion in both differentiated and nondifferentiated Caco-2 cells and decreased secretion in HepG2 cells without affecting apolipoprotein A-I secretion. TGF-β altered apoB secretion by changing steady-state mRNA levels and protein synthesis. Expression of SMAD3 and SMAD4 differentially regulated apoB secretion in these cells.

The gene consists of 29 exons and 28 introns and exists as a 47.5-kb DNase-sensitive domain (7Ludwig E.H. Blackhart B.D. Pierotti V.R. Caiati L. Fortier C. Knott T. Scott J. Mahley R.W.

However, elements required for the transgenic expression of the apob gene in the intestine are located between 54 and 62 kb upstream of the structural gene (11McCormick S.P.A., Ng, J.K. Véniant M.

The apob gene transcription is believed to be constitutive, and apoB levels are thought to change primarily by co- and post-translational mechanisms. First, it was demonstrated that various perturbations that increase apoB secretion do not affect apoB mRNA levels (15Pullinger C.R. North J.D. Teng B.B. Rifici V.A. Ronhild de Brito A.E. Scott J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, it was demonstrated that oleic acid supplementation increases apoB secretion in HepG2 cells by inhibiting the intracellular degradation (16Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies led to the understanding that co- and post-translational mechanisms involving degradation of nascent apoB are primarily involved in the modulation of apoB secretion (17Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

However, apoB expression studies have challenged this concept and indicated that transcriptional mechanisms may also play a role in the control of apoB secretion. For example, the amounts of apoB secreted by rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells stably transfected with human apoB cDNAs were correlated with increases in apoB mRNA levels (22Selby S.L. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1900-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, increased plasma apoB levels were correlated with the human transgene copy number in mice (3Kim E. Young S.G. J.

It is conceivable that human apoB might have escaped the co- and post-translational mechanisms in rats and mice, leading to increased secretion. It is also possible that overexpression might have burdened the post-translational control mechanisms and enhanced apoB secretion. It remains to be determined whether modest changes in the transcription of the endogenous apob gene would affect apoB secretion in human cells. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a family of cytokines that play a widespread role in various biological processes such as growth, development, differentiation, apoptosis, embryogenesis and anti-inflammation (26Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 27Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). These cytokines are produced by most cell types and exert paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine effects by interacting with their cell surface serine/threonine kinase TGF-β receptors type I and type II. TGF-β binds to type II receptors and induces phosphorylation of the type I receptors. The phosphorylated receptor I in turn phosphorylates the receptor SMADs. The phosphorylated receptor SMADs bind to SMAD4, and the complex translocates to the nucleus. The receptor SMADs and SMAD4 complex affects the transcription of various genes by directly interacting with the DNA sequences present in the promoter, enhancer, or repressor elements or through physical interactions with other transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors (26Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar, 27Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation and proteosome-dependent degradation of receptor SMADs in the nucleus provide a way to terminate the TGF-β responses (26Massague J. Annu. Rev.

Invest. 1995; 96: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) have shown that TGF-β levels increase in hepatocytes after injury and in lipocytes during inflammation and fibrosis. HepG2, hepatoma, and Caco-2 (colon carcinoma) cells have been used as models of human hepatic and intestinal cells, respectively, to study lipoprotein assembly and cytokine response (39Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 40Levy E. Mehran M. Seidman E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, TGF-β is expressed constitutively in an autocrine fashion and affects the hepatic gene expression by binding to its cell surface receptors. TGF-β increases apoCIII expression in these cells (31Kardassis D. Pardali K. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41405-41414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cells express many acute phase proteins inducible by cytokines (41Molmenti E.P. Ziambaras T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol.

It has been shown that proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α decrease the secretion of apoB by Caco-2 cells, whereas anti-inflammatory TGF-β increases apoB secretion (42Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Varilek G. Bishop W. Field F.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1996; 270: G94-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of TGF-β on apoB secretion by liver cells has not been described. Here, we show that TGF-β differentially affects apoB secretion in these cells, and this effect is mediated by SMAD3 and SMAD4. Furthermore, acis-element has been localized to 55 kb upstream of theapob gene that responds to TGF-β and increases apoB secretion in Caco-2 cells. Recombinant TGF-β2 was from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies used for the determination of apoB have been described (43Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

In these plasmids, expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) is under the control of various apoB promoter/enhancer elements. The 3TP-Lux construct (a gracious gift from Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY)) contains three AP-1 sites from a collagenase promoter, a SMAD binding region from the PAI-1 promoter, and an adenovirus E4 promoter (46Wieser R.

Caco-2 (human colon carcinoma) cells were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) in 75-mm2 flasks (Corning Glassworks, Corning NY) in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS),l-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. Cells from 70–80% confluent flasks were seeded onto polycarbonate micropore membranes that were inserted into Transwells® (24-mm diameter, 3-μm pore size; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), and then the media were changed every other day for 14–36 days. For experiments, the apical and the basolateral sides were washed three times with DMEM, and the cells were then incubated for 8–24 h in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA. This was to minimize the exposure of these cells to cytokines present in FBS. Cells were then washed and incubated with 2.0 ml of DMEM plus 0.1% BSA on the apical sides of the Transwells. The basolateral sides received 2.0 ml of DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA and different concentrations of either TGF-β1 or TGF-β2. Cells were then incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) for 17 h. The basolateral conditioned media were used for the determination of apoB and apoA-I levels (48Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells were cultivated in 75-mm2flasks (Corning Glass) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,l-glutamine and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells from 70–80% confluent flasks were seeded into six-well plates (Corning Costar Corp.). Subconfluent (70–80%) cell monolayers were washed thrice with DMEM and incubated for 8–24 h in the presence of DMEM plus 0.1% BSA to minimize their exposure to cytokines present in the serum. These cells were then washed and incubated for 17 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere) with 2.0 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% BSA along with different concentrations of either TGF-β1 or TGF-β2. The culture media and cells were collected for further processing. After 17 h of incubation with TGF-β2, differentiated Caco-2 and HepG2 cells were washed with DMEM. HepG2 cells received 2.0 ml of methionine/cysteine-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 10 ng/ml of TGF-β2. In the case of Caco-2 cells, the apical sides received 2.0 ml of methionine/cysteine-free DMEM plus 0.1% BSA, and the basolateral side received 2.0 ml of methionine/cysteine-free DMEM plus 0.1% BSA containing 10 ng/ml of TGF-β2. After 1 h, 100 μCi of Trans-[35S] label were added to each well (to the apical side in the case of Caco-2 cells), and the cells were then incubated for the indicated time periods. Cells were washed with cold DMEM containing methionine and cysteine and were lysed with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm methionine, 1 mm cysteine, and protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were precleared with 10 μl of protein A + G-Sepharose and used for immunoprecipitation. Precleared cell lysates and the media (basolateral media in the case of Caco-2 cells) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a rocker with 5 μl of sheep anti-human apoB antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by adding 20 μl of protein A + G-Sepharose and rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were spun at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 min, and the supernatants were discarded. The pellets were washed three times with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and once with PBS and were finally suspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The suspensions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. The clear supernatants were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to the PhosphorImager screen. The intensity of each band was quantified with ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). HepG2 cells and differentiated Caco-2 cells were incubated for 17 h either with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β2. The total RNA was extracted from the cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA (15 μg) was then run on a denaturing agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 20× SSC (20× 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by exposing it to the UV light. Prehybridization was carried out for 3 h in Quikhyb hybridization solution (Stratagene), and hybridization was carried out in the same solution in the presence of radiolabeled probes and 100 μg/ml denatured and sheared salmon sperm DNA. To prepare different radiolabeled probes, apoB and GAPDH fragments were amplified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). Membranes were then washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen, and RNA levels were quantified with ImageQuant software (AmershamBiosciences). For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA isolated from nontreated and TGF-β-treated Caco-2 and HepG2 cells was used. A blend of Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase provided in the QuantiTect RT Mix (QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to reverse transcribe and amplify apoB and GAPDH sequences. Primers used for apoB and GAPDH were gcactctgcaggggatcccccagatgattggagag and tgatgcccatatttgtcac (apoB) and cagcccagaacatcatccctg and tgttacttataccgatgtcgttg (GAPDH). The reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 15 min and stopped by incubating at 95 °C for 15 min. This treatment also denatures the newly synthesized template cDNA and activates TaqDNA polymerase. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel, and the bands were quantified by scanning. Varying amounts (5–10 μg) of plasmid DNAs along with 1 μg of an internal reference plasmid (pCMV-β-gal) were incubated with Fugene-6 (Roche Diagnostic) and introduced to subconfluent (∼70%) monolayers of Caco-2 and HepG2 cells in 75-mm2 flasks and then incubated for 24 h. An equal number of cells were then transferred to six-well plates or Transwells. After 24 h, the cells were washed with DMEM and incubated for 8 h with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, washed, and treated with or without TGF-β. Three wells received DMEM plus 0.1% BSA containing 10 ng/ml TGF-β, whereas the remaining three wells served as controls (in the case of Transwells, TGF-β was added to the basolateral side). The cells were incubated for 17 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere, and the medium (from the basolateral side in the case of Transwells) was collected and assayed for apoB mass. Cells were washed and collected in lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used for the determination of cellular protein levels and different enzyme activities. Cell protein was quantified by the Bradford method (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) using Coomassie Blue reagent (Pierce). ApoB and apoA-I were quantified by sandwich ELISA (43Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 44Bakillah A. Zhou Z. Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase and CAT activities were assayed as described previously (50Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 51Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The CAT activity levels were quantified with PhosphorImager analysis and the ImageQuant program and were corrected for transfection efficiencies between the flasks by dividing with the β-galactosidase activity values. Luciferase activity was measured as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp.). To investigate the effect of TGF-β on apoB secretion by HepG2 and differentiated (17–20 days postplating), Caco-2 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of TGF-β2 (Fig.1). The amount of apoB secreted by the control Caco-2 and HepG2 cells was 944 ± 59 and 1266 ± 82 ng/well, respectively, in agreement with our earlier studies (44Bakillah A. Zhou Z. Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. Lipids. 1997; 32: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 48Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1391: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In Caco-2 cells, TGF-β2 showed a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of apoB secreted into the basolateral medium. At 10 ng/ml, TGF-β2 increased apoB secretion by 56 ± 10%. The increases ranged from 20 to 80% in different experiments. At higher concentrations, no further increase in apoB secretion was observed, indicating that the maximum effect was achieved at 10 ng/ml TGF-β2. In contrast, TGF-β2 showed a concentration-dependent decrease in the amount of apoB secreted by HepG2 cells (Fig. 1). The decrease in apoB secretion was 20% at 5 ng/ml and reached a maximum of 30% inhibition at 15 ng/ml. Next, we compared the effect of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 on apoB secretion in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). Both TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 augmented (16–25%) apoB secretion in Caco-2 cells and attenuated (23–30%) apoB secretion in HepG2 cells, indicating that both of these molecules have similar biologic effects. In subsequent experiments, we only used TGF-β2 because of more consistent results and relatively better responses. To determine the earliest time point required for TGF-β2 to exert its effects on apoB secretion, we performed time course experiments. These experiments revealed that statistically significant differential effects on apoB secretion in both cell lines were first apparent after 8 h of treatment (data not shown). These studies showed that TGF-β differentially regulates apoB secretion in intestine and liver-derived cell lines. In the studies described above, a major difference between Caco-2 and HepG2 cells was their state of differentiation; the Caco-2 cells were plated in Transwells and allowed to differentiate for about 2 weeks, whereas HepG2 cells were used 2–3 days after plating. Thus, diverse effects of TGF-β might be related to the differentiation of Caco-2 cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of TGF-β on Caco-2 cells after 2 days of plating along with HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). As seen before, treatment of HepG2 cells with TGF-β decreased apoB secretion by ∼25%. As expected, nondifferentiated Caco-2 cells secreted (54 ± 7 ng/well) significantly smaller amounts of apoB than the differentiated cells (see above), in agreement with other studies (48Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,52Luchoomun J. Zhou Z. Bakillah A. Jamil H. Hussain M.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, treatment of these cells increased apoB secretion by 26% (Fig. 3). These experiments were extended to study the effect of TGF-β during the entire course of differentiation of Caco-2 cells. Determination of the differentiation of Caco-2 cells by measuring sucrase activity has been described before (48Lucho"
https://openalex.org/W2081928299,"Vav family proteins are members of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and activators of Rho family small GTPases. In addition to the Dbl homology (DH) domain important for guanine nucleotide exchange factor catalytic function, all Dbl family proteins contain an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that serves to regulate DH domain activity. Although the role of the PH domain in Vav function has been evaluated extensively, its precise role and whether it serves a distinct role in different Vav proteins remain unresolved. Additionally, the precise role of an adjacent cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in regulating DH domain function is also unclear. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of these putative protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction domains to Vav signaling and transforming activity. In contrast to previous observations, we found that the PH domain is critical for Vav transforming activity. Similarly, the CRD was also essential and served a function distinct from that of the PH domain. Although mutation of either domain reduced Vav membrane association, addition of plasma membrane targeting sequences to either the CRD or PH domain mutant proteins did not restore Vav transforming activity. This result contrasts with other Dbl family proteins, where a membrane targeting sequence alone was sufficient to restore the loss of function caused by mutation of the PH domain. Furthermore, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins containing the PH domain or CRD, or both, failed to target to the plasma membrane, suggesting that these two domains also serve regulatory functions independent of promoting membrane localization. Finally, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation may promote Vav membrane association via phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate binding to the PH domain.

Rho family protein function is controlled by a regulated GDP/GTP cycle. Whereas Dbl family proteins function as GEFs and stimulate the formation of the active GTP-bound protein, GTPase activating proteins promote formation of the inactive GDP-bound protein. The GTP-bound protein is the active form and interacts with a spectrum of downstream effector targets to stimulate signaling pathways that regulate actin cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (6Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Vav was first identified as a transforming protein where NH2-terminal truncation of negative regulatory sequences converted Vav into a constitutively activated GEF. Subsequently, two closely related proteins, Vav2 and Vav3, were identified that shared strong sequence similarity (approximately 70%) and structural topography with Vav. Overlapping, as well as very distinct, functions have been described for the different Vav proteins (7Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). All Dbl family proteins share a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) that is followed invariantly by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Although PH domains can be found on signaling molecules other than Dbl family proteins (15Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the invariant DH/PH domain organization suggests that the PH domain serves as a critical regulator of DH domain function. Current evidence suggests two roles for the PH domain in regulating DH domain function. First, the mutation of the PH domains of several Dbl family proteins (Lfc and Dbs) has been shown to abolish their transforming activity, and the addition of the plasma membrane targeting sequence of Ras proteins can restore transforming activity (16Whitehead I.P.

In contrast, the critical function of the PH domain of Dbl could not be restored by addition of a plasma membrane targeting sequence (18Zheng Y. Zangrilli D. Cerione R.A. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19017-19020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the PH domain can serve simply as a membrane targeting sequence for some but not all Dbl family proteins. Whether the PH domain of Vav serves such a role has not been determined. A second function of the PH domain may be to serve as a negative, intramolecular regulator of DH domain function. Broek and colleagues found that the PH domain of Vav, like other PH domains (19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), can bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (20Han J.

Whereas PIP2 association with proto-Vav did not promote its GEF function, PIP3-mediated dissociation of PIP2 binding enhanced its GEF function in vitro. Mutations in the PH domain that impaired PIP2/PIP3 binding caused increased GEF function. Thus, a model was proposed where PIP2 association with the PH domain served as a negative regulator of DH domain function, and the loss of PIP2 binding caused by PIP3 binding relieved this negative regulation. Consistent with a negative regulatory role, Abrams and colleagues (22Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that mutation of the PH domain of full-length Vav led to a constitutively activated protein. In contrast, the PH domain was found to be dispensable for Vav3 biological activity (13Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), whereas we recently determined that the PH domain served a critical positive regulatory role for Vav2 function (23Booden M.A. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2487-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that the PH domain serves divergent functions for the closely related Vav proteins. Beyond the DH/PH domain structure, Dbl family proteins show little or no sequence similarities in their remaining sequences (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In addition to the DH and PH domains, Vav family proteins also contain a diverse array of putative protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction domains that can potentially serve as negative or positive regulators of Vav function (reviewed in Refs. 7Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 24Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The NH2terminus of Vav contains a leucine-rich, calponin homology and an acidic amino acid-rich domain. Because NH2-terminal truncation of these sequences converts Vav to a potent transforming protein, these sequences serve as negative regulators of Vav function (25Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following the PH domain, Vav contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, and a SH2 domain at its COOH terminus (27Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This domain organization is conserved in all three Vav family proteins. Although introduction of missense mutations into the SH2 and SH3 domains caused a loss of Vav transforming activity (28Groysman M. Nagano M. Shaanan B. Katzav S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1597-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,29Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar), subsequent deletion analyses showed that all the SH2/SH3 domains were dispensable for the transforming activity of all three Vav proteins (10Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23Booden M.A. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2487-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The basis for these contrasting observations is not known. In contrast to the SH domains, either missense mutation or deletion of the CRD has shown that this domain is critical for the biological function of all three Vav proteins (10Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23Booden M.A. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2487-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Diff. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise role of the CRD in Vav function still remains to be elucidated, CRDs in other proteins have been shown to facilitate translocation to the plasma membrane, e.g. the CRDs of protein kinase C or RasGRP proteins bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, which in turn promote their translocation to the plasma membrane (31Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32Sharkey N.A. Leach K.L. Blumberg P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 33Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mutation of the CRD of RasGRP causes a loss of transforming activity, and addition of a plasma membrane targeting sequence can restore the loss of CRD function. Although the CRD of the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase does not bind diacylglycerol or phorbol esters, it can interact with Ras to facilitate Raf-1 association with the plasma membrane to allow activation of its kinase function (34Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The CRD of Raf-1 also binds the 14-3-3 adaptor protein as well as phospholipids. Thus, although the CRD of Vav does not bind diacylglycerol, it may still serve as a protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction domain that facilitates Vav association with the plasma membrane. Despite extensive analyses, the precise contribution and functions of the PH domain and CRD to Vav signaling and transformation remain unclear. Conflicting observations have been made that may reflect differences in experimental analyses. To attempt to clarify the role of these two domains in regulating Vav DH domain function, we have evaluated their functions within the context of the minimal functional unit of Vav, the DH/PH/CRD fragment. This approach avoids potential complications that may arise from the presence of other interaction domains present in Vav. Another issue that we have addressed is whether these domains serve similar or distinct functions for other Vav proteins. To accomplish this, we have taken the identical approaches that we have used recently to study the role of the PH domain and CRD in Vav2 function (23Booden M.A. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2487-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We found that, identical to our observations with Vav2, the PH domain and CRD of Vav are both critical for Vav biological activity. Thus, we find no isoform differences in PH domain or CRD function for Vav proteins. Additionally, whereas both domains do facilitate DH domain association with membranes, alone they do not function as membrane targeting sequences nor can their functions be replaced by plasma membrane targeting sequences. Finally, we determined a limited role for PI3K activation in promoting Vav membrane association and activity. cDNA sequences encoding mutations in the SH3 domains were made using the Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mouse proto-vav cDNA sequences subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCTV3HA, which contains sequences from a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at its NH2 terminus, has been described previously (16Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 271: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Diff. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar). A 730-base pair (bp) HpaI fragment containing a uniqueBamHI site at the COOH-terminal end of Vav, just prior to the start of the first SH3 domain, was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This fragment was ligated to the pCR 2.1 vector from the TA cloning kit (Stratagene), sequenced, and then used as the template DNA for mutagenesis. To generate the single mutations within each SH3 domain (W636K and W820K), mutagenic primers (5′-ATT CCT TCC CTC CCA CTT GTT GTG CTC AGC CTC and 5′-GAT CTC CCC ACG CCA CTT GCC TTG CTG TCC) were used, respectively, along with a XhoI →ClaI selection site primer (5′-CCC TCT AGA TGC ATG ATC GAT CGG CCG CCA GTG). When the mutations were verified by sequencing, the double mutant was constructed by using the W820K mutant sequence as a template, the W636K mutagenic primer, and a second HindIII → SalI selection site primer (5′-GCT CGG TAC CGT CGA CGG CGT AAT CAT GG). The pCR 2.1 plasmids containing the correct mutations were then digested with HpaI and ligated to pCTV3HA. This plasmid was then digested with BamHI and a 2.3-kilobase (kb) fragment containing the appropriate mutations, and 1.5 kb of the COOH terminus of pCTV3HA was isolated. To complete the sequences with the NH2-terminal portion of vav, pCTV3HA ΔN-186vav (described in Ref. 26Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was digested withBamHI and the NH2-terminal sequences were ligated to the SH3 domain mutant BamHI fragments. ΔN-186vav ΔC was constructed in a similar fashion as was done for proto-vavΔC (described in Ref. 26Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except that aFseI/BsiWI ΔN-186 vav fragment was used instead of a FseI/BsiWI proto-vavfragment. cDNA sequences encoding amino acid substitutions in the PH domain were generated by PCR-mediated oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. These constructs all terminated just prior to the first SH3 domain similar to the ΔN-186 VavΔC mutants. Because the lysine residue at position 404 lies close to the unique FseI site in Vav, the K404A PH mutant could be made directly from the 5′ primer (5′-CA GTT AAC GGC CGG CCC GCG ATT GAC GGT GAG CTC). The 3′ primer corresponding to amino acids 594–600 (3′-CA GTT AAC CTA CTA GGA TCC CTT AGG CAG ACC CAA TTC) contains two stop codons flanked by aBamHI site and a HpaI site at the 3′ end. The W495L mutant was generated by four primer PCR using the uniqueFseI site. Two fragments were generated, a 280-bp fragment (5′-CA GTT AAC GGC CGG CCC AAG ATT GAC GGT GAG and 3′-CG AAC TGT TCC ATC AGC TTC TTC TTC AGC) and a 330-bp fragment (5′-GAG CTG AAG AAG AAG CTG ATG GAA CAG TTC G and 3′-CAG GCC GGC CAG GAT CCC ATA GTA TTC CTG AAA CAC TT), which were then annealed together and amplified by PCR. Sequences encoding both PH mutants K404A and W495L were contained in a 610-bp fragment, which was then digested with HpaI and ligated into the pCTV3HA plasmid. This plasmid was digested withFseI/BsiWI and ligated to the pCTV3HA ΔN-186FseI/BsiWI fragment to complete the construct. The pCTV3HA ΔN-186 vavΔCRD mutant was constructed by PCR utilizing the same 5′ primer used for the W495L PH domain mutant and a 3′ primer (3′-CA GTT AAC CTA CTA GGA TCC CCC ATT GGC TGT AGC ATT) corresponding to residues 509–515 with two stop codons flanked by aBamHI and a HpaI site at the 3′ end. This 333-bp fragment was digested with HpaI and ligated into pCTV3HA. To add the remaining NH2-terminal sequences, the pCTV3HA construct was digested with FseI/BsiWI and ligated to the FseI/BsiWI fragment from pCTV3HA ΔN-186 vav. To make membrane targeting versions of ΔN-186 vavΔC PH(K404A), ΔN-186 vavΔC PH(W495L), and ΔN-186vavΔCRD, sequences encoding the last 18 remaining amino acids from K-ras4B (includes a polylysine-rich region and the CAAX prenylation signal CVIM) were ligated to each construct at the BamHI restriction enzyme site just prior to the tandem stop codons. Briefly, two primers corresponding to the aforementioned K-ras4B sequences (5′-CA GTT AAC GGA TCC AGC AAA GAT GGT AAA AAG AAG AAA AAG AAG TCA AAG ACA AAG TGT GTA ATT ATG TAA; 3′-CA GTT AAC TTA CAT AAT TAC ACA CTT TGT CTT TGA CTT CTT TTT CTT CTT TTT ACC ATC TTT GCT) containing HpaI restriction enzyme sites at each end and a novel BamHI at the 5′ end were annealed together and then digested with HpaI. The 75-bp fragment was ligated to a HpaI-digested pCTV3HA expression vector (pCTV3HAvav-CAAX). Because the cognate vector pCTV3HA contains a unique BamHI restriction enzyme site downstream from its multiple cloning site, digestion of pCTV3HAvav-CAAX with BamHI derives a 1.6-kb fragment that can be ligated to the BamHI site introduced into the mutated PH domain and ΔCRD constructs. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion expression constructs of thevav PH, CRD, and PH/CRD domains were constructed by PCR amplification of these regions from the cDNA sequence in ΔN-186vav in pAX142. The PH domain containing amino acids 368–517 was amplified with primers incorporating an in-frame 5′ XhoI restriction site and a stop codon adjacent to a 3′ HindIII site. The CRD and PH/CRD encoding fragments were created in similar fashions to include amino acids 507–573 and 368–573, respectively. The digested fragments were ligated into theXhoI/HindIII sites of the pEGFP-C3 mammalian expression vector (Clontech). The products were verified by sequencing. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and 293T human kidney epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum or fetal calf serum, respectively. DNA transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (35Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For transformation studies, the cognate empty vector was used as a control. The transfected cultures were maintained in culture for 14 days, fixed, and stained with crystal violet (0.5%), and then the number of foci of transformed cells was quantitated. To establish cell lines that stably expressed the Vav mutants, transfected NIH 3T3 cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with hygromycin (400 μg/ml) and multiple drug-resistant colonies (>100) were pooled together after 10 days of selection to establish mass populations of stably transfected cells. Transient transfections using various reporter plasmids to determine transcriptional activity were performed as described previously (36Hauser C.A. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, allowed to recover for 30 h, and were then serum-starved (0.5% calf serum) for 14–15 h before lysing with luciferase lysis buffer (Amersham Biosciences). For the ΔN-186 Vav and p110-CAAX cooperation assays, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. After transfection, these cells were treated exactly as described above. The p110-CAAX construct was described previously (37Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The lysates were analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescent reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence). All the assays were performed at least in triplicate. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (26Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of the pAX142 empty vector or pAX142 constructs encoding ΔN-186 Vav, ΔN-186 VavΔC, the ΔN-186 VavΔC PH domain mutants, and the ΔN-186 VavΔCRD mutants. After transient transfection, 293T cells were grown for 48 h, then gently washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1 ml of cold TSA buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.14m NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were homogenized and centrifuged (15,000 × g) to acquire total (T) protein (200 μl of supernatant). The remaining supernatant was then centrifuged (100,000 × g) in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor for 2 h to separate the supernatant into crude cytosolic (S100) and membrane and cytoskeletal protein containing (P100) fractions. The protein concentrations of the total, cytosolic, and membrane samples were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein fractions (25 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and probed with anti-HA epitope antibody (Babco). Protein concentrations of the transiently transfected 293T cells or in the NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing the Vav mutants were determined by the BCA kit (Pierce). Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis and detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and the anti-HA epitope antibody as described previously (38Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Jordan J.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-C3 vector or pEGFP-C3 constructs encoding GFP-Vav PH, GFP-Vav PH/CRD, or GFP-Vav CRD, or the previously reported pEGFP-C1 Akt-PH and pEGFP-N1 PKCγ-C1A-(26–89) (39Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 40Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) following the suggested protocol. After transfection, cells were grown in DMEM with 10% calf serum for 6 h and then serum-starved in DMEM for 18 h. The cells were washed once with PBS and kept in PBS for visualization of live cells. For dishes that were serum-stimulated, images were taken 60 s after addition of PBS supplemented with 10% calf serum. Microscopy was performed on an Olympus Fluoview FV 300 laser scanning biological microscope. Images are stacks of serial scans taken through each cell at 0.4-μm thickness. Previous studies showed that point mutations in the SH2 domain or the COOH-terminal SH3 domain decreased Vav transforming activity (28Groysman M. Nagano M. Shaanan B. Katzav S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1597-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar, 30Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Diff. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other studies found that deletion of the entire SH3/SH2/SH3 domains of Vav proteins did not cause loss of transforming activity (10Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell.

The basis for these opposite observations is not clear but may reflect different consequences of missense and deletion mutagenesis, or alternatively, differences in Vav constructs used. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the consequences of missense and deletion mutations of the SH3 domains of the NH2-terminal truncated and highly transforming ΔN-186 Vav mutant protein. Mutation of the conserved tryptophan present in a majority of SH3 domains to lysine has been shown to disrupt the function of other SH3 domains (41Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D.

It has been shown that the reduced flavins generated by Fre can regulate the activity of the aerobic ribonucleotide reductases by regenerating or scavenging the Tyr122 radical of the ribonucleotide reductase in vitro (1Fontecave M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of Fre with or without bound Rfl, revealing that Fre is similar to members of the ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase family in structure, although the similarities in amino acid sequence between Fre and members of the ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase family are low. The crystal structure shows that Fre is organized into an N-terminal flavin-binding domain and a C-terminal NAD(P)H-binding domain; the secondary structures of the two domains are labeled as F and N, respectively. The most interesting feature is that the loop connecting Fβ5 and Fα1 in the flavin-binding domain that normally interacts with the ADP moiety of FAD in other ferredoxin:NADP+ reductases is exceptionally short in Fre (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consequently, although FAD is a bound cofactor in most ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase proteins, all three flavin substrates of Fre do not remain bound (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because the crystal structure of the Fre·Rfl complex revealed the interactions between the isoalloxazine ring of Rfl and the flavin-binding domain (12Louie T.M. Webster C.M. Xun L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3492-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and because the K m values of Fre for Rfl, FMN, and FAD are very similar (2Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30392-30400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that all three flavins mainly interact with residues of the flavin-binding domain through the isoalloxazine ring. However, direct experimental data are unavailable to support the proposed interactions of Fre with FMN and FAD. In this report we characterized FAD and FMN binding to Fre. TheK d values of Fre with FAD and FMN were determined. The value with FAD was much smaller than that with FMN or Rfl. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Fre with FAD predicted that the ribityl side chain and the ADP moiety of FAD confer extra stability to the Fre·FAD complex. Experimental data supported the simulation model. Studies on the physiological roles of the high affinity of Fre for FAD revealed that FAD is a preferred substrate and inhibitor of Fre. An in vivo model for regulating Fre activities in responding to O2 supply is proposed. All reagents were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Fisher Scientific Co. HpaB, an FADH2-utilizing 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase, was overproduced and purified from E. coliBL21(DE3) carrying pES2 (11Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the clonedfre gene in E. coli BL21(DE3)(pES1) and purification of Fre were done primarily as reported previously (11Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To ensure Fre of the highest purity, a phenyl-agarose chromatography was added to the previously reported procedures. The ammonium sulfate precipitated proteins were dissolved in 20 mm KPi buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm DTT with 25% saturation of ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a phenyl-agarose (Sigma) column (1.5 × 12.5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (25% to 0%, 200 ml) in KPi buffer with 1 mm DTT at a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1. Active fractions eluted with ∼10% saturation of ammonium sulfate were pooled together and dialyzed against several changes of 20 mm KPi buffer (pH 7.0) with 1 mm DTT overnight. The sample was then purified by going through a Bioscale Q column and Superdex 75 column as reported previously (11Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). ESI-MS was done with a Waters Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer. Fre samples in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) were acidified with formic acid to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) and infused into the electrospray ionization source at a flow rate of 10 μl·min−1. The electrospray ionization source temperature and the desolvation temperature were maintained at 90 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The capillary voltage and the cone voltage were 3400 V and 35 V, respectively. Spectra were scanned fromm/z 800 to 3000 at a rate of 1 scan/s. Protein mass spectrum was deconvoluted using the MaxEnt software (Waters). NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the oxidation of NADH (ε340 = 6220m−1·cm−1) in 20 mmKPi buffer (pH 7.0) containing 450 μm NADH and 10 μm FMN or FAD at 30 °C. One unit of NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase activity was defined as the oxidation of 1 nmol NADH/min. A Fre-HpaB coupled assay was performed with 50 nmFre and 10 μm HpaB in 20 μl of 20 mm KPi buffer (pH 7.0) containing 80 μm NADH and 500 μm 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, with either 5 μmeach of FAD and FMN or only 5 μm FAD. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the amount of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate produced was measured by a previously reported HPLC method (11Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array detector (Waters) and a Biosep Sec-S3000 size-exclusion column (7.8 × 300 mm; Phenomenex) was used to estimate the fraction of Fre molecules that contained tightly bound flavins. Pure Fre (200 μg) was eluted from the column with an isocratic flow of 20 mm KPi (pH 7.0) buffer with 1 mm DTT at 0.5 ml·min−1. The amount of flavin co-eluted with Fre was estimated by comparing the elution peak area of Fre derived at 450 nm with the elution peak area of free flavin standards. The same HPLC system equipped with a Delta Pak C18-300Å reverse phase column (3.9 × 150 mm; Waters) was used to determine the nature of the tightly bound flavin. Fre sample (80 μg) was eluted from the column with a 33-ml linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0–70%) with a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1. Retention time of the flavin dissociated from Fre was compared with those of free flavin standards. The dissociation constants, K d, of the Fre·FAD and Fre·FMN complexes were determined by a spectrofluorometric titration method using a spectrofluorometer (Jobin Ybon Fluorlog). A 48 μm Fre solution in 20 mmKPi buffer (pH 7.4) was titrated with various amounts of flavin added from a 50 μm stock solution, and the change in fluorescence after each addition of flavin was recorded. The excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm, and fluorescence emission of Fre was recorded from 300 to 400 nm at 5-nm intervals. Both excitation and emission monochromator slit widths were set at 5 nm. The fluorescence intensity of Fre was plotted against the ratio of initial concentration of FAD to Fre and fitted with the following equation Ifit=κI0Fre0+xI0−I1Equation 1 in which κ is a scaling constant to compare the model with experimental data, I 0 is the fluorescence intensity of Fre, [Fre]0 is the initial concentration of Fre at that titration point, I 1 is the fluorescence intensity of the Fre·FAD complex, and x is the final concentration of the Fre·FAD complex. The value ofx is calculated by the following equation. x=Fre0+FAD0+Kd−Fre0+FAD0+Kd2−4Fre0FAD02Equation 2 The effect of AMP on the K d of Fre for FAD was also determined. The experimental setup was identical to that described above, except that 0.18 mm AMP was included in the solution. The initial geometries of the Fre·FAD and Fre·FMN complexes were based on the crystal structure of the Fre·Rfl complex (from Dr. Vincent Nivière of the Université Joseph Fourier). The complete protein sequence was reconstituted and annealed by MD simulations using the package GROMACS (15Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7194) Google Scholar, 16Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) running on a dual-CPU Linux work station. MD simulations were performed in the presence of 4895 water molecules of simple point charge as solvent. Periodical conditions were imposed for the triclinic simulation box. The GROMOS-96 43a1 force field was used for the Fre·FMN simulation, whereas the GROMACS force field was used for the Fre·FAD simulation. After the initial energy minimization and subsequent relaxation runs, the system was allowed to further equilibrate for another 800 ps with Berendsen-type temperature (300 K) and pressure (1.0 atm) coupling to an external bath. A 1-ns trajectory was recorded for each of the Fre·FAD and Fre·FMN runs. Hydrogen bonding analyses between Fre and the flavin substrate were performed. A hydrogen bond is registered when the distance between the hydrogen bonding donor (OH and NH) and acceptor (O: and N:) is less than 0.25 nm. Root mean square deviation clustering analysis was performed every 5 ps along the trajectory to locate the representative structure for the complexes. In the full-linkage clustering algorithm, a structure is added to the existing cluster when its distance to any element of the cluster is less than the 0.1-nm cutoff. The 5-ps structures were categorized according to their root mean square deviation values. A structure from the middle of the root mean square deviation distribution was extracted from the MD trajectory as the representative configuration. The inhibitory effects of FAD on Fre activity were examined in the presence of NADPH and FMN. Reciprocal initial velocities were plotted against the reciprocal substrate (NADPH or FMN) concentrations at various fixed concentrations of FAD to determine the nature of the inhibitions. Inhibition constants were then determined from the Michaelis-Menten plots fitted with Equation 3 (for competitive inhibition) and Equation 4 (for mixed inhibition) Vo=Vmax[S]KM1+[I]Ki+[S]Equation 3 Vo=Vmax[S]KM1+[I]Ki+1+[I]Ki′[S]Equation 4 using the GraFit 5.0 program (Erithacus Software Ltd.). The apparent kinetic parameters of Fre for the NADPH-FMN substrate pair were also determined from Michaelis-Menten plots fitted with the following equation Vo=Vmax[S]KM+[S]Equation 5 using the GraFit program. Forty-five mg of Fre was purified from 289 mg of protein in the cell extracts. The protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified Fre was acidified and analyzed by ESI-MS; the molecular weight of Fre was determined to be 26,115 ± 5, which is practically identical to Fre's theoretical molecular weight of 26,111 calculated from the amino acid sequence. No other major molecular mass was detected by ESI-MS, further validating the purity of the Fre preparation. The purified Fre had a specific activity of 69,230 ± 295 units·mg−1 when reducing FMN with NADH as the electron donor at 30 °C. The highly concentrated and pure Fre had a pale yellow color, suggesting the possibility of flavins being bound to Fre. The specific flavin bound to Fre was further tested. When 200 μg (∼8 nmol) of Fre was loaded onto an HPLC size-exclusion column, we detected a small amount of flavin co-eluted with the Fre based on the absorption spectrum recorded by the photodiode array detector (Fig.1). The flavin peak was centered at the beginning of the protein peak, consistent with the slightly larger molecular weight of the Fre·flavin complex as compared with that of Fre alone. After integrating the peak area of the flavin peak that co-eluted with Fre and comparing it with the peak area of free FMN standards, our data showed that ∼0.13 nmol equivalent of FMN was co-eluted with Fre. When Fre was loaded onto a C18 reverse phase HPLC column, the Fre-bound flavin was dissociated from the protein, with a retention time of 9.938 min (Fig.2). A typical absorption spectrum of a flavin molecule was clearly detected (Fig. 2, inset). The respective retention times of free FAD, FMN, and Rfl standards were 9.985, 10.155, and 10.898 min, suggesting that the Fre-bound flavin is possibly FAD. This possibility was further examined by loading 25 μl of a mixture of Fre (0.14 μm) with either FMN or FAD (0.24 μm) onto the HPLC size-exclusion column. About 25% of FAD in the Fre-FAD mixture was co-eluted with Fre, but only 2.2% of FMN in the Fre-FMN mixture was co-eluted with Fre.Figure 2HPLC analysis of Fre by a C18reverse phase column. Fre sample (80 μg) was eluted from the column with a 33-ml linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0–70%) with a flow rate of 1 ml·min−1. A minor peak with maximal absorption at 450 nm (dashed line) was eluted from the column at 9.938 min, whereas a major peak with maximal absorption at 280 nm (solid line) was eluted from the column at 26.0 min. Inset,absorption spectrum of the 9.938-min peak with maximal absorptions at 372 and 450 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Aliquots of FAD solution were added to a 48 μm Fre solution in 20 mm KPi (pH 7.4) buffer. The binding of FAD to Fre quenched the fluorescence of Fre, resulting in a gradual decrease in the fluorescence intensity of Fre (Fig. 3,inset). The K d for FAD was determined to be 29 ± 9 nm after plotting the fluorescence intensity of Fre against the ratio of the added FAD concentration to the initial Fre concentration (Fig. 3). Using a similar methodology, the K d for FMN was determined to be 1.5 ± 0.2 μm. The lowK d value for FAD is not consistent with the previous hypothesis that the isoalloxazine rings of the flavin substrates provide the major determinant for the binding of the three flavins to Fre and that the flavins have similar affinity for Fre (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the ribityl moiety and the ADP moiety of FAD might interact with other structural elements in Fre and provide extra stability for the Fre·FAD complex. To test this hypothesis, the structure of the Fre·FAD complex was modeled by MD simulations. MD simulations showed that FAD could adopt an unusual bent conformation (Fig. 4 A). Amino acid residues located in the loop connecting Fβ5 and Fα1 in the flavin-binding domain (e.g. Gly65 and Asn70) and at the proposed NAD(P)H-binding site (e.g. Thr112, Gln143, and Arg202) were shown to form additional H-bonding with the ribityl side chain and the ADP moiety of FAD (Fig. 4 B). Specifically, the MD trajectory showed that there were 8.03 ± 2.13 (3,600 (average) 0.5-ps snapshots of a 900-ns trajectory with S.D.) hydrogen bonds between the Fre protein matrix and the FAD substrate, whereas there were only 4.75 ± 1.72 hydrogen bonds between Fre and FMN. The number of hydrogen bonds appeared to vary with time, reflecting the dynamic nature of the Fre·FAD complex. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 B, in which we show two snapshots of the hydrogen-bonding network around FAD. The computer modeling of the Fre·FAD complex suggested that the ADP moiety of FAD interacts dynamically with amino acid residues located at the proposed NAD(P)H-binding site. This hypothesis was further examined. TheK d value for FAD was determined to be 83 ± 25 nm in the presence of 0.18 mm AMP, a known competitive inhibitor of Fre with respect to NAD(P)H (with reportedK i values ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 mm) (2Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30392-30400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Nivière V. Fieschi F. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This K d value is almost 3 times larger than the K d value determined in the absence of AMP. The effect of FAD as an inhibitor for Fre activity was studied using NADPH as the electron donor and FMN as the major electron acceptor. It has been reported that the K m,NADPH of Fre is 14,000 μm with a k cat of 16 s−1 if FAD is the sole electron acceptor (5Nivière V. Fieschi F. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the highest concentration of NADPH used in our inhibitory study was 415 μm, Fre did not have any detectable activity for FAD reduction due to the large K m,NADPH value. Because FAD was practically not a substrate for Fre under the assay conditions, its inhibitory effect on FMN reduction with NADPH was studied. Fre activity was determined as a function of NADPH concentration (83–415 μm) in the presence of a fixed concentration of FMN (10 μm) at several concentrations of FAD. The double-reciprocal plots showed a series of lines converged at a point to the left of the y axis (Fig.5 A), indicating that FAD is a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to NADPH with a K iof 0.43 ± 0.07 μm and a Ki' of 0.59 ± 0.17 μm; the apparent K m,NADPH was 418 ± 41 μm. When Fre activity was determined as a function of FMN concentration (2–10 μm) in the presence of a fixed concentration of NADPH (200 μm) at several concentrations of FAD, FAD exhibited a typical competitive inhibition effect (Fig 5 B), with a K i of 0.10 ± 0.01 μm and an apparent K m,FMN of 2.0 ± 0.2 μm. The effect of FAD on the activity of Fre for FMN reduction with NADH as the electron donor was also studied. Because FAD reduction by Fre is much slower than FMN reduction when NADH is less than 100 μm (5Nivière V. Fieschi F. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the effect of FAD was studied by measuring the Fre activity under a fixed concentration of NADH (80 μm) and FMN (10 μm), with various FAD concentrations. FAD at 1 μm reduced the rate of NADH consumption of Fre by 13%, and at 10 μm, FAD reduced the rate by 45% (Fig.6). The decrease was shown to be due to the preferential reduction of FAD when the amount of produced FADH2 was measured by HpaB, an FADH2-utilizing 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase that does not use FMNH2 (11Xun L. Sandvik E.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HpaB was used in excess to ensure ultimate usage of FADH2 produced in the assay. After a 30-min incubation, 1.6 nmol of NADH was consumed, and 1.7 ± 0.1 nmol (average of three samples ± S.D.) of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate was produced with FAD alone in the assay; whereas 1.4 ± 0.1 nmol of the product was formed in the presence of equal concentrations of FMN and FAD. Therefore, about 82% of the NADH was used to reduce FAD under the assay conditions containing 5 μm each of FAD and FMN, with the remainder used for FMN reduction. Fre had a much higher affinity for FAD than for FMN. TheK d value for the Fre·FAD complex (29 ± 9 nm) was 52 times lower than that of FMN (1.5 ± 0.2 μm). The K d values for Rfl and lumichrome, a flavin analog, are 3.6 and 0.5 μm (17Nivière V. Fieschi F. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16656-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Nivière V. Vanoni M.A. Zanetti G. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11879-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, among its flavin substrates, Fre binds FAD the most tightly. The tight binding was also observed by the co-elution of FAD with Fre from the HPLC size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1). Results of the MD simulations (Fig. 4 A) showed that not only the isoalloxazine ring of FAD but also the ribityl side chain and the ADP moiety were involved in binding to Fre, offering theoretical support for tighter binding for FAD than for FMN of Rfl. On the basis of the crystallized Fre·Rfl structure, which shows only one direct H-bond from the 2′-OH of the ribityl side chain to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro47(on Fβ4) (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the similar K m values for Rfl, FMN, and FAD, it has been hypothesized that Fre binds Rfl, FMN, and FAD mainly through the isoalloxazine ring (1Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proposed interaction is real for Rfl and FMN, but not for FAD. The MD simulations predicted the formation of 3.28 extra H-bonds on average from the ribityl side chain and ADP moiety of FAD with Fre (Fig. 4 B). Considering the energy of a typical H-bond to be 2.9–7.2 kcal/mol (19Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 176Google Scholar), the extra H-bonds in the Fre·FAD complex contribute to a significant stabilization energy (enthalpy) of 9.5–23.6 kcal/mol, in comparison with the Fre·FMN complex. This stabilization energy should be viewed as an upper bound, because entropy (e.g. the bent conformation and larger size of the FAD can increase the entropy of the Fre·FAD complex) will reduce the stabilization. This view is consistent with the extra stabilization energy (free energy) of 2.3 kcal/mol calculated from the determined K d values of the Fre·FAD complex relative to the Fre·FMN complex. The bent conformation of FAD predicted by MD simulations is similar to the conformation adopted by the FAD prosthetic group in the E. coli flavodoxin reductase, in which FAD exhibits a U-shaped conformation (20Ingelman M. Bianchi V. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the flavodoxin reductase also lacks a full-size adenosine-interacting loop connecting Fβ5 and Fα1, as does Fre. Structure-based sequence alignment of Fre with the flavodoxin reductase shows that two flavodoxin reductase residues that H-bond with the ribityl side chain and the adenine ring of the FAD prosthetic group (Arg50 and Thr116) are conserved in Fre (Arg46 and Thr112) (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Ingelman M. Bianchi V. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonding of Thr112 with FAD is captured by snapshot of MD simulations (Fig. 4), whereas the dynamic interaction of Arg46 with FAD is not presented in the snapshot. The flavodoxin reductase has a Trp248 residue at the C terminus, which provides additional interaction with the adenine ring of FAD. Such a Trp residue is not present in the Fre C terminus and may partly explain why Fre does not bind FAD permanently, whereas the flavodoxin reductase does. Unlike the experimentally verified flavin-binding site, the NAD(P)H-binding site of Fre is only a proposed model (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) based on comparisons with different ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase·AMP complexes (21Serre L. Vellieux F.M. Medina M. Gomez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The adenine ring and the ribose group of the 2′-phospho-ADP moiety of NADPH are proposed to bind to Fre near the amino ends of the α-helices of the NAD(P)H-binding domain, and Arg202 and His144 may bind the pyrophosphate group of NAD(P)H (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our MD simulations also predicted amino acid residues at these regions, such as Gln143 and Arg202, to form H-bonds with the ADP moiety of FAD (Fig.4 B). The overlapping binding sites of FAD and NAD(P)H were supported by several lines of results. Firstly, 0.18 mmAMP, a known competitive inhibitor with respect to the NAD(P)H (2Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30392-30400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Nivière V. Fieschi F. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), increased the K d value of the Fre·FAD complex from 29 nm to 83 nm. In comparison, NADP+ or 3-aminopyridine adenosine dinucleotide phosphate, an NADPH analog, has no effect on the K d of Fre for Rfl (18Nivière V. Vanoni M.A. Zanetti G. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11879-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). AMP affects the binding of FAD to Fre probably by competing with the ADP moiety of FAD for the NAD(P)H-binding site, leading to an increased K d. Secondly, kinetic analysis showed that FAD behaves as a competitive inhibitor with respect to FMN and a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to NADPH (Fig. 5). Competitive inhibition of FAD upon FMN is expected because FAD should compete with FMN for the flavin-binding site. However, the mixed-type inhibition upon NADPH supports the MD simulation model. Lumichrome, an Fre-competitive inhibitor with respect to Rfl, is an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to NADPH (2Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30392-30400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Hence, lumichrome does not inhibit the formation of Fre·NADPH complex. The interactions between the ADP moiety of FAD and residues at the NAD(P)H-binding site may inhibit the formation of Fre·NADPH complex, leading to the observed mixed-type inhibitory effect. The bent conformation of FAD also provides a plausible explanation for the extremely large K m,NADH (301 μm) and K m,NADPH (14,000 μm) values during FAD reduction, in comparison with the correspondingK m values for Rfl and FMN reduction (1Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Decout J.-L. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because FAD binds tightly to Fre through both the isoalloxazine ring and the ADP moiety (Fig. 4), NADH has to compete with the ADP moiety of FAD for the binding site. Consequently, a higher concentration of NADH is required to outcompete the ADP moiety of FAD for the NAD(P)H-binding site, leading to a larger K m,NADH value than that for Rfl and FMN reduction. In the bent conformation, the negatively charged pyrophosphate group of FAD is also located in close proximity to the proposed binding site for the 2′-phosphate group of NADPH (13Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). The highly negatively charged pyrophosphate group may destabilize the binding of NADPH through repulsion with the negatively charged 2′-phosphate group of NADPH. Thus, theK m,NADPH value is 46 times larger than theK m,NADH when FAD is the electron acceptor. The single phosphate group of FMN may also destabilize NADPH binding to Fre by the same mechanism, resulting in a K m,NADPH of 418 ± 41 μm (calculated from Fig. 5); whereas theK m,NADH is merely 14.9 ± 0.8 μmduring FMN reduction (data not shown). The high affinity of Fre for FAD may imply that the in vivoFre activity is much lower than previously expected under aerobic conditions. NADH and NADPH concentrations inside aerobically growingE. coli have been reported in the range of 20 and 150 μm, respectively (23Penfound T. Foster J.W. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 721-730Google Scholar). Intracellular free Rfl, FMN, and FAD concentrations have not been clearly defined. Only one study reports the internal free FAD concentration of Amphibacillus xylanus to be 13 μm (24Ohnishi K. Nimura Y. Yokoyama K. Hidaka M. Masaki H. Uchimura T. Suzuki H. Uozumi T. Kozaki M. Komagata K. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31418-31423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular Rfl concentration should be much lower than those of FMN and FAD because Rfl should be transformed into the coenzyme forms FMN and FAD in order to fulfill its metabolic purpose (25Bacher A. Eberhardt S. Richter G. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 657-664Google Scholar). Assuming the internal free FMN and FAD concentrations to be in the order of ∼10 μm, then in vivo Fre activity should be mainly due to the preferential reduction of FAD by NADH as demonstrated by our in vitro assay (Fig. 6) and the Fre-HpaB coupled assay. Fre literally cannot use NADPH to reduce FAD in vivo because theK m,NADPH value is much higher than the internal NADPH concentration. Thus, the in vivo Fre activity should be suppressed due to the low internal NADH concentration in comparison with the K m,NADH value. The low in vivoFre activity is advantageous to the organism because this prevents unrestrained production of FADH2, wasteful reoxidation of the labile FADH2, and excessive production of detrimental reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 (26Gibson Q.H. Hastings J.W. Biochem. J. 1962; 83: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In summary, this study demonstrated that FAD binds more tightly to Fre than either FMN or Rfl does. The tight binding likely makes FAD the preferred substrate under in vivo conditions (Fig. 6). Experimental data and MD simulations suggested that the tight binding is due to an unusual bent conformation of FAD, allowing additional interactions between FAD and Fre. The ADP moiety of FAD likely competes with NAD(P)H for binding to Fre, explaining the largeK m values for NADH and NADPH during FAD reduction.E. coli is a facultative anaerobe, growing both aerobically and anaerobically. When E. coli grows with sufficient O2 supply, the intracellular NADH concentration is about 20 μm, or 2% of total NADH and NAD+ (23Penfound T. Foster J.W. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 721-730Google Scholar). The low NADH concentration supports very low Fre activity for FAD reduction, and FAD also inhibits FMN reduction by Fre. Thus, our data suggest that Fre activities are likely suppressed in aerobically growing E. coli cells.

In the present study, we used the patch clamp technique to investigate the effect of trachynilysin on the cytoplasmic membrane of differentiated NG108-15 cells in culture. Trachynilysin increased membrane conductance the most when the negativity of the cell holding membrane potential was reduced. The trachynilysin-induced current was carried by cations and reversed at about −3 mV in standard physiological solutions, which led to strong membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx. La3+ blocked the trachynilysin current in a dose-, voltage-, and time-dependent manner, and antibodies raised against the toxin antagonized its effect on the cell membrane. The inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique allowed the recording of single channel activity from which various multiples of 22 pS elementary conductance were resolved. These results indicate that trachynilysin forms pores in the NG108-15 cell membrane, and they advance our understanding of the toxin's mode of action on motor nerve endings and neurosecretory cells.

Trachynilysin (TLY), a 159 kDa membrane-perturbing (hemolytic) toxic protein isolated from the venom of the stonefish Synanceia trachynis, also greatly increases quantal acetylcholine release from motor nerve endings (25Colasante C. Meunier F.A. Kreger A.S. Molgó J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Ouanounou G. Mattei C. Meunier F.A. Kreger A.S. Molgó J. Cybium. 2000; 24: 149-156Google Scholar) and catecholamine secretion from large dense-core vesicles of chromaffin cells (27Meunier F.A. Mattei C. Chameau P. Lawrence G. Colasante C. Kreger A.S. Dolly J.O. Molgó J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, contrary to α-LTX, these two types of release are Ca2+-dependent. Interestingly, neither TLY (25Colasante C. Meunier F.A. Kreger A.S. Molgó J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) nor α-LTX (28Matteoli M. Haimann C.

A. 1988; 85: 7366-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) affects the number of large dense-core vesicles containing neuropeptides in motor nerve endings despite the depletion of small clear synaptic vesicles. TLY has also been reported to raise the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (29Chameau P. Meunier F.A. Kreger A.S. Shimahara T. Molgó J. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1662Crossref Google Scholar) and adrenal chromaffin cells (27Meunier F.A. Mattei C. Chameau P. Lawrence G. Colasante C. Kreger A.S. Dolly J.O. Molgó J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous blockade of L, N, and P/Q voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels caused only a minor reduction of TLY-induced catecholamine secretion and little change in Ca2+ signals (27Meunier F.A. Mattei C. Chameau P. Lawrence G. Colasante C. Kreger A.S. Dolly J.O. Molgó J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and removal of extracellular Ca2+ and addition of EGTA or La3+ completely abolished both secretion and Ca2+ signals. Moreover, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with caffeine inhibited TLY-induced catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells. These results suggest that transmembrane Ca2+ influx and the resulting mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores are required for TLY-induced secretion (27Meunier F.A. Mattei C. Chameau P. Lawrence G. Colasante C. Kreger A.S. Dolly J.O. Molgó J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism for the Ca2+influx, we decided to determine whether TLY activates existing ion channels or forms pores in the plasma membrane. Other stonefish toxins;i.e. stonustoxin from Synanceia horrida venom (30Poh C.H. Yuen R. Khoo H.E. Chung M. Gwee M. Gopalakrishnakone P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1991; 99: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and verrucotoxin from Synanceia verrucosa venom (31Garnier P. Goudey-Perrière F. Breton P. Dewulf C. Petek F. Perrière C. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), are known to exert their hemolytic activity through pore formation (32Chen D. Kini R.M. Yuen R. Khoo H.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, voltage clamp studies have not been performed previously with any of the stonefish toxins. In the present studies, the membrane effects and the ability of TLY to form pores were investigated using the patch clamp technique and differentiated NG108-15 hybrid cells (33Hamprecht B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1977; 49: 99-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated neuroblastoma × glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells were grown in monolayer cultures using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μmaminopterin, 16 μm thymidine, 2 mm glutamine, and 3 μm glycine, as described previously (34Rouzaire-Dubois B. Dubois J.M. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Three days before performing the experiments, the cells were differentiated by adding 0.5 mm dibutyryl cyclic adenosine-monophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) to the medium and reducing the serum concentration to 1%. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air, 5% CO2. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. TLY was purified from stonefish (S. trachynis) venom by sequential anion exchange, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and size exclusion FPLC (25Colasante C. Meunier F.A. Kreger A.S. Molgó J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the purified toxin (∼2 mg of protein/ml) in 10 mmTris-HCl-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5% glycerol were stored at −60 °C. Before being used in the electrophysiological experiments, TLY was diluted with the standard physiological solution. A fast perfusion system allowed changing the solution around the recorded cell in a fraction of a second. Inside-out patch clamp experiments used TLY diluted with the standard solution filling the patch pipette. A female New Zealand White rabbit was injected subcutaneously with a water-in-oil emulsion composed of equal parts of Hunter's TiterMax adjuvant (Sigma) and a solution of purified TLY. Injections were performed on (i) days 0 and 17 with 32 and 158 μg of toxin protein, respectively, (ii) days 31 and 52 with 317 μg of toxin, and (iii) days 88, 110, and 131 with 1.14 mg of toxin. The rabbit was sedated and exsanguinated on day 139, and the anti-TLY serum was lyophilized and stored at 4 °C. Negative control, normal serum was obtained from a rabbit injected (according to the above protocol) with an emulsion containing only adjuvant and buffer, and the serum was lyophilized and stored at 4 °C. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were isolated from reconstituted sera (75 mg/ml deionized water) with an ImmunoPure IgG purification kit (Pierce). The specificity of the anti-TLY IgG was revealed by (i) Western blots probed with the anti-TLY and control IgG preparations and (ii) studies examining the ability of the two preparations to neutralize TLYin vitro hemolytic activity, as described in the below protocols and under “Results” (Fig. 2, A andB). Differentiated NG108-15 cells (2.5 × 106) in culture were extensively washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.1), and centrifuged (800 ×g, 10 min) to remove the nuclei. The protein content of the supernatant fluids was determined by the Lowry method (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrourgh N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before aliquots of the fluids were used in the Western-blotting experiments. TLY (0.5 μg of protein/lane) and the protein extract (6 μg/lane) from NG108-15 cells were analyzed under reducing conditions (10% β-mercaptoethanol) by SDS-PAGE with a 12% acrylamide gel. After electrotransfer (4 °C, overnight, 0.2 A) of the separated protein bands onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was blocked (8 h, 4 °C) with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and it was probed (12 h, 4 °C) with the anti-TLY or control IgG preparation diluted (1:500) in the blocking buffer. The rabbit IgG-probed membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline, and bound antibodies were detected after probing (2 h, 4 °C) with a diluted (1:1000) peroxidase-labeled, anti-rabbit IgG preparation using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One hundred and 1000 hemolytic units of TLY, contained in 1 ml volumes of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) supplemented with crystalline bovine albumin (1 mg/ml), were incubated (15 min, 37 °C) with various amounts of anti-TLY IgG and control IgG, and the residual hemolytic activity of the incubated mixtures was determined against rabbit erythrocytes as previously described (36Kreger A.S. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Whole-cell and inside-out patch clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) as previously described (37Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15169) Google Scholar). Pipettes were made from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instrument, Reading, England) and pulled on a BP-7 puller (Narishige, Osaka, Japan). The patch electrodes filled with physiological saline solutions had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ. Membrane currents were recorded with a RK-300 patch clamp amplifier (Biologic, Claix, France), and they were filtered with an 8-pole low pass Bessel filter (Biologic, ibid.) at 8 kHz for whole-cell recordings and at 3 kHz for inside-out patch recordings. The filtered signals were digitized by a 12 bit A/D converter (Labmaster DMA, Scientific Solutions Inc., Mentor, OH) and stored using pCLAMP 5.5 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Whole-cell and inside-out patch data were acquired at a sample rate of 1 and 10 kHz, respectively. Recordings were analyzed using Origin 5 software (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA), taking advantage of the built-in regression functions and of the Labtalk programming language. The standard external and internal solutions for whole-cell recordings had the following compositions: 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (external solution) and 135 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) (internal solution). The internal solution was filtered through 0.2 μm Millex filters (Millipore, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). The osmotic pressure of the internal and external solutions were 295–305 mosmol and 305–315 mosmol, respectively, as measured with a freezing point osmometer (Knauer, Berlin, Germany). The solutions used to determine the ionic selectivity of the TLY-induced current are shown in Table I. For inside-out patch recordings, the external solution was also used as the internal solution.Table IReversal potential (Erev) of the TLY-induced current in media of various ionic compositionsSolutionsNa+K+Ca2+Mg2+Cl−Methane sulfonateSucrosenErevmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmV11545211650017−321545211015405−33705218001403−114015921165003−35057711610803−360527716201203−4.5For each cell, the TLY-induced current Erev was determined in the standard solution and in one of the test solutions, using the protocol for the Fig. 5 data. All reversal potentials were graphically determined. Open table in a new tab For each cell, the TLY-induced current Erev was determined in the standard solution and in one of the test solutions, using the protocol for the Fig. 5 data. All reversal potentials were graphically determined. To minimize the contribution of voltage-gated K+ channels to the macroscopic current, some patch clamp experiments were performed at a holding potential of +60 mV. Under this condition, the transient voltage-dependent currents, including K+currents (38Rouzaire-Dubois B. Dubois J.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Robbins J. Sim J.A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were inactivated by about 95% 2 min after changing the holding potential. Thus, the different voltage-dependent currents were limited without using any pharmacological agent that could interact with the toxin. To determine the ionic selectivity of the TLY-induced current, its reversal potential was measured in solutions of various ionic composition using ramp-potentials (150 mV/s) from +60 to −60 mV. Derived from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz flux equation (40Goldman D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1943; 27: 37-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 41Hodgkin A. Katz B. J. Physiol.

Ouanounou (this paper) in the Labtalk programming language of Origin software. Current step transitions were detected by computing average currents on a 50–100-ms time window before and after any given point and calculating the difference. A transition occurred when the difference was higher than twice the variance of the “before” window. To quantify the current variations that did not occur in steps, each detected step was subtracted from the ensuing samples of the recording, which led to a smoothed trace deprived of step transitions. In other words, the new trace exhibited only low frequency components. Derivation of that signal allowed us to dissociate the changes of membrane conductance into increasing and decreasing components according to the sign of the derivative. Separate integration of the two components of the derivative over the entire analyzed period gave the cumulative currents corresponding to each component. Noise analysis was performed using the fast Fourier transform module included in Origin 5 software after filtering off the lower frequencies. The analyzed periods were divided into sections of 1024 samples, and the resulting power spectra were averaged. The mean spectrum, performed on similar base-line sections, was subtracted before fitting to Lorentz Equation 3, S(f)=S01+ffcEquation 3 where S(f) is the power, f is the frequency, and S0 is the constant to which the function tends for low frequencies. The mean channel lifetime (τ) was computed from the cut-off frequency (fc). τ=12πfcEquation 4 The elementary conductance was calculated from the variance (ς2) and the mean current (I m) of the analyzed signal, γ=ς2Im·(Vm−Erev)Equation 5 where V m is the membrane potential, andErev is the reversal potential. To determine the effect of TLY on ionic permeability, membrane currents of NG108-15 cells were recorded in the standard external solution using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique at a holding potential of −60 mV. An inward current developed about 1 min after the addition of 12 nm TLY to the external medium. In the continuous presence of TLY, the induced current rapidly became too large to be recorded accurately. Because of the irreversibility of the TLY effect, the toxin was applied for just 1 min. Under these conditions, the TLY-induced current was limited to a recordable intensity range. A 1 min exposure to 12 nm TLY appeared to be just higher than a threshold duration, since shorter applications of that TLY concentration had no effect other than an increase in electrical noise (data not shown). The threshold duration of toxin exposure could be reached by successive applications, alternating TLY-containing medium with TLY-free medium. This suggests that a minimal number of TLY molecules has to bind to the membrane to produce the membrane effect, and this may partly explain the latency of the effect of the toxin. After 1 min of exposure to TLY, the current increased in a stepwise manner to about −500 to −1000 pA and then fluctuated around this range (Fig.1 A). Details of the time course of the TLY-induced current at various time scales are shown in Fig. 1 B. The TLY-induced activity exhibited macroscopic steps of various sizes that coexisted with current fluctuations without visible steps. Thus, two types of current variations, each with its own frequency domain, compose the TLY-induced current. Despite a large spectrum of step sizes and low frequency variations, visual inspection suggested that the membrane current presented preferential values. To support this view, the first minutes of three recordings were pooled and analyzed as follows. The current was binned in 1 pA-wide classes, and the relative number of samples at any of these levels was computed and plotted versus the bin size (Fig. 1 C). The peaks revealed by this time-distribution showed the most frequent intensities of the TLY-induced current. The modes of these peaks, determined by a Gaussian-fitting regression, appeared to be regularly spaced. The mode values were plotted as a function of their rank when sorted in ascending order, and they were fitted with a linear regression equation (inset, Fig.1 C). The slope of the regression line, 27 pA, represents the mean increment between peaks, which suggests that the TLY current is composed of multiples of a common component. The presence of steps and low frequency fluctuations precluded a deeper analysis of the TLY-induced channel-like activity. However, another type of analysis was performed, as shown later. Before using the anti-TLY IgG preparation in our electrophysiological experiments, its specificity was evaluated by Western blotting and by determining its ability and the ability of the control IgG preparation to neutralize TLY in vitro hemolytic activity. The Western blotting experiments revealed (Fig.2 A) that (i) the anti-TLY IgG bound to TLY α- and β-subunits but not to any of the proteins isolated from NG108-15 cells, and (ii) labeling of the toxin subunits was not observed when the control IgG preparation was used as a probe. The studies examining the specificity of the anti-TLY IgG preparation ability to neutralize TLY in vitro hemolytic activity revealed (Fig. 2 B) that incubating 100 and 1000 hemolytic units of TLY with ∼93 and 698 μg, respectively, of anti-TLY IgG eliminated ∼90% of the toxin in vitro hemolytic activity. However, incubating 100 hemolytic units of TLY with ∼1.34 mg of control IgG did not eliminate any hemolytic activity. Our observation that anti-TLY antibodies neutralized TLY hemolytic activity prompted us to determine whether they could also affect the TLY-induced current. TLY was applied (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), and after the macroscopic induced-current developed, anti-TLY IgG (95 μg/ml, final concentration) was added to the external solution. The TLY-induced current progressively decreased in all 4 cells tested (each from a different culture) until it was completely inhibited within 2–4 min (Fig. 2 C). However, control, normal IgG (95 μg/ml, final concentration) did not affect the current induced by TLY or the inhibitory action of a subsequent application of anti-TLY IgG (Fig.2 C). In two of the cells, continuous wash-out of the antibodies allowed about 30% recovery of the TLY-induced current before the gigaseal was lost (data not shown). In the other two cells, the seal was lost at the beginning of the wash-out period. In addition, exposure of the cells to anti-TLY IgG followed by wash-out (which had no membrane effect) did not prevent the membrane response to subsequent exposure to TLY (data not shown). These results suggest that the anti-TLY IgG bound to the toxin in a reversible manner, and they confirm that TLY binds irreversibly to the cell membrane. Because the membrane current returned to the initial base line in the presence of anti-TLY antibodies, we assumed that all of the TLY-induced increases in conductance were exactly balanced by conductance decreases, and this situation prompted us to assess the proportion of steps and low frequency fluctuations involved in the conductance changes. Therefore, using the algorithm described under “Experimental Procedures,” two recordings (including the one shown in Fig. 2) were decomposed into their step and low frequency components (see Fig. 3, A–B), and the two components were separately analyzed. The number of detected upward events represented only 72% of the downward events. Furthermore, the respective amplitude distributions differed, i.e. the upward events were smaller than the downward events (Fig. 3 C). This difference was statistically significant, as demonstrated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test performed on the cumulative frequency distribution (p ≤ 0.01). On the whole, the sum of the closing (upward) events corresponded to only 57% of the opening (downward) events. This feature resulted in a global downward deflection of the step component, as shown in Fig. 3 B(bottom trace). The analysis did not reveal a common substep; however, the frequency distributions (Fig. 3 C,insets) revealed that the most frequent step transitions occurred in the 27 pA class, which may explain the preferential levels of the global TLY-induced current already noticed (Fig. 1 C) and characterized by a 27 pA increment. The low frequency component was analyzed by derivation and by separate integration of the positive and negative parts of the derivative (Fig.3 D). This analysis allowed the separation of periods of increasing and decreasing membrane conductance; i.e. the integral of the positive derivative gives the cumulative current, which corresponded to membrane conductance decreases. Conversely, the integral of the negative derivative corresponded to m"

The pathway for LLO synthesis has been elucidated by a combination of biochemical and genetic methods, and to date mutations in seven genes essential for LLO synthesis have been identified as the causes of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Types Ia–g (2Marquardt T.

LLO synthesis is initiated by the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P by a specific tunicamycin (TN)-sensitive GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT) (4Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This reaction occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (5Dan N. Middleton R.M. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30717-30725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol is then extended to Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, a key LLO intermediate, by a series of cytoplasmically oriented reactions that catalyze the transfer of one residue of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc and five residues of mannose from GDP-mannose. Cytoplasmically oriented Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol then flips to the luminal leaflet (6Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. Cell. 1984; 36: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Schenk B. Fernandez F. Waechter C.J.

Nature. 2002; 415: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This luminally oriented LLO then becomes an acceptor for the transfer of four additional mannose residues from mannose-P-dolichol (MPD) and three glucose residues from glucose-P-dolichol (GPD), generating Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. MPD and GPD are synthesized by the transfer of mannose or glucose from GDP-mannose or UDP-glucose, respectively, to cytoplasmically oriented dolichol-P, and then must flip to the luminal leaflet to participate in LLO synthesis. Thus, along with the 14 specific LLO transferases, two synthases are needed for MPD and GPD, and flippases are needed for MPD, GPD, and Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. In animals, transferases that use MPD and GPD as donor substrates have an additional requirement for the product of the Lec35 gene (9Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E.

It is now clear that the LLO pathway in mammalian cells is subject to a number of regulatory features that presumably ensure an adequate supply of the completed LLO Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol for glycoprotein synthesis. For example, in a reciprocal manner GPT and MPD synthase (MPDS) each appear to be positively regulated by the product of the other (10Kean E.L. Wei Z. Anderson V.E. Zhang N. Sayre L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34072-34082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Extension of LLO intermediates to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol is stimulated by ER stress, which itself can be a result inadequate supplies of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (11Doerrler W.T.

Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). LLO synthesis is dependent upon the amount of dolichol-P (7Schenk B. Fernandez F. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 61R-70RCrossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which can be elevated in cells by increasingcis-isoprenyltransferase activity (13Crick D.C. Waechter C.J. J.

Taken together, control mechanisms such as these reflect the great importance of synthesis of adequate amounts of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol in ER quality control (15Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8623-8626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Approximately two decades ago, several laboratories determined that new synthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol in mammalian cells incubated with radioactive sugars ceased after the addition of inhibitors of mRNA or protein synthesis (Refs. 16Hubbard S.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11782-11789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmitt J.W. Elbein A.D. J. Biol.

At least three hypotheses were proposed to explain this coupling of LLO synthesis with translation. Hubbard and Robbins (16Hubbard S.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11782-11789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that in the absence of a polypeptide acceptor, because of “limited availability of the carrier lipid,” all dolichol-P available for LLO initiation was trapped as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Because MPD synthesis did not appear to be inhibited by translation inhibitors (17Schmitt J.W. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12291-12294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grant S.R. Lennarz W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it was further suggested that the “rate-limiting pool might be a fraction of the total dolichol-P” and thus be reserved for synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol. However, there was no direct evidence for separate pools of dolichol-P in vivo. Subsequently, the idea that translation blockers reduced the supply of dolichol-P available for LLO initiation was questioned when it was shown that dolichol-P added to the culture medium stimulated Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol synthesis in untreated cells, but not in cells treated with translation inhibitors (18Grant S.R. Lennarz W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8077-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A second hypothesis, proposed by the Elbein group (17Schmitt J.W. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12291-12294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8077-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggested that the absence of polypeptide acceptors caused Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol to accumulate, and that Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol could then act as a feedback inhibitor of GPT. Two observations were particularly relevant. First, in translation-inhibited cells, some loss of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol synthesis was detected by incubation with [3H]glucosamine. Second, LLO synthesis was partially restored by addition of a cell-permeant acceptor peptide for OT intended to discharge a portion of the accumulated Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. However, the hypothesized accumulation of total cellular Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol was not confirmed by direct chemical measurement, and introduction of translation inhibitors after addition of [3H]sugar precursors did not appear to significantly increase the amounts of [3H]Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Further, inhibition was detected in mutants that produced Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol instead of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Apart from these hypotheses, Grant and Lennarz proposed that inhibition of translation resulted in elevation of cytoplasmic GTP, which acted as an inhibitor of cytoplasmically oriented GDP-mannose dependent LLO transferases. This proposal was supported by their findings thatin vivo synthesis of early LLO intermediates up to Man1GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol was not blocked by translation inhibitors (18Grant S.R. Lennarz W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because it was shown previously that a step prior to Man5GlcNAc2-P-P- dolichol synthesis was inhibited (16Hubbard S.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11782-11789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the hypothesis predicted the accumulation of one or more intermediates, presumably Man2–4GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. However, no accumulated intermediates were identified. Unfortunately, the radiolabeling methods used with intact cells to formulate these hypotheses raised several complications. For example, the ability to monitor early LLO intermediates was limited because, compared with Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, these molecules contain fewer sugar residues that can be labeled. These types of problems prevented accurate measurements of the actual amounts of various LLOs. Further, because only labeled LLOs could be assessed, the fates of unlabeled pre-existing LLOs were not known. In this study the control of LLO synthesis by translation was re-examined by employing the recently developed fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) approach for direct measurement of LLO compositions in intact cells (21Gao N. Lehrman M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, measurements of LLO biosynthetic activities in vitro were made either with cells gently permeabilized with streptolysin-O (SLO), or with microsomes prepared by conventional homogenization techniques. Our results show that translation blockers interfere with LLO synthesis by trapping the dolichol-P available for LLO initiation by GPT as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, and reveal that the function and regulation of GPT, MPDS, and GPD synthase (GPDS) require properties of the ER that are retained in SLO-permeabilized cells but lost in microsomal preparations. The results directly support the hypothesis of Hubbard and Robbins for a limited pool of dolichol-P that is restricted for LLO synthesis. Upon re-evaluation many of the apparently contradictory results from other studies were found to be consistent with this hypothesis, and differences in experimental conditions appear to account for remaining discrepancies. Culture media and supplies were from Invitrogen, except bovine sera (Atlanta Biologicals). CHO-K1 cells, the LLO biosynthesis defective mutants Lec15.2 and Lec35.1 (9Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S.

Briefly, oligosaccharide profiling gels (Glyko) were used to analyze oligosaccharides modified with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS). Monosaccharide composition gels were prepared 2N. Gao, unpublished data. similar to those offered by Glyko, but with less interfering background material in the region used to measure chitobiose, and used for saccharides modified with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC). The gel was imaged with a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager using a 530DF60 filter. Electronic gel images were generated, and individual fluorescent species were quantified with Quantity One software supplied with the scanner. Cells were swollen and homogenized, and microsomes were recovered by centrifugation as described (26Krag S.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2621-2629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 80 μg of microsomal membrane protein was recovered per 107 cells. Cells were treated on wet ice with SLO (Murex brand, distributed by Corgenix, United Kingdom; supplied as a lyophilized powder containing PBS and reconstituted with ice-cold water), then incubated with 37 °C transport buffer to allow SLO pores to form, exactly as described (27Martys J.L.

Experiments directly comparing results with both in vitro systems used the same cell equivalents. Transport buffer (27Martys J.L. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol.

Nucleotide sugar donors were supplied exogenously, but only endogenous dolichol-P was used. For GPT, unless indicated otherwise, assays included 0.1 μCi/ml UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and were performed at 37 °C for 30 min. Lipid products from microsomal reactions were recovered by organic extraction as described (28Lehrman M.A. Zhu X. Khounlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19796-19803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and those from SLO-cells were recovered by extraction of cells with chloroform-methanol (2:1) and back-washing with chloroform-methanol-water (3:48:47). MPDS and GPDS were assayed by the same procedure, except that UDP-[3H]GlcNAc was replaced by 0.1 μCi/ml GDP-[3H]mannose and 0.1 μCi/ml UDP-[3H]glucose, respectively. For LLO synthesis, assays included 1 μm UDP-GlcNAc and 0.2 μCi/ml GDP-[2-3H]mannose and were performed at 37 °C for 10 min, at which point 1 μm GDP-mannose was added and the assay continued (chase) for another 5 min. LLOs were recovered by extraction into chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) as described (29Zeng Y. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2296-2305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the acceptor peptide Ac-Asn-Tyr-Thr-CONH2, described earlier (20Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8077-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the non-acceptor peptide Ac-Gln-Tyr-Thr-CONH2 were obtained by custom synthesis (Synpep Corp.). The supplier reported that the purity of each peptide assessed by HPLC was at least 97%, and the syntheses were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Peptides were dissolved in pure water. To aid the reader, Fig.1 presents a model supported by this study for control of the LLO biosynthetic cycle by protein synthesis. The cycle is initiated by transfer of GlcNAc-1-P to dolichol-P by GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT). After extension of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol and transfer of oligosaccharide to nascent polypeptide by OT, the resultant dolichol-P-P is converted to dolichol-P by the CWH8 pyrophosphatase (30Fernandez F. Rush J.S. Toke D.A. Han G. Quinn J.E. Carman G.M. Choi J.-Y. Voelker D.R. Aebi M. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41455-41464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for another round of LLO synthesis. The model has three key features. (i) Transfer of oligosaccharide to protein is the rate-limiting step in the cycle. At steady state under normal conditions, most of the dolichol-P available for LLO synthesis is in the form Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. (ii) In the absence of protein synthesis, initiation by GPT is inhibited because it requires a limited primary pool of dolichol-P acceptor that becomes trapped as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. (iii) Inhibition of LLO initiation is relieved by perturbation of cells and preparation of microsomes. Thus, perturbation causes intermingling of the limited primary pool of dolichol-P with a secondary pool that does not normally have access to GPT. However, this intermingling is prevented by gentle permeabilization with the pore-forming toxin SLO. As expected from prior studies (16Hubbard S.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11782-11789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), treatments of CHO-K1 cells with cycloheximide or puromycin for 1 h inhibited protein synthesis by 99% (Fig.2, panel A) and incorporation of [3H]mannose into LLO (CMW 10:10:3 extract) by 98% (panel B). When total LLO compositions from similarly treated cells were determined by FACE (panels C and D), no LLO accumulation, from GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, was detected. Therefore, these data do not support hypotheses that propose interference with one or more LLO mannosyltransferases (which would cause accumulation of LLO intermediates) (18Grant S.R. Lennarz W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or feedback inhibition of LLO initiation by accumulated Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (17Schmitt J.W. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12291-12294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8077-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Note that GlcNAc1–2-P-P-dolichol appeared to be barely detectable by FACE (no more than 1 pmol/107 cells), and was therefore at least 20–40-fold less abundant than Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (20–40 pmol/107 cells). To further test the possible role of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol as a feedback inhibitor, Lec15.2 and Lec35.1 cells were examined because these accumulate Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol and produce no detectable Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Lec35 cells, in contrast with Lec15, do not glucosylate their Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (9Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). FACE did not detect any net LLO accumulation in Lec15 or Lec35 cells treated with translation blockers. These mutant lines were both sensitive to the effects of translation inhibitors on LLO synthesis detected by metabolic labeling (data not shown) as reported earlier (20Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8077-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no evidence from these experiments that accumulation of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, or any other glucosylated LLO, is necessary for inhibition of LLO synthesis. Consistent with earlier reports (17Schmitt J.W. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12291-12294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grant S.R. Lennarz W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we detected no effects for GPT (Fig.3), MPDS, GPDS (see below), and [3H]LLO synthesis (data not shown) in microsomal membranes prepared from CHO-K1 cells treated with translation inhibitors. In the course of these studies, it was noticed that the inhibition of LLO labeling with [3H]mannose in adherent cells was partially relieved by detachment of the cells from culture dishes just prior to labeling. Thus, we considered the possibility that cellular perturbation might counteract the effect of translation inhibition on a key step in the dolichol pathway, in a manner highly reminiscent of the effects of perturbation on cells lacking the Lec35 gene product (9Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Zeng Y. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2296-2305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Lec35p has an essential role in reactions requiring MPD or GPD in intact cells, the glycosylation defective phenotype in Lec35 mutants is lost by various forms of physical perturbation including preparation of microsomes. Gentle permeabilization of the plasma membrane of Lec35 cells with SLO does not affect the Lec35 phenotype, however, permitting the analysis of the Lec35 defect under in vitro conditions (9Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (panel A), whereas treatment of CHO-K1 cells with 0.2 mm cycloheximide had no effect on GPT activity measured in microsomes with endogenous dolichol-P acceptors, GPT activity was inhibited by 80–90% when assayed in SLO-permeabilized cells. This difference was consistently observed over a range of UDP-GlcNAc concentrations (0.84–54 nm) and incubation times (5–40 min; data not shown), and the in vitro activities were highly sensitive to a specific inhibitor of GPT, TN (panel A). Comparable results with CHO-K1 cells were obtained with 0.4 mm puromycin, and similar effects of translation blockers on in vitro GPT activity were obtained with Lec15 (panel B) and Lec35 cells (data not shown). GPT was not directly inhibited by 0.2 mm cycloheximide or 0.4 mm puromycin because neither affected GPT activity when added to SLO-permeabilized CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). These results have two important implications. First, conventional microsomal preparations do not faithfully reflect the factors that govern GPT activity (see “Discussion”), presumably by making a secondary pool of dolichol-P available. Such factors are preserved by permeabilization of cells with SLO, possibly because this treatment subjects the cells to minimal physical perturbation. Even scraping the SLO-permeabilized cells from dishes increased the remaining GPT activity resulting from translation arrest by ∼50% (data not shown). Second, in cells that are not continuously synthesizing protein, GPT activity measured after permeabilization with SLO is highly reduced in a manner that is consistent with the loss of [3H]LLO synthesis in vivo. The residual GPT activity (10–20%) may be the result of minor perturbation that could not be controlled during permeabilization with SLO. If the diminished GPT activity in SLO-permeabilized cells represents a preservation of the effects of translation inhibitors on LLO synthesis in vivo, LLO synthesis in vitro with permeabilized cells should be similarly affected. Cells were treated with cycloheximide for various periods up to 1 h, permeabilized, and assayed either for GPT activity with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc or total LLO synthesis wit"

Following light absorption the C11=C12 double bond isomerizes totrans configuration and triggers protein conformational alterations. These alterations lead to the formation of an active intermediate (Meta II), which binds and activates the visual G protein, transducin. We have examined by UV-visible and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy the photochemistry of a rhodopsin analogue with an 11-cis-locked chromophore, where cis totrans isomerization around the C11=C12 double bond is prevented by a 6-member ring structure (Rh6.10). Despite this lock, the pigment was found capable of forming an active photoproduct with a characteristic protein conformation similar to that of native Meta II. This intermediate is further characterized by a protonated Schiff base and protonated Glu-113, as well as by its ability to bind a transducin-derived peptide previously shown to interact efficiently with native Meta II. The yield of this active photointermediate is pH-dependent and decreases with increasing pH. This study shows that with the C11=C12 double bond being locked, isomerization around the C9=C10 or the C13=C14 double bonds may well lead to an activation of the receptor. Additionally, prolonged illumination at pH 7.5 produces a new photoproduct absorbing at 385 nm, which, however, does not exhibit the characteristic active protein conformation.

Rhodopsin, a seven-transmembrane helical protein, is composed of 348 amino acids and a ligand, 11-cis retinal, which covalently binds to the protein through a protonated Schiff base linkage to the ε-amino group of Lys-296 in the center of helix 7 (1Bounds D. Nature. 1967; 216: 1178-1181Google Scholar). Glu-113 at helix 3 serves as the counterion of the protonated Schiff base (2Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D.

Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar) provides detailed structural information on the interactions between the retinal chromophore and its surrounding residues, which contribute to the red-shifted absorption maximum of the chromophore (λmax 500 nm) relative to protonated retinal Schiff base in methanol solution (λmax 440 nm) and to the high pKa of the protonated Schiff base (6Steinberg G. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1499-1502Google Scholar). Following light absorption, the retinal chromophore isomerizes from 11-cis to trans configuration in 200 fs (7Schoenlein R.W. Peteanu L.A. Mathies R.A. Shank C.V. Science. 1991; 254: 412-415Google Scholar). A series of photointermediates are produced that can be trapped below characteristic transition temperatures (8Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen.

Meta II is the active species, capable of activating transducin, the visual G protein. The equilibrium between Meta I and Meta II is affected by temperature, pressure, pH, and glycerol (9Lewis J.W. Kliger P.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 35: 289-307Google Scholar), as well as by ions (10Delange F. Merkx M. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Pistorius A.M. DeGrip W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 174-180Google Scholar, 11Vogel R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3529-3535Google Scholar). Meta II formation is associated with a movement of helix 6 relative to helix 3 (12Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Google Scholar, 13Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 747-750Google Scholar), a translocation of a proton from the Schiff base to its counterion, Glu-113, and recruitment of a proton from the bulk solution (14Fahmy K. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 171-181Google Scholar, 15Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Google Scholar). Using photoaffinity techniques at low temperature and trapping of different intermediates (16Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that in the dark state as well as in the bathorhodopsin intermediate, the β-ionone ring is located in the vicinity of Trp-265 in the center of helix 6, whereas in the lumirhodopsin, Meta I, and Meta II intermediates, the ring is located in the vicinity of Ala-169 in helix 4. This movement, a flip-over of the chromophoric ring, may trigger conformational changes in the cytoplasmic membrane loops, which interact with transducin. The important role that 11-cis double bond isomerization plays in initiating the photochemically induced reaction was demonstrated by studies of a series of 11-cis locked artificial pigments. Picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy of 11-cis locked rhodopsin bearing a 5-member ring did not show any ground state photoproduct following illumination except for a long-lived excited state intermediate (17Kandori H. Matuoka S. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Ito M. Tsukida K. Balogh-Nair V. Nakanishi K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6460-6467Google Scholar). Excitation of an 11-cis-locked rhodopsin with a 7-member ring produced a photorhodopsin-like species, whereas locked rhodopsin with an 8-member ring exhibited both photorhodopsin- and bathorhodopsin-like products (18Mizukami T. Kandori H. Shichida Y. Chen A.H. Derguini F. Caldwell C.G. Bigge C.F. Nakanishi K. Yoshizawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4072-4076Google Scholar). These results were interpreted by the gradual increase in the rotational flexibility along the C11=C12double bond from a 5- to 8-member ring. To further shed light on the primary event of rhodopsin light activation, the photochemistry of locked pigments was studied under steady state irradiation. Locked rhodopsin bearing a 5-member ring at −196 °C following either orange or blue light irradiation did not produce a bathorhodopsin-like species, whereas at 0 °C a hypsochromic product was observed (19Fukada Y. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Ito M. Kodama A. Tsukida K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5826-5832Google Scholar). Analysis of the retinal components by HPLC did not detect new isomers in the photoproduct. In addition, this pigment could not activate cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase. Illumination of a locked pigment bearing a 7-member ring did not change its absorption spectrum at 4 °C, and yet it produced 12% of other isomers (20Akita H. Tanis S.P. Adams M. Balogh-Nair V. Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 6372-6374Google Scholar). All of these results led to the conclusion that C11=C12 double bond isomerization is a prerequisite for the phototransduction process in rhodopsin. The photocascade of a 6-member ring 11-cis-locked pigment was examined as well (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar, 22Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Google Scholar). Irradiation of this artificial pigment led to a gradual blue shift of the absorption maximum, with a broad shoulder around 380 nm and a loss of ∼ 40% of the visible absorbance. The light-induced transducin activation was about 10% that of Meta II in native rhodopsin. The reason for this marginal activity was unclear. The four isomers of this 6-member ring 11-cis-locked retinal were separated and reconstituted with opsin (Scheme FS1) (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar). During regeneration, the 9,11-dicisand the 11,13-dicis species isomerized thermally in the dark around the C13=C14 double bond to the 9,11,13-tricis and the 11-cis species, respectively. The two 9-trans as well as the two 9-cis isomers, therefore, gave identical pigments absorbing at 510 and 494 nm, respectively. Following continuous irradiation, each of the resulting pigments produced a photoproduct mixture characterized by a similar absorption (λmax 498 nm). The activity of the pigment, under high light intensities, varied from 6 to 15% of that of native Meta II. These pigments as well as their corresponding photoproducts were reexamined recently by HPLC analyses of detergent-solubilized samples and FTIR spectroscopy of membrane samples at neutral pH (23Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar). The study concluded that photoisomerization indeed took place but that the protein moiety did not undergo conformational alterations. Molecular modeling suggested that movement of the β-ionone ring in these pigments is restricted, and therefore it was suggested that movement of the β-ionone ring is crucial for rhodopsin activation. This study further classified two of the four isomers as 11-cis-like and the other two as all-trans-like by their affinities for 11-cis- and all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, respectively (Scheme FS1). Importantly, the two 11-cis-like isomers, 11-cisand the 9,11,13-tricis, were the same as previously found to form the dark states of the pigments (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar). In an attempt to investigate whether the 6-member ring locked pigment (Rh6.10) is capable of producing an active conformation following light absorption, we have studied the photochemistry of Rh6.10 by UV-visible spectroscopy at different pH levels. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy was employed to monitor protein conformational changes following light absorption. It was revealed that the photochemistry of Rh6.10 is pH- dependent. An active Meta II-like intermediate with a protonated Schiff base is produced, particularly at low pH, while at high pH, presumably photoequilibration processes between the 11-cis-like inactive isomers dominate the photochemistry. In an accompanying article (24Vogel R. Fan G.-B. Lüdeke S. Siebert F. Sheves M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40222-40228Google Scholar) we further investigate the thermal decay behavior of the photoproducts of Rh6.10, revealing an interesting slow photocycling behavior of this visual pigment analog. The mixture of locked retinal isomers was synthesized as reported previously (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J.

Briefly, β-ionone reacted with 3-methoxy-2-cyclohexenone in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide at −60 °C followed by neutralization, reduction with lithium diisobutylaluminum hydride, hydrolysis, and water elimination. Horner-Emmons condensation between the ketone with ethyl (diethylphosphono)acetate followed by reduction and oxidation afforded the final mixture of isomers identified by MS and NMR. Opsin was prepared from rhodopsin in washed disk membranes from cattle retinae according to standard procedures (26Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Google Scholar, 27Lewis J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 917: 918-923Google Scholar) and regenerated with the synthetic chromophores overnight on ice (28Vogel R. Fan G.B. Sheves M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8895-8908Google Scholar). The isomeric composition of the chromophores was ∼50:50 9-cis:9-trans, unless stated differently. Extraction of excess retinal and retinal oxime was achieved by two washes with 10 mmheptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin (Aldrich) and three washes with distilled water (29Delange F. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Vanoostrum J. Portier M.D. Verdegem P.J. Lugtenburg J. DeGrip W.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1411-1420Google Scholar). Pigment concentration was determined using an absorption coefficient of 41,200m−1 cm−1 (22Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Google Scholar). FTIR spectroscopy was performed with a Bruker IFS 28 spectrometer with a mercury-cadmium-tellurium detector on sandwich samples with 1 nmol of pigment as described previously (30Vogel R. Siebert F.

IR spectra, recorded in blocks of 512 scans with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 and an acquisition time of 1 min, were corrected for temporal base-line drifts. As buffers we used 20 μl of 200 mm citrate, MES, and BTP (bis-tris propane), in overlapping ranges, containing 200 mm NaCl. Samples were photolyzed for 120 s (150-watt tungsten lamp) with a >530 nm long-pass filter, and half-time for reaching a photostationary state was 20 s at pH 5.0. Binding of a high affinity peptide analogue derived from transducin was monitored in sandwich samples prepared with 0.5 nmol of pigment and 20 nmol of peptide 23 (ac-VLEDLKSCGLF) (31Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Google Scholar). For UV-visible spectroscopy, sandwich samples identical to the infrared samples were used in a PerkinElmer Lambda 17 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled sample holder. Illumination was similar to that used in the IR experiments. Alternatively, a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer was used. Sandwich samples, often used for IR spectroscopy, contain fully hydrated pigment films. For rhodopsin in native washed membranes, the use of sandwich samples offers the possibility of performing both IR and UV-visible spectroscopy with the same sample type under conditions close to those found in membrane suspensions. In particular, the Meta I/Meta II equilibrium of native rhodopsin in membranes is unchanged in this sample type (11Vogel R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3529-3535Google Scholar). Sandwich samples of Rh6.10 (consisting of a 50:50 mixture of the 9-trans and 9-cis isomers; Scheme FS1) gave, following irradiation for ∼ 2 min at pH 7.5, a blue-shifted intermediate (495 nm) characterized by a smaller extinction coefficient, in keeping with previously described results (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar, 22Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Google Scholar). Irradiation for ∼2 min at pH 5.0 gave a product absorbing similar to that obtained at pH 7.5, yet with a more pronounced blue shift (Fig.1 A). In both cases, the position of the absorption maximum indicates that the retinal Schiff base remains protonated during formation of these photoproduct states. To further characterize the intermediates obtained at pH 7.5 and 5.0, we carried out FTIR measurements. The IR spectrum of the photoproduct obtained at pH 7.5 shows, except for a strong negative chromophore band at 1205 cm−1, only small features (Fig. 1 C), indicating only very modest conformational changes of the pigment during photolysis at this pH, in agreement with previously published data (23Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar). At pH 5.0, however, we observed an entirely different photoproduct, similar to that of native Meta II (see Fig.2 A), with large conformational changes, as is evident from bands appearing in the difference spectrum in the amide I and amide II ranges of ∼1650 and 1550 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Also, in the absorption range of protonated carboxylic acids above 1700 cm−1, large bands in the difference spectrum can be observed, indicating considerable environmental changes of the involved groups. The contributions of the different isomers to the difference spectrum obtained at pH 7.5 was examined by using pigments regenerated with only the 9-cis and the 9-trans isomers, respectively, instead of a 50:50 mixture (Fig. 1 D). The spectra show clear differences, reflecting the two different isomers, 9,11,13-tricis and 11-cis (Scheme FS1), in the respective initial dark states (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar). Under continuous illumination the different chromophoric isomers may fully interchange, and in the photostationary equilibrium (after 2 min), the photoproduct isomeric composition therefore becomes largely independent of the initial composition. By subtracting the two spectra, the photoproducts cancel out each other, and we were able to obtain a difference spectrum corresponding to a transition between the two dark states only, shown in Fig. 1 E in black. A spectrum with a very similar band structure was obtained after subtraction of residual contributions of the Meta II-like spectrum obtained at pH 5 (Fig. 1 B) from the pH 7.5 spectrum of the 50:50 mixture (Fig. 1 C), the result of which is shown as well in Fig. 1 E in gray. We can therefore conclude that, besides the small contribution of the low-pH photoproduct, the pH 7.5 spectrum is determined largely by a photoequilibration process between the two isomers that constitute the dark states of the pigment. This process also contributes to the spectrum obtained at pH 5.0, as evident from a similar analysis with pure isomers (not shown) but is superimposed there by the large difference bands of the Meta II-like photoproduct. The same photoequilibration process is described in more detail in the accompanying article (24Vogel R. Fan G.-B. Lüdeke S. Siebert F. Sheves M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40222-40228Google Scholar), where we analyze the thermal relaxation behavior of the Rh6.10 photoproducts and show that Rh6.10 can be photolyzed repeatedly to undergo identical excitation/relaxation cycles on the time scale of minutes to hours. A more detailed comparison of the FTIR spectrum of the low-pH photoproduct of Rh6.10 with that of Meta II of native rhodopsin reveals difference bands that are very similar in part. In Fig. 2 A, we show the difference spectra of both transitions. As the Schiff base in the low-pH photoproduct remains protonated, for a better comparison with native rhodopsin, we show the transition of native rhodopsin to a Meta II state with a protonated Schiff base. Such a state can be obtained in the presence of solute anions without changing the active state conformation of Meta II, as reported previously (32Vogel R. Fan G.B. Siebert F. Sheves M Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13342-13352Google Scholar). In the absorption range of protonated carboxylic acids above 1700 cm−1, where there are characteristic marker bands of Meta II, both spectra show very similar difference bands, indicating similar changes in hydrogen bonding for the membrane-embedded residues, Glu-122 and Asp-83 (33Fahmy K. Jäger F. Beck M. Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10206-10210Google Scholar, 34Rath P. DeCaluwe L.L. Bovee-Geurts P.H. DeGrip W, J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10277-10282Google Scholar). The positive band at 1709 cm−1 is slightly down-shifted compared with the corresponding band of Meta II of native rhodopsin, which was shown to reflect Glu-113 of the chromophore binding pocket becoming protonated during the transition to Meta II (35Jäger F. Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10878-10882Google Scholar). Similar band structures around 1650 cm 1The abbreviations used are: Meta I/II, metarhodopsin I/II; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. are observed as well in the amide I range, whereas there are deviations in the amide II range around 1550 cm−1. The latter, however, is superimposed with the strong ethylenic stretch modes of the respective chromophores. Also, in the fingerprint range between 1100 and 1300 cm−1, we observed difference bands characteristic of the respective retinal chromophores. To compare the content of the low-pH Meta II-like photoproduct of Rh6.10 with Meta II of native rhodopsin, we determined the amplitude of the Meta II marker band of Asp-83 at −1768/+1747 cm−1 (33Fahmy K. Jäger F. Beck M. Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10206-10210Google Scholar, 34Rath P. DeCaluwe L.L. Bovee-Geurts P.H. DeGrip W, J. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10277-10282Google Scholar) as a function of pH. We normalized these values with the total amount of pigment present in the single samples, which was determined from the absolute amide II band intensity at 1550 cm−1 in the absorption spectra. These values were ratioed against the corresponding value of full Meta II of native rhodopsin. The data obtained are plotted in Fig. 2 B and may serve as a rough estimate for the amount of Rh6.10 pigment converted to the active state conformation by photolysis. At the low-pH end, about 60% of the pigment adopts a Meta II-like conformation. The reduced yield compared with native rhodopsin is due in part to the strong overlap of the absorption bands, allowing only the establishment of a photoequilibrium between dark and photoproduct states in Rh6.10, and also presumably to the only partial regeneration yield during pigment preparation. With increasing pH, the amount of the active state photoproduct decreases such that there is less than 10% of this species at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, this considerable decrease may not be a direct consequence of a pH-dependent Meta I/Meta II equilibrium, which is established in native rhodopsin with a pK of 7.8 at 20 °C, as it is not counterbalanced by the formation of substantial amounts of a Meta I species, at least not up to pH 8.5. Instead it reflects a rather general decrease of the total photoproduct yield with increasing pH in favor of the inactive dark states. The structural similarity of the Rh6.10 photoproduct obtained at pH 5.0 to the active state of native rhodopsin suggests a similar activity of the low-pH photoproduct toward the visual G protein, transducin. As direct coupling to and activation of transducin is hampered by the low pH required for formation of the addressed photoproduct, this proposition was examined by testing its ability to interact with a specific peptide analogue derived from the transducin α-subunit C terminus, which is known to be involved in receptor-G protein coupling (36Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. König B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Google Scholar). This analogue, peptide 23 (ac-VLEDLKSCGLF), was previously shown to bind specifically with high affinity to the active state Meta II of native rhodopsin (31Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Google Scholar). Also, in the case of the Meta II-like photoproduct of Rh6.10, we observe characteristic changes between the FTIR difference spectra obtained in the presence and absence of peptide (Fig. 3 A). The double difference spectrum, “with peptide − w/o peptide,” gives the peptide binding spectrum, which is very similar to that obtained for native Meta II (Fig. 3 A) and is in full agreement with previously published peptide binding spectra (37Fahmy K. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1306-1318Google Scholar, 38Nishimura S. Kandori H. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15816-15824Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested the ability of the peptide to stabilize the Meta II-like photoproduct at the expense of the dark states in the photoequilibrium during illumination (extra-Meta II effect). At pH 7.5, where there is only a marginal contribution of the Meta II-like species to the photoproduct, we observed an ∼4-fold increase of this active state species in the presence of the peptide (Fig. 3 B). As described above, illumination of Rh6.10 at neutral pH produces a blue-shifted intermediate absorbing at about 495 nm. We observed that further illumination decreases this band and produces a new photoproduct absorbing at 385 nm (Fig.4 A). The formation of the latter intermediate is clearly evident by comparing the difference spectra of the short and long illuminations (Fig. 4 B). To characterize the newly formed 385 nm absorbing intermediate we carried out FTIR measurements. It is evident that the short (2 min) and long (additional 5 min) illuminations produce different photoproducts (Fig.4 C) and that the intermediate absorbing at 385 nm does not exhibit the characteristic protein conformational alterations observed in native rhodopsin Meta II or in the Rh6.10 Meta II-like photoproduct. Artificial pigments, in which isomerization around the critical double bond was prevented, were studied in both bacteriorhodopsin and bovine rhodopsin. It was demonstrated that in bacteriorhodopsin locking of the C13=C14 double bond eliminated proton pumping activities as well as the regular photocycle (39Fang J. Carriker J. Balogh-Nair V. Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 5162-5163Google Scholar, 40Chang C. Govindjee R. Ebrey T. Bagley K. Dollinger G. Eisenstein L. Marque J. Rodex H. Vittow J. Fang J. Nakanishi K. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 509-512Google Scholar, 41Delaney J. Brack T. Atkinson G. Ottolenghi M. Steinberg G. Sheves M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2101-2105Google Scholar, 42Zhang Q. Ruhman S. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Friedman N. Atkinson G. Delaney J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12828-12829Google Scholar). These studies concluded that the C13=C14 double bond is the only bond that can isomerize and that its locking did not open any detectable new avenue for a different isomerization. Therefore, the protein catalyzes the C13=C14 isomerization and, in addition, inhibits isomerization around double bonds other than C13=C14. In this respect we note that studies with locked retinals were performed also on rhodopsin ofChlamydomonas reinhardtii. Early studies have suggested that activity can be achieved without isomerization of any double bond (43Foster K.W. Saranak J. Derguini F. Zarrilli G.R. Johnson R. Okabe M. Nakanishi K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 819-824Google Scholar). However, further studies demonstrated that activity probably required isomerization of the C13=C14 double bond because locking this bond abolished activity (44Takahashi T. Yoshihara K. Watanabe M. Kubota M. Johnson R. Derguini F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1991; 178: 1273-1277Google Scholar). The situation might be different in bovine rhodopsin, which, as a visual pigment, regularly experiences isomerization around thecis C11=C12 double bond. For example, it is established that the binding site can accommodate the 9-cis retinal isomer, which forms isorhodopsin and isomerizes to all-trans following light absorption (8Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Google Scholar). The isomerization to all-trans initiates the formation of photochemically induced intermediates, which eventually lead to biological activity. In rhodopsin, locking one double bond may possibly lead to isomerization of another one. However, various locked rhodopsin artificial pigments did not exhibit photochemically induced intermediates or biological activity. Recent studies with the 11-cis-locked analogue Rh6.10 (containing a 6-member ring) demonstrated that isomerization around other double bonds does take place following light absorption (23Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that the specific conformation of the 6-member ring chromophore in the binding site and/or specific chromophore-protein interactions enable such an isomerization process. These studies, however, have also indicated that the usual transducin activation did not occur at neutral pH (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar, 22Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Google Scholar, 23Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar). Our present studies show that Rh6.10 membranes have a strongly pH-dependent photochemistry. At neutral pH, the major photochemical process is merely a photoequilibration between the two 11-cis-like isomers that form the dark state of the pigment, 11-cis and 9,11,13-tricis(21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar). This photoequilibration process (Fig. 1, C–E) is therefore not associated with major protein conformational alterations, as also confirmed by FTIR measurements and in keeping with the lack of significant transducin activity reported previously. The situation is completely different at pH 5.0, where in addition to this photoequilibration process, about half of the pigment is converted to an active Meta II-like photoproduct with a protonated Schiff base (Fig1 B). Because the Meta II-like photointermediate of Rh6.10 at pH 5.0 is characterized by a protonated Schiff base, we can conclude that the pKa of the protonated Schiff base in this intermediate is above 5. It was recently demonstrated that the pKa of the protonated Schiff base in the native rhodopsin Meta II is ∼2 and that it is considerably elevated by interaction with anions (32Vogel R. Fan G.B. Siebert F. Sheves M Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13342-13352Google Scholar). The elevated pKa observed in the Rh6.10 Meta II-like intermediate indicates an altered Schiff base environment (probably more hydrophilic) relative to that in native Meta II, thereby forming a “complex” counterion to the protonated Schiff base. Glu-113, the counterion to the protonated Schiff base in the dark state, becomes protonated during the activation of Rh6.10, similar to native rhodopsin, despite the fact that the Schiff base does not deprotonate. The coupling between the pK values of Glu-113 and the Schiff base is therefore much weaker in the activated receptor state compared with the dark state, and protonation of Glu-113 in the activated receptor seems to be determined by the protein conformational changes rather than by the protonation state of the Schiff base. This scenario has been suggested recently (14Fahmy K. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 171-181Google Scholar) and was confirmed in the meantime with native rhodopsin and a variety of rhodopsin mutants and analogues, which may form an activated state without deprotonation of the Schiff base (32Vogel R. Fan G.B. Siebert F. Sheves M Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13342-13352Google Scholar). At neutral pH, extended illumination additionally produces a strongly blue-shifted intermediate absorbing at 385 nm, in agreement with previous studies (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar, 22Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Google Scholar). FTIR measurements, however, clearly indicate that formation of this intermediate is not associated with protein changes characteristic of the active Meta II species, and furthermore, this intermediate does not bind peptide 23. The nature of this intermediate should be the subject of future studies. The question arises as to the mechanism by which an active protein conformation is produced to a substantial extent at pH 5.0 but only marginally at pH 7.5. According to their affinities for 11-cis- and all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, the four isomers of our 11-cis-locked retinal were classified as 11-cis-like and all-trans-like, respectively (23Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar); in the dark state of the pigment in membranes, the isomeric composition of the chromophores is shifted completely to the side of the 11-cis-like isomers (21DeGrip W.J. van Oostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. van der Steen R. van Amsterdam L.J. Groesbeek M. Lugtenburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 211-220Google Scholar). It therefore seems plausible that the active state conformation at low pH is achieved by accumulating all-trans-like isomers during illumination. As the pH is raised, the amount of this Meta II-like species decreases rapidly to a small residual level of about 10%, and yet no pH-dependent Meta I-like intermediate could be detected as a counterpart, which, in analogy to native Meta I, should combine an all-trans-like chromophore with a still inactive protein conformation. Instead, the chromophore composition seems to be dominated largely by the 11-cis-like isomers, and accumulation of all-trans-like isomers seems to be inhibited at neutral to alkaline pH. Possible mechanisms for such an inhibition are discussed in more detail in the accompanying article (24Vogel R. Fan G.-B. Lüdeke S. Siebert F. Sheves M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40222-40228Google Scholar). A previous study indicated substantial formation of all-trans-like isomers also at neutral pH (23Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar), which seems to be in conflict with our results. For those experiments the pigment was solubilized in detergent, which has a dramatic effect both on the Meta I/Meta II equilibrium of native rhodopsin (45Lamola A.A. Yamane T. Zipp A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 738-745Google Scholar) and on the flexibility of the chromophore binding pocket to accommodate different isomers (46Shichida Y. Nakamura K. Yoshizawa T. Trehan A. Denny M. Liu R.S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6495-6499Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that isomerization around the C11=C12 double bond of retinal is not per se a prerequisite for formation of the signaling state in rhodopsin. An all-trans-like, activating chromophore may be produced as well by isomerization around other double bonds, and locking the C11=C12 double bond in acis configuration therefore does not necessarily prevent activation. The active and inactive states of the receptor protein can instead be formed with whole families of retinal ligands stabilizing either of the two states with varying efficiency, and even in the absence of ligands, a pH-dependent equilibrium between the active and inactive conformations of opsin can be observed (30Vogel R. Siebert F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38487-38493Google Scholar). Nevertheless, nature uses the 11-cis to all-trans isomerization process of retinal exclusively in all known visual pigments. This is, however, not because it is the only possible way to convert the receptor protein from an inactive to a signaling state but rather because it is the most efficient way to perform photoreception. The 11-cis to all-transpathway combines a high quantum yield of photoisomerization with extremely low dark isomerization rates (47Birge R.R. Barlow R.B. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 55: 115-126Google Scholar, 48Rieke F. Baylor D.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2553-2572Google Scholar), thus allowing an exquisite sensitivity of the visual system under low light conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2006724451,"Archaeal rhodopsins, <i>e.g.</i>bacteriorhodopsin, all have cyclic photoreactions. Such cycles are achieved by a light-induced isomerization step of their retinal chromophores, which thermally re-isomerize in the dark. Visual pigment rhodopsins, which contain in the dark state an 11-<i>cis</i>retinal Schiff base, do not share such a mechanism, and following light absorption, they experience a bleaching process and a subsequent release of the photo-isomerized all-<i>trans</i> chromophore from the binding pocket. The pigment is eventually regenerated by the rebinding of a new 11-<i>cis</i> retinal. In the artificial visual pigment, Rh<sub>6.10</sub>, in which the retinal chromophore is locked in an 11-<i>cis</i> geometry by the introduction of a six-member ring structure, an activated receptor may be formed by light-induced isomerization around other double bonds. We have examined this activation of Rh<sub>6.10</sub> by UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy and have revealed that Rh<sub>6.10</sub> is a nonbleachable pigment. We could further show that the activated receptor consists of two different subspecies corresponding to 9-<i>trans</i> and 9-<i>cis</i> isomers of the chromophore. Both subspecies relax in the dark via separate pathways back to their respective inactive states by thermal isomerization presumably around the C<sub>13</sub>=C<sub>14</sub> double bond. This nonbleachable pigment can be repeatedly photolyzed to undergo identical activation-relaxation cycles. The rate constants of these photocycles are pH-dependent, and the half-times vary between several hours at acidic pH and about 1.5 min at neutral to alkaline pH, which is several orders of magnitude longer than for bacteriorhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W2086619016,"Regulation of the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit (GPHα) gene has been studied extensively in pituitary and placental cell lines, but little is known of the transcriptional regulators important for its ectopic expression. To investigate the molecular basis for ectopic expression, it was critical to define cis-regulatory elements and their cognatetrans-acting factors that modulate promoter activity in epithelial cell types that do not normally express GPH. DNA-mediated transient expression of promoter-reporter constructs was used to identify a novel negative regulatory element located at the GPHα gene transcription start site. Truncation or site-directed mutagenesis of this element produced up to a 10-fold increase in promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis detected a protein that binds specifically to a DNA motif encompassing the cap site. Based on competitive DNA binding studies with mutated oligonucleotides, it was determined that bases from −5 to −2 and +4 to +11 are critical for protein binding. The DNA sequence flanking the transcription start site from −9 to +11 is an imperfect palindrome; consequently, this motif is referred to as the cap site diad element (CSDE) and the cognate factor as the cap site-binding protein (CSBP). CSBP activity was present at different levels in nuclear extracts prepared from a variety of cell types. Significantly, the ratio of activities exhibited by the GPHα promoter with a mutated CSDE compared with the promoter with a wild-type CSDE was dependent on the transfected cell line and its content of CSBP. These results indicate that a negative regulatory element centered at the GPHα gene cap site and its cognate DNA-binding protein make a significant contribution to the production of α-subunit in a variety of tumor tissues.

The glycoprotein hormone (GPH) 1The abbreviations used are: GPH, glycoprotein hormone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CSBP, cap site-binding protein; CSDE, cap site diad element; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; DTT, dithiothreitol; EB, E-box; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; GPHα, glycoprotein hormone α-subunit; GSE, gonadotrope-specific element; LH, luteinizing hormone; PGBE, pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TSE, trophoblast-specific element; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone. family consists of four members, chorionic gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). These hormones are heterodimers, sharing a common α-subunit but having unique β-subunits that are thought to confer their biological specificity. LH, FSH, and TSH are produced in the anterior pituitary, whereas chorionic gonadotropin is synthesized in the developing placenta. Thus, it is significant that the isolated α- or β-subunits are also synthesized by a variety of tumors (1Weintraub B.D. Rosen S.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 335-342Google Scholar, 2Blackman M.R.

The free subunits are secreted by cell lines established from both trophoblastic (e.g. JAr, JEG-3) and nontrophoblastic (e.g. HeLa, ChaGo, CBT) tumors (16Ruddon R.W. Anderson C. Meade K.S.

In the latter instance, they are considered to be ectopic proteins, i.e. characteristic of a cell type other than that from which the tumor was derived. An active role for α-subunit at some stage of the tumorigenic process is supported by reports showing direct correlations between α-subunit production and tumor formation in nude mice (19Kumar S. Talwar G.P. Biswas D.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 42-47Google Scholar, 20Rivera R.T. Pasion S.G. Wong D.T. Fei Y. Biswas D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2423-2434Google Scholar) and the anchorage-independent growth of tumor cell lines in vitro (8Cox G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 425-431Google Scholar, 20Rivera R.T. Pasion S.G. Wong D.T. Fei Y. Biswas D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2423-2434Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms controlling human α-subunit gene expression in the placenta have been studied extensively. It has been shown that multiple elements in the first 300 bp of DNA upstream from the transcription start site (+1) are necessary to regulate the gene in a tissue-specific manner (21Jameson J.L. Hollenberg A.N. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 203-221Google Scholar). These are illustrated in Fig. 1. Basal promoter elements include consensus TATA and CAAT boxes residing at −29 and −89, respectively. Cyclic AMP-responsive elements (CREs) occur within two tandemly repeated 18-bp sequences that extend from −146 to −111 (22Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Google Scholar, 23Deutsch P.J. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12169-12174Google Scholar, 24Silver B.J. Bokar J.A. Virgin J.B. Vallen E.A. Milsted A.

The core CRE sequence is an 8-bp palindrome (TGACGTCA) that is also found in several other cAMP-responsive genes (25Hyman S.E. Comb M. Lin Y.S. Pearlberg J. Green M.R. Goodman H.M. Mol. Cell.

Adjacent to the CREs in the GPHα gene resides a tissue-specific enhancer located from −180 to −150 that stimulates basal levels of GPHα gene expression in placental choriocarcinoma cells (22Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Google Scholar, 31Jameson J.L. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16190-16196Google Scholar, 32Jameson J.L. Jaffe R.C.

The trophoblast-specific enhancer is a composite element, containing adjacent and overlapping DNA-binding domains for at least three proteins. The upstream enhancer requires the CRE to impart its effects on transcription (22Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Google Scholar, 32Jameson J.L. Jaffe R.C.

The distal and central domains are referred to as TSE (trophoblast-specific element) and upstream regulatory element, respectively (21Jameson J.L. Hollenberg A.N. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 203-221Google Scholar, 31Jameson J.L. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16190-16196Google Scholar, 32Jameson J.L. Jaffe R.C. Deutsch P.J. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 763-772Google Scholar); and the proximal region between −161 and −142 contains a GATA binding motif, originally identified as α-activation element, which is able to respond to cAMP (34Steger D.J. Altschmied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Google Scholar). Cellular proteins have been identified that interact specifically with these distinct regulatory elements (22Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Google Scholar, 23Deutsch P.J. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12169-12174Google Scholar,31Jameson J.L. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Control of cell-specific expression of the α-subunit gene in the pituitary differs from that in the placenta (21Jameson J.L. Hollenberg A.N. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 203-221Google Scholar, 32Jameson J.L. Jaffe R.C. Deutsch P.J. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9879-9886Google Scholar, 33Jameson J.L. Powers A.C. Gallagher G.D.

Regulation of GPHα gene expression in the JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell line and in the αT3–1 pituitary gonadotrope cell line is dependent on the CREs (38Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Google Scholar, 39Schoderbek W.E. Kim K.E. Ridgway E.C. Mellon P.L. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 893-903Google Scholar, 40Windle J.J. Weiner G.J. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Google Scholar). However, the trophoblast-specific enhancer seems not to be involved, and no TSE binding activity could be detected in gonadotrope or thyrotrope cell lines (38Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Google Scholar). In contrast, several regions upstream of the TSE have been implicated for expression in pituitary cells (40Windle J.J. Weiner G.J. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Google Scholar, 41Ocran K.W. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Gutierrez- Hartmann A. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 766-772Google Scholar, 42Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ocran K.W. Kao M.Y. Ridgway E.C. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1352-1361Google Scholar). The best characterized motif, called the gonadotrope-specific element (GSE), is located in the human gene from −223 to −197 and is conserved in all mammalian α-subunit genes examined thus far (38Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Google Scholar). A protein that binds this element was detected in αT3–1 cells but not in thyrotrope cells and was identified as steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (36Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 878-885Google Scholar). The regions (−480 to −417, −254 to −177, and −177 to −120) that confer thyrotrope-specific expression to the mouse α-subunit gene do not contain homology to the GSE (41Ocran K.W. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Gutierrez- Hartmann A. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 766-772Google Scholar, 42Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ocran K.W. Kao M.Y. Ridgway E.C. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1352-1361Google Scholar). The sequence between −344 and −300 is referred to as the pituitary glycoprotein basal element (PGBE), and an imperfect palindrome centered between −342 and −329 has been shown to bind a LIM homeodomain transcription factor (LH-2) (43Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Google Scholar). This suggests that a LIM homeodomain protein can stimulate expression of one of the earliest markers of pituitary differentiation. Regions comparable with the murine PGBE have yet to be identified in the human gene. In addition, two potential basic-helix-loop-helix protein binding sites (E-boxes) are located in the GPHα promoter just downstream (−21 to −16) and just upstream (−50 to −45) of the TATA box. These are referred to as αEB2 and αEB1, respectively, and their mutation reduces basal activity of the promoter 60–80% in pituitary cells (44Jackson S.M. Gutierrey-Hartmann A. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 278-291Google Scholar). Despite the identification and characterization of these basal and enhancer elements that confer tissue-specific activation of the GPHα gene in trophoblasts, gonadotropes, and thyrotropes, the molecular basis for its expression in nonendocrine cell types remains poorly understood. In HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, the GPH α-subunit is ectopically expressed and secreted at levels comparable with those in the eutopic expressing JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (7Cosgrove D.E. Campain J.A. Cox G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 44-54Google Scholar). However, previous studies have suggested that the α-subunit gene proximal promoter is not as active in HeLa cells as it is in JEG-3 cells and that HeLa cells do not have the requisite binding protein to interact with the TSE (22Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Google Scholar, 38Horn F. Windle J.J. Barnhart K.M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2143-2153Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms controlling ectopic production of the gonadotropin subunits in nonendocrine tumors, the regulation of GPHα gene expression was studied in HeLa cells. In a detailed analysis of the GPHα gene promoter sequence, an imperfect inverted repeat centered at the transcription start site was noted. It is demonstrated in this report that the palindromic cap site sequence constitutes a negative cis-acting element that differentially contributes to promoter activity in a variety of cell types depending on the level of a nuclear factor that demonstrates specific binding to the cap site sequence. The element and its cognatetrans-acting factor are referred to as the cap site diad element (CSDE) and cap site-binding protein (CSBP), respectively. HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, HT-29 colon carcinoma cells, Panc-1 pancreatic carcinoma cells, and GH4C1 murine pituitary cancer cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum. JEG-3 and JAr choriocarcinoma cells, U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells, and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The MCF-10A breast cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 5% equine serum, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.02 μg/ml epidermal growth factor. All media were also supplemented with glutamine (0.06%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown as monolayer cultures and maintained in T-flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 95% air and 5% CO2. (a) A 0.89-kbp fragment extending from −846 to +48 was liberated from a GPHα genomic clone (45Fiddes J.C. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 3-18Google Scholar) by digestion with BglII and BamHI. The pBLCAT3 vector (46Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar) was linearized with BamHI and ligated to the BglII/BamHI fragment with T4 DNA ligase, placing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under control of the wild-type α-subunit gene promoter, thereby generating pα(−846/+48)CAT. (b) To construct pα(−846/+3)CAT, the pα(−846/+48)CAT vector was digested withPstI, and the liberated fragment was isolated and subcloned into the polylinker PstI site of pBLCAT3.(c) To introduce point mutations into the cap site sequence, a DNA fragment extending from −1637 to +48 of the GPHα genomic clone (45Fiddes J.C. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 3-18Google Scholar) was subcloned into M13, and uracil-containing single-stranded DNA was isolated to serve as a template for mutagenesis (47Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zarkour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar, 48Zoller M.J. Smith M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6487-6500Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers changed bases at −5 to −2 from TAAC to ATTG (m-1) and bases at −4, −3, +4 and +6 from A, C, G, and T to T, G, A, and C, respectively (m-2). The fragments extending from −846 to +48 containing the point mutations were liberated from M13 and subcloned into pBLCAT3. (d) A synthetic oligonucleotide (CSDE, Table I) extending from −13 to +15 with BamHI overhangs was inserted in both forward and reverse orientation into theBamHI site of pα(−846/+3)CAT to generate pα(+3-CSDE)CAT and pα(+3-EDSC)CAT, respectively. (e) To fabricate HCAP and HPAC, pα(+3-CSDE)CAT and pα(+3-EDSC)CAT vectors were cut withPstI, and the larger fragments were gel-purified and recircularized. Appropriate recombinants were identified by PCR or restriction fragment analysis. Sequences across the cap site (underlined) were verified: HCAP (5′-GACTTCATTAACTGCAGTTACTGAGAAC-3′) restores the imperfect palindrome truncated at +15; HPAC (5′-GACTTCATTAACTGCAGTTAATGAAGTC-3′) creates a perfect palindrome. All mutations and the orientation and number of inserts in these reporter constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing (49Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfections were performed in duplicate using DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitates (50Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 10 μg of the appropriate pαCAT expression plasmid and 5 μg of the internal control plasmid pCMVlacZ, which places the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase gene under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Cells were harvested 48 h after glycerol shock, and cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity as described by Gorman et al. (51Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Google Scholar, 52Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar) and for β-galactosidase activity as described by Maniatis et al. (50Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for each sample. The aliquots assayed for CAT were heated at 65 °C for 10 min; those to be assayed for β-galactosidase activity were left unheated. Protein concentration of cell extracts was determined relative to a bovine serum albumin standard by the method of Bradford (53Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). In separate experiments, relative CAT activities for a given vector generally varied by no more than ± 20%. Stable transfectants were established by incubating HeLa SR3 cells with calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates containing 20 μg of either pα(−846/+48)CAT or pα(−846/+3)CAT plus 5 μg of pSV2neo. Twenty-four hours after the glycerol shock, cells were trypsinized and subcultured from a confluent T-25 flask into a T-75 flask in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Colonies present after 14 days were pooled and subcultured in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Crude nuclear extracts from HeLa, JEG-3, HT-29, Panc-1, GH4C1, U-2 OS, JAr, MCF-7, and MCF-10A cells were prepared as follows. Confluent cells in a 150-cm2 flask were washed and collected in a cold solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaC1, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmEGTA. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of cold nuclear wash buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mmNaCl, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After incubation for 10 min on ice, the cell lysates were underlaid with the above solution, omitting the Triton X-100 and increasing the sucrose concentration to 30%, and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of cold 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) plus 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer) and then incubated for 60 min on ice after adding 150 μl of a solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1m NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10 mmspermidine, and 2 mm PMSF. After pelleting the nuclei, protein extracts were dialyzed against 100 volumes of a buffer containing 200 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. After dialysis for 4 h, the buffer was replaced with an additional 100 volumes of fresh buffer, and dialysis was continued another 4 h. Protein concentration in nuclear extracts was determined as described by Bradford (53Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used as binding probes and competitors are summarized in Table I. EMSA was performed as described by Carthewet al. (54Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Google Scholar) with modification. Binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 10 μg of crude nuclear extract protein, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, and 0.5 mm DTT. Poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (2 μg) was added to eliminate nonspecific protein binding. For competition analysis, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with 50–200 ng of unlabeled oligonucleotide, which provided up to a 1000-fold excess of the competitor relative to the probe. After a 10-min preincubation at 22 °C, 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide (∼0.5 ng) was added, and incubation was continued for 30 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris base, 64.6 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA) and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides (−13/+22, Table I) were individually end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with the appropriate unlabeled complementary strand in excess. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were purified over a 20% polyacrylamide gel, eluted, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in TE buffer as described above. The probes were partially methylated by incubating 106 cpm of DNA in 5–10 μl of TE for 10 min at room temperature with 1–2 μl of dimethyl sulfate in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mmsodium cacodylate (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The reaction was stopped by adding 40 μl of a solution containing 1.5 mm NaOAc (pH 7.0), 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg of tRNA. The methylated probe was purified by ethanol precipitation. The methylated probe was subjected to standard EMSA, and bands corresponding to DNA-protein complex and free probe were excised and electroeluted into 0.1× TBE. The eluates were supplemented with 10 μg of tRNA, extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and cleared of nucleic acid by ethanol precipitation. Precipitates were rinsed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 30 μl of 0.5m piperidine. The DNA was hydrolyzed at 90 °C for 30 min and then precipitated twice with ethanol. The pellet was rinsed twice with 70% ethanol, air-dried, resuspended in 10 μl of a solution containing 80% (v/v) deionized formamide, 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and boiled for 2 min. Equal amounts of radioactivity derived from bound and free probe were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7m urea. Cells that were stably transfected with pα(−846/+48)CAT or pα(−846/+3)CAT were harvested from confluent flasks by scraping into ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl) and washed twice in the same solution by centrifugation (1200 ×g; 5 min; 4 °C). The cells were resuspended in ice-cold TE buffer and lysed by addition of 0.4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After removing nuclei by centrifugation, total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from the postnuclear supernatant by addition of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and phenol extraction as previously described (7Cosgrove D.E. Campain J.A. Cox G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 44-54Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide for specific priming of CAT reverse transcripts was CAT-REV2 (5′-GAGCTTGGCGAGATTTTCAGGAGCTAAGGAAGC-3′), which is located at −36 to −4 relative to the CAT gene translation start site. This primer (10 pmol) and dephosphorylated, HinfI-digested φX174 DNA (250 ng) were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After labeling, reactions were heated to 90 °C for 2 min to inactivate the T4 kinase. For primer extension, 1 μl of end-labeled primer was added to 15 μg of total RNA and 5 μl of 2× buffer, which contained 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm DTT, 2 mm each dNTP, and 1 mmspermidine. The primer and RNA were annealed by heating the tubes at 58 °C for 20 min followed by cooling at room temperature for 10 min. Reaction mixtures for extension were constructed by adding 5 μl of 2× avian myeloblastosis virus primer extension buffer, 1.4 μl of 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 1.6 μl of H2O to the annealing mixture. Incubation was at 42 °C for 30 min. The products were supplemented with 20 μl of loading dye and heated at 90 °C for 10 min. A sample aliquot of 10 μl and 1 μl of labeled φX174 DNA marker were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. The gel was run at 13 watts in 0.6× TBE buffer for about 4 h and subjected to autoradiography. The level of promoter activity for many genes can be defined by the array ofcis-acting elements in the proximal promoter upstream"
