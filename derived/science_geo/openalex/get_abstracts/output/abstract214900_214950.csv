https://openalex.org/W2087370309,"Several species of protozoa, during their logarithmic phases of growth, produce substances that prolong the logarithmic phase in other species. The effect is not as striking as the inhibition of growth caused by antibiotics, but a consistent 50-percent increase in growth has been obtained with Tetrahymena pyriformis in response to a factor produced by Colpidium campylum."
https://openalex.org/W2059953019,"Ultraviolet-polarizing filters with large apertures facilitate the use of spectrophotofluorometers for measuring fluorescence polarization. Such filters (i) allow the use of polarized exciting light even in the ultraviolet region, (ii) make it possible to correct for grating anomalies which influence the observed polarization, and (iii) because of good transmission properties allow the entrance of sufficient light so that small slits and dilute solutions can be used. Under optimum conditions, polarization can be measured with a precision of +/-0.002. Results obtained are in excellent agreement with values cited elsewhere and indicate that standard spectrophotofluorometers can easily be adapted for accurate measurement of polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2079793987,"Measurements of nuclear magnetic relaxation times for protons of water in living skeletal frog muscle show the transverse relaxation time,T2, increases when a muscle contracts isometrically. This result and other experimental data suggest that a fraction of the intracellular water molecules have restricted rotational freedom and that this fraction decreases when contraction occurs."

https://openalex.org/W2006570465,"The concentration of unbound corticosterone in mice exposed to the presence of a trained fighter is much greater if the mice have previously experienced physical defeat than if they have not. There is little difference in the concentration of the hormone between mice placed in the presence of a fighter, given a background of physical defeat, and mice actually attacked and defeated. Two possible categories of stimuli which could be responsible for hyperactivity of the adrenal cortex following defeat by another mouse are psychological and physical (for example, bite wounds); the former is apparently by far the more important under the conditions of these experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1974019435,Treatment of rats with puromycin and acetoxycycloheximide results in a defect in intestinal lipid transport. Under these conditions rats given corn oil accumulate triglyceride within the intestinal cells and fail to develop the normal postprandial hyperlipemia. The observed interference in lipid transport appears to be a consequence of impaired chylomicron formation.
https://openalex.org/W2060371369,"Optically active amino acids contain many highly efficient optical second-harmonic generators. When light from a ruby laser at 6943 A falls on the crystalline amino acids with sufficient intensity, the second harmonic of the light at 3471 A can be observed. Although the symmetry requirements for optical second-harmonic generation are always met by isomerically pure optically active substances, there is considerable variation in efficiency for the generation of the second harmonic, ranging from almost zero to greater than that of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, the most efficient known."
https://openalex.org/W1984083212,"The lifetime of the lymphocyte in hematologically normal women is 530 ± 64 days. This estimate, made from studies on 25 women who had received radiation therapy for cervical carcinoma, is based on the rate of disappearance of lymphocytes with acentric chromosome fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2082455554,"Newborn humans presented with pairs of shapes, each shape differing in number of turns (angles), prefer shapes with 10 turns to shapes with 5 turns or 20 turns, as inferred from photographic recordings of eye fixations."
https://openalex.org/W2015526043,"Purple adenine (ad-3) mutants induced in Neurospora crassa by 2-methoxy-6-chloro-9-(3-[ethyl-2-chloroethyl] aminopropylamino) acridine dihydrochloride (ICR-170) result from intragenic alterations. They are further characterized by low frequencies of leakiness, allelic complementation, and nonpolarized complementation patterns. These characteristics distinguish them from ad-3 mutants induced by x-rays, nitrous acid, and 2-aminopurine."
https://openalex.org/W2059750927,"Cells infected with the papovavirus SV40 not only synthesize viral antigen but also synthesize the specific nonviral antigen found in SV40-induced tumors. In the presence of the DNA antagonist cytosine arabinoside, infected cells fail to make viral antigen but still synthesize the tumor antigen. Iododeoxyuridine does not inhibit the synthesis either of tumor or of virus antigen but does prevent the development of infectious virus."
https://openalex.org/W1963896043,The DNA of Leishmania enriettii can be separated by equilibrium sedimentation in cesium chloride into a major band of density 1.721 and a minor component of density 1.699. DNA from isolated kinetoplasts of this protozoan was identified as the less dense minor component.
https://openalex.org/W2029779553,"Two different oncogenic viruses, polyoma and SV40, are capable of transforming mouse cell line 3T3. The properties of the transformed cells produced by the two viruses are in some ways similar, but in other ways they are specific for the infecting virus. This fact permits testing whether a cell line transformed by the one oncogenic virus is still susceptible to the transforming action of the second virus. Two different clonally isolated polyoma-transformed lines when infected with SV40 give rise to cells with properties characteristic of SV40-transformed cells. The frequency of transformation, however, is considerably reduced compared to that of the parent cell line, 3T3."
https://openalex.org/W2065633630,"By means of a microinjection technique, inulin-carboxyl-C14 or inulin-methoxy-H3 was injected into single proximal tubules of the rat at various urine flow rates. Urine collected separately from the two kidneys showed negligible amounts of inulin activity on the noninjected side, thus demonstrating directly that there is no significant reabsorption of inulin by the renal tubular epithelium under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1979915515,"Chorionic ""growth hormone-prolactin"" in serum and urine from pregnant women, in serum from umbilical cord, and in amniotic fluid was assayed by a sensitive immunological method dependent on the combination of rabbit antiserum to the growth hormone-prolactin with the iodine-131-labeled hormone. The hormone is detectable in serum and urine early in gestation, and with advancing pregnancy its concentration in serum continues to increase to a maximum during the last trimester. It was not found in serum within 8 hours after delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2064394895,Polymerization of certain mouse hemoglobins to eight-chain double molecules is completely inhibited by iodoacetamide. Each double molecule appears to consist of two α2β2-units linked by way of their β-chains with two disulfide bridges.
https://openalex.org/W78234750,"Experimental phenylketonuria can be produced in infant monkeys by feeding excessive quantities of L-phenylalanine soon after birth. Both the phenylketonuric monkey and the phenylketonuric human patient have elevated plasma levels of phenylalanine, and monkey and human excrete almost the same phenylalanine metabolites in the urine. Grand-mal convulsions, observed in some children with phenylketonuria, were also observed in the experimental animals. The biochemical evidence was supported by the learning data. The observed slowness in adapting to testing procedures, or even failure to adapt, and the inadequate performance suggest an intellectual deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2005713772,Pipettes with volumes ranging from less than one nanoliter to 200 nanoliters can be constructed by means of a simple mechanical system and calibrated by radioisotope and fluorescence techniques. Biological fluids can be transferred with a repeatability of 1 percent by this self-filling pipette of constant volume.
https://openalex.org/W2028374242,"Antibodies were produced in guinea pigs against A and B chains of bovine insulin; the chains were prepared by cleavage of all the disulfide bonds with sulfite. Antibodies against A chain reacted with A chain, but not with B chain or native insulin. Antibodies against B chain reacted strongly with both B chain and insulin, but not with A chain. Antibodies against insulin reacted strongly with insulin, weakly with B chain, and not at all with A chain. The results indicate that the insulin-reactive antibodies in antiserums to B chain and to insulin differ and are directed to differing individual antigenic regions of the insulin molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1967653086,Separated chains from antibody of different rabbits do not always give effective binding sites although combination of the chains does occur. There is a specificity of combination such that only chains from the same (or perhaps a related) rabbit form effective binding sites. There appears to be preferential combination between those chains which yield effective sites.

https://openalex.org/W2013788730,"An antagonistic action can be demonstrated between lincomycin, a new antibiotic, and erythromycin, when the two drugs are allowed to diffuse into the same area of an agar plate seeded with a strain of Staphylococcus which is resistant to erythromycin but sensitive to lincomycin. The increase in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of lincomycin in the presence of erythromycin may be significant in clinical application. The antagonism does not depend on a reaction between the two antibiotics, but appears to be the result of an altered metabolism stimulated by erythromycin on erythromycin-resistant staphylococci."
https://openalex.org/W2037777371,"The ""viable yellow"" (A(vy)-) mouse genotype produces phenotypes with ""clear yellow,"" ""black spotted,"" and ""agouti"" coat color. ""Agouti"" A(vy)a mice gain weight at a lower rate and contain significantly less fat and water than ""clear"" and ""spotted"" A(vy)- mice but have similar nonfat dry weights. Between 4 and 28 weeks of age, the length of the tail increases at the same rate in all phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2030232305,"Compared with other species, the rat is unusually vulnerable to polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. In the rat, relatively small amounts of carcinogenic aromatics (i) profoundly depress incorporation of thymidine in DNA, (ii) greatly induce menadione reductase in liver, and (iii) then kill the rat."

https://openalex.org/W1980098591,"Measurements of the cesium-137 content of northern Alaskan natives during the summer of 1964 indicated that the adults of the interior village of Anaktuvuk Pass had the highest average body burden: 1280 nanocuries of cesium-137. This is an increase of 200 percent over the average body burden found in the summer of 1962 and 100 percent over that found in the summer of 1963. The greatest burden found in a native in 1964 was 2.4 microcuries of cesium-137, but the highest burden of all, 3.0 microcuries, was measured in a non-native living mainly on caribou meat. Sodium-22 was found in samples of urine from Eskimos, and subsequently in the Eskimos themselves and in reindeer and caribou meat."
https://openalex.org/W2073853124,Photosynthetic cultures of Euglena gracilis Z which were illuminated during growth were more resistant to the lethal effect of high hydrostatic pressures than nonphotosynthetic cultures grown in the dark. A high percentage of mutants permanently lacking chlorophyll and with altered carotenoids was obtained after subjecting cultures to high pressure. A minimum pressure of 500 atmospheres was critical for color mutation and morphological change. The highest effective pressure used was 1000 atmospheres.
https://openalex.org/W1988331384,"The radio frequency induction technique is now an important tool in physiological experiments and in the treatment of certain diseases. It has come to play an important role in the treatment of heart block in human patients, where medication has been ineffective. In the case of bladder stimulation, work with animals has shown that the voiding of urine can be induced by electrical stimulation. The successful use of this technique on human patients has yet to be consistently achieved, but there is reason to be optimistic."

https://openalex.org/W2009651346,"The existence of an area in Europe in which histoplasmosis is endemic was revealed by the isolation of Histoplasma capsulatum from soil. The soil specimen was collected in a chicken yard on a farm near Bologna, Italy. The Emilia-Romagna region had been selected for study because several, apparently autochthonous, human cases of histoplasmosis had originated there."
https://openalex.org/W2083186415,"Eight collared lizards were tested on a modified Lashley apparatus for brightness discrimination. The animals reached the criterion level of learning in 335 trials and exhibited behavior on the choice platform comparable to that of the rat presented with a similar problem. The pattern of latency appears to be atypical in the lizard, since there was little decrement throughout the learning period."
https://openalex.org/W2012612245,"Individual fractions of polysomes were isolated from yeast. Pulse labeling experiments in vivo show constant specific activity of messenger RNA in each polysome peak; this suggests a uniform density of ribosomes per unit length of messenger RNA. In the cell-free incorporating system, the amount of peptide per ribosome unit increased with the size of polysome."
https://openalex.org/W2035753653,"Ova were sought in the washings of the excised reproductive tracts of 48 patients after they had ovulated. From 24 patients using no contraceptives, two unfertilized ova were recovered. From 24 patients using intrauterine coils, one unfertilized and one fertilized pronuclear ovum were recovered. The latter ovum was at the earliest stage of development recorded for the human."
https://openalex.org/W1978759717,"The maternally transmitted ""sex-ratio"" condition in several species of Drosophila appears to be due to infection by a microorganism of the genus Treponema. Drosophila bifasciata is an exception, since no microorganism has been found in the ""sex-ratio"" strains of this species. Normal D. bifasciata can be infected by injection of the hemolymph of a ""sex-ratio"" strain of D. willistoni containing treponemas. The progenies of the infected D. bifasciata, up to and including the F(4) and F(5) generations, have numerous treponemas in their hemolymph. Their progenies are, however, not unisexual, although both females and males are infected. The hemolymph of these D. bifasciata injected in D. melanogaster females causes typical ""sex-ratio"" symptoms in the progenies of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2012419991,Muscle strips taken from chronically denervated hemidiaphragms of guinea pigs immunized to ovalbumin react in vitro to the administration of small amounts of this protein with a contraction similar to that of visceral muscle in the Schultz-Dale reaction. A sustained shortening is produced by histamine on denervated diaphragmatic muscle from both sensitized and nonsensitized guinea pigs.

https://openalex.org/W2014291132,Potentially masculine gonads of Aedes stimulans (Diptera: Culicidae) can be induced to become ovaries by exposing larvae to elevated temperatures. A juvenile gonad when transplanted into another larva will become a testis or an ovary in response to stimuli which are wholly intrinsic in the implanted gonad. Humoral factors in the hemocoel of the larval host do not influence the direction of morphogenesis of the implanted organ.

https://openalex.org/W1963634288,"Cell-bound complement components are not destroyed by mercaptoethanol. Destruction of cell-bound hemolytic antibody was prevented by cell-bound complement components. In the absence of cells, the complement components C'3 and C'4 were most susceptible to destruction by mercaptoethanol; C'1, C'1a, and C'2 were most resistant. Mercaptoethanol (0.01M) increases C'1 activity, and this increase is not due to activation of C'1 to C'1a. Destruction of some components required both mercaptoethanol and iodoacetamide treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1980360514,"ANY heterogeneity in the pore structure of an ionic membrane, such as differences in pore width, charge density at the pore walls, or the sign of these charges, renders the membrane electrochemically a mosaic1. When such a mosaic membrane is interposed between two electrolytic solutions of different composition its different parts will ordinarily give rise to different potentials. Consequently, the various parts of the mosaic interact electrically; spontaneous local circuits arise, somewhat analogous to those causing metal corrosion1–3."
