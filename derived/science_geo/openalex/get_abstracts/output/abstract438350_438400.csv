https://openalex.org/W2091552865,"Excessive dietary fructose intake may have an important role in the current epidemics of fatty liver, obesity and diabetes as its intake parallels the development of these syndromes and because it can induce features of metabolic syndrome. The effects of fructose to induce fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance, however, vary dramatically among individuals. The first step in fructose metabolism is mediated by fructokinase (KHK), which phosphorylates fructose to fructose-1-phosphate; intracellular uric acid is also generated as a consequence of the transient ATP depletion that occurs during this reaction. Here we show in human hepatocytes that uric acid up-regulates KHK expression thus leading to the amplification of the lipogenic effects of fructose. Inhibition of uric acid production markedly blocked fructose-induced triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism whereby uric acid stimulates KHK expression involves the activation of the transcription factor ChREBP, which, in turn, results in the transcriptional activation of KHK by binding to a specific sequence within its promoter. Since subjects sensitive to fructose often develop phenotypes associated with hyperuricemia, uric acid may be an underlying factor in sensitizing hepatocytes to fructose metabolism during the development of fatty liver."

Subjects were recruited at health camps in both the areas. Health status was evaluated with health questionnaires, spirometry and blood hematology measures. Cr (VI) was measured in groundwater samples by diphenylcarbazide reagent method.Residents from communities with known Cr (VI) contamination had more self-reports of digestive and dermatological disorders and hematological abnormalities. GI distress was reported in 39.2% vs. 17.2% males (AOR = 3.1) and 39.3% vs. 21% females (AOR = 2.44); skin abnormalities in 24.5% vs. 9.2% males (AOR = 3.48) and 25% vs. 4.9% females (AOR = 6.57). Residents from affected communities had greater RBCs (among 30.7% males and 46.1% females), lower MCVs (among 62.8% males) and less platelets (among 68% males and 72% females) than matched controls. There were no differences in leucocytes count and spirometry parameters.Living in communities with Cr (VI) groundwater is associated with gastrointestinal and dermatological complaints and abnormal hematological function. Limitations of this study include small sample size and the lack of long term follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2070002251,"Potassium (K) is an important plant macronutrient that has various functions throughout the whole plant over its entire life span. Cytokinins (CKs) are known to regulate macronutrient homeostasis by controlling the expression of nitrate, phosphate and sulfate transporters. Although several studies have described how CKs signal deficiencies for some macronutrients, the roles of CKs in K signaling are poorly understood. CK content has been shown to decrease under K-starved conditions. Specifically, a CK-deficient mutant was more tolerant to low K than wild-type; however, a plant with an overaccumulation of CKs was more sensitive to low K. These results suggest that K deprivation alters CK metabolism, leading to a decrease in CK content. To investigate this phenomenon further, several Arabidopsis lines, including a CK-deficient mutant and CK receptor mutants, were analyzed in low K conditions using molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches. ROS accumulation and root hair growth in low K were also influenced by CKs. CK receptor mutants lost the responsiveness to K-deficient signaling, including ROS accumulation and root hair growth, but the CK-deficient mutant accumulated more ROS and exhibited up-regulated expression of HAK5, which is a high-affinity K uptake transporter gene that is rapidly induced by low K stress in ROS- and ethylene-dependent manner in response to low K. From these results, we conclude that a reduction in CK levels subsequently allows fast and effective stimulation of low K-induced ROS accumulation, root hair growth and HAK5 expression, leading to plant adaptation to low K conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2041685657,"Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, we investigated the relevance of the UPR in a mouse model of chronic MPTP/probenecid (MPTP/P) injection, which causes severe and persistent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Enhanced activation of the UPR branches, including ATF6α and PERK/eIF2α/ATF4, was observed after MPTP/P injections into mice. Deletion of the ATF6α gene accelerated neuronal degeneration and ubiquitin accumulation relatively early in the MPTP/P injection course. Surprisingly, astroglial activation was strongly suppressed, and production of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-oxidative genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and xCT, in astrocytes were reduced in ATF6α −/− mice after MPTP/P injections. Decreased BDNF expression in ATF6α −/− mice was associated with decreased expression of GRP78, an ATF6α-dependent molecular chaperone in the ER. Decreased HO-1 and xCT levels were associated with decreased expression of the ATF4-dependent pro-apoptotic gene CHOP. Consistent with these results, administration of the UPR-activating reagent tangeretin (5,6,7,8,4′-pentamethoxyflavone; IN19) into mice enhanced the expression of UPR-target genes in both dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes, and promoted neuronal survival after MPTP/P injections. These results suggest that the UPR is activated in a mouse model of chronic MPTP/P injection, and contributes to the survival of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, in part, through activated astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2078583788,"Epigenetic changes are involved in a wide range of common human diseases. Although DNA methylation defects are known to be associated with male infertility in mice, their impact on human deficiency of sperm production has yet to be determined. We have assessed the global genomic DNA methylation profiles in human infertile male patients with spermatogenic disorders by using the Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip. Three populations were studied: conserved spermatogenesis, spermatogenic failure due to germ cell maturation defects, and Sertoli cell-only syndrome samples. A disease-associated DNA methylation profile, characterized by targeting members of the PIWI-associated RNA (piRNA) processing machinery, was obtained. Bisulfite genomic sequencing and pyrosequencing in a large cohort (n = 46) of samples validated the altered DNA methylation patterns observed in piRNA-processing genes. In particular, male infertility was associated with the promoter hypermethylation-associated silencing of PIWIL2 and TDRD1. The downstream effects mediated by the epigenetic inactivation of the PIWI pathway genes were a defective production of piRNAs and a hypomethylation of the LINE-1 repetitive sequence in the affected patients. Overall, our data suggest that DNA methylation, at least that affecting PIWIL2/TDRD1, has a role in the control of gene expression in spermatogenesis and its imbalance contributes to an unsuccessful germ cell development that might explain a group of male infertility disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2036419366,"Human milk contains a large diversity of free glycans beyond lactose, but their functions are not well understood. To explore their functional recognition, here we describe a shotgun glycan microarray prepared from isolated human milk glycans (HMGs), and our studies on their recognition by viruses, antibodies, and glycan-binding proteins (GBPs), including lectins. The total neutral and sialylated HMGs were derivatized with a bifunctional fluorescent tag, separated by multidimensional HPLC, and archived in a tagged glycan library, which was then used to print a shotgun glycan microarray (SGM). This SGM was first interrogated with well defined GBPs and antibodies. These data demonstrated both the utility of the array and provided preliminary structural information (metadata) about this complex glycome. Anti-TRA-1 antibodies that recognize human pluripotent stem cells specifically recognized several HMGs that were then further structurally defined as novel epitopes for these antibodies. Human influenza viruses and Parvovirus Minute Viruses of Mice also specifically recognized several HMGs. For glycan sequencing, we used a novel approach termed metadata-assisted glycan sequencing (MAGS), in which we combine information from analyses of glycans by mass spectrometry with glycan interactions with defined GBPs and antibodies before and after exoglycosidase treatments on the microarray. Together, these results provide novel insights into diverse recognition functions of HMGs and show the utility of the SGM approach and MAGS as resources for defining novel glycan recognition by GBPs, antibodies, and pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2027282106,"Protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) provide spatio-temporal specificity for the omnipotent cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) via high affinity interactions with PKA regulatory subunits (PKA-RI, RII). Many PKA-RII-AKAP complexes are heavily tethered to cellular substructures, whereas PKA-RI-AKAP complexes have remained largely undiscovered. Here, using a cAMP affinity-based chemical proteomics strategy in human heart and platelets, we uncovered a novel, ubiquitously expressed AKAP, termed small membrane (sm)AKAP due to its specific localization at the plasma membrane via potential myristoylation/palmitoylation anchors. In vitro binding studies revealed specificity of smAKAP for PKA-RI (K(d) = 7 nM) over PKA-RII (K(d) = 53 nM) subunits, co-expression of smAKAP with the four PKA R subunits revealed an even more exclusive specificity of smAKAP for PKA-RIα/β in the cellular context. Applying the singlet oxygen-generating electron microscopy probe miniSOG indicated that smAKAP is tethered to the plasma membrane and is particularly dense at cell-cell junctions and within filopodia. Our preliminary functional characterization of smAKAP provides evidence that, like PKA-RII, PKA-RI can be tightly tethered by a novel repertoire of AKAPs, providing a new perspective on spatio-temporal control of cAMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2131977263,"To develop and test new therapeutics and immune prophylaxis strategies for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), understanding tissue parasitism evolution after experimental infection with Leishmania infantum is important. Experimental infection in a hamster model (Mesocricetus auratus) reproduces several typical aspects of canine and human VL that are closely related to the inoculum's route. We quantified the parasitism in the liver and spleen of hamsters experimentally infected by various routes (intradermal, intraperitoneal, and intracardiac [IC]) and different strains of L. infantum (MHOM/BR/74/PP75 and Wild) and compared two different methodologies to evaluate tissue parasitism (Leishman Donovan units [LDU] and real-time qPCR). In addition, the quantification of specific total-IgG in the serum of uninfected and infected hamsters was determined by ELISA. The animals were followed for 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-infection for survival analysis. We found that infection with the Wild strain by the IC route resulted in higher mortality. Positive antibody (IgG) responses were detected with higher peaks at 6 and 9 months in the IC group inoculated with PP75 strain. However, in animals infected with the Wild strain the IgG levels were elevated in all infected groups during all the time evaluated. We also observed by LDU analysis that the IC route lead to higher parasitism in the liver and spleen with both strains. Furthermore, qPCR showed higher sensitivity for identifying animals with low parasitic burden. In conclusion, qPCR can be useful for assessing parasitism in the spleen and liver of a hamster model infected with L. infantum independent of the route of infection, and this technique may become an essential tool for assessing parasite density in the hamster model after experimental treatment or immunization with potential vaccine candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2119390425,"Preliminary data mostly from animal models suggest the sST2/IL-33 pathway may have causal relevance for vascular disease and diabetes and thus point to a potential novel inflammatory link to cardiometabolic disease. However, the characterisation of sST2 levels in terms of metabolic or vascular risk in man is completely lacking. We sought to address this gap via a comprehensive analysis of risk factor and vascular correlates of sST2 in a cross-sectional study (pSoBid). We measured sST2 in plasma in 639 subjects and comprehensively related it to cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors and imaged atherosclerosis measures. Circulating sST2 levels increased with age, were lower in women and in highest earners. After adjusting for age and gender, sST2 levels associated strongly with markers of diabetes, including triglycerides [effect estimate (EE) per 1 standard deviation increase in sST2∶1.05 [95%CI 1.01,1.10]), liver function (alanine aminotransaminase [ALT] and γ-glutamyl transferase [GGT]: EE 1.05 [1.01,1.09] and 1.13 [1.07,1.19] respectively), glucose (1.02 [1.00,1.03]) and sICAM-1 (1.05 [1.02,1.07]). However, sST2 levels were not related to smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, or atheroma (carotid intima media thickness, plaque presence). These results suggest that sST2 levels, in individuals largely without vascular disease, are related principally to markers associated with diabetes and ectopic fat and add support for a role of sST2 in diabetes. Further mechanistic studies determining how sST2 is linked to diabetes pathways may offer new insights into the inflammatory paradigm for type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2029828369,"Ubiquitination plays an important role in the DNA damage response. We identified a novel interaction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8 with Nbs1, a key regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We found that Nbs1 is ubiquitinated both before and after DNA damage and is a direct ubiquitination substrate of RNF8. We also identified key residues on Nbs1 that are ubiquitinated by RNF8. By using laser microirradiation and live-cell imaging, we observed that RNF8 and its ubiquitination activity are important for promoting optimal binding of Nbs1 to DSB-containing chromatin. We also demonstrated that RNF8-mediated ubiquitination of Nbs1 contributes to the efficient and stable binding of Nbs1 to DSBs and is important for HR-mediated DSB repair. Taken together, these studies suggest that Nbs1 is one important target of RNF8 to regulate DNA DSB repair. Ubiquitination plays an important role in the DNA damage response.

https://openalex.org/W2133087609,"The spatial and temporal control of chromosome duplication and segregation is crucial for proper cell division. While this process is well studied in eukaryotic and some prokaryotic organisms, relatively little is known about it in prokaryotic polyploids such as Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which is known to possess one to eight copies of its single chromosome. Using a fluorescent repressor-operator system, S. elongatus chromosomes and chromosome replication forks were tagged and visualized. We found that chromosomal duplication is asynchronous and that the total number of chromosomes is correlated with cell length. Thus, replication is independent of cell cycle and coupled to cell growth. Replication events occur in a spatially random fashion. However, once assembled, replisomes move in a constrained manner. On the other hand, we found that segregation displays a striking spatial organization in some cells. Chromosomes transiently align along the major axis of the cell and timing of alignment was correlated to cell division. This mechanism likely contributes to the non-random segregation of chromosome copies to daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064464679,"We studied a sample of 75 Chinese, 73 Malay, and 29 Indian healthy neonates taking part in a cohort study to examine potential differences in neonatal brain morphology and white matter microstructure as a function of ethnicity using both structural T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We first examined the differences in global size and morphology of the brain among the three groups. We then constructed the T2-weighted MRI and DTI atlases and employed voxel-based analysis to investigate ethnic differences in morphological shape of the brain from the T2-weighted MRI, and white matter microstructure measured by fractional anisotropy derived from DTI. Compared with Malay neonates, the brains of Indian neonates' tended to be more elongated in anterior and posterior axis relative to the superior-inferior axis of the brain even though the total brain volume was similar among the three groups. Although most anatomical regions of the brain were similar among Chinese, Malay, and Indian neonates, there were anatomical variations in the spinal-cerebellar and cortical-striatal-thalamic neural circuits among the three populations. The population-related brain regions highlighted in our study are key anatomical substrates associated with sensorimotor functions."
https://openalex.org/W2046176479,"Background The hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) describes high amyloid deposition and hypometabolism at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. However, it remains unknown whether brain amyloidosis and hypometabolism follow the same trajectories in MCI individuals. We used the concept of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) as defined by the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-Go in order to compare the biomarker profile between EMCI and LMCI. Objectives To examine the global and voxel-based neocortical amyloid burden and metabolism among individuals who are cognitively normal (CN), as well as those with EMCI, LMCI and mild AD. Methods In the present study, 354 participants, including CN (n = 109), EMCI (n = 157), LMCI (n = 39) and AD (n = 49), were enrolled between September 2009 and November 2011 through ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. Brain amyloid load and metabolism were estimated using [18F]AV45 and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET, respectively. Uptake ratio images of [18F]AV45 and [18F]FDG were calculated by dividing the summed PET image by the median counts of the grey matter of the cerebellum and pons, respectively. Group differences of global [18F]AV45 and [18F]FDG were analyzed using ANOVA, while the voxel-based group differences were estimated using statistic parametric mapping (SPM). Results EMCI patients showed higher global [18F]AV45 retention compared to CN and lower uptake compared to LMCI. SPM detected higher [18F]AV45 uptake in EMCI compared to CN in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, medial and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. EMCI showed lower [18F]AV45 retention than LMCI in the superior temporal, inferior parietal, as well as dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. Regarding to the global [18F]FDG, EMCI patients showed no significant difference from CN and a higher uptake ratio compared to LMCI. At the voxel level, EMCI showed higher metabolism in precuneus, hippocampus, entorhinal and inferior parietal cortices, as compared to LMCI. Conclusions The present results indicate that brain metabolism remains normal despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation in EMCI. These results suggest a role for anti-amyloid interventions in EMCI aiming to delay or halt the deposition of amyloid and related metabolism impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2104895781,"The song of a male zebra finch is a stereotyped motor sequence whose tempo varies with social context--whether or not the song is directed at a female bird--as well as with the time of day. The neural mechanisms underlying these changes in tempo are unknown. Here we show that brain temperature recorded in freely behaving male finches exhibits a global increase in response to the presentation of a female bird. This increase strongly correlates with, and largely explains, the faster tempo of songs directed at a female compared to songs produced in social isolation. Furthermore, we find that the observed diurnal variations in song tempo are also explained by natural variations in brain temperature. Our findings suggest that brain temperature is an important variable that can influence the dynamics of activity in neural circuits, as well as the temporal features of behaviors that some of these circuits generate."
https://openalex.org/W1967636456,"We describe the improvement of transglycosylation (TG) by chitinase D from Serratia proteamaculans (SpChiD). The SpChiD produced a smaller quantity of TG products for up to 90 min with 2 mm chitotetraose as the substrate and subsequently produced only hydrolytic products. Of the five residues targeted at the catalytic center, E159D resulted in substantial loss of both hydrolytic and TG activities. Y160A resulted in a product profile similar to SpChiD and a rapid turnover of substrate with slightly increased TG activity. The rest of the three mutants, M226A, Y228A, and R284A, displayed improved TG and decreased hydrolytic ability. Four of the five amino acid substitutions, F64W, F125A, G119S, and S116G, at the catalytic groove increased TG activity, whereas W120A completely lost the TG activity with a concomitant increase in hydrolysis. Mutation of Trp-247 at the solvent-accessible region significantly reduced the hydrolytic activity with increased TG activity. The mutants M226A, Y228A, F125A, S116G, F64W, G119S, R284A, and W247A accumulated approximately double the concentration of TG products like chitopentaose and chitohexaose, compared with SpChiD. The double mutant E159D/F64W regained the activity with accumulation of 6.0% chitopentaose at 6 h, similar to SpChiD at 30 min. Loss of chitobiase activity was unique to Y228A. Substitution of amino acids at the catalytic center and/or groove substantially improved the TG activity of SpChiD, both in terms of the quantity of TG products produced and the extended duration of TG activity."
https://openalex.org/W2088398279,"The mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR acts a stress response protein whose function and/or protein stability are modulated by diverse stress stimuli through posttranslational modifications. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which metabolic stress facilitates proteasomal degradation of HuR in cancer cells. In response to the glucose transporter inhibitor CG-5, HuR translocates to the cytoplasm, where it is targeted by the ubiquitin E3 ligase β-TrCP1 for degradation. The cytoplasmic localization of HuR is facilitated by PKCα-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-318 as the Ser-318 → alanine substitution abolishes the ability of the resulting HuR to bind PKCα and to undergo nuclear export. The mechanistic link between β-TrCP1 and HuR degradation was supported by the ability of ectopically expressed β-TrCP1 to mimic CG-5 to promote HuR degradation and by the protective effect of dominant negative inhibition of β-TrCP1 on HuR ubiquitination and degradation. Substrate targeting of HuR by β-TrCP1 was further verified by coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro GST pull-down assays and by the identification of a β-TrCP1 recognition site. Although HuR does not contain a DSG destruction motif, we obtained evidence that β-TrCP1 recognizes an unconventional motif, (296)EEAMAIAS(304), in the RNA recognition motif 3. Furthermore, mutational analysis indicates that IKKα-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-304 is crucial to the binding of HuR to β-TrCP1. Mechanistically, this HuR degradation pathway differs from that reported for heat shock and hypoxia, which underlies the complexity in the regulation of HuR turnover under different stress stimuli. The ability of glycolysis inhibitors to target the expression of oncogenic proteins through HuR degradation might foster novel strategies for cancer therapy."

Enhanced efficacy without further cleft closure. Reevaluating twist as a source of agonist efficacy in AMPA receptors.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structures, it was initially thought that the extent of cleft closure is the primary mechanism by which agonists mediate receptor activation, i.e., increased cleft closure leads to increased activation (23.Gouaux E. Structure and function of AMPA receptors.J. Physiol. 2004; 554: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, there were several structures such as those of the glutamate-bound form of the T686A mutant and the structures of the AMPA bound form of the L650T mutant that do not follow this trend (22.Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Tuning activation of the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 ion channel by genetic adjustment of agonist-induced conformational changes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ensemble FRET investigations with the wild type and L650T mutant were consistent with the x-ray structures, further validating these deviations from the cleft closure hypothesis (28.Mankiewicz K.A. Rambhadran A. Wathen L. Jayaraman V.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent single-molecule FRET (smFRET) investigations of wild type and T686S mutant receptors provide additional insight into the complete structural landscape in terms of cleft closure (30.Landes C.F. Rambhadran A. Taylor J.N. Salatan F. Jayaraman V. Structural landscape of isolated agonist-binding domains from single AMPA receptors.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies showed that both the most probable state and the average state probed by the T686S mutant showed a closed cleft conformation consistent with the x-ray structures. However, the T686S mutant protein also probed a wider range of cleft closure states that covered more open states than the glutamate bound wild type receptor. Thus, the probability that the T686S mutant was in the closed state was lower than that of the wild type protein when bound to glutamate, and this decrease in probability could lead to lower activation (27.Zhang W. Cho Y. Lolis E. Howe J.R. Structural and single-channel results indicate that the rates of ligand binding domain closing and opening directly impact AMPA receptor gating.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30.Landes C.F. Rambhadran A. Taylor J.N. Salatan F. Jayaraman V. Structural landscape of isolated agonist-binding domains from single AMPA receptors.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These smFRET investigations emphasized the need to study the overall cleft closure landscape and dynamics of the agonist-binding domain to obtain a better insight into the role of cleft closure in activation. The smFRET results are also consistent with NMR investigations that show wide variation in the dynamics of the agonist-binding domain upon binding to different agonists. In particular, NMR studies investigating the methyl group dynamics indicate that at slower time scales, willardiines, which are partial agonists of the AMPA receptor, exhibit the largest flexibility in the agonist-binding domain relative to full agonists and antagonists (31.Fenwick M.K. Oswald R.E. NMR spectroscopy of the ligand-binding core of ionotropic glutamate receptor 2 bound to 5-substituted willardiine partial agonists.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32.Maltsev A.S. Oswald R.E. Hydrophobic side chain dynamics of a glutamate receptor ligand binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10154-10162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we have performed smFRET investigations with substituted willardiines bound to the agonist-binding domain and compared the spectrum of states that the protein probes to the previously reported NMR-based dynamics and additionally correlated these results with activation of the receptor. The plasmid expressing the agonist-binding domain of the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors was provided by Dr. Eric Gouaux (Oregon Health and Science University). Mutations T394C and S652C were made by standard mutation reactions using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies). Plasmid expressing this double mutant was transformed, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli origami DE3 cells (EMD Chemicals) in LB broth, Miller (Fisher Scientific) containing ampicillin (Sigma Aldrich), kanamycin (Fisher Scientific), and tetracycline (Shelton Scientific) at concentrations of 50, 15, and 12.5 μg/ml, respectively. The protein expression was induced using isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher Scientific) when cells reached an optical density of 0.8–0.9. After isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside addition, cells were grown at 20 °C for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in 20 mm Tris buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm glutamate, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml lysozyme, 125 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate, 25 μg/ml DNaseI. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm, 4 °C for 45 min. The supernatant was then purified using a HiTrap nickel column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm glutamate. The protein was labeled with a 1:3 ratio of maleimide derivatives of Alexa 555 (donor) and Alexa 647 (acceptor) (Invitrogen), respectively. The ratio was confirmed using absorbance measurements. Protein was allowed to conjugate with the fluorophores by incubating overnight at 4 °C in dark. The protein sample was dialyzed to remove the excess unbound fluorophores in phosphate-buffered saline without glutamate, and the appropriate willardiine derivative (Abcam Biochemicals) was added to the protein. This sample was then treated with sulfolink resin for 30 min. The resin was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was conjugated with biotin-conjugated anti-His antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals) and used for smFRET investigations. Standard 22 × 22-mm glass microscope slides were plasma cleaned to remove the organic residues and other impurities from the surface. The surface was then functionalized with aminosilane groups through the Vectabond procedure. In this procedure, the slides were first treated with Vectabond-acetone 1% (w/v) solution (Vector Laboratories) for 5 min, rinsed with molecular biology grade water (HyClone) for 30 s, and dried with an N2 gas stream. The functionalized area was then exposed with 100:1 mixture of 5-kDa, methoxy-terminated, N-succinimidyl polyethylene glycol (Fluka; 33% w/w PEG in molecular biology grade water) and 5-kDa biotin-terminated PEG (NOF Corporation, 2.5% w/w in molecular biology grade water) in sodium bicarbonate (1% v/v, pH 8.0) buffer for ∼3 h. A sample chamber was assembled by placing a custom hybriwell chamber (Grace Bio-labs) with the help of two silicon ports (press fit tubing connectors; Grace Bio-labs) on top of the biotin-PEG glass slide (33.Karam P. Ngo A.T. Rouiller I. Cosa G. Unraveling electronic energy transfer in single conjugated polyelectrolytes encapsulated in lipid vesicles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17480-17485Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The silicon ports provided the inlet and outlet for the flow system. The biotin-PEG chamber was filled with 40 μl of 20% w/w streptavidin (Invitrogen) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated in the dark for 10 min. The streptavidin acts as linker between the biotin-PEG slide and the biotin-conjugated anti-histidine antibody bound to GluA2 subunit. A PBS solution containing ∼250 nm protein tagged with biotin-conjugated anti-histidine monoclonal antibody was then added in ten 17-μl increments into the chamber and incubated for 20 min. The excess protein was then rinsed with PBS buffer. To minimize the photobleaching and blinking of fluorophores, all of the experiments were performed in the presence of an oxygen scavenger system, consisting of 33% w/w β-d-(+)-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% w/w glucose oxidase, 0.1% v/v catalase (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mm methyl viologen (Sigma Aldrich), and 1 mm ascorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich) in molecular biology grade water saturated with phosphate buffer (34.Vogelsang J. Doose S. Sauer M. Tinnefeld P. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer in nanopipets. Improving distance resolution and concentration range.Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 7367-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, 1 mm of the substituted willardiine was also added to the oxygen scavenging system, depending on the experimental conditions. All single-molecule fluorescence measurements were performed using a custom built confocal microscope (35.Darugar Q. Kim H. Gorelick R.J. Landes C. Human T-cell lympotropic virus type 1 nucleocapsid protein-induced structural changes in transactivation response DNA measured by single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 12164-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36.Taylor J.N. Darugar Q. Kourentzi K. Willson R.C. Landes C.F. Dynamics of an anti-VEGF aptamer. A single molecule study.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A 532-nm diode-pumped solid state laser (Coherent, Compass 315M-100 SL) was used for sample excitation. The light was expanded to overfill the back aperture of a Fluar 100× 1.3 NA oil immersion microscope objective lens (Carl Zeiss), which resulted in the expansion of the laser light in a 1/e2 beam radius of ∼ 250 nm and height of ∼ 1 μm, respectively. The sample chamber with the flow system for oxygen scavenger was placed on top of a closed-loop x-y-z piezo stage (P-517.3CL; Physik Instrumente) with 100 × 100 × 20-μm travel range and 1-nm specificity (SPM 1000; RHK Technology, Maryville, TN). The power of the laser was controlled as necessary using neutral density filters. Fluorescence was collected and refocused by the same objective and was separated from the excited light by using a dichroic mirror (z532rdc; Chroma Technology). Fluorescence was collected and refocused by the same objective and the excited light was filtered via a notch filter (zet532nf, Chroma Technology). The refocused signal was further passed though a dichroic mirror (640dcxr, Chroma Technology) to split donor emission and acceptor emission by wavelength, and these fluorescence signals were collected by two avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR-15; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The signal to noise ratio was improved by the use of additional emission filters (NHPF-532.0, Kaiser Optical; and ET585, Chroma Technology) placed in front of the photodiode detectors. To obtain the smFRET trajectories for the individual protein molecules, a 10 × 10-μm area of the sample was scanned to spatially locate 20–25 molecules. The fluorescence signals of the donor and the acceptor were collected until the fluorophores were photobleached. The emission intensity trajectories were collected at 1-ms resolution and later binned up to 10-ms time steps to improve the signal to noise ratio. All of the data were analyzed with programs written in-house using MATLAB (R2009b; Mathworks). The corrected fluorescence signal trajectories were used directly to calculate the apparent FRET efficiency (EA) using the following equation, EA=IAIA+ID(Eq. 1) where IA and ID correspond to background corrected acceptor and donor fluorescence intensities, respectively. The distance between the two fluorophores was calculated with the following equation, E=(1+(RR0)6)−1(Eq. 2) where: r = is the inter-dye distance, and R0 = is the Förster radius, which, for the Alexa 555-Alexa 647 pair, is ∼5.1 nm (Molecular Probes). All the raw trajectories were analyzed by the above mentioned processing algorithm, and traces were automatically characterized into single step bleaching, multistep bleaching and high acceptor background. Traces were excluded if they met with the conditions of multistep bleaching and higher acceptor background. Details of the wavelet denoising technique have been described previously (30.Landes C.F. Rambhadran A. Taylor J.N. Salatan F. Jayaraman V. Structural landscape of isolated agonist-binding domains from single AMPA receptors.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37.Taylor J.N. Makarov D.E. Landes C.F. Denoising single-molecule FRET trajectories with wavelets and Bayesian inference.Biophys.

Phys. Chem. B. 2011; 115: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For experiments requiring multiple solution conditions on the same proteins, a secondary method of data collection and analysis was used. Single-molecule samples were prepared as described above along with two buffer solutions following the stated procedure for oxygen scavenging solutions and using glutamate (1 mm) and iodowillardiine (1 mm) as agonists. A dual syringe pump system initially delivered glutamate containing buffer with a flow rate of 0.001 ml/min followed by both the glutamate and iodowillardiine buffers and then finally iodowillardiine alone. A 30 × 30-μm area was repeatedly raster scanned using the same confocal setup as above, with a 30-s repetition rate between images. The images were analyzed using a custom-designed program that locates and tracks single molecules to correct for possible stage drift. Molecules were selected from the final frame of the acceptor channel images to avoid skewing of intensities by photobleaching and to ensure FRET occurred in all molecules during the imaging period. The GluA2-flip plasmid was donated by Dr. Seeburg (Max Planck Institute, Heidelberg, Germany). Endogenous accessible cysteine residues were removed, and the T394C and S652C mutations were introduced into wild type GluA2 as described above. This construct was co-transfected with enhanced GFP into human embryonic kidney 293 tSA201 (HEK 293) cells (ATCC CRL 11268) using the calcium phosphate technique with 1–2 μg of GluA2/ml for 10–12 h. Electrophysiological experiments were performed 48–72 h later. Alexa 555 (100 nm) was added to the recording dish 10–20 min prior to recording. Whole cell recordings were obtained using thick walled borosilicate pipettes with resistances of 2–4 MΩ and filled with solution containing 135 mm CsF, 33 mm CsOH, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The extracellular bath solution consisted of (in mm) 150 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). All of the ligand solutions were prepared in extracellular buffer and kept at pH 7.4. Cyclothiazide at a concentration of 100 μm was used for all experiments. Cells expressing mutant GluA2 were voltage-clamped at −60 mV, and solutions were locally applied using computer controlled valve switcher (VC-6; Warner Instruments) and homemade application pipette. All of the recordings were performed using an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), with data acquired at 10 kHz, low pass filtered at 3 kHz (8-pole Bessel, −3 dB) and under the control of pCLAMP 10.1 software (Molecular Devices). Two-tailed repeated measures t test was performed for statistical analysis of differences in the responses evoked by the different ligands. Whole cell currents were obtained using saturating concentrations of glutamate (10 mm) and chlorowillardiine (1 mm), nitrowillardiine (1 mm), iodowillardiine (1 mm), and (2 mm) UBP-282, on GluA2-flip receptors under nondesensitizing conditions in the presence of 100 μm cyclothiazide. To compare our results directly with the smFRET experiments, agonist-evoked responses were recorded from the same agonist-binding domain mutations, i.e., T394C/S652C GluA2. The currents evoked by the willardiines were normalized to 10 mm glutamate responses and are shown in Fig. 1. The data shown in the bar graph are consistent with the numerous previous more detailed investigations and show that the willardiines are partial agonists with iodowillardiine have a lower response relative to chloro- and nitro-willardiines (31.Fenwick M.K.

Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A two-tailed repeated measures t test was performed for statistical analysis of differences in the measured currents, and a p value of ≤0.05 was considered significant in our experiments. The p values for chlorowillardiine, nitrowillardiine, and iodowillardiine were calculated to be less than 0.0005, 0.0025, and 0.0005, respectively, in comparison with mean currents with glutamate. As expected, the antagonist UBP-282 produced no response beyond the base-line noise. These willardiines, along with glutamate, thus provide a spectrum of ligands that allow us to draw correlations between the smFRET-based states and receptor activation. A representative smFRET trace of a single GluA2 subunit agonist-binding domain tagged with donor and acceptor fluorophores is shown in Fig. 2. The sites tagged with the donor and acceptor fluorophores are T394C and S652C, similar to those used in our previous smFRET investigations (30.Landes C.F. Rambhadran A. Taylor J.N. Salatan F. Jayaraman V. Structural landscape of isolated agonist-binding domains from single AMPA receptors.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The smFRET data from a number of such traces (170–210 traces) for each willardiine were then processed for background and cross-talk correction (35.Darugar Q. Kim H. Gorelick R.J. Landes C.

https://openalex.org/W2032057318,"Liver metastasis is a major cause of mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). However, mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted phosphorylated glycoprotein that is involved in tumor migration and metastasis. The role of OPN in cancer is currently unclear. In this study, OPN mRNA was examined in tissues from CRC, adjacent normal mucosa, and liver metastatic lesions using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The protein expression of OPN and its receptors (integrin αv and CD44 v6) was detected by using an immunohistochemical (IHC) method. The role of OPN in liver metastasis was studied in established colon cancer Colo-205 and SW-480 cell lines transfected with sense- or antisense-OPN eukaryotic expression plasmids by flow cytometry and cell adhesion assay. Florescence redistribution after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study gap functional intercellular communication (GJIC) among OPN-transfected cells. It was found that OPN was highly expressed in metastatic hepatic lesions from CRC compared to primary CRC tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. The expression of OPN mRNA in tumor tissues was significantly related with the CRC stages. OPN expression was also detected in normal hepatocytes surrounding CRC metastatic lesions. Two known receptors of OPN, integrin αv and CD44v6 proteins, were strongly expressed in hepatocytes from normal liver. CRC cells with forced OPN expression exhibited increased heterotypic adhesion with endothelial cells and weakened intercellular communication. OPN plays a significant role in CRC metastasis to liver through interaction with its receptors in hepatocytes, decreased homotypic adhesion, and enhanced heterotypic adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2109223668,"Advancement in plant research is becoming impaired by the fact that the transfer of multiple genes is difficult to achieve. Here we present a new binary vector for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation, pHUGE-Red, in concert with a cloning strategy suited for the transfer of up to nine genes at once. This vector enables modular cloning of large DNA fragments by employing Gateway technology and contains DsRED1 as visual selection marker. Furthermore, an R/Rs inducible recombination system was included allowing subsequent removal of the selection markers in the newly generated transgenic plants. We show the successful use of pHUGE-Red by transferring eight genes essential for Medicago truncatula to establish a symbiosis with rhizobia bacteria as one 74 kb T-DNA into four non-leguminous species; strawberry, poplar, tomato and tobacco. We provide evidence that all transgenes are expressed in the root tissue of the non-legumes. Visual control during the transformation process and subsequent marker gene removal makes the pHUGE-Red vector an excellent tool for the efficient transfer of multiple genes."

MUNC13-4 was also essential for the regulation of intracellular ROS production induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa despite normal trafficking of p22phox-expressing vesicles toward the phagosome. Importantly, in the absence of MUNC13-4, phagosomal maturation was impaired as observed by the defective delivery of azurophilic granules and multivesicular bodies to the phagosome. Significantly, this mechanism was intact in RAB27A KO neutrophils. Intracellular bacterial killing was markedly impaired in MUNC13-4 KO neutrophils.

The efficiency of pathogen killing by neutrophils through degranulation, phagocytosis, and NETs relies on the timely activation of neutrophil granular proteins (2.Lee W.L. Harrison R.E. Grinstein S.

Granular secretory proteins are held in diverse neutrophil secretory organelles (5.Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Granules of the human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte.Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature neutrophils contain four types of storage organelles: azurophilic granules, specific granules, gelatinase granules, and secretory vesicles (5.Borregaard N. Cowland J.B. Granules of the human neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocyte.Blood. 1997; 89: 3503-3521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They also contain multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (6.Cieutat A.M. Lobel P. August J.T. Kjeldsen L. Sengeløv H. Borregaard N. Bainton D.F. Azurophilic granules of human neutrophilic leukocytes are deficient in lysosome-associated membrane proteins but retain the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker.Blood. 1998; 91: 1044-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are formed by the endocytic pathway and are both exocytosable and able to fuse with the phagosome (7.Dahlgren C. Carlsson S.R. Karlsson A. Lundqvist H. Sjölin C. The lysosomal membrane glycoproteins Lamp-1 and Lamp-2 are present in mobilizable organelles, but are absent from the azurophil granules of human neutrophils.Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sequential mobilization of neutrophil organelles and the release of their cargoes into the extracellular milieu or into the intraphagosomal space are necessary events to mediate extracellular or intracellular killing, respectively. The release of granular proteins is also significant for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (4.Papayannopoulos V. Metzler K.D. Hakkim A. Zychlinsky A. Neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase regulate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Importantly, defects in granular proteins are associated with immunodeficiencies in mice and humans. For example, deficiencies in the azurophilic granule protein elastase, a strong antibacterial serine protease, or myeloperoxidase (MPO), the enzyme responsible for the formation of antibacterial oxidized halides, are associated with susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections (8.Tkalcevic J. Novelli M. Phylactides M. Iredale J.P. Segal A.W. Roes J.

Consequences of total and subtotal myeloperoxidase deficiency: risk or benefit ?.Acta Haematol. 2000; 104: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The bactericidal activity of neutrophils is also mediated by their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In neutrophils, ROS production relies on the NADPH oxidase, a multisubunit enzymatic complex that is responsible for the monoelectronic reduction of oxygen to produce superoxide anion (O2̇̄) (11.Babior B.M. The respiratory burst oxidase and the molecular basis of chronic granulomatous disease.Am. J. Hematol. 1991; 37: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The production of O2̇̄ is directly associated with the microbicidal capacity of these cells because patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), whose NADPH oxidase is inactive, suffer recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (12.Babior B.M. Woodman R.C. Chronic granulomatous disease.Semin. Hematol. 1990; 27: 247-259PubMed Google Scholar). The neutrophil NADPH oxidase complex is composed of the cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox; the membrane-associated flavocytochrome b558 (formed by the subunits gp91phox and p22phox); and the accessory proteins Rac2 (13.Knaus U.G.

In unstimulated neutrophils, the oxidase is dissociated and inactive. In response to appropriate stimuli, the flavocytochrome b558 assembles with the cytosolic factors, generating a functional complex (14.Babior B.M. NADPH oxidase.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Most subunits of the flavocytochrome b558 are associated with the membranes of intracellular specific and gelatinase granules, and only a small proportion is also present at the plasma membrane (17.Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. Subcellular localization of the b-cytochrome component of the human neutrophil microbicidal oxidase: translocation during activation.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Many soluble stimuli including the bacterially derived chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) (18.Uriarte S.M. Rane M.J. Luerman G.C. Barati M.T. Ward R.A. Nauseef W.M. McLeish K.R. Granule exocytosis contributes to priming and activation of the human neutrophil respiratory burst.J.

Priming of the neutrophil respiratory burst involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent exocytosis of flavocytochrome b558-containing granules.J. Biol.

In addition, during phagocytosis, flavocytochrome b558-containing granules fuse with the phagosome, and the oxidase is assembled at phagosomal membranes (20.Jankowski A. Scott C.C. Grinstein S.

Equally important, azurophilic granules and multivesicular bodies are able to fuse with the phagosomal membrane in a sequential manner in a process referred to as phagosome maturation (23.Tse S.M. Furuya W. Gold E. Schreiber A.D. Sandvig K. Inman R.D. Grinstein S. Differential role of actin, clathrin, and dynamin in Fcγ receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis.J. Biol.

LAMP proteins are required for fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Thus, myeloperoxidase and serine proteases are released from azurophilic granules into the phagosome to mediate the formation of antibacterial HOCl at the expense of H2O2 and to degrade bacterial materials, respectively. Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), which in neutrophils localizes at MVBs (6.Cieutat A.M. Lobel P. August J.T. Kjeldsen L. Sengeløv H. Borregaard N. Bainton D.F. Azurophilic granules of human neutrophilic leukocytes are deficient in lysosome-associated membrane proteins but retain the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker.Blood. 1998; 91: 1044-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is also considered an important factor for efficient phagosomal maturation (24.Huynh K.K. Eskelinen E.L. Scott C.C. Malevanets A. Saftig P. Grinstein S. LAMP proteins are required for fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). From this, it is clear that granule trafficking and fusion are essential for the neutrophil innate immune response, but the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes are not fully characterized. The small GTPase RAB27A is a master organizer of vesicular trafficking and, together with its specific effectors, controls exocytosis in hematopoietic cells (25.Tolmachova T. Anders R. Stinchcombe J.

In neutrophils, RAB27A controls azurophilic granule exocytosis and regulates the activation of the NADPH oxidase at the plasma membrane (26.Munafó D.B. Johnson J.L. Ellis B.A. Rutschmann S.

Importantly, defects in the rab27a or the unc13-4 genes are associated with immunodeficiencies in humans (31.Wood S.M. Meeths M. Chiang S.C. Bechensteen A.G. Boelens J.J. Heilmann C. Horiuchi H.

For instance, RAB27A deficiency causes Griscelli syndrome type 2, an immunodeficiency with partial albinism (32.Ménasché G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Mutations in RAB27A cause Griscelli syndrome associated with haemophagocytic syndrome.Nat.

Both RAB27A and MUNC13-4 deficiencies are associated with malfunction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and neutrophils, and patients with Griscelli syndrome type 2 and FHL3 suffer an accelerated phase (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic syndrome) initiated by recurrent and often fatal viral and bacterial infections (34.Mahlaoui N.

Possible roles for MUNC13-4 in the control of the secretion of other neutrophil granules, ROS production, phagocytosis maturation, or NET formation have not been explored. In this work, using neutrophils from MUNC13-4-deficient mice, we show that MUNC13-4 plays a previously unrecognized fundamental role in the regulation of neutrophil phagosome maturation and ROS production. Our experiments utilized C57BL/6 munc13-4jinx/jinx mice (here referred to as munc13-4 KO mice) (35.Crozat K. Hoebe K. Ugolini S. Hong N.A. Janssen E. Rutschmann S. Mudd S. Sovath S. Vivier E.

The munc13-4 KO mice were maintained as a homozygous stock for use in these studies. rab27aash/ash (RAB27A KO) mice that contain a splicing mutation in the rab27a gene have been extensively utilized for the study of RAB27A deficiency and were described previously (36.Wilson S.M.

All animal studies were performed in compliance with the United States Department of Health and Human Services Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All studies were conducted according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines and with approval of the animal review board at The Scripps Research Institute. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils were isolated using a Percoll gradient fractionation system as described (39.Johnson J.L. Monfregola J. Napolitano G. Kiosses W.B. Catz S.D.

Neutrophils were isolated from the 62 to 78% interface, washed, and used in all our assays. Human neutrophils were isolated from normal donor's blood by Ficoll density centrifugation as described previously (40.Markert M. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M.

For the detection of extracellular ROS, 3 × 105 neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of isoluminol and horseradish peroxidase (6.58 units/ml). Neutrophils were stimulated with fMLP (10 μm), and chemiluminescence was continuously monitored for up to 20 min at 37 °C using an EG&G Berthold microplate luminometer. Where indicated, neutrophils were preincubated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 30 min before fMLP stimulation. For the analysis of intracellular ROS production, neutrophils were stimulated with serum-opsonized Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAK kindly contributed by Dr. S. Lory at Harvard University. Bacteria were utilized at a ratio of 1:10 (neutrophils/bacteria). In other experiments, neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1 μg/ml), and luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was continuously monitored for 20 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, the cells were incubated in the presence of superoxide dismutase (300 units/ml) or cytochalasin D (10 μg/ml) for 10 min before stimulation. Wild type and MUNC13-4 KO murine neutrophils were seeded in 8-well plates with bottom coverglass (number 1.5 borosilicate coverglass, Lab-Tek, Nunc). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.02% saponin, and blocked with a solution of 2% BSA in PBS. The samples were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 0.02% saponin and blocking agents and subsequently labeled using Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The cells were stored in unsolidified water-based mounting medium (refractive index, 1.37) or PBS until analyzed. TIRF microscopy experiments were performed using a 100× 1.45 numerical aperture TIRF objective (Nikon) on a Nikon TE2000U microscope custom modified with a TIRF illumination module as described (30.Johnson J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2044799774,"Central to the power-stroke and brownian-ratchet mechanisms of protein translocation is the process through which nonequilibrium fluctuations are rectified or ratcheted by the molecular motor to transport substrate proteins along a specific axis. We investigated the ratchet mechanism using anthrax toxin as a model. Anthrax toxin is a tripartite toxin comprised of the protective antigen (PA) component, a homooligomeric transmembrane translocase, which translocates two other enzyme components, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), into the cytosol of the host cell under the proton motive force (PMF). The PA-binding domains of LF and EF (LF(N) and EF(N)) possess identical folds and similar solution stabilities; however, EF(N) translocates ∼10-200-fold slower than LF(N), depending on the electrical potential (Δψ) and chemical potential (ΔpH) compositions of the PMF. From an analysis of LF(N)/EF(N) chimera proteins, we identified two 10-residue cassettes comprised of charged sequence that were responsible for the impaired translocation kinetics of EF(N). These cassettes have nonspecific electrostatic requirements: one surprisingly prefers acidic residues when driven by either a Δψ or a ΔpH; the second requires basic residues only when driven by a Δψ. Through modeling and experiment, we identified a charged surface in the PA channel responsible for charge selectivity. The charged surface latches the substrate and promotes PMF-driven transport. We propose an electrostatic ratchet in the channel, comprised of opposing rings of charged residues, enforces directionality by interacting with charged cassettes in the substrate, thereby generating forces sufficient to drive unfolding."
https://openalex.org/W1999410533,"The X-linked Mecp2 is a known interpreter of epigenetic information and mutated in Rett syndrome, a complex neurological disease. MeCP2 recruits HDAC complexes to chromatin thereby modulating gene expression and, importantly regulates higher order heterochromatin structure. To address the effects of MeCP2 deficiency on heterochromatin organization during neural differentiation, we developed a versatile model for stem cell in vitro differentiation. Therefore, we modified murine Mecp2 deficient (Mecp2−/y) embryonic stem cells to generate cells exhibiting green fluorescent protein expression upon neural differentiation. Subsequently, we quantitatively analyzed heterochromatin organization during neural differentiation in wild type and in Mecp2 deficient cells. We found that MeCP2 protein levels increase significantly during neural differentiation and accumulate at constitutive heterochromatin. Statistical analysis of Mecp2 wild type neurons revealed a significant clustering of heterochromatin per nuclei with progressing differentiation. In contrast we found Mecp2 deficient neurons and astroglia cells to be significantly impaired in heterochromatin reorganization. Our results (i) introduce a new and manageable cellular model to study the molecular effects of Mecp2 deficiency, and (ii) support the view of MeCP2 as a central protein in heterochromatin architecture in maturating cells, possibly involved in stabilizing their differentiated state."
https://openalex.org/W1972533724,"In the present study, we have isolated leucocytes from peripheral blood, head kidney and spleen from lumpsucker (Cyclopterus lumpus L.), and performed functional studies like phagocytosis and respiratory burst, as well as morphological and cytochemical analyses. Different leucocytes were identified, such as lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells with bean shaped or bilobed nuclei. In addition, cells with similar morphology as described for dendritic cells in trout were abundant among the isolated leucocytes. Flow cytometry was successfully used for measuring phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity. The phagocytic capacity and ability were very high, and cells with different morphology in all three leucocyte preparations phagocytised beads rapidly. Due to lack of available cell markers, the identity of the phagocytic cells could not be determined. The potent non-specific phagocytosis was in accordance with a high number of cells positive for myeloperoxidase, an enzyme involved in oxygen-dependent killing mechanism present in phagocytic cells. Further, high respiratory burst activity was present in the leucocytes samples, verifying a potent oxygen- dependent degradation. At present, the specific antibody immune response could not be measured, as immunoglobulin or B-cells have not yet been isolated. Therefore, analyses of the specific immune response in this fish species await further clarification. The present study presents the first analyses of lumpsucker immunity and also the first within the order Scopaeniformes."
https://openalex.org/W2022084339,"Background The Eastern hive honey bee, Apis cerana cerana is a native and widely bred honey bee species in China. Molecular biology research about this honey bee species is scarce, and genomic information for A. c. cerana is not currently available. Transcriptome and expression profiling data for this species are therefore important resources needed to better understand the biological mechanisms of A. c. cerana. In this study, we obtained the transcriptome information of A. c. cerana by RNA-sequencing and compared gene expression differences between queens and workers of A. c. cerana by digital gene expression (DGE) analysis. Results Using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing we obtained 51,581,510 clean reads corresponding to 4.64 Gb total nucleotides from a single run. These reads were assembled into 46,999 unigenes with a mean length of 676 bp. Based on a sequence similarity search against the five public databases (NR, Swissport, GO, COG, KEGG) with a cut-off E-value of 10−5 using BLASTX, a total of 24,630 unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology terms, or metabolic pathways. Using these transcriptome data as references we analyzed the gene expression differences between the queens and workers of A. c. cerana using a tag-based digital gene expression method. We obtained 5.96 and 5.66 million clean tags from the queen and worker samples, respectively. A total of 414 genes were differentially expressed between them, with 189 up-regulated and 225 down-regulated in queens. Conclusions Our transcriptome data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for future A. c. cerana study, establishing an important public information platform for functional genomic studies in A. c. cerana. Furthermore, the DGE data provide comprehensive gene expression information for the queens and workers, which will facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the different physiological aspects of the two castes."
https://openalex.org/W2039216637,"DNA demethylation is used to establish and maintain an unmethylated state. The molecular mechanisms to induce DNA demethylation at a particular genomic locus remain unclear. The mouse H19/insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) imprinted control region (ICR) is a methylation state-sensitive insulator that regulates transcriptional activation of both genes. The unmethylated state of the ICR established in female germ cells is maintained during development, resisting the wave of genome-wide de novo methylation. We previously demonstrated that a DNA fragment (fragment b) derived from this ICR-induced DNA demethylation when it was transfected into undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, two octamer motifs within fragment b were necessary to induce this DNA demethylation. Here, we demonstrated that both octamer motifs and their flanking sequences constitute Sox-Oct motifs (SO1 and SO2) and that the SO1 region, which requires at least four additional elements, including the SO2 region, contributes significantly to the induction of high-frequency DNA demethylation as a Sox-Oct motif. Moreover, RNAi-mediated inhibition of Oct3/4 expression in P19 cells resulted in a reduced DNA demethylation frequency of fragment b but not of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene CpG island. The Sox motif of SO1 could function as a sensor for a hypermethylated state of the ICR to repress demethylation activity. These results indicate that Sox-Oct motifs in the ICR determine the cell type, DNA region, and allele specificity of DNA demethylation.

https://openalex.org/W2093068814,"A continuous monitoring of the whole tumor burden of individuals in orthotopic tumor models is a desirable aim and requires non-invasive imaging methods. Here we investigated whether quantification of a xenograft tumor intrinsic fluorescence signal can be used to evaluate tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. Stably fluorescence protein (FP) expressing cell clones of colorectal carcinoma and germ cell tumor lines were generated by lentiviral transduction using the FPs eGFP, dsRed2, TurboFP635, and mPlum. Applying subcutaneous tumor models in different experimental designs, specific correlations between measured total fluorescence intensity (FI) and the tumor volume (V) could be established. The accuracy of correlation of FI and V varied depending on the cell model used. The application of deep-red FP expressing xenografts (TurboFP635, mPlum) was observed to result in improved correlations. This was also reflected by the results of a performed error analysis. In a model of visceral growing mPlum tumors, measurements of FI could be used to follow growth and response to chemotherapy. However, in some cases final necropsy revealed the existence of additional, deeper located tumors that had not been detected in vivo by their mPlum signal. Consistently, only the weights of the tumors that were detected in vivo based on their mPlum signal correlated with FI. In conclusion, as long as tumors are visualized by their fluorescence signal the FI can be used to evaluate tumor burden. Deep-red FPs are more suitable for in vivo applications as compared to eGFP and dsRed2."
https://openalex.org/W2070096395,"NF-κB is a pleiotrophic transcription factor that plays a prominent regulatory role in various cellular processes. Although previous efforts have focused on its activation, how NF-κB selects specific target genes in response to discrete signals remains puzzling. In addition to the well defined Rel protein components of NF-κB, the ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) was identified to be an essential component of specific NF-κB complexes. RPS3 synergistically interacts with the NF-κB p65 subunit to achieve optimal binding and transactivation of a subset of NF-κB target genes, thus providing regulatory specificity. Emerging evidence suggests an important role for the RPS3-p65 interaction in context-specific NF-κB gene transcription. The food-borne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 impacts the transcription of a subset of NF-κB target genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in host cells by preventing the nuclear translocation of RPS3, but not p65. The N terminus of p65 is crucial for RPS3 binding. Although several p65 N-terminal fragments are generated by either protease cleavage or alternative mRNA splicing under certain pathophysiological conditions, the role of these fragments in modulating NF-κB signaling, in particular RPS3-dependent selective gene transcription, has not been fully characterized. Here we report that an N-terminal fragment of p65 (amino acids 21-186) can selectively modulate NF-κB gene transcription by competing for RPS3 binding to p65. This 21-186 fragment preferentially localizes in the cytoplasm where it delays stimuli-induced RPS3 nuclear translocation, without affecting the nuclear translocation of p65. Our findings thus uncover a new cytoplasmic function for the N-terminal domain of p65 and provide a novel strategy for selective inhibition of NF-κB gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2139582806,"Archer fish knock down insects anchored to vegetation by hitting them with a precisely aimed jet of water. The striking force of the jet at the impact is such to overcome the strong anchoring forces of insects. The origin of the effectiveness of such hunting mechanism has been long searched for inside of the fish, in the unsuccessful attempt to identify internal structures dedicated to the amplification of muscular power. Here we perform a kinematic analysis of the jet emitted by two specimens of Toxotes jaculatrix. We estimate that at the impact the jet conveys a typical specific power of about 3000 W/kg, which is well above the maximum specific power of the order of 500 W/kg deliverable by a vertebrate muscle. Unexpectedly, we find that the amplification of muscular power occurs outside of the fish, and is due to a hydrodynamic instability of the jet akin to those occurring in Drop-on-Demand inkjet printing. The investigated fish are found to modulate the velocity of the jet at the orifice to favor the formation of a single, large, water drop that hits the prey abruptly with a large momentum. The observed mechanism represents a remarkable example of use of an external hydrodynamic lever that does possibly not entail the high evolutionary cost needed for the development of highly specialized internal structures dedicated to the storing of mechanical energy."
https://openalex.org/W2058953436,"A simple movement, such as pressing a button, can acquire different meanings by producing different consequences, such as starting an elevator or switching a TV channel. We evaluated whether the brain activity preceding a simple action is modulated by the expected consequences of the action itself. To further this aim, the motor-related cortical potentials were compared during two key-press actions that were identical from the kinematics point of view but different in both meaning and consequences. In one case (virtual grasp), the key-press started a video clip showing a hand moving toward a cup and grasping it; in the other case, the key-press did not produce any consequence (key-press). A third condition (real grasp) was also compared, in which subjects actually grasped the cup, producing the same action presented in the video clip. Data were collected from fifteen subjects. The results showed that motor preparation for virtual grasp (starting 3 s before the movement onset) was different from that of the key-press and similar to the real grasp preparation–as if subjects had to grasp the cup in person. In particular, both virtual and real grasp presented a posterior parietal negativity preceding activity in motor and pre-motor areas. In summary, this finding supports the hypothesis that motor preparation is affected by the meaning of the action, even when the action is only virtual."
https://openalex.org/W2063594726,"Most proteins have not evolved for maximal thermal stability. Some are only marginally stable, as for example, the DNA-binding domains of p53 and its homologs, whose kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities are strongly correlated. Here, we applied high-throughput methods using a real-time PCR thermocycler to study the stability of several full-length orthologs and paralogs of the p53 family of transcription factors, which have diverse functions, ranging from tumour suppression to control of developmental processes. From isothermal denaturation fluorimetry and differential scanning fluorimetry, we found that full-length proteins showed the same correlation between kinetic and thermodynamic stability as their isolated DNA-binding domains. The stabilities of the full-length p53 orthologs were marginal and correlated with the temperature of their organism, paralleling the stability of the isolated DNA-binding domains. Additionally, the paralogs p63 and p73 were significantly more stable and long-lived than p53. The short half-life of p53 orthologs and the greater persistence of the paralogs may be biologically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W1983449452,"Cyclin A1 is a male germ cell-specific cell cycle regulator that is essential for spermatogenesis. It is unique among the cyclins by virtue of its highly restricted expression in vivo, being present in pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes and not in earlier or later stages of spermatogenesis. To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this narrow window of expression of the mouse cyclin A1 (Ccna1) gene, we carried out a detailed analysis of its promoter. We defined a 170-bp region within the promoter and showed that it is involved in repression of Ccna1 in cultured cells. Within this region we identified known cis-acting transcription factor binding sequences, including an Sp1-binding site and two GATA1-binding sites. Neither Sp1 nor GATA1 is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and later stages of germ cell differentiation. Sp1 is readily detected at earlier stages of spermatogenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that neither factor alone was sufficient to significantly repress expression driven by the Ccna1 promoter, while concurrent binding of Sp1, and most likely GATA1 and possibly additional factors was inhibitory. Occupancy of Sp1 on the Ccna1 promoter and influence of GATA1-dependent cis-acting elements was confirmed by ChIP analysis in cell lines and most importantly, in spermatogonia. In contrast with many other testis-specific genes, the CpG island methylation status of the Ccna1 promoter was similar among various tissues examined, irrespective of whether Ccna1 was transcriptionally active, suggesting that this regulatory mechanism is not involved in the restricted expression of Ccna1."
https://openalex.org/W2018476645,"To search for new targets of anticancer therapies using phytoestrogens we performed comparative metabolic profiling of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF-12A. Application of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed significant differences in the metabolic levels after exposure with 17ß-estradiol, genistein or a composition of phytoestrogens within a native root flax extract. We observed the metabolites 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-lactic acid, cis-aconitic acid, 11-beta-hydroxy-progesterone, chenodeoxycholic acid and triacontanoic acid with elevated levels due to estrogen action. Particularly highlighted were metabolites of the sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingosine and its dihydro derivate as well as ethanolaminephosphate were significantly altered after exposure with 1 nM 17ß-estradiol in the cell line MCF-7, while MCF-12A was not affected. Treatment with genistein and the flax extract normalized the sphingosine concentrations to the basic levels found in MCF-12A cells. We could further demonstrate that the expression levels of the sphingosine metabolizing enzymes: sphingosine-1-phosphate kinase (Sphk) and lyase (S1P lyase) were significantly influenced by estrogens as well as phytoestrogens. The isoform Sphk2 was overexpressed in the tumorigenic cell line MCF-7, while S1P lyase was predominantly expressed in the non-tumorigenic cell line MCF-12A. Importantly, in MCF-7 the weak S1P lyase expression could be significantly increased after exposure with 10 µM genistein and 1 µg/ml root flax extract. Here, we present, for the first time, an analysis of metabolic response of phytoestrogens to breast cancer cell lines. The contrasting regulation of sphingolipid enzymes in MCF-7 and MCF-12A render them as preferred targets for future anticancer strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2107363261,"The Simple View of Reading (SVR) in Chinese was examined in a genetically sensitive design. A total of 270 pairs of Chinese twins (190 pairs of monozygotic twins and 80 pairs of same-sex dizygotic twins) were tested on Chinese vocabulary and word reading at the mean age 7.8 years and reading comprehension of sentences and passages one year later. Results of behavior-genetic analyses showed that both vocabulary and word reading had significant independent genetic influences on reading comprehension, and the two factors together accounted for most but not all of the genetic influences on reading comprehension. In addition, sentence comprehension had a stronger genetic correlation with word reading while passage comprehension showed a trend of stronger genetic overlap with vocabulary. These findings suggest that the genetic foundation of the SVR in Chinese is largely supported in that language comprehension and decoding are two core skills for reading comprehension in nonalphabetic as well as alphabetic written languages."
https://openalex.org/W2009228170,"Deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plasma membrane chloride channel is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). Though several maneuvers can rescue endoplasmic reticulum-retained ΔF508CFTR and promote its trafficking to the plasma membrane, rescued ΔF508CFTR remains susceptible to quality control mechanisms that lead to accelerated endocytosis, ubiquitination, and lysosomal degradation. To investigate the role of scaffold protein interactions in rescued ΔF508CFTR surface instability, the plasma membrane mobility of ΔF508CFTR was measured in live cells by quantum dot single particle tracking. Following rescue by low temperature, chemical correctors, thapsigargin, or overexpression of GRASP55, ΔF508CFTR diffusion was more rapid than that of wild-type CFTR because of reduced interactions with PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins. Knock-down of the plasma membrane quality control proteins CHIP and Hsc70 partially restored ΔF508CFTR-scaffold association. Quantitative comparisons of CFTR cell surface diffusion and endocytosis kinetics suggested an association between reduced scaffold binding and CFTR internalization. Our surface diffusion measurements in live cells indicate defective scaffold interactions of rescued ΔF508CFTR at the cell surface, which may contribute to its defective peripheral processing."

In previous studies, using ATP as the cosubstrate, it was reported that the APH(2″)-Ia domain of this enzyme is unique among aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, having the ability to inactivate an unusually broad spectrum of aminoglycosides, including 4,6- and 4,5-disubstituted and atypical. We recently demonstrated that GTP, and not ATP, is the preferred cosubstrate of this enzyme. We now show, using competition assays between ATP and GTP, that GTP is the exclusive phosphate donor at intracellular nucleotide levels. In light of these findings, we reevaluated the substrate profile of the phosphotransferase domain of this clinically important enzyme. Steady-state kinetic characterization using the phosphate donor GTP demonstrates that AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia phosphorylates 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides with high efficiency (kcat/Km = 105-107 m−1 s−1). Despite this proficiency, no resistance is conferred to some of these antibiotics by the enzyme in vivo. We now show that phosphorylation of 4,5-disubstituted and atypical aminoglycosides are negligible and thus these antibiotics are not substrates.

Based on their structure, they are broadly classified into three major classes: 4,6-disubstituted, 4,5-disubstituted, and atypical (Fig. 1). The most important mechanism of bacterial resistance to this class of antibiotics is enzymatic modification, which greatly diminishes the affinity of aminoglycosides for the bacterial 30 S ribosomal subunit, their target in vivo (2.Llano-Sotelo B.

In light of the substantial differences in the reported substrate specificities of APH(2″)-Ia and the remaining members of the APH(2″) subfamily of aminoglycoside kinases and the discovery that GTP, and not ATP, is the preferred cosubstrate for APH(2″)-Ia, we sought to reevaluate the nucleotide and aminoglycoside substrate profiles of the clinically important AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia enzyme. Amikacin was purchased from the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (Rockville, MD). Arbekacin, dibekacin, and kanamycin B were obtained from Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Neamine was a gift from S. Mobashery (University of Notre Dame). Kanamycin A, gentamicin C, sisomicin, tobramycin, butirosin A and B, lividomycin A, paromomycin, and neomycin B were bought from Sigma. Netilmicin was obtained from Schering-Plough (Kenilworth, NJ). The native gene for AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia was custom-synthesized (GenScript) and cloned between the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of pBluescript II KS (+) under the control of the promoter for aph(2″)-IIIa (pBluescript::AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia) (10.Toth M.

The MICs of selected aminoglycoside antibiotics were determined by the broth microdilution method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (14.Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically: Approved Standard. 8th Ed. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Wayne, PA2009Google Scholar). AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia was expressed in Escherichia coli JM83 using the above plasmid. E. coli JM83 without the plasmid was used as a control. The MICs were evaluated in Mueller-Hinton II broth (Difco) using a bacterial inoculum of 5 × 105 cfu/ml. All plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16–20 h before results were interpreted. The gene for AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia, optimized for expression in E. coli, was custom-synthesized (GenScript) and cloned between the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites of pET22b(+). The recombinant plasmid (pET22::AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia) was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Selected cells were grown in LB medium (300 ml) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until A600 = 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mm to induce protein expression, and the cells were further grown at 22 °C for an additional 20 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, resuspended in 30 ml of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.2 mm DTT, and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min, and nucleic acids were precipitated from the soluble fraction using 1.5% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the sample was dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) at 4 °C. After clarifying the soluble proteins by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min, the sample was loaded onto an Affi-Gel 15-gentamicin affinity column equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) (10.Toth M. Chow J.W. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S.B. Source of phosphate in the enzymic reaction as a point of distinction among aminoglycoside 2′-phosphotransferases.J. Biol.

AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (200–800 mm) in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and fractions positive for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase activity were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a DEAE anion exchange column equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia was eluted in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) using a linear NaCl gradient (0–800 mm). Purified AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia (>95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE) was recovered from fractions containing 400–450 mm NaCl. These fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and stored in liquid N2. The protein concentration was evaluated using the Pierce® BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Enzyme activity was continuously monitored at room temperature by coupling the production of GDP, from AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia-catalyzed phosphate transfer, to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as described previously (10.Toth M. Chow J.W. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S.B. Source of phosphate in the enzymic reaction as a point of distinction among aminoglycoside 2′-phosphotransferases.J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 100 μm NADH, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 25 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, saturating GTP (100 μm), and varying concentrations of aminoglycoside(s) were initiated by the addition of enzyme (5–200 nm final) and monitored at 340 nm (Δϵ340 = −6200 cm−1 m−1) on a Cary 60 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent). The steady-state velocities (v) were plotted versus the concentration of aminoglycoside and fit nonlinearly with the Michaelis-Menten equation using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters kcat and Km. The inhibitor dissociation constants for butirosin A and B, lividomycin A, and paromomycin were determined by the method of Dixon (15.Dixon M. The determination of enzyme inhibitor constants.Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar) using two fixed concentrations of amikacin (40 and 60 μm) and varying concentrations of the inhibitor. The inhibitor dissociation constants for neomycin B and neamine were evaluated using a single fixed concentration of substrate (amikacin, 40 μm, or sisomicin, 20 μm) and varying concentrations of the inhibitor and fitting the fractional activity (vi/vo) with Equation 1 using Prism 5 (16.Copeland R.A.

Enzyme activity was monitored discontinuously at room temperature using a modified version of a previously described assay (17.Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Kinetics: a tool to study molecular motors.Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and varying concentrations of GTP, ATP, and aminoglycoside were initiated by the addition of enzyme (0.25–3 μm final). The GTP stock contained 5–10% (v/v) [γ-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At various time points, aliquots were quenched in an equal volume of 0.5 n formic acid and spotted on a PEI-cellulose TLC plate (10 cm × 20 cm). The plates were developed in 0.3 m potassium Pi (pH 3.4) for 7 min followed by quantification of the radiolabeled substrate, [γ-32P]GTP, and products, [32P]Pi and 32P-labeled aminoglycoside, using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). The concentration of substrate or product was calculated using Equations 2–4. GTP=(GTPdluPdlu+Adlu+GTPdlu)GTPi(Eq. 2) P=(PdluPdlu+Adlu+GTPdlu)GTPi(Eq. 3) A=(AdluPdlu+Adlu+GTPdlu)GTPi(Eq. 4) where GTP is the concentration of GTP, Pdlu is the amount of [32P]Pi in DLU, Adlu is the amount of 32P-labeled aminoglycoside in DLU, GTPdlu is the amount of [γ-32P]GTP in DLU, GTPi is the initial concentration of GTP, P is the concentration of Pi, and A is the concentration of phosphorylated aminoglycoside. Comparison of the resistance profiles conferred by various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes is complicated by the fact that the genes for these enzymes are expressed in different strains, under different promoters, and from different locations (chromosomal or plasmid), which can all significantly affect their levels of expression. We earlier reported the aminoglycoside resistance profile of the monofunctional APH(2″)-Ia (10.Toth M. Chow J.W. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S.B.

As such, we cloned the gene for AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia into the plasmid pBluescript II KS (+) under the promoter for aph(2″)-IIIa we previously used for the monofunctional enzyme (10.Toth M. Chow J.W. Mobashery S. Vakulenko S.B. Source of phosphate in the enzymic reaction as a point of distinction among aminoglycoside 2′-phosphotransferases.J. Biol.

With the exception of tobramycin, the bifunctional enzyme conferred a level of resistance equivalent (within 2-fold) to the monofunctional enzyme. Thus, in vivo it would appear that the level of aminoglycoside resistance observed with E. coli JM83 harboring the bifunctional enzyme is mostly due to the activity of the APH(2″)-Ia domain. This agrees with studies that could only detect phosphorylated kanamycin A in vivo using a strain expressing AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia (7.Azucena E. Grapsas I. Mobashery S.

Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic studies of the bifunctional AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia and the monofunctional APH(2″)-Ia enzymes have demonstrated a selectivity for GTP (Km = 3 and 3.5 μm, respectively) over ATP (Km = 3600 and 870 μm, respectively) as the phosphate donor (9.Martel A.

The concentrations of ATP and GTP in the bacterial cell have been measured in various microorganisms, with estimates ranging from 1 to 10 mm for ATP and from 0.5 to 5 mm for GTP (20.Bochner B.R.

At these concentrations, GTP is saturating and ATP is at least at Km level for AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia; thus, there is the potential for both to be used as substrates in vivo. To test whether GTP, ATP, or both could serve as the phosphate donor(s) for AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia in the presence of both NTPs, we devised an assay to determine the rate of phosphate transfer from GTP in the presence and absence of ATP under conditions where the relative ratios of the two nucleotides are as measured in vivo. Four ratios of ATP and GTP were evaluated; one was determined in Staphylococcus aureus (24.Liebeke M. Meyer H. Donat S. Ohlsen K. Lalk M.

Taymaz-Nikerel H. Baart G. Waegeman H. Maertens J. Heijnen J.J. van Gulik W.M. Catching prompt metabolite dynamics in Escherichia coli with the BioScope at oxygen rich conditions.Metab. Eng. 2010; 12: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We followed phosphorylation of tobramycin by AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia using [γ-32P]GTP as the radiolabeled phosphate donor, thus detecting only GTP-dependent phosphorylation, even in the presence of ATP. Using PEI-cellulose TLC plates, we were able to separate the [γ-32P]GTP and 32P-labeled tobramycin, and then the amount of tobramycin phosphorylated by GTP was quantified by phosphorimaging (Fig. 3). If AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia was using both ATP and GTP as the phosphate donor, we would expect to see a decrease in the rate of GTP-dependent phosphorylation when ATP was present in the reaction. Comparison of the rate of GTP-dependent phosphorylation of tobramycin in the absence and presence of ATP showed no differences when the three ratios of NTPs mimicking in vivo levels were used (Fig. 4, A–C). More importantly, even under conditions in which ATP was in 20-fold excess over GTP and 3-fold above the Km level, we still saw no difference in the rate of GTP-dependent phosphorylation of tobramycin (Fig. 4D). This argues that only GTP is used by AAC(6′)-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia as a source of phosphate. Recent kinetic and x-ray crystallographic studies of three APH(2″) phosphotransferases, APH(2″)-IIa, -IIIa, and -IVa, revealed that these enzymes possess structural templates for the binding of both ATP and GTP (13.Toth M.

The availability of both structural templates accounts for the ability of APH(2″)-IIa and -IVa to use both ATP and GTP as cosubstrates. On the other hand, the structure of APH(2″)-IIIa, an enzyme that has a 400-fold higher relative affinity for GTP when compared with ATP (4 and 1600 μm, respectively), revealed that the ATP-binding template in this enzyme is obstructed by the presence of a bulky tyrosine residue, whereas the GTP-binding template is fully accessible (10.Toth M.

https://openalex.org/W2002641870,"Social insect colonies are complex systems in which the interactions of many individuals lead to colony-level collective behaviors such as foraging. However, the emergent properties of collective behaviors may not necessarily be adaptive. Here, we examine symmetry breaking, an emergent pattern exhibited by some social insects that can lead colonies to focus their foraging effort on only one of several available food patches. Symmetry breaking has been reported to occur in several ant species. However, it is not clear whether it arises as an unavoidable epiphenomenon of pheromone recruitment, or whether it is an adaptive behavior that can be controlled through modification of the individual behavior of workers. In this paper, we used a simulation model to test how symmetry breaking is affected by the degree of non-linearity of recruitment, the specific mechanism used by individuals to choose between patches, patch size, and forager number. The model shows that foraging intensity on different trails becomes increasingly asymmetric as the recruitment response of individuals varies from linear to highly non-linear, supporting the predictions of previous work. Surprisingly, we also found that the direction of the relationship between forager number (i.e., colony size) and asymmetry varied depending on the specific details of the decision rule used by individuals. Limiting the size of the resource produced a damping effect on asymmetry, but only at high forager numbers. Variation in the rule used by individual ants to choose trails is a likely mechanism that could cause variation among the foraging behaviors of species, and is a behavior upon which selection could act."
https://openalex.org/W2031159147,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that plays important roles in growth and development. ABA is also the central regulator to protect plants against abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and adverse temperatures, and ABA signaling is therefore a promising biotechnological target for the generation of crops with increased stress resistance. Recently, a core signal transduction pathway has been established, in which ABA receptors, type 2C protein phosphatases, and AMPK-related protein kinases control the regulation of transcription factors, ion channels, and enzymes. Here we use a simple protein thermal stability shift assay to independently validate key aspects of this pathway and to demonstrate the usefulness of this technique to detect and characterize very weak (Kd ≥50 µM) interactions between receptors and physiological and synthetic agonists, to determine and analyze protein-protein interactions, and to screen small molecule inhibitors."

Unlike in vivo patch clamp experiments, Cx43 was purified and isolated from other membrane constituents allowing elucidation of individual protein responses to various electrical and chemical stimuli.

AFB1-8,9-exo-epoxide, one of AFB1 metabolites, acts as a mutagen to react with DNA and induce gene mutations, including the tumor suppressor p53. In addition, AFB1 reportedly stimulates IGF receptor activation. Aberrant activation of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling is tightly associated with various types of human tumors. In the current study, we investigated the effects of AFB1 on key elements in IGF-IR signaling pathway, and the effects of AFB1 on hepatoma cell migration. The results demonstrated that AFB1 induced IGF-IR, Akt, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and SMMC-7721, and an immortalized human liver cell line Chang liver. AFB1 also down-regulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 but paradoxically up-regulated IRS2 through preventing proteasomal degradation. Treatment of hepatoma cells and Chang liver cells with IGF-IR inhibitor abrogated AFB1-induced Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, IRS2 knockdown suppressed AFB1-induced Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Finally, AFB1 stimulated hepatoma cell migration. IGF-IR inhibitor or IRS2 knockdown suppressed AFB1-induced hepatoma cell migration. These data demonstrate that AFB1 stimulates hepatoma cell migration through IGF-IR/IRS2 axis."

Several of the human 14-3-3 isoforms are dysregulated in certain cancers and thus have been implicated in oncogenesis; experimentally, 14-3-3γ behaves as an oncogene, whereas 14-3-3σ acts as a tumor suppressor. In this study, we sought to localize these opposing phenotypes to specific regions of the two isoforms and then to individual amino acids therein. Using a bioinformatics approach, six variable regions (VRI–VRVI) were identified. Using this information, two sets of constructs were created in which N-terminal portions (including either VRI–IV or only VRI and VRII) of 14-3-3γ and 14-3-3σ were swapped; NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the four chimeric proteins were tested for transformation activity (focus formation, growth in soft agar) and activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling. We found that the specific phenotypes of 14-3-3γ are associated with the N-terminal 40 amino acids (VRI and VRII); in like fashion, VRI and VRII of 14-3-3σ dictated its tumor suppressor function. Using individual amino acid substitutions within the 14-3-3γ VRII, we identified two residues required for and two contributing to the γ-specific phenotypes. Our observations suggest that isoform-specific phenotypes are dictated by a relatively few amino acids within variable regions.

https://openalex.org/W2117829554,"Mice with a deficiency in the HDL receptor SR-BI and low expression of a modified apolipoprotein E gene (SR-BI KO/ApoeR61(h/h)) called 'HypoE' when fed an atherogenic, 'Paigen' diet develop occlusive, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease (CHD), myocardial infarctions (MI), and heart dysfunction and die prematurely (50% mortality ~40 days after initiation of this diet). Because few murine models share with HypoE mice these cardinal, human-like, features of CHD, HypoE mice represent a novel, small animal, diet-inducible and genetically tractable model for CHD. To better describe the properties of this model, we have explored the effects of varying the composition and timing of administration of atherogenic diets, as well as social isolation vs. group housing, on these animals.HypoE mice were maintained on a standard lab chow diet (control) until two months of age. Subsequently they received one of three atherogenic diets (Paigen, Paigen without cholate, Western) or control diet for varying times and were housed in groups or singly, and we determined the plasma cholesterol levels, extent of cardiomegaly and/or survival. The rate of disease progression could be reduced by lowering the severity of the atherogenic diet and accelerated by social isolation. Disease could be induced by Paigen diets either containing or free of cholate. We also established conditions under which CHD could be initiated by an atherogenic diet and then subsequently, by replacing this diet with standard lab chow, hypercholesterolemia could be reduced and progression to early death prevented.HypoE mice provide a powerful, surgery-free, diet-'titratable' small animal model that can be used to study the onset of recovery from occlusive, atherosclerotic CHD and heart failure due to MI. HypoE mice can be used for the analysis of the effects of environment (diet, social isolation) on a variety of features of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018418293,"Friedreich ataxia is a genetic disease caused by deficiencies in frataxin. This protein has homologs not only in higher eukaryotes but also in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The function of this protein is still controversial. We have identified a frataxin homolog in fission yeast, and we have analyzed whether its depletion leads to any of the phenotypes observed in other organisms. Cells deleted in pfh1 are sensitive to growth under aerobic conditions, display increased levels of total iron, hallmarks of oxidative stress such as protein carbonylation, decreased aconitase activity, and lower levels of oxygen consumption compared with wild-type cells. This mitochondrial protein seems to be important for iron and/or reactive oxygen species homeostasis. We have analyzed the proteome of cells devoid of Pfh1, and we determined that gene products up- and down-regulated upon iron depletion in wild-type cells are constitutively misregulated in this mutant. Because of the particular signaling pathway components governing the iron starvation response in fission yeast, our experiments suggest that cells lacking Pfh1 display a decrease of cytosolic available iron that triggers activation of Grx4, the common regulator of the iron starvation gene expression program. Our Schizosaccharomyces pombe Δpfh1 strain constitutes a new and useful model system to study Friedreich ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W1984261650,"Dichelobacter nodosus is the principal causative agent of ovine footrot and its extracellular proteases are major virulence factors. Virulent isolates of D. nodosus secrete three subtilisin-like serine proteases: AprV2, AprV5 and BprV. These enzymes are each synthesized as precursor molecules that include a signal (pre-) peptide, a pro-peptide and a C-terminal extension, which are processed to produce the mature active forms. The function of the C-terminal regions of these proteases and the mechanism of protease processing and secretion are unknown. AprV5 contributes to most of the protease activity secreted by D. nodosus. To understand the role of the C-terminal extension of AprV5, we constructed a series of C-terminal-deletion mutants in D. nodosus by allelic exchange. The proteases present in the resultant mutants and their complemented derivatives were examined by protease zymogram analysis, western blotting and mass spectrometry. The results showed that the C-terminal region of AprV5 is required for the normal expression of protease activity, deletion of this region led to a delay in the processing of these enzymes. D. nodosus is an unusual bacterium in that it produces three closely related extracellular serine proteases. We have now shown that one of these enzymes, AprV5, is responsible for its own maturation, and for the optimal cleavage of AprV2 and BprV, to their mature active forms. These studies have increased our understanding of how this important pathogen processes these virulence-associated extracellular proteases and secretes them into its external environment."
https://openalex.org/W1967202188,"Deep sequencing technology is revolutionizing our understanding of HIV/SIV evolution. It is known that acute SIV sequence variation within CD8 T lymphocyte (CD8-TL) epitopes is similar among MHC-identical animals, but we do not know whether this persists into the chronic phase. We now determine whether chronic viral variation in MHC-identical animals infected with clonal SIV is similar throughout the entire coding sequence when using a sensitive deep sequencing approach. We pyrosequenced the entire coding sequence of the SIV genome isolated from a unique cohort of four SIVmac239-infected, MHC-identical Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) 48 weeks after infection; one MCM in the cohort became an elite controller. Among the three non-controllers, we found that genome-wide sequences were similar between animals and we detected increased sequence complexity within 64% of CD8-TL epitopes when compared to Sanger sequencing methods. When we compared sequences between the MHC-matched controller and the three non-controllers, we found the viral population in the controller was less diverse and accumulated different variants than the viral populations in the non-controllers. Importantly, we found that initial PCR amplification of viral cDNA did not significantly affect the sequences detected, suggesting that data obtained by pyrosequencing PCR-amplified viral cDNA accurately represents the diversity of sequences replicating within an animal. This demonstrates that chronic sequence diversity across the entire SIV coding sequence is similar among MHC-identical animals with comparable viral loads when infected with the same clonal virus stock. Additionally, our approach to genome-wide SIV sequencing accurately reflects the diversity of sequences present in the replicating viral population. In sum, our study suggests that genome-wide pyrosequencing of immunodeficiency viruses captures a thorough and unbiased picture of sequence diversity, and may be a useful approach to employ when evaluating which sequences to include as part of a vaccine immunogen."
https://openalex.org/W2040001825,"Endogenous estrogens play an important role in the overall cardiocirculatory system. However, there are no studies exploring the hormone metabolism and signaling pathway genes together on ischemic stroke, including sulfotransferase family 1E (SULT1E1), catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT), and estrogen receptor α (ESR1).A case-control study was conducted on 305 young ischemic stroke subjects aged </= 50 years and 309 age-matched healthy controls. SULT1E1 -64G/A, COMT Val158Met, ESR1 c.454-397 T/C and c.454-351 A/G genes were genotyped and compared between cases and controls to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke susceptibility. Gene-gene interaction effects were analyzed using entropy-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), classification and regression tree (CART), and traditional multiple regression models.COMT Val158Met polymorphism showed a significant association with susceptibility of young ischemic stroke among females. There was a two-way interaction between SULT1E1 -64G/A and COMT Val158Met in both MDR and CART analysis. The logistic regression model also showed there was a significant interaction effect between SULT1E1 -64G/A and COMT Val158Met on ischemic stroke of the young (P for interaction = 0.0171). We further found that lower estradiol level could increase the risk of young ischemic stroke for those who carry either SULT1E1 or COMT risk genotypes, showing a significant interaction effect (P for interaction = 0.0174).Our findings support that a significant epistasis effect exists among estrogen metabolic and signaling pathway genes and gene-environment interactions on young ischemic stroke subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1981567771,"Background The risks and benefits of infection prophylaxis are uncertain in children with cancer and thus, preferences should be considered in decision making. The purpose of this report was to describe the attitudes of parents, children and healthcare professionals to infection prophylaxis in pediatric oncology. Methods The study was completed in three phases: 1) An initial qualitative pilot to identify the main attributes influencing the decision to use infection prophylaxis, which were then incorporated into a discrete choice experiment; 2) A think aloud during the discrete choice experiment in which preferences for infection prophylaxis were elicited quantitatively; and 3) In-depth follow up interviews. Interviews were recorded verbatim and analyzed using an iterative, thematic analysis. Final themes were selected using a consensus approach. Results A total of 35 parents, 22 children and 28 healthcare professionals participated. All three groups suggested that the most important factor influencing their decision making was the effect of prophylaxis on reducing the chance of death. Themes of importance to the three groups included antimicrobial resistance, side effects of medications, the financial impact of outpatient prophylaxis and the route and schedule of administration. Conclusion Effect of prophylaxis on risk of death was a key factor in decision making. Other identified factors were antimicrobial resistance, side effects of medication, financial impact and administration details. Better understanding of factors driving decision making for infection prophylaxis will help facilitate future implementation of prophylactic regiments."
https://openalex.org/W2007553608,"Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested a role of amygdala in trait anxiety level, in which amygdala was typically treated as a whole. To date, it remains unknown whether the morphology of specific subregions of amygdala are associated with trait anxiety. Here, we employed a shape analysis approach to locate the association between its morphology and trait anxiety on the surface of amygdala. 24 healthy young participants were included. The boundary of amygdala for each subject was first manually outlined using high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) image, followed by 3D surface reconstruction and parameterization using spherical harmonic description. Two point-wise metrics, direct displacement between the individual surface and atlas surface and its normal projection, were used to quantify the surface morphology of amygdala. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the two surface metrics and trait anxiety levels, which were located around the lateral and central nucleus of right amygdala. Our results provided localized information for the association between amygdala and trait anxiety, and suggested a central role of the lateral and central nucleus of right amygdala on trait anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2045632205,"The heat shock response (HSR) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway designed to maintain proteostasis and to ameliorate toxic effects of aberrant protein folding. We have studied the modulation of the HSR by the scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)) and amyloid β peptide (Aβ) and investigated whether an activated HSR or the ectopic expression of individual chaperones can interfere with PrP(Sc)- or Aβ-induced toxicity. First, we observed different effects on the HSR under acute or chronic exposure of cells to PrP(Sc) or Aβ. In chronically exposed cells the threshold to mount a stress response was significantly increased, evidenced by a decreased expression of Hsp72 after stress, whereas an acute exposure lowered the threshold for stress-induced expression of Hsp72. Next, we employed models of PrP(Sc)- and Aβ-induced toxicity to demonstrate that the induction of the HSR ameliorates the toxic effects of both PrP(Sc) and Aβ. Similarly, the ectopic expression of cytosolic Hsp72 or the extracellular chaperone clusterin protected against PrP(Sc)- or Aβ-induced toxicity. However, toxic signaling induced by a pathogenic PrP mutant located at the plasma membrane was prevented by an activated HSR or Hsp72 but not by clusterin, indicating a distinct mode of action of this extracellular chaperone. Our study supports the notion that different pathological protein conformers mediate toxic effects via similar cellular pathways and emphasizes the possibility to exploit the heat shock response therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2011133379,"We have isolated a novel type of lectin named Arenicola marina lectin-1 (AML-1) from the lugworm A. marina. The lectin was purified from the coelomic fluid by affinity chromatography on a GlcNAc-derivatized column and eluted with GlcNAc. On SDS-PAGE, AML-1 showed an apparent molecular mass of 27 and 31 kDa in the reduced state. The N-terminal amino acid sequences were identical in these two bands. In the unreduced state, a complex band pattern was observed with bands from 35 kDa to more than 200 kDa. Two different full-length clones encoding polypeptides of 241 and 243 amino acids, respectively, were isolated from a coelomocyte cDNA library. The two clones, designated AML-1a and AML-1b, were 92% identical at the protein level and represent a novel type of protein sequence family. Purified AML-1 induced agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes, which could be inhibited by N-acetylated saccharides. Recombinant AML-1b showed the same band pattern as the native protein, whereas recombinant AML-1a in the reduced state lacked a 27 kDa band. AML-1b bound GlcNAc-derivatized columns and chitin, whereas AML-1a did not bind to these matrices. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that AML-1 is expressed by coelomocytes in the nephridium and in round cells in the epidermis and in eggs. Moreover, AML-1 expression was up-regulated in response to a parasitic infection. We conclude that AML-1 purified from coelomic fluid is encoded by AML-1b and represents a novel type of protein family that binds acetylated components."
