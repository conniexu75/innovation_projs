https://openalex.org/W4214532250,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid, accurate and accessible nucleic acid tests to enable timely identification of infected individuals. We optimized a sample-to-answer nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 that provides results in <1 hour using inexpensive and readily available reagents. The test workflow includes a simple lysis and viral inactivation protocol followed by direct isothermal amplification of viral RNA using RT-LAMP. The assay was validated using two different instruments, a portable isothermal fluorimeter and a standard thermocycler. Results of the RT-LAMP assay were compared to traditional RT-qPCR for nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, and saliva collected from a cohort of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. For all three sample types, positive agreement with RT-LAMP performed using the isothermal fluorimeter was 100% for samples with Ct <30 and 69-91% for samples with Ct <40. Following validation, the test was successfully scaled to test the saliva of up to 400 asymptomatic individuals per day as part of the campus surveillance program at Rice University. Successful development, validation, and scaling of this sample-to-answer, extraction-free real-time RT-LAMP test for SARS-CoV-2 adds a highly adaptable tool to efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic, and can inform test development strategies for future infectious disease threats."
https://openalex.org/W4214723227,"The Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) is an RNA virus with a positive-strand that belongs to the Togaviridae family’s Alphavirus genus. An epidemic was observed among French troops stationed in the Central African Republic, most likely caused by the SFV virus. The two transmembrane proteins El and E2 and the peripheral protein E3 make up the viral spike protein. The virus binds to the host cell and is internalized via endocytosis; endosome acidification causes the E1/E2 heterodimer to dissociate and the E1 subunits to trimerize. Lupenone was evaluated against the E1 spike protein of SFV in this study based on state-of-the-art cheminformatics approaches, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation. The molecular docking study envisaged major interactions of Lupenone with binding cavity residues involved non-bonded van der Waal’s and Pi-alkyl interactions. Molecular dynamic simulation of a time scale 200 ns corroborated interaction pattern with molecular docking studies between Lupenone and E1 spike protein. Nevertheless, Lupenone intearcation with the E1 spike protein conforming into a stable complex substantiated by free energy landscape (FEL), PCA analysis. Free energy decomposition of the binding cavity resdiues of E1 spike protein also ensured the efficient non-bonded van der Waal’s interaction contributing most energy to interact with the Lupenone. Therefore, Lupenone interacted strongly at the active site conforming into higher structural stability throughout the dynamic evolution of the complex. Thus, this study perhaps comprehend the efficiency of Lupenone as lead molecule against SFV E1 spike protein for future therapeutic purpose."

SAM related mortality rates in under-five children are well documented in Ethiopia but data on their predictors are limited. We aimed to document factors associated with SAM related mortality to inform better inpatient management.A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among children admitted due to SAM at Pawe General Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, from the 1st of January 2015 to the 31st of December 2019. Data from the records of SAM children were extracted using a standardized checklist. Epi-Data version 3.2 was used for data entry, and Stata version 14 was used for analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of mortality. Variables with P<0.05 were considered significant predictors of mortality.Five-hundred sixty-eight SAM cases were identified of mean age was 27.4 (SD± 16.5) months. The crude death rate was 91/568 (16.02%) and the mean time to death was determined as 13 (±8) days. Independent risk factors for death were: (i) vomiting AHR = 5.1 (1.35-21.1, p = 0.026), (ii) diarrhea AHR = 2.79 (1.46-5.4, p = 0.002), (iii) needing nasogastric therapy AHR = 3.22 (1.65-6.26, p = 0.001), (iv) anemia AHR = 1.89 (1.15-3.2, p = 0.012), and (v) being readmitted with SAM AHR = 1.7 (1.12-2.8, p = 0.037).SAM mortality was high in under-five children in our setting. The identified risk factors should inform treatment and prevention strategies. Improved community health education should focus on healthy nutrition and seeking early treatment. Inpatient mortality may be reduced by stricter adherence to treatment guidelines and recognizing early the key risk factors for death."
https://openalex.org/W4214713521,"Background As global populations age, cross-national comparisons of cognitive health and dementia risk are increasingly valuable. It remains unclear, however, whether country-level differences in cognitive function are attributable to population differences or bias due to incommensurate measurement. To demonstrate an effective method for cross-national comparison studies, we aimed to statistically harmonize measures of episodic memory and language function across two population-based cohorts of older adults in the United States (HRS HCAP) and India (LASI-DAD). Methods Data for 3,496 HRS HCAP (≥65 years) and 3,152 LASI-DAD (≥60 years) participants were statistically harmonized for episodic memory and language performance using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) methods. Episodic memory and language factor variables were investigated for differential item functioning (DIF) and precision. Results CFA models estimating episodic memory and language domains based on a priori adjudication of comparable items fit the data well. DIF analyses revealed that four out of ten episodic memory items and five out of twelve language items measured the underlying construct comparably across samples. DIF-modified episodic memory and language factor scores showed comparable patterns of precision across the range of the latent trait for each sample. Conclusions Harmonization of cognitive measures will facilitate future investigation of cross-national differences in cognitive performance and differential effects of risk factors, policies, and treatments, reducing study-level measurement and administrative influences. As international aging studies become more widely available, advanced statistical methods such as those described in this study will become increasingly central to making universal generalizations and drawing valid conclusions about cognitive aging of the global population."
https://openalex.org/W4214542145,"Nutritional value of black soldier fly ( Hermetia illucens ) larvae (BSFL) processed by three different methods of treatment was compared. The resulting products were the spray-dried BSFL (SPR), oven-dried BSFL 1 (OVN1) and oven-dried BSFL 2 (OVN2). Proximate chemical composition, and profiles of amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, heavy metals, vitamins and nucleotides were analysed and compared. The tested BSFL meals were considered to have a good profile of essential amino acids (EAAs), with leucine, lysine, valine, and histidine being the dominant EAAs. Their content of saturated fatty acids exceeded that of the unsaturated fatty acids. Vitamins B1, B2, and C were also present in the samples. Minerals such as calcium, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, zinc, iron, manganese and copper were found to be in adequate amounts in almost all the samples. Heavy metals in the BSFL meals were mostly below 1g kg -1 . Nucleotides such as inosine monophosphate and uridine monophosphate occurred in all the BSFL meals. Other nucleotides, including guanosine monophosphate, adenosine monophosphate, xanthosine monophosphate, and cytidine monophosphate were detected in either or both of SPR and OVN2. In general, the nutritional value of the BSFL meals tested in the present study was influenced by the method of processing."
https://openalex.org/W4214519456,"Success in the retail sector is highly dependent on customer satisfaction. Maintaining a competitive edge depends upon the service providers knowing and enacting what is important to their customers. Multiple studies have employed various research approaches to identifying characteristics of customer satisfaction in different sectors as well as retail sector. However, very few have determined such characteristics using multiple approaches simultaneously in the retail store. This study aims to identify, categorize, and rank the retail store attributes, based on their effects on customer satisfaction. A survey focusing on retail store characteristics that impact customer satisfaction was developed and distributed. Over 400 responses were collected and evaluated, using the Kano model. Results showed that visually appealing facilities and error-free transactions are of prime importance to customers. They are taken for granted, but their absence plays a significant role in customer dissatisfaction. An easy-to-navigate store layout and readily available service increase customer satisfaction, but their absence doesn’t decrease customer satisfaction. Clean public areas and modern-looking equipment are important, and improvements to them increase customer satisfaction at a proportional rate. The findings of this study will assist service providers in realizing the relative importance of the attributes of retail stores and in evaluating the impacts of their current practices on customer satisfaction levels. Such importance will also help retail sector policy makers in mandating policies focusing on must-have attributes to preserve customer satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4214557052,"Light chain amyloidosis is one of the most common forms of systemic amyloidosis. The disease is caused by the misfolding and aggregation of immunoglobulin light chains to insoluble fibrils. These fibrils can deposit in different tissues and organs such as heart and kidney and cause organ impairments that define the clinical presentation. In this study, we present an overview of IGLV-IGLJ and IGLC germline utilization in 85 patients classified in three clinically important subgroups with dominant cardiac, renal as well as cardiac and renal involvement. We found that IGLV3 was the most frequently detected IGLV-family in patients with dominant cardiac involvement, whereas in renal patients IGLV1 were most frequently identified. For patients with dominant heart and kidney involvement IGLV6 was the most frequently detected IGLV-family. In more detailed analysis IGLV3-21 was observed as the most dominant IGLV-subfamily for patients with dominant heart involvement and IGLV1-44 as the most frequent IGLV-subfamily in the group of patients with dominant kidney involvement. For patients with dominant heart and kidney involvement IGLV6-57 was the most frequently detected IGLV-subfamily. Additionally, we were able to show an exclusive linkage between IGLJ1 and IGLC1 as well as between IGLJ2 and IGLC2 in the fully assembled IGL mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W4214742566,"The higher airborne microbial concentration in indoor areas might be responsible for the adverse indoor air quality, which relates well with poor respiratory and general health effects in the form of Sick building syndromes. The current study aimed to isolate and characterize the seasonal (winter and spring) levels of culturable bio-aerosols from indoor air, implicating human health by using an epidemiological health survey. Microorganisms were identified by standard macro and microbiological methods, followed by biochemical testing and molecular techniques. Sampling results revealed the bacterial and fungal aerosol concentrations ranging between (300-3650 CFU/m3) and (300-4150 CFU/m3) respectively, in different microenvironments during the winter season (December-February). However, in spring (March-May), bacterial and fungal aerosol concentrations were monitored, ranging between (450-5150 CFU/m3) and (350-5070 CFU/m3) respectively. Interestingly, Aspergillus and Cladosporium were the majorly recorded fungi whereas, Staphylococcus, Streptobacillus, and Micrococcus found predominant bacterial genera among all the sites. Taken together, the elevated levels of bioaerosols are the foremost risk factor that can lead to various respiratory and general health issues in additional analysis, the questionnaire survey indicated the headache (28%) and allergy (20%) were significant indoor health concerns. This type of approach will serve as a foundation for assisting residents in taking preventative measures to avoid exposure to dangerous bioaerosols."
https://openalex.org/W4225922213,"COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe healthcare challenge calling for an integrated approach in determining the clues for early non-invasive diagnostics of the potentially severe cases and efficient patient stratification. Here we analyze the clinical, laboratory and CT scan characteristics associated with high risk of COVID-19-related death outcome in the cohort of severely-ill patients in Russia. The data obtained reveal that elevated dead lymphocyte counts, decreased early apoptotic lymphocytes, decreased CD14+/HLA-Dr+ monocytes, increased expression of JNK in PBMCs, elevated IL-17 and decreased PAI-1 serum levels are associated with a high risk of COVID-19-related mortality thus suggesting them to be new prognostic factors. This set of determinants could be used as early predictors of potentially severe course of COVID-19 for trials of prevention or timely treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4214570156,"A Polymer Electrolytic Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) is an efficient power device for automobiles, but its efficiency and life span depend upon its air delivery system. To ensure improved performance of PEMFC, the air delivery system must ensure proper regulation of Oxygen Excess Ratio (OER). This paper proposes two nonlinear control strategies, namely Integral Sliding Mode Control (ISMC) and Fast Terminal ISMC (FTISMC). Both the controllers are designed to control the OER at a constant level under load disturbances while avoiding oxygen starvation. The derived controllers are implemented in MATLAB/ Simulink. The corresponding simulation results depict that FTISMC has faster tracking performance and lesser fluctuations due to load disturbances in output net power, stack voltage/power, error tracking, OER, and compressor motor voltage. Lesser fluctuations in these parameters ensure increased efficiency and thus extended life of a PEMFC. The results are also compared with super twisting algorithm STA to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. ISMC and FTISMC yield 7% and 20% improved performance as compared to STA. The proposed research finds potential applications in hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W4214713625,"Medication errors can endanger the health and safety of patients and need to be managed appropriately. This study aimed at developing a new and comprehensive method for estimating the probability of medication errors in hospitals. An extensive literature review was conducted to identify factors affecting medication errors. Success Likelihood Index Methodology was employed for calculating the probability of medication errors. For weighting and rating of factors, the Fuzzy multiple attributive group decision making methodology and Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process were used, respectively. A case study in an emergency department was conducted using the framework. A total number of 17 factors affecting medication error were identified. Workload, patient safety climate, and fatigue were the most important ones. The case study showed that subtasks requiring nurses to read the handwritten of other nurses and physicians are more prone to human error. As there is no specific method for assessing the risk of medication errors, the framework developed in this study can be very useful in this regard. The developed technique was very easy to administer."
https://openalex.org/W4214484107,"Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional protein with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of LF against the potato common scab pathogen Streptomyces scabiei, which causes severe damage to potato tubers. LF derived from bovine (bLF) had much higher activity against S. scabiei than human LF. The minimal inhibitory concentration of bLF was 3.9 μM. The effects of both apo-bLF (iron-free) and holo-bLF (iron-saturated) on S. scabiei were not different. Bovine lactoferricin (LFcinB), a short peptide with a length of 25 amino acid residues located in the N-terminal region of bLF, showed antimicrobial activity against S. scabiei, similar to that of bLF. These results indicated that the antimicrobial activity of bLF against S. scabiei cannot be attributed to its iron-chelating effect but to the bioactivity of its peptides. When S. scabiei was treated with the fusion protein of mCherry-LFcinB (red fluorescent protein) expressed in Escherichia coli, the pseudohyphal cells instantly glowed, indicating that the peptide electrostatically binds to the surface of S. scabiei. An assay of synthetic peptides, with modified number of arginine (Arg) and tryptophan (Trp) residues based on the antimicrobial center (RRWQWR) of LFcinB showed that Trp residues are implicated in the antimicrobial activity against S. scabiei; however, Arg residues are also necessary to carry Trp residues to the cell surface to fully exert its activity. Although the single amino acid effect of Trp had low activity, Trp derivatives showed much higher activity against S. scabiei, suggesting that the derivatives effectively bind to the cell surface (cell membrane) by themselves without a carrier. Thus, amino acid derivatives might be considered effective and alternative antimicrobial substances."
https://openalex.org/W4214584709,"Dinoflagellate species are traditionally defined using morphological characters, but molecular evidence accumulated over the past several decades indicates many morphologically-based descriptions are inaccurate. This recognition led to an increasing reliance on DNA sequence data, particularly rDNA gene segments, in defining species. The validity of this approach assumes the divergence in rDNA or other selected genes parallels speciation events. Another concern is whether single gene rDNA phylogenies by themselves are adequate for delineating species or if multigene phylogenies are required instead. Currently, few studies have directly assessed the relative utility of multigene versus rDNA-based phylogenies for distinguishing species. To address this, the current study examined D1-D3 and ITS/5.8S rDNA gene regions, a multi-gene phylogeny, and morphological characters in Gambierdiscus and other related dinoflagellate genera to determine if they produce congruent phylogenies and identify the same species. Data for the analyses were obtained from previous sequencing efforts and publicly available dinoflagellate transcriptomic libraries as well from the additional nine well-characterized Gambierdiscus species transcriptomic libraries generated in this study. The D1-D3 and ITS/5.8S phylogenies successfully identified the described Gambierdiscus and Alexandrium species. Additionally, the data showed that the D1-D3 and multigene phylogenies were equally capable of identifying the same species. The multigene phylogenies, however, showed different relationships among species and are likely to prove more accurate at determining phylogenetic relationships above the species level. These data indicated that D1-D3 and ITS/5.8S rDNA region phylogenies are generally successful for identifying species of Gambierdiscus , and likely those of other dinoflagellates. To assess how broadly general this finding is likely to be, rDNA molecular phylogenies from over 473 manuscripts representing 232 genera and 863 described species of dinoflagellates were reviewed. Results showed the D1-D3 rDNA and ITS phylogenies in combination are capable of identifying 97% of dinoflagellate species including all the species belonging to the genera Alexandrium , Ostreopsis and Gambierdiscus , although it should be noted that multi-gene phylogenies are preferred for inferring relationships among these species. A protocol is presented for determining when D1-D3, confirmed by ITS/5.8S rDNA sequence data, would take precedence over morphological features when describing new dinoflagellate species. This protocol addresses situations such as: a) when a new species is both morphologically and molecularly distinct from other known species; b) when a new species and closely related species are morphologically indistinguishable, but genetically distinct; and c) how to handle potentially cryptic species and cases where morphotypes are clearly distinct but have the same rDNA sequence. The protocol also addresses other molecular, morphological, and genetic approaches required to resolve species boundaries in the small minority of species where the D1-D3/ITS region phylogenies fail."
https://openalex.org/W4214602185,"SARS-CoV-2 has spread throughout the world since its discovery in China, and Malaysia is no exception. WGS has been a crucial approach in studying the evolution and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the ongoing pandemic. Despite considerable number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been submitted to GISAID and NCBI databases, there is still scarcity of data from Malaysia. This study aims to report new Malaysian lineages of the virus, responsible for the sustained spikes in COVID-19 cases during the third wave of the pandemic. Patients with nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs confirmed COVID-19 positive by real-time RT-PCR with CT value < 25 were chosen for WGS. The selected SARS-CoV-2 isolates were then sequenced, characterized and analyzed along with 986 sequences of the dominant lineages of D614G variants currently circulating throughout Malaysia. The prevalence of clade GH and G formed strong ground for the presence of two Malaysian lineages of AU.2 and B.1.524 that has caused sustained spikes of cases in the country. Statistical analysis on the association of gender and age group with Malaysian lineages revealed a significant association (p <0.05). Phylogenetic analysis revealed dispersion of 41 lineages, of these, 22 lineages are still active. Mutational analysis showed presence of unique G1223C missense mutation in transmembrane domain of the spike protein. For better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Malaysia especially with reference to the reported lineages, large scale studies based on WGS are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4214684104,"After stratifying for age, sex and multimorbidity at baseline, our aim is to analyse time trends in incident multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the 15-year clinical trajectories of individual patients in a family medicine setting.This study was carried out using data from the Registration Network Family Medicine in the South of the Netherlands. The clinical trajectories of 10037 subjects during the 15-year period (2000-2014) were analyzed in a repeated measurement of using a generalized estimating equations model as well as a multilevel random intercept model with repeated measurements to determine patterns of incident multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Hierarchical age-period-cohort models were used to generate age and cohort trajectories for comparison with prevalence trends in multimorbidity literature.Multimorbidity was more common in females than in males throughout the duration of the 15-year trajectory (females: 39.6%; males: 33.5%). With respective ratios of 11.7 and 5.9 between the end and the beginning of the 15-year period, the youngest female and male groups showed a substantial increase in multimorbidity prevalence. Ratios in the oldest female and male groups were 2.2 and 1.9 respectively. Females had higher levels of multimorbidity than males in the 0-24-year and 25-44-year age groups, but the levels converged to a prevalence of 92.2% in the oldest male and 90.7% in the oldest female group. Similar, albeit, moderate differences were found in polypharmacy patterns.We sought to specify the progression of multimorbidity from an early age. As a result, our study adds to the multimorbidity literature by specifying changes in chronic disease accumulation with relation to polypharmacy, and by tracking differences in patient trajectories according to age and sex. Multimorbidity and polypharmacy are common and their prevalence is accelerating, with a relatively rapid increase in younger groups. From the point of view of family medicine, this underlines the need for a longitudinal approach and a life course perspective in patient care."
https://openalex.org/W4214714508,"The early detection of acute myocardial infarction, which is caused by lifestyle-related risk factors, is essential because it can lead to chronic heart failure or sudden death. Echocardiography, among the most common methods used to detect acute myocardial infarction, is a noninvasive modality for the early diagnosis and assessment of abnormal wall motion. However, depending on disease range and severity, abnormal wall motion may be difficult to distinguish from normal myocardium. As abnormal wall motion can lead to fatal complications, high accuracy is required in its detection over time on echocardiography. This study aimed to develop an automatic detection method for acute myocardial infarction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) in echocardiography. The short-axis view (papillary muscle level) of one cardiac cycle and left ventricular long-axis view were input into VGG16, a CNN model, for feature extraction. Thereafter, LSTM was used to classify the cases as normal myocardium or acute myocardial infarction. The overall classification accuracy reached 85.1% for the left ventricular long-axis view and 83.2% for the short-axis view (papillary muscle level). These results suggest the usefulness of the proposed method for the detection of myocardial infarction using echocardiography."
https://openalex.org/W4214531901,"Judgement bias testing has emerged as a potential tool for assessing affective states in animals. Researchers infer an animal's affective state based on an animal's response to an ambiguous stimulus that is intermediate to both the rewarded and punished conditioned stimuli. Animals can be classified as ""optimistic"" or having a positive affective state if the animal displays behaviors that suggest an increased expectation of reward in the face of ambiguous stimuli. Alternatively, animals can be classified ""pessimistic"" or having a negative affective state if the animal displays behaviors that suggest an increased expectation of punishment in the face of ambiguous stimuli. Recent reports in multiple species question what factors influence performance in judgement bias testing, and which may allow for erroneous conclusions regarding individual affective state. In order to better understand this concern, 25 female swine were subjected to behavioral assessments at critical rearing stages to determine response variability. These same individuals were then assessed for physical measures of welfare and judgement bias using the ""go/no-go"" task as breeding adults. Sows which were more aggressive approached the ambiguous, but not the positive, stimulus significantly faster than others. Both optimistic and pessimistic biases were observed despite all sows living in enriched housing, and, sows with more positive physical welfare measures (fewer skin lesions and healthy body condition) did not exhibit more optimistic judgement biases. Our data demonstrate that behavior traits, such as aggressiveness, can affect a sow's performance in a judgement bias test, while measures of physical health did not. We suggest that individual differences in behavior (e.g., bold-aggressive behavioral syndrome, or, proactive coping style) generate different emotional responses and can contribute to the animal's overall affective state more so than physical ailment. Our findings highlight the complexity of how different factors impact an animal's overall affective state and support the need for complementary measures in future JBT studies, including personality assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4214533294,"Although serologic tests for COVID-19 diagnosis are rarely indicated nowadays, they remain commercially available and widely used in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of anti-SARS-CoV-2antibody diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in Brazil.Eleven commercially available diagnostic tests, comprising five lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays (LFAs) and six immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA) were analyzed from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Health System.The direct costs of LFAs ranged from US$ 11.42 to US$ 17.41and of ELISAs, from US$ 6.59 to US$ 10.31. Considering an estimated disease prevalence between 5% and 10%, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) was the most cost-effective test, followed by the rapid One Step COVID-19 Test, at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 2.52 and US$ 1.26 per properly diagnosed case, respectively. Considering only the LFAs, at the same prevalence estimates, two tests, the COVID-19 IgG/IgM and the One Step COVID-19 Test, showed high effectiveness at similar costs. For situations where the estimated probability of disease is 50%, the LFAs are more costly and less effective alternatives.Nowadays there are few indications for the use of serologic tests in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and numerous commercially available tests, with marked differences are observed among them. In general, LFA tests are more cost-effective for estimated low-COVID-19-prevalences, while ELISAs are more cost-effective for high-pretest-probability scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4214765322,"Cows from 8 commercial Dutch dairy farms were equipped with 2 sensors to study their complete time budgets of eating, rumination, lying, standing and walking times as derived from a neck and a leg sensor. Daily sensor data of 1074 cows with 3201 lactations was used from 1 month prepartum until 10 months postpartum. Farms provided data over a 5 year period. The final models (lactational time budget and 24h time budget) showed significant effects of parity, farm and calving season. When primiparous cows were introduced in the lactational herd, they showed a decrease in lying time of 215 min (95% CI: 187–242) and an increase in standing time of 159 min (95% CI: 138–179), walking time of 23 min (95% CI: 20–26) and rumination time of 69 min (95% CI: 57–82). Eating time in primiparous cows increased from 1 month prepartum until 9 months in lactation with 88 min (95% CI: 76–101) and then remained stable until the end of lactation. Parity 2 and parity 3+ cows decreased in eating time by 30 min (95% CI: 20–40) and 26 min (95% CI: 18–33), respectively, from 1 month before to 1 month after calving. Until month 6, eating time increased 11 min (95% CI: 1–22) for parity 2, and 24 min (95% CI: 16–32) for parity 3+. From 1 month before calving to 1 month after calving, they showed an increase in ruminating of 17 min (95% CI: 6–28) and 28 min (95% CI: 21–35), an increase in standing time of 117 min (95% CI: 100–135) and 133 min (95% CI: 121–146), while lying time decreased with 113 min (95% CI: 91–136) and 130 min (95% CI: 114–146), for parity 2 and 3+, respectively. After month 1 in milk to the end of lactation, lying time increased 67 min (95% CI: 49–85) for parity 2, and 77 min (95% CI: 53–100) for parity 3+. Lactational time budget patterns are comparable between all 8 farms, but cows on conventional milking system (CMS) farms with pasture access appear to show higher standing and walking time, and spent less time lying compared to cows on automatic milking system (AMS) farms without pasture access. Every behavioral parameter presented a 24h pattern. Cows eat, stand and walk during the day and lie down and ruminate during the night. Daily patterns in time budgets on all farms are comparable except for walking time. During the day, cows on CMS farms with pasture access spent more time walking than cows on AMS farms without pasture access. The average 24h pattern between parities is comparable, but primiparous cows spent more time walking during daytime compared to older cows. These results indicate a specific behavioral pattern per parameter from the last month prepartum until 10 months postpartum with different patterns between parities but comparable patterns across farms. Furthermore, cows appear to have a circadian rhythm with varying time budgets in the transition period and during lactation."

However, no studies have analysed the opinion of the S-As on the functioning of DC with a qualitative methodology. The aim of the present work was to collect the opinions of elite university S-As in relation to DC policy adopted by their academic institutions in different European countries. In total, 77 athletes (F = 35, M = 42; age range: 20–25 years) participated in 15 national face-to-face focus groups in five different countries, to discuss aspects that higher education institutes should implement in relation to: 1) the athletes’ needs; 2) assistance/tutorship: 2) curricula requirements; 3) financial support; 4) logistic support; 5) social support; and 6) dual career policies. Fifty of the athletes competed in individual sports and twenty-seven team sports. Of them, 57 was enrolled at undergraduate, 17 was enrolled in a master and 3 in a PhD. The athletes were presented with 13 open-ended questions one by one, and were ensured freedom to interact. All the discussions were recorded. After this, a general discussion took place in which the participants identified and agreed on a final list of statements from their focus group deemed to be relevant to DC athletes as university students. Then, at a consensus meeting, the findings were combined, repetitions were eliminated, and fragmented statements were condensed into broader ones. A final list of 31 statements, organized in six related content units, were identified in relation to the athletes’ needs (n = 5), assistance/tutorship (n = 5), curricula requirements (n = 4), financial support (n = 4), logistic support (n = 4), social support (n = 6), and DC policies (n = 3), respectively.

Herein, new ARLs via an analytical integral equation (IE) solution as an analytical IE and a numerical IE method to test a CUSUM control chart's ability to detect a wide range of shifts in the mean of a SARFIMAX(P, D, Q, r)s process with underlying exponential white noise are presented. The analytical IE formulas were derived by using the Fredholm integral equation of the second type while the numerical IE method for the approximate ARL is based on quadrature rules. After applying Banach's fixed-point theorem to guarantee its existence and uniqueness, the precision of the proposed analytical IE ARL was the same as the numerical IE method. The sensitivity and accuracy of the ARLs based on both methods were assessed on a CUSUM control chart running a SARFIMAX(P, D, Q, r)s process with underlying exponential white noise. The results of an extensive numerical study comprising the examination of a wide variety of out-of-control situations and computational schemes reveal that none of the methods outperformed the IE. Specifically, the computational scheme is easier and can be completed in one step. Hence, it is recommended for use in this situation. An illustrative example based on real data is also provided, the results of which were found to be in accordance with the research results."
https://openalex.org/W4214548334,"Progressively more community initiatives have been undertaken over last decades to monitor water quality. Biological data collected by volunteers has been used for biodiversity and water quality studies. Despite the many citizen science projects collecting and using macroinvertebrates, the number of scientific peer-reviewed publications that use this data, remains limited. In 2018, a citizen science project on biological water quality assessment was launched in the Netherlands. In this project, volunteers collect macroinvertebrates from a nearby waterbody, identify and count the number of specimens, and register the catch through a web portal to instantaneously receive a water quality score based on their data. Water quality monitoring in the Netherlands is traditionally the field of professionals working at water authorities. Here, we compare the data from the citizen science project with the data gathered by professionals. We evaluate information regarding type and distribution of sampled waterbodies and sampling period, and compare general patterns in both datasets with respect to collected animals and calculated water quality scores. The results show that volunteers and professionals seldomly sample the same waterbody, that there is some overlap in sampling period, and that volunteers more frequently sampled urban waters and smaller waterbodies. The citizen science project is thus yielding data about understudied waters and this spatial and temporal complementarity is useful. The character and thoroughness of the assessments by volunteers and professionals are likely to differentiate. Volunteers collected significantly lower numbers of animals per sample and fewer animals from soft sediments like worms and more mobile individuals from the open water column such as boatsmen and beetles. Due to the lack of simultaneous observations at various locations by volunteers and professionals, a direct comparison of water quality scores is impossible. However, the obtained patterns from both datasets show that the water quality scores between volunteers and professionals are dissimilar for the different water types. To bridge these differences, new tools and processes need to be further developed to increase the value of monitoring biological water quality by volunteers for professionals."

Teamwork, interpersonal relations, analytical skills or critical/clinical thinking are some examples of internationally recommended competences in this kind of university studies. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate this learning in Physiotherapy through valid tools that facilitate this task.To analyze the psychometric properties according to competences in Clinical Practices (RECOPC-FIS II) in order to assess 14 transversal or universal competences of under-graduate students in the Physiotherapy degree.A validation study was conducted with 197 students in the 3rd and 4th year of the Physiotherapy degree and 202 clinical tutors who assessed these students using the RECOPC-FIS II. Different psychometric properties were analyzed: factor structure, internal consistency and sensitivity to change.The RECOPC-FIS II has a high internal consistency. Its 14 items saturate in a single factor. Regarding the sensitivity to change, the rubric showed higher scores in the Practicum of the 4th year with respect to that of the 3rd year, reaching significant differences in all of them.The RECOPC-FIS II is a valid and reliable instrument to assess the transversal competencies of undergraduate students of Physiotherapy during their clinical practice. Therefore, it is intended to facilitate the acquisition of essential skills for the development of their professional career. The flexibility of this tool would allow its adaptation to other health science courses."

Socially anxious individuals are known to show attention biases to threatening stimuli, although there is inconsistency in the literature with regards to the type of attentional biases they present. This study examines the effect of attention bias modification (ABM) for social anxiety in non-treatment-seeking college students meeting social anxiety disorder criteria, taking into consideration previous mixed results regarding its effectiveness. Attention bias levels and types (i.e. vigilance vs avoidance) at baseline were examined and considered as potential moderators of ABM effects. Sixty-eight socially anxious individuals were randomly allocated to ABM vs placebo groups. A structured interview and self-report assessment were completed at pre-treatment and post-treatment. Results showed half of the participants presented few attention biases at baseline, and the rest presented either vigilance or avoidance. Participants with low attention biases scored higher in social anxiety than those showing avoidance and there was no difference between those showing vigilance vs avoidance. No significant effects from pre to post treatment were observed in attention biases, self-report or structured interview of anxiety in the ABM group. Baseline attention biases did not moderate these effects. Results are discussed with regards to implications for future research towards the creation of more effective protocols, based on the needs of heterogeneous social anxiety sub-groups."
https://openalex.org/W4214724947,"The caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD, amino acids 82–101 of caveolin-1) has been shown to suppress bleomycin-induced lung and skin fibrosis and angiotensin II (AngII)-induced myocardial fibrosis. To identify active subregions within CSD, we split its sequence into three slightly overlapping 8-amino acid subregions (82–89, 88–95, and 94–101). Interestingly, all three peptides showed activity. In bleomycin-treated mice, all three subregions suppressed the pathological effects on lung and skin tissue morphology. In addition, while bone marrow monocytes isolated from bleomycin-treated mice showed greatly enhanced migration in vitro toward CXCL12, treatment in vivo with CSD and its subregions almost completely suppressed this enhanced migration. In AngII-induced heart failure, both 82–89 and 88–95 significantly suppressed fibrosis (both Col I and HSP47 levels), microvascular leakage, and heart weight/ body weight ratio (HW/BW) while improving ventricular function. In contrast, while 94–101 suppressed the increase in Col I, it did not improve the other parameters. The idea that all three subregions can be active depending on the assay was further supported by experiments studying the in vitro migration of human monocytes in which all three subregions were extremely active. These studies are very novel in that it has been suggested that there is only one active region within CSD that is centered on amino acids 90–92. In contrast, we demonstrate here the presence of other active regions within CSD."
https://openalex.org/W4214758975,"To meet the high thickness accuracy requirements in cold-rolling processes, a roll eccentricity signal extraction method based on modified particle swarm optimization and wavelet threshold denoising (MPSO-WTD) with intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) is proposed. The strong denoising ability of the wavelet is combined with the decomposition and recognition attributes of ITD for non-stationary signals. Periodic disturbances in strip thickness caused by roll eccentricity are actively compensated. First, the wavelet is used to denoise the signal and the MPSO algorithm is applied to determine a rational threshold and improve the calculation efficiency. Then, the denoised signal is decomposed into proper rotational components (PRCs) using the ITD method, and an appropriate PRC component representing the eccentricity signal is extracted. Finally, the eccentricity compensation signal is applied in the automatic gauge control (AGC) system of the cold rolling mill. During the rolling process, the rolling speed is not constant and will directly affect the frequency of the roll eccentricity signal. To solve this problem, an encoder is installed at the end of the roll and the compensation frequency of the roller eccentricity signal is determined in the roller eccentricity compensation system according to the pulse number output. The results of simulations and experiments show that roll eccentricity signals extracted using the proposed method can effectively remove the influence of interference signals. An average improvement of 62.3% in the roll eccentricity compensation effect was achieved under the stable rolling condition in the finishing rolling stage."
https://openalex.org/W4214763655,"Learning from others provides the foundation for culture and the advancement of knowledge. Learning a new visuospatial skill from others represents a specific challenge-overcoming differences in perspective so that we understand what someone is doing and why they are doing it. The ""what"" of visuospatial learning is thought to be easiest from a shared 0° first-person perspective and most difficult from a 180° third-person perspective. However, the visual disparity at 180° promotes face-to-face interaction, which may enhance learning by scaffolding social perspective taking, the ""why"" of visuospatial learning. We tested these potentially conflicting hypotheses in child and young adult learners. Thirty-six children (4-6 years) and 57 young adults (18-27 years) observed a live model open a puzzle box from a first-person (0°) or third-person (90° or 180°) perspective. The puzzle box had multiple solutions, only one of which was modelled, which allowed for the assessment of imitation and goal emulation. Participants had three attempts to open the puzzle box from the model's perspective. While first-person (0°) observation increased imitation relative to a 180° third-person perspective, the 180° observers opened the puzzle box most readily (i.e., fastest). Although both age groups were excellent imitators and able to take the model's perspective, adults were more faithful imitators, and children were more likely to innovate a new solution. A shared visual perspective increased imitation, but a shared mental perspective promoted goal achievement and the social transmission of innovation.

For our first experiment, we assigned 9-week-old male Wistar rats randomly into four groups: light phase (zeitgeber time; ZT6) non-trained control, dark phase (ZT18) non-trained control, light phase-trained, and dark phase-trained. Trained animals performed 90 min of downhill running once every 3 d for 8 weeks. The second experiment involved dividing 9-week-old male Wistar rats to control and exercise groups. The latter were subjected to 15 min of downhill running at ZT6 and ZT18. The absolute (+12.8%) and relative (+9.4%) SOL muscle weights were higher in the light phase-trained group. p70S6K phosphorylation ratio was 42.6% higher in the SOL muscle of rats that had exercised only in light (non-trained ZT6). Collectively, the degree of muscle hypertrophy in SOL is time-of-day dependent, perhaps via the mTOR/p70S6K signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4214566185,"Experimental breakthroughs have provided unprecedented insights into the genes involved in cancer. The identification of such cancer driver genes is a major step in gaining a fuller understanding of oncogenesis and provides novel lists of potential therapeutic targets. A key area that requires additional study is the posttranscriptional control mechanisms at work in cancer driver genes. This is important not only for basic insights into the biology of cancer, but also to advance new therapeutic modalities that target RNA-an emerging field with great promise toward the treatment of various cancers. In the current study we performed an in silico analysis on the transcripts associated with 800 cancer driver genes (10,390 unique transcripts) that identified 179,190 secondary structural motifs with evidence of evolutionarily ordered structures with unusual thermodynamic stability. Narrowing to one transcript per gene, 35,426 predicted structures were subjected to phylogenetic comparisons of sequence and structural conservation. This identified 7,001 RNA secondary structures embedded in transcripts with evidence of covariation between paired sites, supporting structure models and suggesting functional significance. A select set of seven structures were tested in vitro for their ability to regulate gene expression; all were found to have significant effects. These results indicate potentially widespread roles for RNA structure in posttranscriptional control of human cancer driver genes."
https://openalex.org/W4214607302,"It remains unclear as to whether polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an additional risk factor in the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in obese women. In the current study, we provide clarity on this issue by rigorously analysing patient LV geometry beyond the basic clinical measures currently used. Importantly, the cohort contained only normotensive patients that would normally be deemed low risk with no further intervention required.The study comprised 24 obese women with PCOS and 29 obese Control women. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to evaluate LV structure/function. Basic clinical and metabolic data were collected for each participant consisting of age, BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose, LDL-C, HLD-C, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Exclusion criteria; BMI < 30 g/m2, type 2 diabetes, hypertension.Both groups exhibited concentric remodelling of the LV posterior wall at a prevalence of ~20%, this associated with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Estimated LV mass/height2.7 was increased patients with PCOS (45 ± 2.2 vs 37 ± 1.6) with 33% exhibiting LV mass/height2.7 above ASE guidelines, compared to 7% in Controls. Furthermore, 25% of patients with PCOS were characterised with concentric hypertrophy, an alteration in LV geometry that was not observed in the Control group.To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess LV geometric patterns in obese women with PCOS. The results suggest that obese women with PCOS are at greater risk of concentric hypertrophy than obese only women and provide justification for additional cardiovascular risk assessment in normotensive obese/PCOS women."
https://openalex.org/W4214679000,"Purpose 11 C-Methionine ( 11 C-MET) PET prognostication of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type glioblastomas is inadequate as conventional parameters such as standardized uptake value (SUV) do not adequately reflect tumor heterogeneity. We retrospectively evaluated whether volume-based parameters such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion methionine metabolism (TLMM) outperformed SUV for survival correlation in patients with IDH wild type glioblastomas. Methods Thirteen IDH wild type glioblastoma patients underwent preoperative 11 C-MET PET. Both SUV-based parameters and volume-based parameters were calculated for each lesion. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing and Cox regression analysis were used for correlation between PET parameters and overall survival. Results Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 393 days. MTV (HR 1.136, p = 0.007) and TLMM (HR 1.022, p = 0.030) were inversely correlated with overall survival. SUV-based 11 C-MET PET parameters did not show a correlation with survival. In a paired analysis with other clinical parameters including age and radiotherapy dose, MTV and TLMM were found to be independent factors. Conclusions MTV and TLMM, and not SUV, significantly correlate with overall survival in patients with IDH wild type glioblastomas. The incorporation of volume-based 11 C-MET PET parameters may lead to a better outcome prediction for this heterogeneous patient population."
https://openalex.org/W4214701889,"Sentence processing is known to be highly incremental. Speakers make incremental commitments as the sentence unfolds, dynamically updating their representations based on the smallest pieces of information from the incoming speech stream. Less is known about linguistic processing on the sub-word level, especially with regard to abstract grammatical information. This study employs the Visual World Paradigm to investigate the processing of grammatical aspect by Russian-speaking adults (n = 124). Aspectual information is encoded relatively early within the Russian verb which makes this an ideal testing ground to investigate the incrementality of grammatical processing on the sub-word level. Participants showed preference for pictures of ongoing events when they heard sentences involving Imperfective verbs, and for pictures of completed events when they heard sentences involving Perfective verbs. Crucially, the analysis of the participants' eye-movements showed that they exhibited preference for the target picture already before they heard the end of the verb. Moreover, the latency of this effect depended on where the aspectual information was encoded within the verb. These results indicate that the processing and integration of grammatical aspect information can happen rapidly and incrementally on a fine-grained word-internal level. Methodologically, the study draws together a set of analytical techniques which can be fruitfully applied to the analysis of effect latencies in a wide range of studies within the Visual World eye-tracking paradigm."

Analysis of T2D prevention interventions for these populations show that limited attention has been given to facilitating increased physical activity (PA) in a culturally appropriate manner. The aim of this feasibility study was to identify whether culturally tailored dance is acceptable to women of SA origin, and whether it may have an effect on PA and PA-related social cognitive determinants.A community-based culturally tailored dance intervention choreographed to Bollywood music was evaluated among 26 women of SA origin in the Netherlands for 10 weeks, 2 times per week. This feasibility study was conducted as a before-after, mixed-methods study, combining data from focus groups, individual interviews, questionnaires and accelerometers.The majority of participants were in the age of 50-59 years and at moderate-to-high T2D risk. There was high attendance (73%), low drop out (12%) and high satisfaction scores for various program components. Key reasons for participation were the cultural appropriateness, in particular the combination of historically and emotionally embedded Indian music and dance, and the non-competitive nature of the intervention. On average, in each of the 19 one-hour sessions, participants spent 30.8 minutes in objectively assessed light intensity PA, 14.1 minutes in moderate intensity PA and 0.3 minutes in vigorous PA, and took 2,100 steps during a session. At follow-up, total moderate-to-vigorous PA increased by 7.8 minutes per day (95%CI: 3.1, 12.5) and daily steps increased by 784 (95%CI: 173, 1394), with a concomitant reduction in light PA of 12 minutes per day (95%CI: -21.9, -2.2). Positive shifts in some PA-behavioral social cognitive determinants and no negative side-effects were observed.Bollywood Dance appears to be a feasible, culturally acceptable and potentially effective approach to increase PA in SA women in the Netherlands. A pilot cluster RCT is needed to confirm these initial findings on effectiveness."

However, the generation mechanism of training-induced alpha activity has not yet been clarified. The present study aimed to identify sources of training-induced alpha activity through four temporal/spectral analytic techniques, i.e., the max peak average (MPA), positive average (PA), negative average (NA) and event-related spectral perturbation average (ERSPA) methods. Thirty-five healthy participants were recruited into an alpha group receiving feedback of 8-12-Hz amplitudes, and twenty-eight healthy participants were recruited into a control group receiving feedback of random 4-Hz amplitudes from the range of 7 to 20 Hz. Twelve sessions were performed within 4 weeks (3 sessions per week). The control group had no change in the amplitude spectrum. In contrast, twenty-nine participants in the alpha group showed significant alpha amplitude increases exclusively and were identified as ""responders"". A whole-head EEG was recorded for the ""responders"" after NFT. The epochs of training-induced alpha activity from whole-head EEG were averaged by four different methods for equivalent current dipole source analysis. High agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficients on dipole source localization between each method were observed, showing that the dipole clusters of training-induced alpha activity were consistently located in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and middle temporal gyrus. The residual variance (goodness of fit) for dipole estimation of the MPA was significantly smaller than that of the others. Our findings indicate that the precuneus, PCC and middle temporal gyrus play important roles in enhancing training-induced alpha activity. The four averaging methods (especially the MPA method) were suitable for investigating sources of brainwaves. Additionally, three dipoles can be used for dipole source analysis of training-induced alpha activity in future research, especially the training sites are around the central regions."

In Ethiopia, under-five mortality rates, about 190,000 children die each year. Different research conducted in Ethiopia on childhood vaccination have focused on either vaccination coverage of individual vaccine or complete and incomplete vaccination. As far as my literature searching, studies separated the vaccination status into non-vaccinated, partially vaccinated and full vaccinated and assorted factors among children age 12-23 month in Ethiopia were limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors associated with vaccination status among children 12-23 months of age in Ethiopia.A secondary data analysis was done based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total weighted sample of 1911 children age 12-23 months of age were included in the study. Logit based Multinomial logistic regression analysis was computed to distinguish factors associated with routine vaccination of children aged 12-23 months. P-value less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance of each independent variables, and adjusted odd ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval were used to present the result and STATA 14 was utilized for data management and analysis.Overall the prevalence of full vaccinated children was 35%, while 49% of children were partially vaccinated and 16% were non-vaccinated. In multinomial analysis, having focused ANC (at least four visits) contrasted to no ANC visits at all had 9.7 higher odd of being fully vaccinated than not vaccinated [AOR = 9.74, 95% CI = 3.52-26.94], and 5 times higher odd of being partially vaccinated than not vaccinated [AOR = 4.97, 95% CI = 2.00-12.33].The present study found that childhood full vaccination status was low compared with the World Health Organization targets. Frequency of ANC visit and visited by field worker were significantly associated both partially and full vaccination whereas, visited health facility last 12 months and wealth status were significantly associated with childhood full vaccination."

Composite readiness index for all services including family planning, antenatal care service, delivery and newborn service readiness index, and curative child care service readiness index was considered for the integration of all services (i.e. readiness for FPMCH). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to examine the association between covariates and readiness score to provide integrated services.The mean readiness score of integrated services in health facilities in Nepal was 52.1%. The services in private hospitals and peripheral health facilities had significantly lower readiness scores of integrated services compared to government hospitals. Compared to Province 3(Province 3 holds the national capital), Province 2 had significantly lower and Province 7 had significantly higher readiness scores. There is a marginally significantly higher readiness score of integrated services in the facilities where management meetings are held compared to where management meetings are never conducted. Interestingly, health facilities where external supervision occurred in the last 4 months had better service readiness of integrated services compared with those facilities with no external supervision. Similarly, the facilities that performed the routine quality assurance activities and facilities having a system for collecting opinion and being reviewed had a higher integrated services readiness score than their counterparts.This study found a scope of improvement in management practices in the health sector of Nepal especially for supportive supervision, quality assurance (QA) activities, monthly management meetings, and a system of collecting and reviewing opinions from the clients. Strengthening management practices especially, promoting supportive supervision and adhering to QA protocols may improve HF readiness to implement integrated FPMCH in Nepal. Being low readiness, there is an urgent need for policy reform to improve the integrated service readiness, particularly in Province 2."
https://openalex.org/W4226046580,"Due to increasing demand for salmon and environmental barriers preventing expansion in established sites, salmon farmers seek to move or expand their production to more exposed sites. In this study we investigate the effects of strong currents and waves on the behaviour of salmon and how they choose to use the space available to them. Observations are carried out in a site with strong tidal currents and well mixed water. Using video cameras and echo sounders, we show that salmon prefer to use the entire water column, narrowing their range only as a response to cage deformation, waves, or daylight. Conversely, salmon show strong horizontal preference, mostly occupying the portions of the cage exposed to currents. Additionally, waves cause salmon to disperse from the exposed side of the cage to the more sheltered side. Even when strong currents decrease the amount of available space, salmon choose to occupy the more exposed part of the cage. This indicates that at least with good water exchange, the high density caused by limited vertical space is not so aversive that salmon choose to move to less desirable areas of the cage. However, the dispersal throughout the entire available water column indicates that ensuring enough vertical space, even in strong currents, would be beneficial to salmon welfare."

We hypothesize that inquisitiveness is a fundamental determinant for generativity and happiness, empirically examining the relationships along with cognitive, noncognitive and sociodemographic factors. We conduct questionnaire surveys with 400 Japanese subjects, applying quantile regression and structural equation modeling to the data. First, the analysis identifies the importance of inquisitiveness in characterizing generativity in that people with high inquisitiveness tend to be generative. Second, people are identified to be happy as they have high generativity and inquisitiveness, demonstrating two influential roles of inquisitiveness as direct and indirect determinants through a mediator of generativity. Overall, the results suggest that inquisitiveness shall be a key element of people's happiness through intergenerational and intragenerational communications or relations."

India is no exception, where low rate of treatment seeking for hypertension coupled with widespread out-of-pocket payments (OOPs) have been a challenge. This study assessed the pattern of health care seeking behaviour and financial protection along with the associated factors among hypertensive individuals in rural West Bengal, India.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Birbhum district of the state of West Bengal, India, during 2017-2018, where 300 individuals were recruited randomly from a list of hypertensives in a population cohort. Healthcare seeking for hypertension and related financial protection in terms of-OOPs and expenses relative to monthly per-capita family expenditure, were analysed. Findings indicated that 47% of hypertensives were not on treatment. Among those under treatment, 80% preferred non-public facilities, and 91% of them had wide-spread OOPs. Cost of medication was a major share of expenses followed by transportation cost to access public health care facility. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated longer duration of disease (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.68, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.24-25.99) and health care seeking from non-public establishment (aOR: 34.33, CI: 4.82-244.68) were associated with more incident of OOPs. Linear regression with generalized linear model revealed presence of co-morbidities (adjusted coefficient (aCoeff)10.28, CI: 4.96,15.61) and poorer economic groups (aCoeffpoorest 11.27, CI 3.82,18.71; aCoefflower-middle 7.83, CI 0.65,15.00 and aCoeffupper-middle 7.25, CI: 0.80,13.70) had higher relative expenditure.This study suggests that individuals with hypertension had poor health care seeking behaviour, preferred non-public health facilities and had suboptimal financial protection. Economically poorer individuals had higher burden of health expenditure for treatment of hypertension, which indicated gaps in equitable health care delivery for the control of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W4214509007,"Background The purpose of a rapid response system (RRS) is to reduce the incidence of preventable cardiopulmonary arrests (CPAs) and patient deterioration in general wards. The objective of this study is to investigate the incidence and temporal trends of preventable CPAs and determine factors associated with preventable CPAs in a hospital with a mature RRS. Methods This was a single-center prospective cohort study of all CPAs occurring in the general ward between March 2017 and June 2020. The RRS operates from 07:00 to 23:00 on weekdays and from 07:00 to 12:00 on Saturdays. All CPAs were reviewed upon biweekly conference, and a panel of intensivists judged their preventability. Trends of preventable CPAs were analyzed using Poisson regression models and factors associated with preventable CPAs were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results There were 253 CPAs over 40 months, and 64 (25.3%) of these were preventable. The incidence rate of CPAs was 1.07 per 1000 admissions and that of preventable CPAs was 0.27 per 1000 admissions. The number of preventable CPAs decreased by 24% each year (incidence rate ratio = 0.76; p = 0.039) without a change in the total CPA incidence. The most common contributor to the preventability was delayed response from physicians (n = 41, 64.1%). A predictable CPA with a pre-alarm sign had increased odds in the occurrence of preventable CPAs, while a cardiac cause of CPAs and RRS operating hours had decreased odds in terms of occurrence of preventable CPA. Conclusion Our study showed that one-fourth of all CPAs occurring in the general wards were preventable, and these arrests decreased each year. A mature RRS can evolve to reduce preventable CPAs with regular self-evaluation. Efforts should be directed at improving physicians’ response time since a delay in their response was the most common cause of preventable CPAs."
https://openalex.org/W4214553538,"Triadin, a protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of striated muscles, anchors the calcium-storing protein calsequestrin to calcium release RyR channels at the junction with t-tubules, and modulates these channels by conformational effects. Triadin ablation induces structural SR changes and alters the expression of other proteins. Here we quantify alterations of calcium signaling in single skeletal myofibers of constitutive triadin-null mice. We find higher resting cytosolic and lower SR-luminal [Ca2+], 40% lower calsequestrin expression, and more CaV1.1, RyR1 and SERCA1. Despite the increased CaV1.1, the mobile intramembrane charge was reduced by ~20% in Triadin-null fibers. The initial peak of calcium release flux by pulse depolarization was minimally altered in the null fibers (revealing an increase in peak calcium permeability). The ""hump"" phase that followed, attributable to calcium detaching from calsequestrin, was 25% lower, a smaller change than expected from the reduced calsequestrin content and calcium saturation. The exponential decay rate of calcium transients was 25% higher, consistent with the higher SERCA1 content. Recovery of calcium flux after a depleting depolarization was faster in triadin-null myofibers, consistent with the increased uptake rate and lower SR calsequestrin content. In sum, the triadin knockout determines an increased RyR1 channel openness, which depletes the SR, a substantial loss of calsequestrin and gains in other couplon proteins. Powerful functional compensations ensue: activation of SOCE that increases [Ca2+]cyto; increased SERCA1 activity, which limits the decrease in [Ca2+]SR and a restoration of SR calcium storage of unknown substrate. Together, they effectively limit the functional loss in skeletal muscles."

This is considered acceptable in general but possible associations with cognitive function have not yet been studied.Sixty living kidney donors (LKD), who had donated between 2003 and 2012 at Hannover Medical School, underwent neurocognitive testing including attentional and memory testing. In a cross-sectional design results were compared with data of healthy controls (n = 40) and with norm data given in the respective test manuals adjusted for age, sex, and education.The median age of the LKD was 58 (range 39-70) years and the median time since donation was 7 (range 4-14) years. The LKD did not differ from controls in most of the cognitive test results and a composite attention test sum score. However, LKD did worse than controls in tests of working memory, parallel processing of stimuli, and sustained attention. No differences were found regarding quality of life. In LKD cognitive test results correlated significantly only with educational level but not with time since transplantation, eGFR, somatic comorbidity, quality of life and levels of fatigue, distress, depression, and anxiety.Our data show a fairly normal performance of LKD in most attentional and memory tests. However, our pilot study also suggests some cognitive impairment in attention tests in LKD which would need to be confirmed in longitudinal prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W4214587396,"Field tests to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) are an alternative to traditional exercise testing methods. Published field tests and their accompanying estimation equations account for up to 80% of the variance in VO2max with an error rate of ~4.5 ml.kg-1.min-1. These tests are limited to very specific age-range populations. The purpose of this study was to create and validate a series of easily administered walking and stepping field equations to predict VO2max across a range of healthy 18-79-year-old adults.One-hundred-fifty-seven adults completed a graded maximal exercise test to assess VO2max. Five separate walking and three separate stepping tests of varying durations, number of stages, and intensities were completed. VO2max estimation equations were created using hierarchal multiple regression. Covariates including age, sex, body mass, resting heart rate, distance walked, gait speed, stepping cadence, and recovery heart rate were entered into each model using a stepwise approach. Each full model created had the same base model consisting of age, sex, and body mass. Validity of each model was assessed using a Jackknife cross-validation analysis, and percent bias and root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated.Base models accounted for ~72% of the total variance of VO2max. Full model variance ranged from ~79-83% and bias was minimal (<±1.0%) across models. RMSE for all models were approximately 4.5 ml.kg-1.min-1. Stepping tests performed better than walking tests by explaining ~2.5% more of the variance and displayed smaller RMSE.All eight models accounted for a large percentage of VO2max variance (~81%) with a RMSE of ~4.5 ml.kg-1.min-1. The variance and level of error of models examined highlight good group mean prediction with greater error expected at the individual level. All the models perform similarly across a broad age range, highlighting flexibility in application of these tests to a more general population."

In a delay-discounting task, subjects made a series of intertemporal choices between smaller-sooner and larger-delayed rewards and were asked to listen to a voice recording verbalizing the information for payoff options. We manipulated the speech rate of the voice recordings and administered two treatment conditions: Slow and Fast. We did not find an overall treatment effect in the acoustic manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W4214640561,"This paper evaluates a study which aimed to enhance clinical care of young people with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (MD) and their families in two Canadian neuromuscular clinics. We report on how/why the study changed clinical practices in relation to the 'human' (e.g., emotional, social, existential, cultural) dimensions of living with MD.The intervention involved regular dialogical exchanges with clinicians across the two sites, during which direct observations of the clinics' care practices were discussed and changes were planned. We drew from realist evaluation approaches to assess changes in clinical care associated with the intervention. Data sources included dialogical exchanges; clinic observations; interviews with clients, families and clinicians; and team analysis sessions.Our evaluation suggests the clinical teams shifted their thinking and practices towards greater consideration of human aspects of living with MD including: more routinely attending to emotional, social and experiential dimensions of living with MD; reconceptualisation of risk; and considerations of affective aspects of clinical care. Not all clinicians changed their thinking and practices in the same ways, or to the same extent, and there were differences between the sites. These differences were likely due to numerous factors, including varying levels of clinician comfort with examining and shifting their own practices, and differing formal and informal clinic routines at each site.Overall, this intervention was able to shift clinic practices, and could feasibly be adapted across rehabilitation settings."
https://openalex.org/W4214767093,"The Promethee-GAIA method is a multicriteria decision support technique that defines the aggregated ranks of multiple criteria and visualizes them based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In the case of numerous criteria, the PCA biplot-based visualization do not perceive how a criterion influences the decision problem. The central question is how the Promethee-GAIA-based decision-making process can be improved to gain more interpretable results that reveal more characteristic inner relationships between the criteria. To improve the Promethee-GAIA method, we suggest three techniques that eliminate redundant criteria as well as clearly outline, which criterion belongs to which factor and explore the similarities between criteria. These methods are the following: A) Principal factoring with rotation and communality analysis (P-PFA), B) the integration of Sparse PCA into the Promethee II method (P-sPCA), and C) the Sum of Ranking Differences method (P-SRD). The suggested methods are presented through an I4.0+ dataset that measures the Industry 4.0 readiness of NUTS 2-classified regions. The proposed methods are useful tools for handling multicriteria ranking problems, if the number of criteria is numerous."
https://openalex.org/W4214480181,"The central symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is deficiency in social communication, which is generally viewed as being caused by pragmatic impairment (PI). PI is difficulty in using language appropriately in social situations. Studies have confirmed that PI is the result of neurological, cognitive, linguistic, and sensorimotor dysfunctions involving intricately intertwined factors. To elucidate the whole picture of this impairment, an approach from a multifaceted perspective fusing those factors is necessary. To this end, comprehensive PI mapping is a must, since no comprehensive mapping has yet been developed. The aim of this research is to present a model of annotation scheme development and corpus construction to efficiently visualize and quantify for statistical investigation occurrences of PI, which enables comprehensive mapping of PI in the spoken language of Japanese ASD individuals. We constructed system networks (lexicogrammatical option systems speakers make choices from) in the theoretical framework of Systemic Functional Linguistics, from which we developed an annotation scheme to comprehensively cover PI. Since system network covers all possible lexicogrammatical choices in linguistic interaction, it enables a comprehensive view of where and in what lexicogrammar PI occurs. Based on this annotation scheme, we successfully developed the Corpus of ASD + Typically Developed Spoken Language consisting of texts from 1,187 audiotaped tasks performed by 186 ASD and 106 typically developed subjects, accommodating approximately 1.07 million morphemes. Moreover, we were successful in the automatization of the annotation process by machine learning, accomplishing a 90 percent precision rate. We exemplified the mapping procedure with a focus on the spoken use of negotiating particles. Our model corpus is applicable to any language by incorporating our method of constructing the annotation scheme, and would give impetus to defining PI from a cross-linguistic point of view, which is needed because PI of ASD reflects cross-linguistic differences."
https://openalex.org/W4214534416,"Dream enactment behavior is one of the features of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. It might be a manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases and can lead to fall associated injuries. There is no evidence of dream enactment behavior and its associated factors in Ethiopia. Hence, this study targeted to pinpoint the predictors of dream enactment behavior among Medical students at the University of Gondar.The cross-sectional survey was carried out at the University of Gondar among Medical students selected by simple random sampling technique from Dec 2020 to Feb 2021. We used a structured pretested questionnaire to collect the data and dream enactment behavior was evaluated using rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder single question. Descriptive statistics were computed, and determinant factors were identified using binary logistic regression model. In the final model, explanatory variables with a p<0.05 were considered as predictors (statistically significant) of the dream enactment behavior. The strength of association was determined using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% CI.Four-hundred and twelve students took part in the study with 97.4% response rate. The mean age of participants was 20.82(±1.88) years and 291(70.63%) were males. The prevalence of dream enactment was 34.47% (95% CI: 30.02-39.20). Daytime sleepiness score (AOR = 1.104; 95% CI: 1.053-1.160), age (AOR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.019-1.290), monthly pocket money (AOR = 0.9991; 95% CI: 0.9985-0.9997), alcohol drink (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI: 1.076-6.846), and perceived stress (AOR = 3.854; 95% CI: 1.802-8.242) were statistically significant factors of dream enactment behavior.In this study, the magnitude of dream enactment behavior was high which was significantly associated with daytime sleepiness score, age, monthly pocket money, alcohol drink, and perceived stress all of which are modifiable except age. The University of Gondar has to plan a strategy to avert the condition via the prevention of the determinant factors. Students need to reduce stress and avoid alcohol drink. We strongly urge forthcoming scholars to ascertain association of dream enactment and academic performance of university students."
https://openalex.org/W4214618968,"Under the current universal trend towards larger grant sizes in research funding systems, we focus on how large of a grant size is appropriate. We study the directional returns to scale (RTS) to assess whether current grant sizes are the most productive. We take the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) as an example and select three samples of physics, geography and management for an empirical study. We find that the optimal input direction and the most productive grant size scale is different for the three disciplines; based on the current grant size, physics should not expand the grant size and team size input, geography should further increase the grant size to improve performance and management should further expand the team size rather than the grant size. In this paper, we demonstrate a new method to calculate the optimal direction, which is the lowest rate of congestion, according to the characteristics of the General Program. Based on these results, we also calculate the most productive scale size. This method has certain value for project management."
https://openalex.org/W4214621695,"In thrombin generation (TG) assays, regarded as global coagulation tests, contact activation is considered a major problem which can be eliminated by adding Corn Trypsin Inhibitor (CTI). In previous studies, however, venous thrombosis risk prediction using TG assays did not improve after CTI addition. However, it is unknown whether CTI addition could help to detect subtle but relevant nuances in determinants of TG, making the assay more suitable to detect disturbances in the coagulation system. This study's objective was to assess whether the addition of CTI is associated with a broader contribution of individual coagulation factors to the total amount of thrombin formed in Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) and Technoclone Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA). Thrombin generation was measured in 326 healthy individuals from THE VTE study at very low tissue factor concentrations, with and without addition of CTI prior to blood sampling. The influence of several coagulation factors on total amount of thrombin formed, i.e. area under the curve (AUC) or endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), was analysed using multiple linear regression with standardisation of all values resulting in Z-scores with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Association between coagulation factors and TG changed minimally after addition of CTI. Largest changes after CTI addition were found for following factors: for CAT: free protein S (from 0.00 (95%CI -0.12 to 0.12) to -0.29 (95%CI -0.43 to -0.15)) and protein S (from -0.05 (95%CI -0.18 to 0.08) to -0.21 (95%CI -0.37 to -0.05)); for TGA: antithrombin (from -0.11 (-0.23 to 0.02) to -0.19 (-0.30 to -0.07)), factor VIII (from 0.15 (0.03 to 0.27) to 0.24 (0.13 to 0.36)) and fibrinogen (from 0.12 (-0.01 to 0.26) to 0.19 (0.06 to 0.32)). In conclusion, there is no clear trend towards a broader contribution of coagulation factors in samples handled with CTI compared with those handled without CTI."
