https://openalex.org/W1616230851,"It was known previously that 1) the relA gene of Escherichia coli encodes an enzyme capable of guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) synthesis, 2) an uncharacterized source of ppGpp synthesis exists in relA null strains, and 3) cellular degradation of ppGpp is mainly due to a manganese-dependent ppGpp 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase encoded by the spoT gene. Here, the effects of spoT gene insertions and deletions are compared with analogous alterations in neighboring genes in the spo operon and found to be lethal in relA+ strains as well as slower growing in relAl backgrounds than delta relA hosts. Cells with null alleles in both the relA and spoT genes are found no longer to accumulate ppGpp after glucose exhaustion or after chelation of manganese ions by picolinic acid addition; the inability to form ppGpp is reversed by a minimal spoT gene on a multicopy plasmid. Strains apparently lacking ppGpp show a complex phenotype including auxotrophy for several amino acids and morphological alterations. We propose that the SpoT protein can either catalyze or control the alternative pathway of ppGpp synthesis in addition to its known role as a (p)ppGpp 3'-pyrophosphohydrolase. We favor the possibility that the SpoT protein is a bifunctional enzyme capable of catalyzing either ppGpp synthesis or degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2032914003,"Infant vocal babbling has been assumed to be a speech-based phenomenon that reflects the maturation of the articulatory apparatus responsible for spoken language production. Manual babbling has now been reported to occur in deaf children exposed to signed languages from birth. The similarities between manual and vocal babbling suggest that babbling is a product of an amodal, brain-based language capacity under maturational control, in which phonetic and syllabic units are produced by the infant as a first step toward building a mature linguistic system. Contrary to prevailing accounts of the neurological basis of babbling in language ontogeny, the speech modality is not critical in babbling. Rather, babbling is tied to the abstract linguistic structure of language and to an expressive capacity capable of processing different types of signals (signed or spoken)."
https://openalex.org/W2082890587,"The three-dimensional atomic structure of a single-stranded DNA virus has been determined. Infectious virions of canine parvovirus contain 60 protein subunits that are predominantly VP-2. The central structural motif of VP-2 has the same topology (an eight-stranded antiparallel beta barrel) as has been found in many other icosahedral viruses but represents only about one-third of the capsid protein. There is a 22 angstrom (A) long protrusion on the threefold axes, a 15 A deep canyon circulating about each of the five cylindrical structures at the fivefold axes, and a 15 A deep depression at the twofold axes. By analogy with rhinoviruses, the canyon may be the site of receptor attachment. Residues related to the antigenic properties of the virus are found on the threefold protrusions. Some of the amino termini of VP-2 run to the exterior in full but not empty virions, which is consistent with the observation that some VP-2 polypeptides in full particles can be cleaved by trypsin. Eleven nucleotides are seen in each of 60 symmetry-related pockets on the interior surface of the capsid and together account for 13 percent of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2037097116,"NEURONAL nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of a gene family of ligand-gated transmitter receptors that includes muscle nicotinic receptors, GABAA receptors and glycine receptors1–4. Several lines of evidence indicate that neuronal nicotinic receptors can be made up of only two subunits, an alpha (α) subunit which binds ligand, and a non-alpha (nα) or beta (β) subunit5–13. The stoichiometry of each subunit in the functional receptor has been difficult to assess, however. Estimates of the molecular weight of neuronal nicotonic receptor macromolecules suggest that these receptors contain at least four subunits but probably not more than five5,12. We have examined the subunit stoichiometry of the chick neuronal α4/nα1, receptor7,9 by first using site-directed mutagenesis to create subunits that confer different single channel properties on the receptor. Co-injection with wild-type and mutant subunits led to the appearance of receptors with wild-type, mutant and hybrid conductances. From the number of hybrid conductances, we could deduce the number of each subunit in the functional receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1583483795,"The effect of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5), human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2), fibroblasts (Balb/3T3), and neuroblastoma cells (NB2A) has been studied. The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells was inhibited by physiologically relevant concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, neuroblastoma cells were only sensitive to higher alpha-tocopherol concentrations, and proliferation of the other cell lines was not inhibited. The inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation was specific for alpha-tocopherol. Trolox, phytol, and alpha-tocopherol esters had no effect. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor or endothelin was completely sensitive to alpha-tocopherol. If smooth muscle cells were stimulated by fetal calf serum, proliferation was 50% inhibited by alpha-tocopherol. No effect of alpha-tocopherol was observed when proliferation of smooth muscle cells was stimulated by bombesin and lysophosphatidic acid. The possibility of an involvement of protein kinase C in the cell response to alpha-tocopherol was suggested by experiments with the isolated enzyme and supported by the 2- to 3-fold stimulation of phorbol ester binding induced by alpha-tocopherol in sensitive cells. Moreover, alpha-tocopherol also caused inhibition of protein kinase C translocation induced by phorbol esters and inhibition of the phosphorylation of its 80-kDa protein substrate in smooth muscle cells. A model is discussed by which alpha-tocopherol inhibits cell proliferation by interacting with the cytosolic protein kinase C, thus preventing its membrane translocation and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2054712073,"Larval development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by the activities of four classes of chemosensory neurons. The choice between normal development and development into a specialized larval form called a dauer larva is regulated by competing environmental stimuli: food and a dauer pheromone. When the neuron classes ADF, ASG, ASI, and ASJ are killed, animals develop as dauer larvae regardless of environmental conditions. These neurons might sense food or dauer pheromone, or both, to initiate the specialized differentiation of many cell types that occurs during dauer formation. Entry into and exit from the dauer stage are primarily controlled by different chemosensory neurons. The analysis of mutants defective in dauer formation indicates that the chemosensory neurons are active in the absence of sensory inputs and that dauer pheromone inhibits the ability of these neurons to generate a signal necessary for normal development."

https://openalex.org/W1984151930,"Area V4 is a part of the primate visual cortex. Its role in vision has been extensively debated. Inferences about the functions of this area have now been made by examination of a broad range of visual capacities after ablation of V4 in rhesus monkeys. The results obtained suggest that this area is involved in more complex aspects of visual information processing than had previously been suggested. Monkeys had particularly severe deficits in situations where the task was to select target stimuli that had a lower contrast, smaller size, or slower rate of motion than the array of comparison stimuli from which they had to be discriminated. Extensive training on each specific task resulted in improved performance. However, after V4 ablation, the monkeys could not generalize the specific task to new stimulus configurations and to new spatial locations."

https://openalex.org/W2139424308,"Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) were obtained from a 550-kilobase region that contains three probes previously mapped as very close to the locus of the fragile X syndrome. These YACs spanned the fragile site in Xq27.3 as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization. An internal 200-kilobase segment contained four chromosomal breakpoints generated by induction of fragile X expression. A single CpG island was identified in the cloned region between markers DXS463 and DXS465 that appears methylated in mentally retarded fragile X males, but not in nonexpressing male carriers of the mutation nor in normal males. This CpG island may indicate the presence of a gene involved in the clinical phenotype of the syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1600598432,"Determinants of methotrexate (MTX) resistance in cell lines resistant to short, but not continuous, MTX exposure were investigated since such lines may have relevance to clinical resistance. CCRF-CEM R30dm (R30dm), cloned from CCRF-CEM R30/6 (a MTX-resistant subline of the CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell line), had growth characteristics similar to CCRF-CEM. R30dm was resistant to a 24-h exposure to levels as high as 300 microM MTX but was as sensitive as CCRF-CEM to continuous MTX exposure. MTX resistance of R30dm was stable for greater than 68 weeks in the absence of selective pressure. Initial velocities of MTX transport were comparable for R30dm and CCRF-CEM, as were dihydrofolate reductase specific activity and MTX binding. A 2-fold thymidylate synthase activity decrease for R30dm from that of CCRF-CEM was not a significant factor in R30dm MTX resistance. Decreased MTX poly(gamma-glutamate) synthesis resulted in lower levels of drug accumulation by R30dm. Decreased polyglutamylation was attributable to folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity in R30dm extracts which was 1, 2, and less than or equal to 10% of CCRF-CEM extracts with the substrates MTX, aminopterin, and naturally occurring folates, respectively. Comparison of cell lines with varying levels of resistance to short term MTX exposure indicated that the extent of MTX resistance was proportional to the reduction of FPGS activity. The evidence supported decreased FPGS activity as the mechanism of resistance to short MTX exposure in the cell lines investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1962281270,"We describe here the purification and characterization of a recently identified adherens junction protein that has an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Beckerle, M. C. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 1679-1687). The 82-kDa protein was isolated from avian smooth muscle by a low ionic strength alkaline pH extraction followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation. Sequential chromatographic separation using DEAE-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and hydroxylapatite resins results in a purified 82-kDa protein. The 82-kDa protein has a Stokes radius of 5.6 nm and a relative sedimentation coefficient of 3.0 S. The calculated native molecular mass of the protein based on its hydrodynamic properties is 69 kDa, and the derived frictional ratio (f/fo) is 2.1. The protein does not focus discretely by isoelectric-focusing-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; there are numerous isoelectric point variants in the range of 6.4-7.2, with the average isoelectric point being 6.9. The 82-kDa protein is phosphorylated in vivo and appears to be a cytoplasmic component of adherens junctions. The properties of the 82-kDa protein distinguish it from other known adherens junction proteins of this molecular mass. In fibroblasts, the 82-kDa protein is found in adhesion plaques as well as along actin-containing stress fibers near where they terminate at sites of cell-substratum adhesion. It is also found in the cell-cell adherens junctions of pigmented retinal epithelial cells and the dense plaques of smooth muscle cells. Since the 82-kDa protein is found at both cell-substratum and cell-cell adherens junctions, we propose to call it zyxin, meaning a joining, to indicate that it is found at regions where extracellular ligands are structurally and functionally joined to the cytoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W1988734689,"A cellular DNA binding protein, LBP-1, sequentially interacts in a concentration-dependent manner with two sites that surround the transcriptional initiation site of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter. Although sequences in the downstream site (site I) were found to enhance transcription, purified LBP-1 specifically repressed transcription in vitro by binding to the upstream site (site II), which overlaps the TATA element. The binding of human TATA binding factor (TFIID) to the promoter before LBP-1 blocked repression, suggesting that repression resulted from an inhibition of TFIID binding to the TATA element. Furthermore, mutations that eliminated binding to site II both prevented repression in vitro and increased HIV-1 transcription in stably transformed cells. These findings suggest that a cellular factor regulates HIV-1 transcription in a manner that is characteristic of bacterial repressors and that this factor could be important in HIV-1 latency."
https://openalex.org/W1653824949,"Previous work demonstrated that the ligand binding domain (LBD) was required to determine the formation of the cytosolic, untransformed, inactive, 8 S, heterooligomeric form of the human glucocorticosteroid receptor (hGR) which includes the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) (Pratt, W.B., Jolly, D.J., Pratt, D.V., Hollenberg, S.M., Giguere, V., Cadepond, F.M., Schweizer-Groyer, G., Catelli, M.G., Evans, R.M., and Baulieu, E.E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 267-273). Truncations of hGR deleting all or almost all of the LBD give GR derivatives in the non-hsp90-interacting 4 S form able to stimulate transcription in a hormone-independent manner. To identify the LBD subregion(s) involved in 8 S formation, we analyzed the sedimentation behavior of hGR mutants with various LBD internal deletions and/or truncations transiently expressed in cells that contain hsp90 but very low levels of endogenous GR, and we correlated the results with their transcriptional activity. LBD has been divided into three subregions: two of them, LBD1 (between amino acids 551 and 626) and LBD2 (between amino acids 627 and 696), include amino acid sequences highly conserved in the steroid receptor superfamily, and LBD3 consists of the carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule (amino acids 697-777). Each of these subregions can be deleted without impeding 8 S heterooligomer formation, and the corresponding receptors do not have transcriptional activity in the absence as well as in the presence of hormone. When linked to hGR mutants truncated after amino acids 532 or 550, each subregion does separately promote 8 S heterooligomeric complex formation and repress the intrinsic constitutive transcriptional activity of the truncated receptors. These 8 S complexes contain hsp90. In a control experiment, the linkage of 1,017 amino acids of beta-galactosidase to the carboxyl-terminal of 1-532 hGR gave a hybrid receptor still constitutively transcriptionally active which did not bind hsp90. These results provide evidence that there is a strong correlation between the association with hsp90 and the loss of GR functional properties and that hsp90 may play a critical role in maintaining the receptor in a nonfunctional state."
https://openalex.org/W1602679104,"Escherichia coli has two enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), designated ppGpp synthetase I (PSI = RelA) and II (PSII), whose activities are regulated differently. Until now, the gene for PSII had not been identified. Here, an E. coli relA1 strain that expresses lacZ from an rrnB P1 promoter was used to screen mutants with increased beta-galactosidase activity on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl beta-D-galactoside indicator plates at 30 degrees C. About 15% of the mutants obtained in this manner had reduced levels of ppGpp at 30 degrees C and no detectable ppGpp at 43 degrees C. These mutants did not form colonies at 42 degrees C on minimal medium plates and had elevated ribosome concentrations and higher growth rates at 30 degrees C. Genetic mapping by phage P1 transduction and complementation analyses showed that the mutations were located in spoT and that they were recessive. Specific inhibition of SpoT-dependent ppGpp degradation activity with picolinic acid showed that two of the mutants tested were deficient in ppGpp synthesis activity. These results indicate that spoT is required for PSII activity, suggesting that spoT encodes both ppGpp degradation and synthesis activities and that these two functions can be affected independently by mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1524668721,"Conditions have been identified which permit metabolic formation of the third oxidized intermediate in the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase reaction cascade. Metabolism of either the immediate precursor substrate 3 beta-hydroxylanost-8-en-32-al or lanost-8-ene-3 beta,32-diol under mixed function oxidase conditions affords formation of the intermediate. It must be emphasized that the intermediate can only be detected if saponification procedures are omitted during sterol isolation. Comparative chemical and biochemical studies of the isolated metabolite with 3 beta,15 alpha-dihydroxylanost-8-en-32-al reveal that the metabolite is not the 15 alpha-hydroxylanosterol aldehyde, a putative demethylase intermediate. The metabolite is efficiently converted to the demethylated delta 8,14-diene sterol in the absence of molecular oxygen or NADPH, thus supporting its identity as the final oxidized intermediate in the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase cascade. 1H NMR analysis shows a proton resonance at 7.86 ppm consistent with a formyloxy proton. Mass spectral and infrared analysis of the metabolite clearly establish oxygen insertion into the immediate precursor substrate, 3 beta-hydroxylanost-8-en-32-al. Collectively, the biochemical and chemical characteristics of the metabolite support a structural assignment for the metabolite as 14 alpha-formyloxy-lanost-8-en-3 beta-ol."
https://openalex.org/W1769141315,"Heat-stable enterotoxins are a family of toxin peptides that are produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and consist of 18 and 19 amino acid residues (Aimoto, S., Takao, T., Shimonishi, Y., Hara, S., Takeda, T., Takeda, Y., and Miwatani, T. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 129, 257-263). A synthetic fully toxic analog of the enterotoxin, Mpr5-STp(5-17), where Mpr is beta-mercaptopropionic acid and which consists of 13 amino acid residues from Cys5 to Cys17 in a heat-stable enterotoxin but is deaminated at its N terminus (Kubota, H., Hidaka, Y., Ozaki, H., Ito, H., Hirayama, T., Takeda, Y., and Shimonishi, Y.

Commun. 161, 229-235), has been crystalized from water, and its crystal structure has been solved by a direct method and refined by least square procedures to give an R factor of 0.089. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell constants a = 21.010 (2) A, b = 27.621 (4) A, and c = 12.781 (1) A. The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains one peptide molecule with 13 water molecules. A right-hand spiral peptide backbone extends throughout the molecule. Three beta-turns are located along this spiral and fixed tightly by three intramolecular disulfide linkages. The actual structure predicts the biniding region on the enterotoxin to the receptor protein on the membrane of rat intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1520754068,"Muscarinic receptor-induced changes in the activities of phospholipase D (PLD) and of phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) were investigated in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with, and stably expressing, the human m1, m2, m3, and m4 mAChR subtypes, respectively. PLD and PI-PLC activities in these four transfected cell lines as well as in nontransfected cells were measured by the formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol [( 3H]PEt) and [3H]inositol phosphates [( 3H]IP) after labeling cellular phospholipids with [3H]oleic acid and [3H]inositol. The muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol had no significant effects on [3H]PEt and [3H]IP formation in nontransfected HEK cells. In cells expressing the m1 or m3 receptors carbachol (1 mM; in the presence of 400 mM ethanol and 10 mM lithium chloride) caused the formation of [3H]PEt of about 12,000 cpm/mg protein (basal PEt formation was not measurable) and increased [3H]IP formation by 20,000-30,000 cpm/mg (a 7-10-fold increase over basal levels). The EC50 values (0.3-1.5 microM) were similar for both effects and both mAChR subtypes. In contrast, in cells expressing m2 or m4 receptor subtypes the magnitude of [3H]PEt (about 4,000 cpm/mg protein) or [3H]IP (3,000-4,000 cpm/mg) formation was much smaller and the EC50 values (20-40 microM) much higher than for the m1 and m3 receptors. Neomycin (1 mM) inhibited the m1 and m3 receptor-mediated production of IP by 50%, whereas the PEt formation was attenuated by 20% in the same cells. We conclude that activation of all of the four mAChR subtypes, although with different efficiencies, can stimulate PLD. The m1 and m3 receptor-mediated stimulation of the PLD may be at least partially independent of the PI-PLC stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1551196064,"The conversion of dopachrome to dihydroxyindole(s), a key reaction in eumelanin biosynthetic pathway, has been shown to be under the control of dopachrome conversion factor. Dopachrome conversion factor isolated from the hemolymph of Manduca sexta larvae, which is devoid of any tyrosinase activity, exhibits a narrow substrate specificity and readily bleaches the iminochromes derived from the oxidation of L-dopa, L-dopa methyl ester, and alpha-methyl-L-dopa, but failed to attack the corresponding D-isomers. The product formed in the case of L-dopachrome was identified to be 5,6-dihydroxyindole. Therefore, aromatization of dopachrome seems to accompany its decarboxylation as well. However, the enzyme also converts L-dopachrome methyl ester to an indole derivative indicating that it can deprotonate the alpha-hydrogen when the carboxyl group is blocked. These results are accounted for by the transient formation and further transformation of a reactive quinone methide intermediate during the dopachrome conversion factor-catalyzed reaction. The fact that the enzyme-catalyzed conversion of alpha-methyl dopachrome methyl ester (where both decarboxylation and deprotonation are blocked) resulted in the generation of a stable quinone methide in the reaction mixture confirms this contention and supports our recent proposal that quinone methide and not indolenine is the key transient intermediate in the conversion of dopachrome to dihydroxyindole observed during melanogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1584962124,"The endoplasmic reticulum is a major site of localization for eukaryotic cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase complexes. Previous studies have shown that the microsomal forms of P-450 insert into the membrane via their hydrophobic amino terminus through the signal recognition particle-dependent pathway. We have examined the insertion of bovine 17 alpha-hydroxylase (P45017 alpha) into the endoplasmic reticulum of COS 1 cells to evaluate the functional role of its hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence and membrane insertion. An NH2-terminal truncated protein, P450 delta 2-17, which lacked amino acids 2-17 was expressed in COS 1 cells, subcellular fractions were isolated, and P450 delta 2-17 was localized by immunoblot analysis. Compared to the full-length P45017 alpha, the NH2-terminal truncation resulted in a 2.5-fold decrease in P45017 alpha protein recovered with the microsomal fraction, 50% of which was an integral membrane protein as defined by resistance to Na2CO3 extraction. Despite correct membrane localization, P450 delta 2-17 was not a functional enzyme in COS 1 cells. A CO difference spectrum of microsomes containing P450 delta 2-17 did not give a typical 450 nm absorbance. We conclude that the hydrophobic amino terminus is required for the expression of a functionally competent P45017 alpha in COS 1 cells and suggest that the insertion of the amino terminus into the membrane is necessary for the folding of this protein into its correct structural form."
https://openalex.org/W1601010313,"The apparent active site of human leukocyte glycoasparaginase (N4-(beta-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparaginase EC 3.5.1.26) has been studied by labeling with an asparagine analogue, 5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline. Glycoasparaginase was purified 4,600-fold from human leukocytes with an overall recovery of 12%. The purified enzyme has a Km of 110 microM, a Vmax of 34 mumol x l-1 x min-1, and a specific activity of 2.2 units/mg protein with N4-(beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparagine as substrate. The carbohydrate content of the enzyme is 15%, and it exhibits a broad pH maximum between 7 and 9. The 88-kDa native enzyme is composed of 19-kDa light (L) chains and 25-kDa heavy (H) chains and it has a heterotetrameric structure of L2H2-type. The glycoasparaginase activity decreases rapidly and irreversibly in the presence of 5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline. At any one concentration of the compound, the inactivation of the enzyme is pseudo-first-order with time. The inhibitory constant, K1, is 80 microM and the second-order rate constant 1.25 x 10(3) M-1 min-1 at pH 7.5. The enzyme activity is competitively protected against this inactivation by its natural substrate, aspartylglucosamine, indicating that this inhibitor binds to the active site or very close to it. The covalent incorporation of [5-14C]diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline paralleled the loss of the enzymatic activity and one inhibitor binding site was localized to each L-subunit of the heterotetrameric enzyme. Four peptides with the radioactive label were generated, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and sequenced by Edman degradation. The sequences were overlapping and all contained the amino-terminal tripeptide of the L-chain. By mass spectrometry, the reacting group of 5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline was characterized as 4-oxo-L-norvaline that was bound through an alpha-ketone ether linkage to the hydroxyl group of the amino-terminal amino acid threonine."
https://openalex.org/W1583131770,"Subunits of gizzard smooth muscle tropomyosin, dissociated by guanidinium chloride and reassociated by high salt dialysis, form a 1:1 mixture of the beta beta and gamma gamma homodimers (Graceffa, P. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1282-1287). The homodimers have now been separated by anion-exchange chromatography and native gel electrophoresis, enabling us to show that the native protein is composed of more than 90% heterodimer. The in vitro equilibrium distribution of heterodimer and homodimers, at close to physiological temperature and ionic conditions, was calculated from thermal unfolding profiles of separated homodimers and heterodimer, as monitored by circular dichroism. The results, for an equal proportion of beta and gamma chains, indicate a predominant formation of heterodimer via chain dissociation and chain exchange, although the proportion of heterodimer was much less than the 90-100% found in the native protein. However, the proportion of heterodimer for actin-bound tropomyosin, determined by analyzing tropomyosin sedimented with actin, was greater than 90%, which may provide a model for assembly in vivo. The end-to-end interactions of the homodimers are about the same but are much less than that of the native heterodimer, as determined by viscometry. The greater end-to-end interaction of heterodimers may lead to stronger binding to actin compared to homodimers and thus would further shift the equilibrium between heterodimer and homodimers toward heterodimer and possibly account for the almost exclusive population of heterodimer in the presence of actin. The greater end-to-end interaction of the heterodimer may also provide a functional advantage for its preferred assembly. This study also shows that the two-step thermal unfolding of the homodimer mixture is due to the formation of heterodimer via an intermediate which is a new type of tropomyosin species which forms a gel in low salt. This tropomyosin is also present in small amounts in native tropomyosin preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1558749218,"Chondrogenesis, the differentiation of mesenchyme into cartilage, results in a change in composition of the extracellular matrix. The cartilage matrix contains several unique components, including type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; it also contains fibronectin, a glycoprotein that mediates the interaction of cells with their matrix. We show that chick cartilage fibronectin mRNA contains an unusual pattern of alternatively spliced exons. Specifically, it contains exon IIIB but does not contain exon IIIA whereas fibronectin mRNA from mesenchyme contains both exons IIIB and IIIA. Thus the splicing pattern of the fibronectin mRNA must change from B+A+ to B+A- during chondrogenesis. Most fibronectin mRNA in other mesenchymal tissues contains exon IIIA but little exon IIIB (B-A+). Culturing of chondrocytes (cartilage-producing cells) results in loss of exon IIIB from fibronectin mRNA (B-A-). Manipulation of culture conditions to produce more adhesive chondrocytes (treatment with hyaluronidase, transformation with Rous sarcoma virus, and treatment with retinoic acid) increases the amount of fibronectin mRNA containing exon IIIA. These results suggest that exon IIIB may mediate the interactions of chondrocytes with the unique components of the cartilage matrix and exon IIIA may play a role in chondrocyte adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1562909948,"Feedback inhibition of the regulatory enzyme threonine deaminase by isoleucine provides an important level of enzymic control over branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Cloning ilvA, the structural gene for threonine deaminase, under control of the trc promoter results in expression of active enzyme upon induction by isopropyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactoside to levels of approximately 20% of the soluble protein in cell extracts. High level expression of threonine deaminase has facilitated the development of a rapid and efficient protocol for the purification of gram quantities of enzyme with a specific activity 3-fold greater than previous preparations. The catalytic activity of threonine deaminase is absolutely dependent on the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, and the tetrameric molecule is isolated containing 1 mol of cofactor/56,000-Da chain. Wild-type threonine deaminase demonstrates a sigmoidal dependence of initial velocity on threonine concentration in the absence of isoleucine, consistent with a substrate-promoted conversion of the enzyme from a low activity to a high activity conformation. The enzymic dehydration of threonine to alpha-ketobutyrate measured by steady-state kinetics, performed at 20 degrees C in 0.05 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, is described by a Hill coefficient, nH, of 2.3 and a K0.5 of 8.0 mM. The negative allosteric effector L-isoleucine strongly inhibits the enzyme, yielding a value for nH of 3.9 and K0.5 of 74 mM whereas enzyme activity is greatly increased by L-valine, which yields nearly hyperbolic kinetics characterized by a value for nH of 1.0 and a K0.5 of 5.7 mM. Thus, these effectors promote dramatic and opposing effects on the transition from the low activity to the high activity conformation of the tetrameric enzyme."

The sites at which these monoclonals bind the apoB polypeptide sequence had already been established. The angular distances between all possible pairs of binding sites except one allowed the relative placement of six epitopes on the LDL sphere. We conclude that apoB extends over at least a hemisphere of the LDL surface since four epitopes are located in the Northern Hemisphere at sites arbitrarily designated as the North Pole, the Aleutian Islands, Bogota, and in the Atlantic Ocean, while two are found in the Southern Hemisphere at Buenos Aires and at Madagascar. ApoB appears to possess a restricted flexibility, since these relative epitope locations show a substantial standard deviation in latitude and longitude. Mapping of additional epitopes may provide an answer to the question of whether apoB circumnavigates the LDL sphere."
https://openalex.org/W1555972800,"We previously identified a cluster of hematopoietic serine protease genes on chromosome 14 at band q11.2. This cluster contains the cathepsin G gene and the two related cathepsin G-like genes CGL-1 and CGL-2. The CGL-1 gene is identical with the cytotoxic T cell serine protease CSP-B (also called SECT, and in mice, CCP1, granzyme B, or CTLA-1). In this report, we determined that CGL-2 is identical with a recently described gene called h-CCPX. The coding sequences of CG, CGL-1, and CGL-2 are 65-75% identical at the DNA level. The intervening sequences are much less conserved, except for introns 3 of the CGL-1 and CGL-2 genes, which are 93% identical. Each of the genes has the same overall organization, with 5 exons and 4 introns, very short 5' untranslated regions, and identical splice phases for all of the introns. Cathepsin G is expressed at high levels in promyelocytes/promonocytes, and CGL-1/CSP-B is expressed at high levels in activated cytolytic T cells, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK), and natural killer (NK) cells. CGL-2/h-CCPX is expressed at much lower levels in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes, LAK and NK cells. To begin to define the regulatory elements that target expression of each of these genes to their specific lineages at specific times, the 5' flanking region of each gene was sequenced. The 5' flanking regions are minimally related and have few conserved consensus elements. Further experiments will be required to determine the critical cis-acting regulatory sequences required for tissue- and development-specific expression of each of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W1525291339,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, ERp59), ERp72, and ERp61 are luminal proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are characterized by the presence of sequences corresponding to the active site regions of PDI. Each one of these proteins possesses a different COOH-terminal tetrapeptide ER retention signal. In order to investigate what other tetrapeptide sequences could serve as retention signals and to determine to what extent the function of the retention signal is modulated by the protein carrying the signal, we have constructed a set of mutants of two of these resident ER proteins, PDI and ERp72. In each of these proteins, the wild type tetrapeptide sequences were replaced by each member of the set of the 12 possible combinations consisting of (K,R,Q)-(D,E)-(D,E)-L. Analysis of the efficiency of retention of the variant proteins when each was transiently expressed in COS cells showed that the retention efficiencies vary with both the COOH-terminal sequence and with the protein that carries this sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1534265657,"Pure L-threonine dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli is a tetrameric protein (Mr = 148,000) with 6 half-cystine residues/subunit; its catalytic activity as isolated is stimulated 5-10-fold by added Mn2+ or Cd2+. The peptide containing the 1 cysteine/subunit which reacts selectively with iodoacetate, causing complete loss of enzymatic activity, has been isolated and sequenced; this cysteine residue occupies position 38. Neutron activation and atomic absorption analyses of threonine dehydrogenase as isolated in homogeneous form now show that it contains 1 mol of Zn2+/mol of enzyme subunit. Removal of the Zn2+ with 1,10-phenanthroline demonstrates a good correlation between the remaining enzymatic activity and the zinc content. Complete removal of the Zn2+ yields an unstable protein, but the native metal ion can be exchanged by either 65Zn2+, Co2+, or Cd2+ with no change in specific catalytic activity. Mn2+ added to and incubated with the native enzyme, the 65Zn2(+)-, the Co2(+)-, or the Cd2(+)- substituted form of the enzyme stimulates dehydrogenase activity to the same extent. These studies along with previously observed structural homologies further establish threonine dehydrogenase of E. coli as a member of the zinc-containing long chain alcohol/polyol dehydrogenases; it is unique among these enzymes in that its activity is stimulated by Mn2+ or Cd2+."
https://openalex.org/W1525127751,"We have analyzed quantitatively the influence of distal promoter elements on steroid-responsive gene expression in vitro. Functional synergism between enhancer and distal promoter elements was examined using two model promoters, one containing a natural promoter (mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat) and one constructed artificially. Human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expressed in baculovirus induces transcription from a mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-containing DNA template. Transcription is diminished by oligonucleotides containing a nuclear factor 1 (NF-1)-binding site or a glucocorticoid/progesterone response element. Quantitative analysis indicates that NF-1 and GR act synergistically during transcriptional activation. In contrast, efficient activation by GR or purified chick progesterone receptor of a glucocorticoid/progesterone response element-linked ovalbumin promoter does not require interaction with the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP) element in the distal promoter. Lack of synergism is not related to enhancer strength, since the glucocorticoid/progesterone response elements can be moved further from the promoter or reduced to a single copy response element without increasing the dependence upon COUP. Strong synergism is restored following substitution of an NF-1 distal promoter element for the COUP element in this construct. Our results suggest that synergism between steroid response and distal promoter elements is dependent upon the identity of the promoter element rather than upon the inherent strength of the enhancer element."
https://openalex.org/W1493653180,"Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) were purified from the kidneys of female and male rats and characterized by primary structure and histological distribution in the kidney. Two FABPs (14 and 15.5 kDa) were found in male rat kidney cytosol whereas only 14-kDa FABP could be recognized in female rat kidneys throughout the purification steps. The amino acid sequence of the 14-kDa FABP was identical to that of rat heart FABP deduced from the cDNA sequence (Heuckeroth, R. O., Birkenmeier, E. H., Levin, M. S., and Gordon, J. I. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9709-9717). Structural analysis of the male-specific 15.5-kDa FABP identified this second FABP as a proteolytically modified form of alpha 2u-globulin, an 18.7-kDa major urinary protein of adult male rats (Unterman, R. D., Lynch, K. R., Nakhasi, H. L., dolan, K. P., Hamilton, J. W., Cohn, D. V., and Feigelson, P. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 3478-3482) which shares a common ancestry with a number of hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins such as serum retinol-binding proteins. Immunohistochemical investigation disclosed that heart-type FABP (14-kDa FABP) is localized in the cytoplasm of the epithelia of the distal tubules in both male and female rat kidneys whereas 15.5-kDa FABP immunostaining was observed predominantly in the endosomes or lysosomes of proximal tubules in male rat kidneys. These results suggest strongly the functional divergence of two FABPs in the rat kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1552788236,"In aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), His143 is located within a hydrogen-bonding distance to Asp222 that forms a strong ion pair with the ring nitrogen of the coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) or pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). His143 of Escherichia coli AspAT was replaced by Ala or Asn. The mutant enzyme H143A showed a slight increase in the maximum velocity of the overall transamination reaction between aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate, while H143N AspAT showed a decrease to 60% in the maximum rate of the overall reactions in both directions. In all of the half-transamination reactions with four substrates, aspartate, glutamate, oxalacetate, and 2-oxoglutarate, the catalytic competence as defined by kmax/Kd decreased by 3-18-fold upon replacing His143 by either Ala or Asn. The extent of the decrease varied from one substrate to another; it was largely contributed to by the decrease in affinities for all substrates. The equilibrium constants, [PMP-form] [keto acid]/[( PLP-form] [amino acid]), decreased by over 10-fold upon the mutations at position 143. Both H143A and H143N AspATs exhibited a considerably decreased affinity for 2-methylaspartate, an external-aldimine-forming substrate analogue, yet without appreciable alteration in the affinity for succinate and glutarate, which are non-aldimine-forming analogues. All these findings suggest that, although His143 is not essential for catalysis, it might assist the formation of enzyme-substrate complex."
https://openalex.org/W1561460958,"Hypoosmotic stress is a potent inducer of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in a variety of mammalian cells, but the physiological relevance of this response has not been determined. To test whether an increased putrescine content confers a growth advantage at lower osmolarities, we compared the ability of L1210 mouse leukemia cells and of ODC-overproducing variants obtained from this cell line (D-R cells) to proliferate after a hypotonic shock (325----130 mosmol/kg). The growth rate of D-R cells at 130 mosmol/kg was greater than or equal to 5-fold higher than in L1210 cells; and unlike the ODC-overproducing strain, L1210 cells underwent up to a 90% loss of viability over time as seen after restoration of normosmotic growth conditions and by trypan blue exclusion tests. The addition of putrescine or L-ornithine stimulated the proliferation of both cell sublines up to 5-fold in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal effect observed at about 10 and 100 microM, respectively. Putrescine restored virtually normal growth rates in both sublines at osmolarities as low as 190 mosmol/kg. No other alpha,omega-diamine was active in that respect whereas spermidine was markedly inhibitory. Furthermore, D-R cells incubated at 130 mosmol/kg showed a marked growth inhibition by 1-aminooxy-3-aminopropane (potent ODC inhibitor to which they are resistant in isotonic media) as a result of putrescine but not spermidine depletion. Whereas ODC was strongly and rapidly induced by hypotonic shock there was a precipitous decline in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity. Putrescine synthesis and accumulation were nevertheless reduced in D-R cells incubated at 130 mosmol/kg because of a decreased availability of L-ornithine. When either putrescine or L-ornithine was added to hypotonic media, D-R cells accumulated putrescine massively for extended periods together with a reduction in spermidine and spermine contents. Putrescine transport patterns were altered by hypotonic shock, net excretion of the diamine being reduced by about 80%, with a concurrent enlargement of the intracellular pool. Finally, parental L1210 cells incubated with an irreversible inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase for 24 h until hypotonic shock and supplemented with putrescine in the presence of the drug thereafter exhibited a greatly exaggerated growth stimulation by the diamine. These results demonstrate an essential role for an early increase in putrescine content in the growth adaptation of a mammalian cell line to a lower osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W2170991412,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic hematopoietic growth factor that induces both growth and differentiation of tissue macrophages. The subcellular mechanism of action of GM-CSF is unknown. We have examined the effect of GM-CSF on the immediate early response gene, Egr-1, in murine peritoneal macrophages. Our data demonstrate that recombinant GM-CSF (25 units/ml) produces a 12-fold increase in Egr-1 mRNA within 30 min. Pretreatment with cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) had no effect on the ability of GM-CSF to increase Egr-1 mRNA. In nuclear runoff studies, GM-CSF increased the transcription rate of Egr-1 by 10-fold at 10 min. The maximal effect on Egr-1 transcription occurred at 25 min (13-fold) and decreased by 45 min. The half-life of Egr-1 mRNA in GM-CSF-treated macrophages is 13-21 min. We were unable to calculate the half-life in control cells, however, because of the short half-life and low level of constitutive expression of Egr-1 mRNA. Endogenous protein kinase C activity in macrophages was depleted by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24 h. GM-CSF increased Egr-1 mRNA in protein kinase C-depleted macrophages, whereas the stimulatory effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on Egr-1 was blocked. These data show that GM-CSF rapidly increases transcription of Egr-1 mRNA. The effect of GM-CSF on Egr-1 mRNA does not require de novo protein synthesis or protein kinase C. These findings provide a basis for investigating the molecular mechanism of action of GM-CSF in tissue macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1586379857,"In higher plants, the chloroplastic protein plastocyanin is synthesized as a transit peptide-containing precursor by cytosolic ribosomes and posttranslationally transported to the thylakoid lumen. En route to the lumen, a plastocyanin precursor is first imported into chloroplasts and then further directed across the thylakoid membrane by a second distinct transport event. A partially processed form of plastocyanin is observed in the stroma during import experiments using intact chloroplasts and has been proposed to be the translocation substrate for the second step (Smeekens, S., Bauerle, C., Hageman, J., Keegstra, K., and Weisbeek, P. (1986) Cell 46, 365-375). To further characterize this second step, we have reconstituted thylakoid transport in a system containing in vitro-synthesized precursor proteins and isolated thylakoid membranes. This system was specific for lumenal proteins since stromal proteins lacking the appropriate targeting information did not accumulate in the thylakoid lumen. Plastocyanin precursor was taken up by isolated thylakoids, proteolytically processed to mature size, and converted to holo form. Translocation was temperature-dependent and was stimulated by millimolar levels of ATP but did not strictly require the addition of stromal factors. We have examined the substrate requirements of thylakoid translocation by testing the ability of different processed forms of plastocyanin to transport in the in vitro system. Interestingly, only the full-length plastocyanin precursor, not the partially processed intermediate form, was competent for transport in this in vitro system."
https://openalex.org/W1495819388,"Amino acids in lac repressor protein which form cross-links to lac operator DNA specifically substituted with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) have been identified. Five sites of cross-linking in BrdU-substituted operator DNA were found at positions +3, +4, +14, +18, and +19 relative to the initiation site for transcription (Wick, K.L., and Matthews, K.S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6106-6112). Irradiation of complexes of repressor and each of these five singly substituted operator DNAs was executed under large scale conditions to generate sufficient complex for proteolysis, separation of the peptide-DNA, and peptide sequencing. The DNAs substituted with BrdU for thymidine at positions +3, +18, and +19 yielded cross-links to the peptide spanning residues 23-33, with the cross-link identified at His-29. Substitution at position +14 resulted in a cross-link to Tyr-17 within the peptide containing amino acids 13-22. These results are consistent with the structure determined by NMR and molecular dynamics calculations of the NH2-terminal headpiece-symmetric operator complex (Lamerichs, R.M.J.N., Boelens, R., van der Marel, G.A., van Boom, J.H., Kaptein, R., Buck, F., Fera, B., and Ruterjans, H. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2895-2991; de Vlieg, J., Berendsen, H.J.C., and van Gunsteren, W.F. (1989) Proteins 6, 104-127). This structure indicates proximity of His-29 in the major groove to thymidines at positions +3 and +4. Since base pairs at positions +18 and +19 occupy symmetrical positions to +3 and +4 in the promoter distal region of the operator, it would be anticipated that cross-links similar to the +3 and +4 positions would form at these sites; this prediction is not borne out by the behavior at +4/+18, as no peptide could be identified cross-linked to DNA substituted at +4. Molecular dynamics simulations and the NMR data indicate that Tyr-17 interacts with the thymine at position +8, which is symmetrically related to position +14. Although BrdU-associated strand scission at +8 is protected, this site does not cross-link with bound lac repressor; inversely, DNA substituted with BrdU at +14 cross-links to repressor, but is not protected from strand scission by the presence of the protein. These differences at symmetrically related nucleotide positions (+4 versus +18, +8 versus +14) reflect the inherent asymmetry in the interaction. The identification of amino acids in proximity to specifically substituted sites confirms that positions of several amino acids in the intact protein-operator complex correspond to those in the structure of the NH2-terminal headpiece-operator DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1549231958,"The transport of the lumenal protein plastocyanin has been proposed to occur in two steps: 1) transport across the chloroplastic envelope to the stroma and 2) transport across the thylakoid membrane to the lumen where proteolytic maturation occurs. A partially processed stromal form of plastocyanin has been tentatively identified as a pathway intermediate and as the substrate for the second translocation step (Smeekens, S., Bauerle, C., Hageman, J., Keegstra, K., and Weisbeek, P. (1986) Cell 46, 365-375). In this study, we have examined the transport kinetics of several lumenal proteins under various incubation conditions. Soluble intermediate sized forms were observed in import reactions with plastocyanin precursors from three higher plant species and with the precursor of the 33-kDa polypeptide of the oxygen-evolving enhancer complex. The accumulation patterns observed for these soluble intermediate sized forms depended on incubation conditions and could not be consistently explained by a simple model where the intermediate sized form is the substrate for the second step. Thus, it has not been possible to clearly identify the substrate for thylakoid translocation in organello."
https://openalex.org/W1544176870,"Abstract A gene coding for the 5 S rRNA-binding protein (YL3) in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was isolated using a polymerase chain reaction-amplified gene probe. The DNA sequence contains no introns and codes for a 297 amino acid (Mr = 33,741) protein. Although the protein is just 1 residue longer than in rat, unlike the high sequence homology in the 5 S rRNAs from the same organisms, only about 45% of the amino acid residues are conserved with surprisingly little homology in the carboxyl-terminal end. Nevertheless, comparative studies indicate that a number of structural features are conserved including small repeats in the primary structure and a number of helical estimates in the higher order structure. One of the sequence repeats also appears to be present in the carboxyl-terminal end of the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIIA suggesting an evolutionary relationship in these 5 S RNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1552020410,"Specific contacts between the lac repressor and operator have been explored using 5-bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA. Substitution of BrdU for single thymidine positions in a synthetic 40-base pair operator provides substrate for ultraviolet irradiation; upon irradiation, strand scission occurs at the BrdU residues. When bound, lac repressor protein provides protection against UV-induced breakage depending on the nature of the sites and type of interaction. We have confirmed 13 unique sites of inducer-sensitive protection along the operator sequence using this method compared to complete substitution with BrdU; differences were observed at two positions for singly substituted versus completely substituted DNAs (Ogata, R., and Gilbert, W. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 4973-4976). The ability of these photosensitive DNAs to form short range cross-links to bound protein has been used to determine the efficiency with which cross-linked protein-DNA complexes are generated at each individual site of BrdU substitution. Five sites of high efficiency cross-linking to the repressor protein have been identified. At one site, cross-linking without protection from strand scission was observed; this result suggests an unusual mechanism of strand scission and/or cross-linking at this site. Comparison of the UV protection results and the cross-linking data show that these processes provide complementary tools for identifying and analyzing individual protein-DNA contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1538889094,"The biosynthesis of gastrin involves a complex series of post-translational processing reactions that result in the formation of a biologically active secretory product. To study the mechanisms for two specific reactions in gastrin processing, namely dibasic cleavage and amidation, we infected AtT-20, GH3, and Rin5-f cells with the retroviral expression vector, pZip-NeoSV(X), containing human gastrin cDNA. We detected gastrin and its glycine extended post-translational processing intermediates (G-gly) in the media and cell extracts of successfully infected cells. Characterization of the molecular forms of gastrin in these cell lines revealed that GH3 and Rin5-f processed gastrin in a manner similar to antral G-cells but the cleavage of the Lys74-Lys75 bond that converts G34 to G17 appeared to be suppressed in AtT-20 cells. Even after conversion of this site to Arg74-Arg75 via site-directed mutagenesis, the At-20 cells synthesized G34 predominantly. All of the infected cells amidated gastrin but the gastrin/G-gly ratio, a reflection of amidation within the cells, was enhanced in GH3 and Rin5-f cells but diminished in AtT-20 cells upon treatment with dexamethasone (10(-4) M) for 3 days. The dibasic cleavage of gastrin was uneffected by dexamethasone. Our data suggest that the activities of post-translational processing reactions responsible for the synthesis of biologically active gastrin exhibit considerable tissue and substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1531966633,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been shown previously to decrease hepatic synthesis of both albumin and albumin mRNA. These findings prompted us to ask whether decreased albumin expression is due to changes in the rate of gene transcription. A cell-free in vitro transcription assay demonstrated that activity of the albumin promoter in hepatonuclear extracts was diminished 3- to 4-fold in diabetic compared with control animals. This decrease was abolished in extracts prepared from diabetic animals treated with insulin. The potential mechanisms for diminished activity were examined by mixing extracts from normal and diabetic animals prior to incubation with DNA templates. In the presence of limited amounts of albumin promoter DNA, addition of diabetic to control extract caused a reduction in promoter activity, suggesting that an inhibitor or inhibitors of albumin promoter activity is/are present in the liver of diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W1536664339,"We report the first lateral diffusion measurements of redox components in normal-sized, matrix-containing, intact mitoplasts (inner membrane-matrix particles). The diffusion measurements were obtained by submicron beam fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements of individual, intact, rat liver mitoplasts bathed in different osmolarity media to control the matrix density and the extent of inner membrane folding. The data reveal that neither the extent of mitochondrial matrix density nor the complexity of the inner membrane folding have a significant effect on the mobility of inner membrane redox components. Diffusion coefficients for Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), Complex III (ubiquinol: cytochrome c oxidoreductase), Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), ubiquinone, and phospholipid were found to be effectively invariant with the matrix density and/or membrane folding and essentially the same as values we reported previously for spherical, fused, ultralarge, matrix-free, inner membranes. Diffusion of proton-transporting Complex V (ATP synthase) appeared to be 2-3-fold slower at the greatest matrix density and degree of membrane folding. Consistent with a diffusion-coupled mechanism of electron transport, comparison of electron transport frequencies (productive collisions) with the theoretical, diffusion-controlled, collision frequencies (maximum collisions possible) revealed that there were consistently more calculated than productive collisions for all redox partners. Theoretical analyses of parameters for submicron fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements in intact mitoplasts support the finding of highly mobile redox components diffusing at the same rates as determined in conventional fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements in fused, ultralarge inner membranes. These findings support the Random Collision Model of Mitochondrial Electron Transport at the level of the intact mitoplast and suggest a similar conclusion for the intact mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1597797344,"A member of the proteinase inhibitor I gene family encoding an inhibitor I protein with a novel trypsin-specific reactive site was isolated from the wild tomato species Lycopersicon peruvianum (L.) Mill. (LA107). The nucleotide sequence of the gene was identical to a previously isolated cDNA clone from L. peruvianum fruit (Wingate, V.P.M., Broadway, R. M., and Ryan, C. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17734-17738) with the exception of one nucleotide 3 base pairs upstream from the 5' terminus of the cDNA. S1 nuclease protection experiments and RNA blot hybridization analysis show that the gene is developmentally regulated in L. peruvianum fruit and is not the same inhibitor I gene that is wound inducible in leaves. Nucleotide sequences are present in the 5'-flanking sequences of the fruit-specific L. peruvianum gene inhibitor I gene which share similarity with regulatory sequences that have been associated with the regulation of several known elicitor- and ethylene-inducible genes. However, the L. peruvianum motifs are not identical with those of other genes and are probably not functional. Because inhibitor I genes are not expressed or are expressed in very low levels in modern tomato fruit before the onset of ripening but expressed at high levels in fruit of the wild L. peruvianum species, a unique fruit-specific signaling system must therefore be present in L. peruvianum fruit for the transcriptional regulation of the inhibitor I gene which is not present in the fruit of the modern tomato, L. esculentum."
