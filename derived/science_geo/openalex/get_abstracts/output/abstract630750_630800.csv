https://openalex.org/W2803271184,"Genetic robustness, or the ability of an organism to maintain fitness in the presence of harmful mutations, can be achieved via protein feedback loops. Previous work has suggested that organisms may also respond to mutations by transcriptional adaptation, a process by which related gene(s) are upregulated independently of protein feedback loops. However, the prevalence of transcriptional adaptation and its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, by analysing several models of transcriptional adaptation in zebrafish and mouse, we uncover a requirement for mutant mRNA degradation. Alleles that fail to transcribe the mutated gene do not exhibit transcriptional adaptation, and these alleles give rise to more severe phenotypes than alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis in alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay reveals the upregulation of a substantial proportion of the genes that exhibit sequence similarity with the mutated gene's mRNA, suggesting a sequence-dependent mechanism. These findings have implications for our understanding of disease-causing mutations, and will help in the design of mutant alleles with minimal transcriptional adaptation-derived compensation."

https://openalex.org/W2934339908,"Microglia maintain homeostasis in the central nervous system through phagocytic clearance of protein aggregates and cellular debris. This function deteriorates during ageing and neurodegenerative disease, concomitant with cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms of impaired microglial homeostatic function and the cognitive effects of restoring this function remain unknown. We combined CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens with RNA sequencing analysis to discover age-related genetic modifiers of microglial phagocytosis. These screens identified CD22, a canonical B cell receptor, as a negative regulator of phagocytosis that is upregulated on aged microglia. CD22 mediates the anti-phagocytic effect of α2,6-linked sialic acid, and inhibition of CD22 promotes the clearance of myelin debris, amyloid-β oligomers and α-synuclein fibrils in vivo. Long-term central nervous system delivery of an antibody that blocks CD22 function reprograms microglia towards a homeostatic transcriptional state and improves cognitive function in aged mice. These findings elucidate a mechanism of age-related microglial impairment and a strategy to restore homeostasis in the ageing brain."

https://openalex.org/W2931582083,"During metazoan development, immune surveillance and cancer dissemination, cells migrate in complex three-dimensional microenvironments1-3. These spaces are crowded by cells and extracellular matrix, generating mazes with differently sized gaps that are typically smaller than the diameter of the migrating cell4,5. Most mesenchymal and epithelial cells and some-but not all-cancer cells actively generate their migratory path using pericellular tissue proteolysis6. By contrast, amoeboid cells such as leukocytes use non-destructive strategies of locomotion7, raising the question how these extremely fast cells navigate through dense tissues. Here we reveal that leukocytes sample their immediate vicinity for large pore sizes, and are thereby able to choose the path of least resistance. This allows them to circumnavigate local obstacles while effectively following global directional cues such as chemotactic gradients. Pore-size discrimination is facilitated by frontward positioning of the nucleus, which enables the cells to use their bulkiest compartment as a mechanical gauge. Once the nucleus and the closely associated microtubule organizing centre pass the largest pore, cytoplasmic protrusions still lingering in smaller pores are retracted. These retractions are coordinated by dynamic microtubules; when microtubules are disrupted, migrating cells lose coherence and frequently fragment into migratory cytoplasmic pieces. As nuclear positioning in front of the microtubule organizing centre is a typical feature of amoeboid migration, our findings link the fundamental organization of cellular polarity to the strategy of locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2935362216,"Interleukin (IL)-2 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is necessary to prevent chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract1-4. The protective effects of IL-2 involve the generation, maintenance and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells4-8, and the use of low doses of IL-2 has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease9. However, the cellular and molecular pathways that control the production of IL-2 in the context of intestinal health are undefined. Here we show, in a mouse model, that IL-2 is acutely required to maintain Treg cells and immunological homeostasis throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Notably, lineage-specific deletion of IL-2 in T cells did not reduce Treg cells in the small intestine. Unbiased analyses revealed that, in the small intestine, group-3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are the dominant cellular source of IL-2, which is induced selectively by IL-1β. Macrophages in the small intestine produce IL-1β, and activation of this pathway involves MYD88- and NOD2-dependent sensing of the microbiota. Our loss-of-function studies show that ILC3-derived IL-2 is essential for maintaining Treg cells, immunological homeostasis and oral tolerance to dietary antigens in the small intestine. Furthermore, production of IL-2 by ILC3s was significantly reduced in the small intestine of patients with Crohn's disease, and this correlated with lower frequencies of Treg cells. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated pathway in which a microbiota- and IL-1β-dependent axis promotes the production of IL-2 by ILC3s to orchestrate immune regulation in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2952062681,"The hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex are part of a brain system that maps self-location during navigation in the proximal environment1,2. In this system, correlations between neural firing and an animal's position or orientation are so evident that cell types have been given simple descriptive names, such as place cells3, grid cells4, border cells5,6 and head-direction cells7. While the number of identified functional cell types is growing at a steady rate, insights remain limited by an almost-exclusive reliance on recordings from rodents foraging in empty enclosures that are different from the richly populated, geometrically irregular environments of the natural world. In environments that contain discrete objects, animals are known to store information about distance and direction to those objects and to use this vector information to guide navigation8-10. Theoretical studies have proposed that such vector operations are supported by neurons that use distance and direction from discrete objects11,12 or boundaries13,14 to determine the animal's location, but-although some cells with vector-coding properties may be present in the hippocampus15 and subiculum16,17-it remains to be determined whether and how vectorial operations are implemented in the wider neural representation of space. Here we show that a large fraction of medial entorhinal cortex neurons fire specifically when mice are at given distances and directions from spatially confined objects. These 'object-vector cells' are tuned equally to a spectrum of discrete objects, irrespective of their location in the test arena, as well as to a broad range of dimensions and shapes, from point-like objects to extended surfaces. Our findings point to vector coding as a predominant form of position coding in the medial entorhinal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2931582381,"A critical period is a developmental epoch during which the nervous system is expressly sensitive to specific environmental stimuli that are required for proper circuit organization and learning. Mechanistic characterization of critical periods has revealed an important role for exuberant brain plasticity during early development, and for constraints that are imposed on these mechanisms as the brain matures1. In disease states, closure of critical periods limits the ability of the brain to adapt even when optimal conditions are restored. Thus, identification of manipulations that reopen critical periods has been a priority for translational neuroscience2. Here we provide evidence that developmental regulation of oxytocin-mediated synaptic plasticity (long-term depression) in the nucleus accumbens establishes a critical period for social reward learning. Furthermore, we show that a single dose of (+/-)-3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) reopens the critical period for social reward learning and leads to a metaplastic upregulation of oxytocin-dependent long-term depression. MDMA-induced reopening of this critical period requires activation of oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens, and is recapitulated by stimulation of oxytocin terminals in the nucleus accumbens. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases that are characterized by social impairments and of disorders that respond to social influence or are the result of social injury3."

https://openalex.org/W2875574901,"The appeal of lasers can be attributed to both their ubiquitous applications and their role as model systems for elucidating nonequilibrium and cooperative phenomena. Introducing novel concepts in lasers thus has a potential for both applied and fundamental implications. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the coupling between carrier spin and light polarization in common semiconductor lasers can enable room-temperature modulation frequencies above 200 GHz, exceeding by nearly an order of magnitude the best conventional semiconductor lasers. Surprisingly, this ultrafast operation relies on a short carrier spin relaxation time and a large anisotropy of the refractive index, both commonly viewed as detrimental in spintronics and conventional lasers. Our results overcome the key speed limitations of conventional directly modulated lasers and offer a prospect for the next generation of low-energy ultrafast optical communication."
https://openalex.org/W2817470878,"Phononic resonators play important roles in settings that range from gravitational wave detectors to cellular telephones. They serve as high-performance transducers, sensors, and filters by offering low dissipation, tunable coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a wide range of frequencies, materials, and fabrication processes. Systems of phononic resonators typically obey reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon transmission coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the direction of transmission. Reciprocity must be broken to realize devices (such as isolators and circulators) that provide one-way propagation of acoustic energy between resonators. Such devices are crucial for protecting active elements, mitigating noise, and operating full-duplex transceivers. To date, nonreciprocal phononic devices have not combined the features necessary for robust operation: strong nonreciprocity, in situ tunability, compact integration, and continuous operation. Furthermore, they have been applied only to coherent signals (rather than fluctuations or noise), and have been realized exclusively in travelling-wave systems (rather than resonators). Here we describe a cavity optomechanical scheme that produces robust nonreciprocal coupling between phononic resonators. This scheme provides ~ 30 dB of isolation and can be tuned in situ simply via the phases of the drive tones applied to the cavity. In addition, by directly monitoring the resonators' dynamics we show that this nonreciprocity can be used to control thermal fluctuations, and that this control represents a new resource for cooling phononic resonators."

https://openalex.org/W2930346360,"Across different kingdoms of life, ATP citrate lyase (ACLY, also known as ACL) catalyses the ATP-dependent and coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent conversion of citrate, a metabolic product of the Krebs cycle, to oxaloacetate and the high-energy biosynthetic precursor acetyl-CoA1. The latter fuels pivotal biochemical reactions such as the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol and acetylcholine2, and the acetylation of histones and proteins3,4. In autotrophic prokaryotes, ACLY is a hallmark enzyme of the reverse Krebs cycle (also known as the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle), which fixates two molecules of carbon dioxide in acetyl-CoA5,6. In humans, ACLY links carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and is strongly expressed in liver and adipose tissue1 and in cholinergic neurons2,7. The structural basis of the function of ACLY remains unknown. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of bacterial, archaeal and human ACLY, and use distinct substrate-bound states to link the conformational plasticity of ACLY to its multistep catalytic itinerary. Such detailed insights will provide the framework for targeting human ACLY in cancer8-11 and hyperlipidaemia12,13. Our structural studies also unmask a fundamental evolutionary relationship that links citrate synthase, the first enzyme of the oxidative Krebs cycle, to an ancestral tetrameric citryl-CoA lyase module that operates in the reverse Krebs cycle. This molecular transition marked a key step in the evolution of metabolism on Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2931368040,"Current programmable nuclease-based methods (for example, CRISPR–Cas9) for the precise correction of a disease-causing genetic mutation harness the homology-directed repair pathway. However, this repair process requires the co-delivery of an exogenous DNA donor to recode the sequence and can be inefficient in many cell types. Here we show that disease-causing frameshift mutations that result from microduplications can be efficiently reverted to the wild-type sequence simply by generating a DNA double-stranded break near the centre of the duplication. We demonstrate this in patient-derived cell lines for two diseases: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G)1 and Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome type 1 (HPS1)2. Clonal analysis of inducible pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from the LGMD2G cell line, which contains a mutation in TCAP, treated with the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease revealed that about 80% contained at least one wild-type TCAP allele; this correction also restored TCAP expression in LGMD2G iPS cell-derived myotubes. SpCas9 also efficiently corrected the genotype of an HPS1 patient-derived B-lymphoblastoid cell line. Inhibition of polyADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) suppressed the nuclease-mediated collapse of the microduplication to the wild-type sequence, confirming that precise correction is mediated by the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway. Analysis of editing by SpCas9 and Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 Cas12a (LbCas12a) at non-pathogenic 4–36-base-pair microduplications within the genome indicates that the correction strategy is broadly applicable to a wide range of microduplication lengths and can be initiated by a variety of nucleases. The simplicity, reliability and efficacy of this MMEJ-based therapeutic strategy should permit the development of nuclease-based gene correction therapies for a variety of diseases that are associated with microduplications. Disease-causing microduplications can be corrected by harnessing an endogenous double-stranded break DNA repair pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2888004657,"In high-energy and condensed-matter physics, particle exchange has an essential role in the understanding of long-range interactions and correlations. For example, the exchange of massive bosons leads to the Yukawa potential1,2, and phonon exchange between electrons gives rise to Cooper pairing in superconductors3. Here we show that, when a Bose–Einstein condensate of caesium atoms is embedded in a degenerate Fermi gas of lithium atoms, interspecies interactions can give rise to an effective trapping potential, damping, and attractive boson–boson interactions mediated by fermions. The latter, which is related to the Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida mechanism4, results from a coherent three-body scattering process. Such mediated interactions are expected to form new magnetic phases5 and supersolids6. We show that under suitable conditions, the mediated interactions can convert a stable Bose–Einstein condensate into a train of ‘Bose–Fermi solitons’7,8. The predicted long-range nature of the mediated interactions opens up the possibility of correlating distant atoms and preparing new quantum phases. Embedding a Bose–Einstein condensate of caesium atoms in a degenerate Fermi gas of lithium atoms gives rise to fermion-mediated attractive boson–boson interactions, which can lead to the formation of a train of Bose–Fermi solitons."
https://openalex.org/W2927591937,"Introduction Smartphone usage has become commonplace and impact on sleep quality among adolescents. Adolescent girls have a greater tendency toward sleep quality problems. However, relationship of sleep quality, smartphone dependence, and health-related behaviors in female junior college students has not been studied. Objectives This study had the two goals: to investigate the relationship between female college students' sleep quality, smartphone dependence, and health-related behaviors, and to identify predictors of sleep quality. Methods This study employed a cross-sectional research approach to gather 409 subjects at a junior college in southern Taiwan, and used a structured questionnaire to collect data. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: basic demographic data, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, assessment of smartphone dependence, and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP). Logistic regression analysis was employed to check for any association between sleep quality and smartphone dependence or HPLP. Results Sleep quality was significantly associated with degree of smartphone dependence, total HPLP score, and scores on the four HPLP subscales of nutritional behavior, self-actualization, interpersonal support, and stress management behavior. The lower the subjects' degree of smartphone dependence was, the better their sleep quality was. Furthermore, the degree of smartphone dependence and total HPLP score were significant predictors of sleep quality. Conclusions Smartphone dependence is associated with poor sleep quality among female college students. Improving health-related behaviors (nutritional behavior, self-actualization, interpersonal support, and stress management behavior) can also promote improvement in sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W2929652033,"There are no existing treatments for the long-term degenerative effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This is due, in part, to our limited understanding of chronic TBI and uncertainty about which proposed mechanisms for long-term neurodegeneration are amenable to treatment with existing or novel drugs. Here, we used microarray and pathway analyses to interrogate TBI-induced gene expression in the rat hippocampus and cortex at several acute, subchronic and chronic intervals (24 hours, 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months) after parasagittal fluid percussion injury. We used Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify significantly expressed genes and prominent cell signaling pathways that are dysregulated weeks to months after TBI and potentially amenable to therapeutic modulation. We noted long-term, coordinated changes in expression of genes belonging to canonical pathways associated with the innate immune response (i.e., NF-κB signaling, NFAT signaling, Complement System, Acute Phase Response, Toll-like receptor signaling, and Neuroinflammatory signaling). Bioinformatic analysis suggested that dysregulation of these immune mediators-many are key hub genes-would compromise multiple cell signaling pathways essential for homeostatic brain function, particularly those involved in cell survival and neuroplasticity. Importantly, the temporal profile of beneficial and maladaptive immunoregulatory genes in the weeks to months after the initial TBI suggests wider therapeutic windows than previously indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2933071257,"A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an emerging and promising wireless technology aimed to improve traffic safety and provide comfort to road users. However, the high mobility of vehicles and frequent topology changes pose a considerable challenge to the reliable delivery of safety applications. Clustering is one of the control techniques used in VANET to make the frequent topology changes less dynamic. Nevertheless, research has shown that most of the existing clustering algorithms focus on cluster head (CH) election with very few addressing other critical issues such as cluster formation and maintenance. This has led to unstable clusters which could affect the timely delivery of safety applications. In this study, enhanced weight-based clustering algorithm (EWCA) was developed to address these challenges. We considered any vehicle moving on the same road segment with the same road ID and within the transmission range of its neighbour to be suitable for the cluster formation process. This was attributed to the fact that all safety messages are expected to be shared among the vehicles within the vicinity irrespective of their relative speedto avoid any hazardous situation. To elect a CH, we identified some metrics on the basis of the vehicle mobility information. Each vehicle was associated with a predefined weight value based on its relevance. A vehicle with the highest weight value was elected as the primary cluster head (PCH). We also introduced a secondary cluster head (SeCH) as a backup to the PCH to improve the cluster stability. SeCH took over the leadership whenever the PCH was not suitable for continuing with the leadership. The simulation results of the proposed approach showed a better performance with an increase of approximately40%– 45% in the cluster stability when compared with the existing approaches. Similarly, cluster formation messages were significantly minimized, hence reducing the communication overhead to the system and improving the reliable delivery of the safety applications."
https://openalex.org/W2928955042,"Rhodopsin (Rho) is a visual G protein–coupled receptor expressed in the rod photoreceptors of the eye, where it mediates transmission of a light signal into a cell and converts this signal into a nerve impulse. More than 100 mutations in Rho are linked to various ocular impairments, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Accordingly, much effort has been directed toward developing ligands that target Rho and improve its folding and stability. Natural compounds may provide another viable approach to such drug discovery efforts. The dietary polyphenol compounds, ubiquitously present in fruits and vegetables, have beneficial effects in several eye diseases. However, the underlying mechanism of their activity is not fully understood. In this study, we used a combination of computational methods, biochemical and biophysical approaches, including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, and mammalian cell expression systems to clarify the effects of four common bioactive flavonoids (quercetin, myricetin, and their mono-glycosylated forms quercetin-3-rhamnoside and myricetrin) on rod opsin stability, function, and membrane organization. We observed that by directly interacting with ligand-free opsin, flavonoids modulate its conformation, thereby causing faster entry of the retinal chromophore into its binding pocket. Moreover, flavonoids significantly increased opsin stability, most likely by introducing structural rigidity and promoting receptor self-association within the biological membranes. Of note, the binding of flavonoids to an RP-linked P23H opsin variant partially restored its normal cellular trafficking. Together, our results suggest that flavonoids could be utilized as lead compounds in the development of effective nonretinoid therapeutics for managing RP-related retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2926269240,"Introduction This Dutch study is a qualitative interview study. It aims to contribute to our understanding of the day-to-day experiences by providing an idiographic description of what it means existentially to be in the world as a person affected by a form of dementia, taking into account the contextual nature of these embodied experiences. Methods We used a combination of narrative accounts of people from dementia. We first collected 322 recorded messages of 16 diarists who joined the Dutch Dementia Diaries project. This data was supplemented with 37 interview accounts. Our data analysis was inspired by Van Manen’s existential phenomenological approach. Results The findings show that living with dementia–from a first-person perspective–can be understood as a severely unsettling experience: the people concerned enter a very uncertain, unpredictable and ambiguous period of life. They have to face all kinds of losses that considerably change and disrupt their relationships with 1) their own body, 2) with others and 3) with the surrounding world. This experience is explicated in the following themes: 1a) scrutinizing your disrupted body; 1b) trying to control your bodily loss-of-control; 2a) feeling scrutinized by the suspicious gaze of others; 2b) drifting away from significant others; 2c) having difficulties sharing the struggle; 2d) longing to be taken seriously; 2e) engaging in a world of peers; and 3a) sensing disorientation in an alien place; 3b) feeling closed in within a shrinking space; 3c) trying to control a dreaded future; 3d) trying to control a dreaded future by means of euthanasia. Discussion Our study demonstrates how the people with dementia are affected by ‘the eyes of others’. They longed for a safe and accepting environment, but quite often felt scrutinized by inquisitive and disapproving looks. The outcomes also reveal a connection between dominant social imaginaries and people’s self-understanding of dementia. Much of the suffering stems from living under the shadow of negative imaginaries. Furthermore, our study supports the demand for a socio-relational approach by demonstrating that–from a first-person perspective–dementia can be seen a disorder that is related in particular to questions about selfhood, social relations and social roles. For the people involved, instead of what dementia is, the focus is on what Alzheimer’s disease means and does and how it affects daily life."
https://openalex.org/W2929736067,"Plastids perform many essential functions in plant metabolism including photosynthesis, synthesis of metabolites, and stress signaling. The most prominent type in green leaves is the chloroplast which contains thylakoids, plastoglobules, and starch. As these structures are closely linked to the metabolism of chloroplasts, changes during plant growth and development and during environmental stress situations are likely to occur. The aim of this study was to characterize changes in size and ultrastructure of chloroplast on cross-sections of leaves during high light stress, Botrytis infection, and dark induced senescence by quantitative transmission electron microscopy (TEM).The size of chloroplasts on cross sections of leaves decreased significantly when plants were subject to high light (49%), Botrytis infection (58%), and senescence (71%). The number of chloroplasts on cross sections of the palisade cell layer and spongy parenchyma, respectively, decreased significantly in plants exposed to high light conditions (48% and 29%), infected with Botrytis (48% and 46%), and during senescence (78% and 80%). Thylakoids on cross-sections of chloroplasts decreased significantly in plants exposed to high light (22%), inoculated with Botrytis cinerea (36%), and senescence (51%). This correlated with a massive increase in plastoglobules on cross-sections of chloroplasts of 88%, 2,306% and 19,617%, respectively. Starch contents on cross sections of chloroplasts were completely diminished in all three stress scenarios. These results demonstrate that the decrease in the number and size of chloroplasts is a reliable stress marker in plants during abiotic and biotic stress situations which can be easily detected with a light microscope. Further, lack of starch, the occurrence of large plastoglobules and decrease in thylakoids can also be regarded as reliable stress marker in plants which can be detected by TEM."

Between 2008-2015, 11,066 adult and 3,815 nymphal I. pacificus and five adult and 144 nymphal Ixodes spinpalpis, a commonly collected wildlife tick, were collected from 42 California counties. Borrelia burgdorferi sl was detected in 1.2% and 3.8% I. pacificus adults and nymphs, respectively. Results from this study indicate genetic diversity and geographic structure of B. burgdorferi sl in California I. pacificus ticks, by sequence comparison of the16S rRNA gene, with B. burgdorferi ss, the agent of Lyme disease, found only in I. pacificus collected from the north and central coastal and Sierra Nevada foothill regions; B. burgdorferi ss was not detected in ticks tested from southern California. In contrast, Borrelia bissettiae, a member of the B. burgdorferi sl complex, was detected in both I. pacificus and I. spinipalpis, in the coastal region of both northern and southern California, but was absent from ticks in the Sierra Nevada foothills. In a similar pattern to B. bissettiae, Borrelia americana (a member of the B. burgdorferi sl complex) was detected in a single adult I. pacificus from the north coast and two I. spinipalpis nymphs from south-coastal California. This study highlights that the geographic area of Lyme disease acarological risk in California is the north-central and Sierra Nevada foothill regions of the state with little to no risk in the southern regions of the state."
https://openalex.org/W2932530892,"Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes heme degradation, a process crucial for regulating cellular levels of this vital, but cytotoxic, cofactor. Two HO isoforms, HO1 and HO2, exhibit similar catalytic mechanisms and efficiencies. They also share catalytic core structures, including the heme-binding site. Outside their catalytic cores are two regions unique to HO2: a 20-amino acid–long N-terminal extension and a C-terminal domain containing two heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) that bind heme independently of the core. Both HO isoforms contain a C-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor; however, their sequences diverge. Here, using hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS, size-exclusion chromatography, and sedimentation velocity, we investigated how these divergent regions impact the dynamics and structure of the apo and heme-bound forms of HO1 and HO2. Our results reveal that heme binding to the catalytic cores of HO1 and HO2 causes similar dynamic and structural changes in regions (proximal, distal, and A6 helices) within and linked to the heme pocket. We observed that full-length HO2 is more dynamic than truncated forms lacking the membrane-anchoring region, despite sharing the same steady-state activity and heme-binding properties. In contrast, the membrane anchor of HO1 did not influence its dynamics. Furthermore, although residues within the HRM domain facilitated HO2 dimerization, neither the HRM region nor the N-terminal extension appeared to affect HO2 dynamics. In summary, our results highlight significant dynamic and structural differences between HO2 and HO1 and indicate that their dissimilar C-terminal regions play a major role in controlling the structural dynamics of these two proteins."

Of particular interest in this regard is a rapid escape, or startle, reflex possessed by zebrafish larvae; this reflex, the C-start, is mediated by a relatively simple neuronal circuit and exhibits habituation, a non-associative form of learning. Here we demonstrate a rapid form of habituation of the C-start to touch that resembles the previously reported rapid habituation induced by auditory or vibrational stimuli. We also show that touch-induced habituation exhibits input specificity. This work sets the stage for in vivo optical investigations of the cellular sites of plasticity that mediate habituation of the C-start in the larval zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2928465101,"Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to reduce the likelihood of neonatal early-onset group B streptococcal infection (EOGBS) has coincided with major reductions in incidence. While the decline has been largely ascribed to IAP following either universal screening or a risk-based approach to identify mothers whose babies may most benefit from IAP, there is lack of high quality evidence to support this view.To describe management of maternal GBS colonisation in one local health district using universal screening and assess rates of EOGBS over time.A retrospective cohort study was undertaken to describe compliance with GBS management, to determine the incidence of EOGBS and association between rates and maternal screening. Linking routinely collected maternity and pathology data, we explored temporal trends using logistic regression and covariates for potential effect modifiers.Our cohort included 62,281 women who had 92,055 pregnancies resulting in 93,584 live born babies. Screening occurred in 76% of pregnancies; 69% had a result recorded, 21.5% of those were positive for GBS. Prophylaxis was used by 79% of this group. Eighteen babies developed EOGBS, estimated incidence/1000 live births in 2006 and 2016 was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.63) and 0.1 (95% CI, 0 to 0.2) respectively. Seven of 10 term babies with EOGBS were born to mothers who screened negative. Data were unable to provide evidence of difference in rates of EOGBS between screened and unscreened pregnancies. We estimated the difference in EOGBS incidence from crude and weighted models to be 0 (95% CI, -0. 2 to 0.17) and -0.01 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.10) /1000 live births respectively.No change was detected in rates of EOGBS over time and no difference in EOGBS in babies of screened and unscreened populations. Screening and prophylaxis rates were modest. Limitations of universal screening suggest alternatives be considered."

Methods Prospective cohort study of 139 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. Adrenal hormones were determined within the first 24 hours of the septic process. To determine and compare the predictive ability of each marker for the risk of unfavorable evolution (in-hospital, 28-day and 90-day mortality), ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves were constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined. As measures of association, adjusted odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression. Cortisol, DHEA and DHEAS results were compared to lactate, CRP, SOFA and APACHE II Scores. Results Cortisol showed the best predictive ability, with AUCs of 0.758, 0.759 and 0.705 for in-hospital mortality, and 28-day and 90-day mortality, respectively; whereas AUCs for 28 days mortality for SOFA and APACHE II scores, and other biomarkers studied, such as Lactate or CRP, were 0.644, 0.618, 0.643 and 0.647, respectively. Associations between high cortisol levels (>17.5 μg/dL) and mortality were strong and statistically significant for in-hospital and 28-day mortality: adjusted ORs 10.13 and 9.45 respectively, and lower for long term mortality (90 days): adjusted OR 4.26 (95% CI 1.34–13.56), p trend 0.014. Regarding adrenal androgens, only positive associations were obtained for DHEAS and most of these positive associations did not yield statistical significance. Regarding Cortisol/DHEA and cortisol/DHEAS ratios, they did not improve the predictive ability of cortisol. The only exception was the cortisol/DHEAS ratio, which was the best predictor of mortality at 90 days (AUC 0.737), adjusted OR for highest cortisol/DHEAS ratio values 6.33 (95%CI 1.77–22.60), p trend 0.002. Conclusion Basal cortisol measured within the first 24 hours of the septic process was the best prognostic factor for in-hospital and 28-day mortality, even superior to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores. The cortisol/DHEAS ratio was an independent predictor of long-term mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2932844429,"Background Overall 5-year survival rates for patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are poor, but vary by race/ethnicity. We undertook a comprehensive assessment of underlying contributing factors to the favorable survival outcomes of HCC among Asians compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Methods We identified 1,284 Asian and 7,072 NHW patients newly diagnosed with HCC between 1994 and 2011 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. We used a novel three-step sequential matching approach to identify demographic, presentation and treatment factors that may explain survival differences between Asians and NHWs. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between Asian race and risk of HCC-related mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results The absolute difference in 5-year survival rates between Asians and NHWs was 8.4% (95% CI: 4.6%-12.0%) in the demographics match analysis. The disparity remained unchanged after additionally matching on stage, grade and comorbidities in the presentation match analysis. However, in the treatment match analysis, which accounts for differences in demographic, presentation and treatment factors, the absolute difference in 5-year survival rates was reduced to 5.8% (95% CI: 2.6%-9.3%). Treatment differences explained more of survival disparity in Asian and NHW patients with localized disease than for those with regional or distant stage HCC. Conclusions Asian patients with HCC continue to have more favorable survival outcomes than NHWs with HCC. This persistent disparity seems to be more related to treatment differences than to differences in presentation characteristics including stage."

Male partners of women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be at higher risk of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU). The aim of this study was to examine the role of BV associated bacteria in first-void urine (FVU) in 97 asymptomatic men without urethritis (controls) and 44 men (cases) with NGU including 20 men with idiopathic urethritis (IU) attending a Swedish STD-clinic between January and October 2010. BV-associated bacteria and ureaplasmas were detected by quantitative PCR assays. All BV associated bacteria, except Megasphaera-like type 1, were strongly positively correlated with U. urealyticum p<0.005 and even stronger with the combined U. urealyticum and U. parvum load (p<0.0005) suggesting that ureaplasma induced elevated pH may stimulate the growth of BV associated bacteria. No statistically significant differences were found between IU cases and controls in the prevalence or load of BV associated bacteria or ureaplasmas. In multiple logistic regression, Megasphaera-like type 1 was associated with IU (p = 0.03), but most positive FVU samples contained very few bacteria and the finding may not be clinically relevant."

Fasted subjects were served a 400ml liquid test meal containing 25g lactulose. The intensity of eight GI symptoms and the amount of exhaled H2 and CH4 were assessed before and during 4h after meal intake. The challenge was repeated after 14 days consumption of FMP or a control product in a double-blind, randomized, parallel design. The metabolic potential of fecal microbiota was profiled using 16S MiSeq analysis of samples obtained before and after the intervention.106 patients with IBS were randomized. No difference between FMP or control groups was found on GI symptoms or breath H2 and CH4 in the whole cohort. A post-hoc analysis in patients stratified according to their fasting H2 levels showed that in high H2 producers (fasting H2 level≥10ppm, n = 35), FMP consumption reduced fasting H2 levels (p = 0.003) and H2 production during the challenge (p = 0.002) and tended to decrease GI discomfort (p = 0.05) vs. control product. The Prevotella/Bacteroides metabolic potential at baseline was higher in high H2 producers (p<0.05) vs. low H2 producers and FMP consumption reduced this ratio (p<0.05) vs. control product.The response to a fermented milk product containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 (FMP) in patients with IBS seems to be associated with the metabolic potential of the gut microbiota.ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01252550.

https://openalex.org/W2927629803,"Internal acidification of the influenza virus, mediated by the M2 proton channel, is a key step in its life cycle. The interior M1 protein shell dissolves at pH~5.5 to 6.0, allowing the release of vRNA to the cytoplasm upon fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. Previous models have described the mechanisms and rate constants of M2-mediated transport but did not describe the kinetics of pH changes inside the virus or consider exterior pH changes due to endosome maturation. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model of M2-mediated virion acidification. We find that ~32,000 protons are required to acidify a typically-sized virion. Predicted acidification kinetics were consistent with published in vitro experiments following internal acidification. Finally, we applied the model to the in vivo situation. For all rates of endosomal maturation considered, internal acidification lagged ~1 min behind endosomal acidification to pH 6. For slow endosomal maturation requiring several minutes or more, internal and endosomal pH decay together in pseudo-equilibrium to the late endosomal pH~5.0. For fast endosomal maturation (≲2 min), a lag of tens of seconds continued toward the late endosomal pH. Recent experiments suggest in vivo maturation is in this ""fast"" regime where lag is considerable. We predict that internal pH reaches the threshold for M1 shell solvation just before the external pH triggers membrane fusion mediated by the influenza protein hemagglutinin, critical because outward proton diffusion through a single small fusion pore is faster than the collective M2-mediated transport inward."
https://openalex.org/W2952567878,"Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) are widely used for measuring DNA methylation levels on a genome-wide scale. Both methods have limitations: WGBS is expensive and prohibitive for most large-scale projects; RRBS only interrogates 6-12% of the CpGs in the human genome. Here, we introduce methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme bisulfite sequencing (MREBS) which has the reduced sequencing requirements of RRBS, but significantly expands the coverage of CpG sites in the genome. We built a multiple regression model that combines the two features of MREBS: the bisulfite conversion ratios of single cytosines (as in WGBS and RRBS) as well as the number of reads that cover each locus (as in MRE-seq). This combined approach allowed us to estimate differential methylation across 60% of the genome using read count data alone, and where counts were sufficiently high in both samples (about 1.5% of the genome), our estimates were significantly improved by the single CpG conversion information. We show that differential DNA methylation values based on MREBS data correlate well with those based on WGBS and RRBS. This newly developed technique combines the sequencing cost of RRBS and DNA methylation estimates on a portion of the genome similar to WGBS, making it ideal for large-scale projects of mammalian genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2926498455,"Based on non-clinical data, it is expected that azilsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, will help improve insulin resistance in addition to its hypotensive action. The present study is aimed to explore the effect of azilsartan compared to telmisartan on insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients in the clinical setting.This multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group exploratory study was conducted in Japan. We randomized adult patients (≥20 years old) with grade I or II essential hypertension and coexisting type 2 diabetes (1:1) to receive either oral azilsartan (20 mg/day;17 patients) or telmisartan (40 mg/day;16 patients) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the homeostasis model assessment ratio of insulin resistance (HOMA-R) from the baseline at the end of the treatment period. We also evaluated its safety and efficacy on other diabetes-related variables and blood pressure.The mean changes in HOMA-R at the end of treatment were 0.22 (95% CI, -1.09-1.52) in the azilsartan group and -0.23 (95% CI, -0.72-0.27) in the telmisartan group. We found no clinically remarkable changes between the groups in diabetes-related variables such as fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c (NGSP), HOMA-β, or 1,5-anhydroglucitol. Reductions in clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed at week 4 and the reduced levels were maintained throughout the treatment period in both groups. No serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed. Only one drug-related TEAE (mild decrease in blood pressure) was reported in one patient in the azilsartan group.Neither azilsartan nor telmisartan had any clinically remarkable effects on insulin resistance parameters when administered for 12 weeks to patients with grade I or II essential hypertension and coexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus. Azilsartan (20 mg/day) and telmisartan (40 mg/day) exerted comparable antihypertensive effects.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02079805."
https://openalex.org/W2930208559,"The innate immune system plays an essential role in initial recognition of pathogen infection by producing inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. cGAS is a cytoplasmic sensor for DNA derived from DNA viruses. cGAS binding with DNA induces the production of cGAMP, a second messenger that associates with STING in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). STING changes its cellular distribution from ER to perinuclear Golgi, where it activates the protein kinase TBK1 that catalyzes the phosphorylation of IRF3. Here we found that STING trafficking is regulated by myotubularin-related protein (MTMR) 3 and MTMR4, members of protein tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate 3′ position in phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and generate PtdIns5P from PtdIns3,5P2 and PtdIns from PtdIns3P.

In DKO cells, STING rapidly trafficked from ER to Golgi after ISD stimulation. Notably, DKO cells exhibited enlarged cytosolic puncta positive for PtdIns3P and STING was aberrantly accumulated in this puncta.

https://openalex.org/W2951598908,"MiRNAs and proteins play important roles in different stages of breast tumor development and serve as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. A new algorithm that combines machine learning algorithms and multilayer complex network analysis is hereby proposed to explore the potential diagnostic values of miRNAs and proteins. XGBoost and random forest algorithms were employed to screen the most important miRNAs and proteins. Maximal information coefficient was applied to assess intralayer and interlayer connection. A multilayer complex network was constructed to identify miRNAs and proteins that could serve as biomarkers for breast cancer. Proteins and miRNAs that are nodes in the network were subsequently categorized into two network layers considering their distinct functions. The betweenness centrality was used as the first measurement of the importance of the nodes within each single layer. The degree of the nodes was chosen as the second measurement to map their signalling pathways. By combining these two measurements into one score and comparing the difference of the same candidate between normal tissue and cancer tissue, this novel multilayer network analysis could be applied to successfully identify molecules associated with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2925511497,"In the last decade, health care reform has dominated U.S. public policy and political discourse. Double-digit rate increases in premiums in the Health Insurance Marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2018 make this an ongoing issue that could affect future elections. A seminal event that changed the course of policy and politics around health care reform is the 2016 presidential election. The results of the 2016 presidential election departed considerably from polling forecasts. Given the prominence of the Affordable Care Act in the election, we test whether changes in health insurance coverage at the county-level correlate with changes in party vote share in the presidential elections from 2008 through 2016. We find that a one-percentage-point increase in county health insurance coverage was associated with a 0.25-percentage-point increase in the vote share for the Democratic presidential candidate. We further find that these gains on the part of the Democratic candidate came almost fully at the expense of the Republican (as opposed to third-party) presidential candidates. We also estimate models separately for states that did and did not expand Medicaid and find no differential effect of insurance gains on Democratic vote share for states that expanded Medicaid compared to those that did not. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that outcomes in health insurance markets played a role in the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The decisions made by the current administration, and how those decisions affect health insurance coverage and costs, may be important factors in future elections as well."
https://openalex.org/W2933723414,"To determine whether there is an association between severe intraventricular hemorrhage and early extubation in preterm infants born before 29 weeks of gestational age and intubated at birth.This study included 1587 preterm infants from a nationwide French population cohort (EPIPAGE-2). Secondary data on intubated preterm infants were analyzed. After gestational age and propensity score matching (1:1) we built two comparable groups: an early extubation group and a delayed extubation group. Each neonate in one group was paired with a neonate in the other group having the same propensity score and gestational age. Early extubation was defined as extubation within 48 hours of life. Severe intraventricular hemorrhages were defined as grade III or IV hemorrhages according to the Papile classification.After matching, there were 398 neonates in each group. Using a generalized estimating equation model, we found that intraventricular hemorrhage was not associated with early extubation (adjusted OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.6-1.4). This result was supported by sensitivity analyses.The practice of early extubation was not associated with an increased proportion of intraventricular hemorrhages. To complete these results, the long-term neurologic outcomes of these infants need to be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2934340148,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been widely used to map DNA-binding proteins, histone proteins and their modifications. ChIP-seq data contains redundant reads termed duplicates, referring to those mapping to the same genomic location and strand. There are two main sources of duplicates: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates and natural duplicates. Unlike natural duplicates that represent true signals from sequencing of independent DNA templates, PCR duplicates are artifacts originating from sequencing of identical copies amplified from the same DNA template. In analysis, duplicates are removed from peak calling and signal quantification. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the duplicates is believed to represent true signals. Obviously, removing all duplicates will underestimate the signal level in peaks and impact the identification of signal changes across samples. Therefore, an in-depth evaluation of the impact from duplicate removal is needed. Using eight public ChIP-seq datasets from three narrow-peak and two broad-peak marks, we tried to understand the distribution of duplicates in the genome, the extent by which duplicate removal impacts peak calling and signal estimation, and the factors associated with duplicate level in peaks. The three PCR-free histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq data had about 40% duplicates and 97% of them were within peaks. For the other datasets generated with PCR amplification of ChIP DNA, as expected, the narrow-peak marks have a much higher proportion of duplicates than the broad-peak marks. We found that duplicates are enriched in peaks and largely represent true signals, more conspicuous in those with high confidence. Furthermore, duplicate level in peaks is strongly correlated with the target enrichment level estimated using nonredundant reads, which provides the basis to properly allocate duplicates between noise and signal. Our analysis supports the feasibility of retaining the portion of signal duplicates into downstream analysis, thus alleviating the limitation of complete deduplication."

Of the risk factors identified, the most plausible are hormonal and genetic. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for hypospadias in Northwest Russia based on registry data.The study population included male infants registered in the Murmansk County Birth Registry between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011 (n = 25 475). These infants were followed-up for 2 years using the Murmansk Regional Congenital Defects Registry to identify cases of hypospadias not diagnosed at birth. We used logistic regression analysis to examine the contributions of hypospadias risk factors.Out of 25 475 male infants born during the study period, 148 had isolated hypospadias. The overall prevalence rate was 54.2 (95% CI 53.6-54.8) per 10 000 male infants. Those born to mothers with preeclampsia (OR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.03-2.66) or infant birthweight < 2500 g (OR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.18-3.60) exhibited increased risk for hypospadias. Maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, folic acid intake during pregnancy or hepatitis B surface antigen positivity did not associate with increased risk of hypospadias.Combining data from a birth registry with those from a congenital defects registry provided optimal information about the prevalence of hypospadias and its association with low infant birthweight and preeclampsia. These factors have in common changes in hormone levels during pregnancy, which in turn may have contributed to hypospadias development."

https://openalex.org/W2928841317,"Peritoneal tuberculosis (TB) remains difficult to diagnose because of its non-specific clinical features and the lack of efficient microbiological tests. As delayed diagnosis is associated with high mortality rates, new diagnostic tools are needed.We investigated for 24 patients prospectively enrolled with a possible diagnosis of peritoneal TB, the diagnostic value of the analysis of IFN-γ production by peritoneal fluid lymphocytes in response to a short in vitro stimulation with mycobacterial antigens. The patients were classified in two groups: non-TB and confirmed or highly probable TB. Diagnosis of TB was based on microbiological and histopathological criteria and/or a favorable response to anti-TB treatment. The IFN-γ production by peritoneal CD4+ T lymphocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry after an overnight in vitro stimulation with three different mycobacterial antigens, purified protein derivative (PPD), heparin-binding haemagglutinin (HBHA) or early-secreted-antigen-target-6 (ESAT-6). The percentages of PPD-, HBHA- or ESAT-6-induced IFN-γ-producing peritoneal fluid CD4+ T lymphocytes were higher in the TB group than in the non-TB group (p = 0.0007, p = 0.0004, and p = 0.0002 respectively). Based on cut-off values determined by ROC curve analysis of the results from TB and highly probable TB compared to those of non-TB patients, the sensitivity of these three tests was 100% with a specificity of 92%.The analysis of mycobacterial-induced IFN-γ production by peritoneal lymphocytes is a promising tool to reliably and rapidly diagnose peritoneal TB. Further studies should be performed on larger cohorts of patients in high-TB-incidence countries to confirm the clinical value of this new diagnostic approach for peritoneal TB."
https://openalex.org/W2928981468,"Introduction Current guidelines recommend maintaining vancomycin trough concentrations between 15–20 mg/L for serious methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This recommendation is based on limited evidence. Methods A retrospective study including patients with vancomycin susceptible MRSA infections (MIC< = 2 mg/L), treated with vancomycin. We compared outcomes among patients attaining high (> = 15mg/L) vs low (<15mg/L) trough vancomycin levels. We used a propensity score to matching patients achieving low and high levels and conducted an adjusted analysis in the propensity score (PS)-matched cohort using regression analysis. Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Results Among 285 patients included, there were no significant differences between patients achieving high and low vancomycin levels in mortality (46/131, 35.1% vs 41/154, 26.6%), clinical success, microbiological success, or nephrotoxicity. Similarly, in the PS-matched cohort (n = 162), there was no significant difference in mortality between patients with high and low vancomycin levels (24/53, 45.3% vs 57/109, 52.3%, respectively), adjusted odds ratio for mortality with high levels 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.28–1.43). In both cohorts, patients with pneumonia achieving high levels had significantly higher clinical and microbiological success (PS-matched cohort: clinical success: 16/32, 50.0% vs 5/27, 18.5%, p = 0.012; microbiological success: 19/32, 59.4% vs 7/27, 25.9%, p = 0.010), without significant differences in mortality. Conclusions We found no association between vancomycin levels > = 15 mg/L and clinical outcomes in patients with MRSA infections. In patients with MRSA pneumonia, vancomycin levels > = 15 mg/L were associated with higher clinical success rates. Further larger cohort studies are needed to define optimal vancomycin levels according to the site of infection."

Evaluating the association between periodontitis and CVD would be helpful to better understand the pathophysiology and various complications of periodontitis. We aimed to determine whether there is an independent relationship between periodontitis and various CVD risk indicators or prevalence.Our study used representative data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Finally, data from 26,097 participants were used for analysis. Periodontitis was defined as a community periodontal index (CPI) ≥3. Participants were classified into 3 groups according to CPI score: Non-PO (participants without periodontitis, CPI score <3), NS-PO (participants with non-severe periodontitis, CPI score = 3), and Severe PO (participants with severe periodontitis, CPI score = 4). Cardiometabolic risk was evaluated based on metabolic syndrome, future CVD risk, and prevalent CVD. Prevalent CVD was defined as participants with cerebrovascular accidents and/or coronary artery disease. Framingham risk score (FRS) was calculated in participants without prevalent CVD.The numbers of participants in Non-PO, NS-PO, and Severe PO groups were 17,237, 6,738, and 2,122, respectively. The proportions of participants with high FRS and/or prevalent CVD increased as the severity of periodontitis increased. In participants without prevalent CVD, the FRS according to severity of periodontitis increased in both univariate and multivariate analyses as the severity of periodontitis increased. Logistic regression showed that the odds ratio for metabolic syndrome increased as the severity of periodontitis increased on univariate analysis and that the presence of periodontitis was associated with a higher odds ratio for metabolic syndrome on multivariate analysis. Trends for prevalent CVD were similar to those of metabolic syndrome. For participants without prevalent CVD, the odds ratio for high FRS increased as the severity of periodontitis increased in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Subgroup analyses according to sex and age showed similar trends.Periodontitis was associated with CVD in the Korean population. Therefore, those with periodontitis, especially young adults with severe periodontitis, may be closely monitored for CVD."

Several studies have suggested that the immunomodulatory effects of human bone marrow MSCs (hBM-MSCs) are regulated through the activation of TLRs.

Also, activation of TLR3 stimulates the secretion of immune modulators and soluble factors that lead to immunosuppressive responses (2Waterman R.S. Tomchuck S.L. Henkle S.L. Betancourt A.M. A new mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) paradigm: polarization into a pro-inflammatory MSC1 or an immunosuppressive MSC2 phenotype.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 (20436665)e1008810.1371/journal.pone.0010088Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 25Keating A.

Several studies have suggested that stimulation of TLR3 regulates migration properties and immunomodulatory factors, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), prostaglandin E2, and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (2Waterman R.S.

However, the mechanism of the TLR3-activated migration of hMSCs is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether TLR3-stimulated hMSCs contribute to the pathway in response to hMSC migration using gene expression profiling. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq for gene expression profiling of hMSCs treated with a TLR3 ligand (poly(I:C), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) compared with unstimulated hMSCs (control hMSCs). We analyzed differentially expressed genes and validated the RNA-seq data using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Our results show that TLR3-stimulated hMSCs express inflammatory- and migration response-related genes, thus revealing the molecular effects of TLR3 activation. Additionally, our results show that the TLR3-stimulated hMSCs increased cell migration through the activation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). Together, these results strengthen the molecular foundation for the clinical utilization of the cell migration abilities of hMSCs. To study the effects of TLR3 stimulation on hMSCs, we incubated them with poly(I:C) for 4 h. Nonstimulated hMSCs (control hMSCs) and TLR3-stimulated cells (TLR3-stimulated hMSCs) exhibited a similar spindle-shaped fibroblastic morphology (Fig. 1A). Flow cytometry expression analysis of the typical MSC-related surface antigens showed that both the control hMSCs and TLR3-stimulated hMSCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, and CD105 and negative for the hematopoietic lineage markers CD31, CD34, CD45, and HLA-DR after 6 passages (Fig. 1B). The viability of these cells was not appreciably affected when treating them with various concentrations of poly(I:C) (1 to 20 μg/ml) for 4 h (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that TLR3-stimulated hMSCs maintain the typical characteristics of hMSCs. To determine the appropriate time points, we performed mRNA and protein expression analysis in hMSCs treated for 0.5 to 24 h with poly(I:C) at 10 μg/ml. The poly(I:C) treatment induced the expression of IDO (Fig. 1D) as well as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) (Fig. 1, E and F). Although the time profiles differed, induction was in all cases maximal or near-maximal at 4 h. Based on these results, we used 10 μg/ml concentration and the 4-h time point as the standard condition for TLR3 stimulation of hMSCs. To analyze the gene expression pattern in response to TLR3 stimulation, three independent samples (biological triplicates) of the entire transcriptomes of the control 7F3915 hMSCs and TLR3-stimulated 7F3915 hMSCs were profiled using RNA-Seq. A total of 130 genes were differentially expressed, with 120 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated genes in the TLR3-stimulated versus control hMSCs. Of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the top 50 up-regulated genes are listed in Fig. 2A. Interestingly, most of the top 50 genes were related to interferons and inflammation, namely, an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), CXCL8, IFIT3, interleukin 1 β (IL1β), and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Next, we performed functional annotation analysis for Gene Ontology (GO) based on the biological processes (BP) using DAVID Informatics Resources. The up-regulated genes in the TLR3-stimulated hMSCs were determined to be involved in several BPs such as response to viruses, inflammation, and anti-apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, normalized RNA-seq read densities of inflammation-related (CXCL1 and CXCL8) and interferon-related genes (IFIT1 and IFIT2) were increased in TLR3-stimulated hMSCs (Fig. 2C). To validate the RNA-seq results, we confirmed the expression of the DEGs by qRT-PCR. Because viral dsRNA poly(I:C) was used to treat the hMSCs, we selected inflammation-related (CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL3, and CXCL8) and interferon-related (guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1), GBP2, IFIT1 and IFIT2) genes for analysis. GBP1, GBP2, and IFIT1 mRNAs were up-regulated at 4 h; CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, and IFIT2 mRNAs at 2 and 4 h (Fig. 2D). To identify the degree to which the 7F3915 hMSCs genes that we detected were up-regulated in 7F3674 and 127756 hMSCs, we further constructed RNA-seq dataset to compare the up-regulated genes in 7F3915 hMSCs with that of 7F3674 and 127756 hMSCs. We compared the identified molecular signatures of the most highly up-regulated genes that we found to be expressed in 7F3915 hMSCs to those of 7F3674 and 127756 hMSCs. Of the top 30 up-regulated genes in TLR3-stimulated 7F3915 hMSCs, 7F3674 and 127756 hMSCs shared 20 genes following TLR3 stimulation, suggesting substantial similarities in their transcriptional regulation among different donors hMSCs (Fig. S1, A and B). The following inflammation-related genes were up-regulated all three different donors (7F3915, 7F3674, and 127756 hMSCs): cytokines/chemokines (CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL8, and CXCL8, etc.) and interferon-related (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44, OASL, MX1, etc.). However, we found that most of the positive regulators of inflammation-related genes were more highly induced in 7F3915 hMSCs than in 7F3674 and 127756 hMSCs following TLR3 stimulation. We also observed 7F3674 and 127756 hMSCs also had similarities in their physiological functions according to DAVID GO analysis, such as response to viruses and immune response (Fig. S1C). To identify the degree to which the 7F3915 hMSCs genes that we detected were up-regulated in immune cell types, we analyzed our published RNA-seq dataset (40Das A. Chai J.C. Kim S.H. Lee Y.S. Park K.S. Jung K.H. Chai Y.G. Transcriptome sequencing of microglial cells stimulated with TLR3 and TLR4 ligands.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 (26159724): 51710.1186/s12864-015-1728-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to compare the up-regulated genes in TLR3-stimulated BV-2 microglial cell lines with that of 7F3915 hMSCs. Using Venn diagrams, and heat maps of BV-2 microglial cell lines and hMSCs transcriptome profiles, we found that hMSCs differed in their transcriptomes from BV-2 microglial cell lines (Fig. S2, A and C). We compared the identified molecular signatures of the top 100 up-regulated genes (fold-change ≥ 1.5, and p ≤ 0.01) between hMSCs and BV-2 microglial cell lines. In hMSCs, 71 genes were up-regulated that were not common to the BV-2 microglial cell lines. In contrast, in BV-2 microglial cell lines, also 71 genes were up-regulated that were not common to the TLR3-stimulated hMSCs (Fig. S2A). The unique gene sets for hMSCs and BV-2 microglial cell lines are presented in Fig. S2C. However, TLR3-stimulated hMSCs and BV-2 microglial cell lines also displayed similarities in their transcriptomes. The following inflammation-related genes were up-regulated only in hMSCs: cytokines/chemokines (CCL2, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL6, CXCL8, IL7R, IL32, etc.) and interferon-related (GBP1, GBP4, IFI44, IFI44L, OASL, OAS1, OAS3, among others) (Fig. S2C). Thus, hMSCs and BV-2 microglial cell lines maintain their molecular signature during inflammatory responses. Next, we used IPA software to identify the network of genes and related pathways that represent the interacting genes in TLR3-stimulated 7F3915 hMSCs. Networks 1 and 2 were among the networks of DEGs after 4 h of poly(I:C) treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). The genes in network 1 are known to be involved in cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, and inflammatory response; these genes formed a direct or indirect network with the NF-κB complex (Fig. 3A). The genes in network 2 are known to be involved in antimicrobial response, inflammatory response, and dermatological diseases and conditions; these genes formed a direct or indirect network with interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family (Fig. 3B). The top 10 canonical pathways that include DEGs in the TLR3-stimulated hMSCs are listed in Fig. 3C. Interestingly, the genes in canonical pathways related to inflammation encode pattern recognition receptors for bacteria and viruses, interferon signaling, and activation of IRF by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor. To further characterize the TLR3-stimulated hMSCs, we determined the molecular and cellular functions of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in TLR3-stimulated hMSCs. We found that the top 6 of these functions are related to cellular movement, immunological disease, etc. (Fig. 3D). To better understand regulation, we focused on the transcription factors (TFs) among the DEGs in TLR3-stimulated 7F3915 hMSCs. Up-regulated TFs notably included the NF-κB family, i.e. NF-κB1, NF-κB2, NF-κBIA, NF-κBIE, NF-κBIZ, REL, and RELB (Fig. 4A), as confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4E). Next, we used IPA software to identify the target genes that were directly or indirectly regulated by TFs in TLR3-stimulated hMSCs. Interestingly, we found that cytokines, chemokines, and inflammation-related genes, including CXCL8, CXCL10, IL6, and IRF1, were regulated by TFs, including NF-κB1 and FOXO1 (Fig. 4B). Next, we used DAVID 6.8 software to identify functionally annotated processes of the FOXO1- and NF-κB1-regulated genes. We observed an enrichment of FOXO1 target genes associated with protein oligomerization and response to interleukin-1 (Fig. 4C). NF-κB1-regulated genes were determined to be related to the chemokine-mediated signaling pathway and chemotaxis (Fig. 4D). The FOXO1 and NF-κB1-regulated transcripts were determined to be associated with cytokine-mediated responses and immune responses. We analyzed the expression of several FOXO genes using real-time"
https://openalex.org/W2927500665,"The goal of this study was to provide insight into the pathogenicity of Onchocerca fasciata in Camelus bactrianus to help control onchocerciasis. From November 2015 to January 2016, the prevalence and severity of onchocerciasis were recorded in 152 camels. Nodules containing Onchocerca were collected and observed. Adult parasites were extracted from the nodules and identified via light microscopy as well as by partial sequencing of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The sequences were examined and compared to similar sequences from other Onchocerca species. In total, 80.3% of camels were parasitized. The severity of infection varied, as camels harboured between one and fifteen nodules. The morphology and the cuticle differed in both sexes and displayed considerable variation in the thickness and structure of different body parts. Identification was further confirmed using molecular biology methods. This study provides a comprehensive morphological description of Onchocerca fasciata isolated from camels. The prevalence and intensity of infection (assessed via nodules) varied in the Bactrian camels. The structure of the cuticle was an important morphological feature for species differentiation in Onchocerca. Based on our data, the morphological assessment of O. fasciata represents a reliable method to characterize other Onchocerca species."

In most developing countries, delivery time is the primary opportunity for women to access post-partum family planning methods, especially for those living in remote areas. Hence, this study assesses providers’ knowledge on postpartum intrauterine contraceptive device service provision. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Amhara region health center and hospitals. Health providers surveyed included obstetricians, gynecologists, general practitioners, emergency surgical officers, health officers, midwives and nurses from September 18, 2015 to December18, 2016. Simple random sampling was used to select 864 subjects. Data were collected by using a structured self-administered questionnaire and observing the facility. Multilevel analysis was done to see factors associated with outcome. Results A total of 197 health facilities and 864 providers are included in the final analysis. Of the total providers 524 (60.6%) were from a health center. The mean age (±SD) of participants was 27.8 years (±5.4). The number of providers with good knowledge accounted for 253 of those surveyed (29.3%). The proportion of good knowledge among trained PP-IUCD providers was 35.7% (those who scored above average), and 27.9% was untrained about PP-IUCD. A considerable heterogeneity was observed between health facilities for each indicator of provider’s knowledge. Gender differences were observed as the mean knowledge score deference on PP-IUCD by 0.4 points (β = -0.41; -0.72, -0.10) when the participant was female. Having experience of regular counseling of pregnant women increases PP-IUCD knowledge score by 0.97. (β = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.47). Where the health facility requested clients to purchase the IUCD themselves, the mean knowledge score decreased by 0.47 points compared with free of charge at the facility level (β = -0.47; 95%CI: -0.87, -0.07). Conclusion Our findings showed that providers’ knowledge about postpartum IUCD was low in the Amhara region public health facility. The lowest knowledge score was noted among nurses, health Officers, midwives, and general practice professionals. Factors associated with providers’ knowledge on PP-IUCD are the status of health facility, female sex, training on PP-IUCD, regular counseling of pregnant women, and unavailability of IUCD service."
https://openalex.org/W2926477282,"Preventive viral vaccine efficacy trials require large-scale sample analysis to quantitate immune responses and their correlation with infection outcomes. Traditional plaque reduction assays measure a functionally important form of humoral immunity, neutralizing antibody titer. These assays, however, are time-consuming and laborious. We previously developed a higher throughput assay of neutralizing antibody to herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (Blevins et al., PLOS ONE, 10(12), e0144738) using the enzyme-linked virus inducible system (ELVIS) cell line; this cell line produces β-galactosidase in response to HSV infection. Here, serum samples from recipients of an investigational vaccine in the Herpevac Trial for Women were used to compare the ELVIS cell assay with the lower throughput, traditional plaque reduction assay. We demonstrate that neutralizing antibody titers to HSV-1 or HSV-2 determined using ELVIS cells positively correlate with neutralizing antibody titers determined by traditional plaque reduction assay, thus validating a higher throughput alternative for large-scale sample analysis."
