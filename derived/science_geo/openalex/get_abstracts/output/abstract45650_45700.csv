https://openalex.org/W2080532845,"The mRNAs of transiently expressed genes frequently contain an AU-rich sequence in the 3' untranslated region. We introduced a 51 nucleotide AT sequence from a human lymphokine gene, GM-CSF, into the 3' untranslated region of the rabbit beta-globin gene. Our experiments demonstrate that this caused the otherwise stable beta-globin mRNA to become highly unstable in vivo. The instability conferred by the AU sequence in the mRNA was partially alleviated by treatment of the cells with cycloheximide. We propose that the AU sequences are the recognition signal for an mRNA processing pathway which specifically degrades the mRNAs for certain lymphokines, cytokines, and proto-oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2089828715,"The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) expanded in interleukin-2 (IL-2) to mice bearing micrometastases from various types of tumors showed that TIL are 50 to 100 times more effective in their therapeutic potency than are lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Therefore the use of TIL was explored for the treatment of mice with large pulmonary and hepatic metastatic tumors that do not respond to LAK cell therapy. Although treatment of animals with TIL alone or cyclophosphamide alone had little impact, these two modalities together mediated the elimination of large metastatic cancer deposits in the liver and lung. The combination of TIL and cyclophosphamide was further potentiated by the simultaneous administration of IL-2. With the combination of cyclophosphamide, TIL, and IL-2, 100% of mice (n = 12) bearing the MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma were cured of advanced hepatic metastases, and up to 50% of mice were cured of advanced pulmonary metastases. Techniques have been developed to isolate TIL from human tumors. These experiments provide a rationale for the use of TIL in the treatment of humans with advanced cancer."

Using gel filtration to study the formation of ovalbumin (OVA) peptide-I-Ad complexes, it is herein demonstrated that the complexes, once formed, are very stable (kd ≈ 3 × 10−6 s−1), but the rate of complex formation is very slow (ka ≈ 1 M−1 s−1), explaining the overall low equilibrium constant of ∼2 × 10−6 M. Treating the complexes with glutaraldehyde revealed that the ovalbumin peptide was cross-linked solely to the α chain of I-Ad. Planar membranes containing I-Ad-OVA complexes stimulated a T cell response with 2 × 104 less antigen than required when uncomplexed antigen was used, thus demonstrating the biologic importance of these complexes in antigen recognition."

https://openalex.org/W1699719812,"Six cysteine proteinase inhibitors were isolated from human urine by affinity chromatography on insolubilized carboxymethylpapain followed by ion-exchange chromatography and immunosorption. Physicochemical and immunochemical measurements identified one as cystatin A, one as cystatin B, one as cystatin C, one as cystatin S, and one as low molecular weight kininogen. The sixth inhibitor displayed immunochemical cross-reactivity with salivary cystatin S but had a different pI (6.85 versus 4.68) and a different (blocked) N-terminal amino acid. This inhibitor was tentatively designated cystatin SU. The isolated inhibitors accounted for nearly all of the cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity of the urinary pool used as starting material. The enzyme inhibitory properties of the inhibitors were investigated by measuring inhibition and rate constants for their interactions with papain and human cathepsin B. Antisera raised against the inhibitors were used in immunochemical determinations of their concentrations in several biological fluids. The combined enzyme kinetic and concentration data showed that several of the inhibitors have the capacity to play physiologically important roles as cysteine proteinase inhibitors in many biological fluids. Cystatin C had the highest molar concentration of the inhibitors in seminal plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and milk; cystatin S in saliva and tears; and kininogen in blood plasma, synovial fluid, and amniotic fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2039703359,"The human T-lymphotropic retrovirus HTLV-III/LAV encodes a trans-activator that increases viral gene expression. We expressed this trans-activator in animal cells and studied its structural and functional characteristics. The putative trans-activator protein was immunoprecipitated from overproducing stable cell lines and shown to migrate as a 14-kilodalton polypeptide on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. S1 nuclease mapping experiments showed that the trans-activator increases the levels of steady-state messenger RNA transcribed from the viral long terminal repeat promoter. Sequences within the R region of the HTLV-III/LAV long terminal repeat are essential for trans-activation. Quantitations of messenger RNA and protein showed that the protein increase was greater than the messenger RNA increase in CV1 and HeLa cells, indicating that more than one mechanism was responsible for the trans-activation and that cell type-specific factors may determine the final level of trans-activation."

https://openalex.org/W1544155990,"Many of the thylakoid membrane proteins of plant and algal chloroplasts are synthesized in the cytosol as soluble, higher molecular weight precursors. These precursors are post-translationally imported into chloroplasts, incorporated into the thylakoids, and proteolytically processed to mature size. In the present study, the process by which precursors are incorporated into thylakoids was reconstituted in chloroplast lysates using the precursor to the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (preLHCP) as a model. PreLHCP inserted into thylakoid membranes, but not envelope membranes, if ATP was present in the reaction mixture. Correct integration into the bilayer was verified by previously documented criteria. Integration could also be reconstituted with purified thylakoid membranes if reaction mixtures were supplemented with a soluble extract of chloroplasts. Several other thylakoid precursor proteins in addition to preLHCP, but no stromal precursor proteins, were incorporated into thylakoids under the described assay conditions. These results suggest that the observed in vitro activity represents in vivo events during the biogenesis of thylakoid proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1978130054,"The chromosomal breakpoint involved in the t(8;14)(q24;q11) chromosome translocation in the SKW-3 cell line, which directly involves the 3′ flanking region of the c-myc gene, was cloned and sequenced. The breakpoint on chromosome 8 mapped to a position 3 kb 3′ of c-myc while the chromosome 14 breakpoint occurred 36 kb 5′ of the gene for the constant region of the α chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR). The translocation resulted in a precise rearrangement of sequences on chromosome 8 and what appears to be a functional Jα segment on chromosome 14. Signal sequences for V-J joining occurred at the breakpoint positions on both chromosomes 14 and 8, suggesting that the translocation occurs during TCR gene rearrangement and that it is catalyzed by the enzymatic systems involved in V-J joining reactions. The involvement of c-myc in the translocation and the association of joining signals at the breakpoints provides a parallel to the situation observed in the translocations involving c-myc and the immunoglobulin loci in B-cell neoplasms and suggests that common mechanisms of translocation and oncogene deregulation are involved in B- and T-cell malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2120931274,"The current prevalence of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome in humans has provoked renewed interest in methods of protective immunization against retrovirus-induced diseases. In this study, a vaccinia-retrovirus recombinant vector was constructed to study mechanisms of immune protection against Friend virus leukemia in mice. The envelope (env) gene from Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) was inserted into the genome of a vaccinia virus expression vector. Infected cells synthesized gp85, the glycosylated primary product of the env gene. Processing to gp70 and p15E, and cell surface localization, were similar to that occurring in cells infected with F-MuLV. Mice inoculated with live recombinant vaccinia virus had an envelope-specific T-cell proliferative response and, after challenge with Friend virus complex, developed neutralizing antibody and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and were protected against leukemia. In contrast, unimmunized and control groups developed a delayed neutralizing antibody response, but no detectable CTL, and succumbed to leukemia. Genes of the major histocompatibility complex influenced protection induced by the vaccinia recombinant but not that induced by attenuated N-tropic Friend virus."
https://openalex.org/W1556026733,"It was previously demonstrated that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in human A431 cells undergoes a slow post-translational modification by which it acquires EGF binding capacity (Slieker, L.J., and Lane, M.D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 687-690). In this report, the role of glycosylation in the acquisition of ligand binding activity and in the intracellular translocation of the receptor precursor is characterized. Human A431 cells were incubated with [35S]methionine, and 35S-labeled EGF receptors were purified either by immunoprecipitation (total receptor) or by adsorption to an EGF affinity matrix (high affinity, or active receptor). The half-time for receptor activation is approximately 30 min and precedes its acquisition of resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (t 1/2 = 75 min), a medial Golgi event. Activation is blocked by tunicamycin and is markedly slowed (t 1/2 = 120 min) by 1-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidase I. In the latter case, the oligosaccharide chains are not further processed to complex forms. Treatment of the active high mannose receptor with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H generates a fully active aglycoreceptor polypeptide, indicating that core oligosaccharide addition is a prerequisite for activation but that oligosaccharide chains are not intrinsically required for EGF binding. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that the EGF receptor is activated in the endoplasmic reticulum and that translocation from that organelle is extremely slow (t 1/2 = 75 min). Since the latter translocation rate approximates that for the acquisition of the resistance to endoglycosidase H, transit from the endoplasmic reticulum appears to be rate-limiting for the maturation of the receptor. Both tunicamycin and 1-deoxynojirimycin inhibit exit from the endoplasmic reticulum in parallel with their effects on the acquisition of binding activity. Immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled EGF receptor with antiphosphotyrosine antibody in the presence of ATP suggested that the autophosphorylation activity of the receptor is also acquired post-translationally. The possible correlation of this to EGF binding activity is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2060032114,"Single amino acid changes were introduced into normal (non-oncogenic) and activated forms of the human H-ras protein at a position (residue 116) proposed on structural grounds to represent a contact site with guanine nucleotides. Substitutions at this site could significantly reduce the ability of both forms to bind and hydrolyze guanosine 5'-triphosphate; these substitutions, however, did not necessarily diminish the transforming capacity of activated derivatives. One substitution that severely impairs these functions activated the transforming potential of the otherwise normal polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2066471533,"The receptors of two T cell hybridomas that recognize class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, respectively, have been compared. In both cases these receptors are hybrid molecules formed as a result of cellular fusion. The receptors contain the same α chain, contributed by the tumor cell fusion partner, and related β chains, contributed by the normal T cell component. Thus, surprisingly, the same α chain can contribute to recognition of class I and class II MHC molecules. Moreover, the finding that in two independent examples hybrid receptor molecules created randomly by in vitro cell fusion recognize MHC supports the theory that the T cell repertoire has an intrinsic affinity for MHC."
https://openalex.org/W1598347620,"This study reports the entire nucleotide sequence of the protein coding region sequence of the alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) Z gene, a common form of the alpha 1AT gene associated with serum alpha 1AT deficiency. In addition to Glu342 to Lys342 mutation in exon V which has been previously identified by peptide analysis, another point mutation (GTG to GCG in exon III) in the gene sequence predicts a second amino acid substitution (Val213 to Ala213) in the Z protein. This Val213 to Ala213 mutation was confirmed to be a general finding in Z type alpha 1AT gene by evaluating genomic DNA from 40 Z haplotypes using synthetic oligonucleotide gene probes directed toward the mutated exon III sequences in the Z gene. Furthermore, the exon III Val213 to Ala213 mutation eliminates a BstEII restriction endonuclease site in the alpha 1AT Z gene, allowing rapid identification of this Val213 to Ala213 substitution at the genomic DNA level. Surprisingly, when genomic DNA samples from individuals thought to be homozygous for the M1 gene (the most common alpha 1AT haplotype) were evaluated with BstEII, 23% of the M1 haplotypes were BstEII site negative, thus identifying a new form of M1 (i.e. M1(Ala213], likely identical to M1 but with an isoelectric focusing silent amino acid substitution (Val213 to Ala213). Although the relative importance of the newly identified exon III Val213 to Ala213 mutation to the pathogenesis of the abnormalities associated with the Z gene is not known, it is likely that M1(Ala213) gene represents a common normal polymorphism of the alpha 1AT gene that served as an evolutionary intermediate between the M1(Val213) and Z genes."
https://openalex.org/W2051879599,"The critical role of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in immune response heightens the need to know its structure in order to understand its activity. New computer-assisted predictive methods for the assignment of secondary structure together with a method to predict the tertiary structure of a protein from data on its primary sequence and secondary structure were applied to IL-2. This method generated four topological families of structures, of which the most plausible is a right-handed fourfold alpha-helical bundle. Members of this family were shown to be compatible with existing structural data on disulfide bridges and monoclonal antibody binding for IL-2. Experimental estimates of secondary structure from circular dichroism and site-directed mutagenesis data support the model. A region likely to be important in IL-2 binding to its receptor was identified as residues Leu36, Met38, Leu40, Phe42, Phe44, and Met46."

https://openalex.org/W1532097092,"A marked dissociation has been observed between the timed accumulation in calcified tissues of two related vitamin K-dependent proteins, bone Gla protein (BGP) and the recently discovered matrix Gla protein (MGP). In long bone diaphyses, total levels of MGP were essentially equivalent in newborn, juvenile, and adult rats. In agreement with previous studies, BGP levels were only 5% of adult levels in newborn rat bones and increased to 90% of adult levels by 19 days of age. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of the longitudinal distribution of MGP and BGP in 14-day-old rat tibia, a bone in which new mineral is added rapidly at both growth plates. Again, MGP was essentially at the same level in the regions nearest the growth plates as in the midshaft while BGP levels were 10-fold lower in the regions nearest the growth plates. These differences in the timed accumulation of MGP and BGP in calcifying tissues indicate that MGP could function earlier in bone formation than does BGP. To further characterize the MGP antigen in bone, extracts from newborn and adult rat bones were chromatographed by gel filtration over Sephacryl S-200. All of the antigen extracted by formic acid and most of the antigen subsequently extracted by guanidine HCI emerged at the position expected for the 79-residue MGP. There was a significant difference in the fraction of total MGP which was extracted by guanidine HCI in newborn (50%) and adult (20%) bone. The radioimmunoassay for rat MGP which was developed for these studies employs rabbit antibody directed against calf MGP and rat MGP for standards and radioiodinated tracer. This assay has a sensitivity of 0.1 ng and does not detect rat or calf BGP."
https://openalex.org/W1590240981,"Subcellular fractions of neuroblastoma x glioma (NG108-15) hybrid cells were used to study the mechanism of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release. A microsomal fraction, enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes and almost devoid of mitochondria, was the most active in inositol trisphosphate- or GTP-dependent release of calcium. Neither GTP nor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate affected the calcium efflux mediated by the other reagent, suggesting that inositol trisphosphate and GTP act on different calcium-sequestrating vesicles. The stimulation of calcium release by GTP was relatively slow (t1/2 = 90 s), dependent on polyethyleneglycol, and greater at 2 X 10(-5) M calcium (5 nmol X min-1 X mg-1) than at 10(-6) M calcium (0.8 nmol X min-1 X mg-1). The inositol trisphosphate-induced calcium efflux was not mimicked by inositol monophosphate; it was fast (t1/2 less than 10 s) and unaffected by 3% polyethyleneglycol. The amount of calcium released by inositol trisphosphate was greatest at 10(-6) M external calcium (1 nmol X min-1 X mg-1) and it was undetectable at 2 X 10(-5) M calcium. A feedback inhibition of the inositol trisphosphate-induced calcium release by cytoplasmic calcium provides a safety mechanism preventing deleterious effects of abnormally high calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W1513968218,"von Willebrand factor binds to fibrillar type I collagen in a rapid, temperature-independent, reversible, specific, and saturable manner. Evaluation of binding isotherms by Scatchard-type analysis demonstrated that 6-18 micrograms of von Willebrand factor bind per mg of collagen, with Ka between 2 and 8 X 10(8) M-1. Five distinct tryptic fragments, purified under denaturing and reducing conditions and representing over 75% of the molecular mass of the von Willebrand factor subunit, were tested for their capacity to inhibit the von Willebrand factor-collagen interaction. Complete inhibition was obtained with a 52/48-kDa fragment at a concentration of approximately 1 microM. The location of this fragment in the subunit was established to be between Val-449 and Lys-728. Fifteen monoclonal antibodies against the 52/48-kDa fragment inhibited von Willebrand factor binding to collagen. Six antibodies against other portions of the von Willebrand factor subunit had no inhibitory effect. The tryptic fragment was a competitive inhibitor of von Willebrand factor binding to collagen and, therefore, recognizes the same interaction site as the intact molecule. These studies precisely define a domain in the von Willebrand factor subunit that interacts with type I collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1601858448,"Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is formed in response to specific agonists that cause activation of phospholipase C and degradation of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. IP3 is a second messenger that releases Ca2+ from the dense tubular system to the cytosol in stimulated platelets. Our present information indicates that [3H]IP3 is dephosphorylated to [3H]inositol bisphosphate (IP2) and [3H]inositol monophosphate (IP) by human platelets treated with 0.05-0.10% Triton X-100. This dephosphorylation of [3H]IP3 to [3H]IP2 and [3H]IP is also observed when platelets are permeabilized by electrical stimulation or by 20 micrograms/ml saponin. These detergents or electropermeabilization allow IP3 to access cytosolic IP3 phosphatase. Pretreatment of intact platelets with phorbol dibutyrate and 1-oleyl-2-acetyldiacylglycerol for 30 s, at concentrations that maximally activate protein kinase C, stimulates the conversion of IP3 to IP2 and IP. This suggests a role for protein kinase C in the regulation of IP3 degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2148254572,"Ca2+ release triggered by inositol trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) has been measured in saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes with 45Ca2+ or Quin 2. The initial rate of Ca2+ release was not greatly affected by the incubation temperature (175 +/- 40 pmol X s-1 X mg dry weight-1, at 30 degrees C versus 133 +/- 24 pmol X s-1 X mg dry weight-1 at 4 degrees C). The amount of Ca2+ released by Ins(1,4,5)P3 was not affected by pH (6.5-8.0). La3+ (100 microM) markedly inhibited the effect of 1 microM Ins(1,4,5)P3. The possibility that La3+ chelates Ins(1,4,5)P3 cannot be excluded since the effect of La3+ could be overcome by increasing the Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration. Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ release showed a requirement for permeant cations in the incubation medium. Optimal release was observed with potassium gluconate. Other monovalent cations, with the exception of Li+, can substitute for K+. Permeant anions, at concentrations above 40 mM, inhibited Ca2+ release produced by Ins(1,4,5)P3. Cl-, Br-, I-, and SO2-4 were equally effective as inhibitors. Ins(1,4,5)P3 also caused the release of 54Mn2+ and 85Sr2+ accumulated by the permeabilized hepatocytes. Our results are consistent with Ins(1,4,5)P3 promoting the membrane translocation of divalent cations through an ion channel rather than an ion carrier. The translocation of positive charge through this channel is balanced by ancillary movements of monovalent cations and anions across the reticular membranes. The transport systems responsible for these compensatory ion movements may represent a potential site for the regulation of the hormone-mediated Ca2+ signal."
https://openalex.org/W1489800773,"The lysosomal cysteine proteinases cathepsin L and cathepsin B were examined for their effect on the neutrophil elastase inhibitory activity of human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI). Human cathepsin L catalytically inactivated human alpha 1PI by cleavage of the bonds Glu354-Ala355 and Met358-Ser359 (the serine proteinase inhibitory site). Cathepsin B did not inactivate alpha 1PI, even when equimolar amounts of enzyme were employed. Cathepsin L is the first human proteinase shown to catalytically inactivate alpha 1PI. These findings, in conjunction with other reports, suggest that alpha 1PI contains a proteolytically sensitive region encompassing residues 350-358. Taken together with the discovery of the elastinolytic activity of cathepsin L (Mason, R. W., Johnson, D. A., Barrett, A. J., and Chapman, H. A. (1986) Biochem. J. 233, 925-927), the present findings emphasize the possible importance of cathepsin L in the pathological proteolysis of elastin and diminish the role that can be attributed to cathepsin B in such processes."
https://openalex.org/W1489822375,"The effects of phorbol esters, dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), and micromolar Ca2+ on protein phosphorylation and catecholamine secretion in digitonin-treated chromaffin cells were investigated. [gamma-32P]ATP was used as a substrate for phosphorylation in the permeabilized cells. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) enhanced Ca2+-dependent catecholamine secretion from digitonin-permeabilized cells. The enhancement required MgATP. Only those phorbol esters which activate protein kinase C in vitro enhanced both catecholamine secretion and protein phosphorylation. DiC8, which activates protein kinase C in vitro and mimics phorbol ester effects in situ, also enhanced both catecholamine secretion and protein phosphorylation. Preincubation of intact cells with TPA or DiC8 was necessary for maximal effects on both catecholamine secretion and protein phosphorylation in subsequently digitonin-treated chromaffin cells. The TPA-induced enhancement of protein phosphorylation was almost entirely Ca2+-independent, whereas DiC8-induced enhancement of protein phosphorylation was mainly Ca2+-dependent. Micromolar Ca2+ alone also enhanced the phosphorylation of a large number of proteins. Most of the proteins phosphorylated in response to TPA or potentiated by DiC8 in combination with Ca2+ were also phosphorylated by micromolar Ca2+ in the absence of exogenous protein kinase C activators. In intact cells, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) induced Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of at least 17 proteins which were detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. All of the proteins phosphorylated upon incubation with 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium were phosphorylated upon incubation with micromolar Ca2+ in digitonin-treated cells. These results demonstrate that TPA- or DiC8-enhanced Ca2+-dependent catecholamine secretion is associated with enhanced protein phosphorylation which is probably mediated by protein kinase C and that activation of protein kinase C modulates catecholamine secretion from digitonin-treated chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984040687,"The permeability of gap junctions to tetraethylammonium ions was measured in isolated pairs of blastomeres from Rana pipiens L. and compared to the junctional conductance. In this system, the junctional conductance is voltage-dependent and decreases with moderate transjunctional voltage of either sign. The permeability to tetraethylammonium ions was determined by injecting one cell of a pair with tetraethylammonium and monitoring its changing concentration in the prejunctional and postjunctional cells with ion-selective electrodes. Junctional conductance was determined by current-clamp and voltage-clamp techniques. For different cell pairs in which the transjunctional voltage was small and the junctional conductance at its maximum value, the permeability to tetraethylammonium ions was proportional to the junctional conductance. In individual cell pairs, a reduction in the junctional conductance induced by voltage was accompanied by a proportional reduction in the permeability of the gap junction over a wide range. The diameter of the tetraethylammonium ion (8.0 to 8.5 A, unhydrated) is larger than that of the potassium ion (4.6 A, hydrated), the predominant current-carrying species. The proportionality between the permeability to tetraethylammonium ions and the junctional conductance, measured here with exceptionally fine time resolution, indicates that a common gap junctional pathway mediates both electrical and chemical fluxes between cells, and that closure of single gap junction channels by voltage is all or none."
https://openalex.org/W1561429200,"myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is an intracellular second messenger generated from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C. In the present study, we have used the abilities of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inhibit inositol 1,4,5-tris[32P]phosphate binding and to stimulate release of sequestered stores of 45Ca2+ to assay the mass of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in extracts derived from [3H]inositol-prelabeled chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils. These assays are specific for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate since the relative capacity of the extracts to compete with inositol 1,4,5-tris[32P]phosphate binding and to release 45Ca2+ correlated well with the [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate content of the extract as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. No correlation of these activities was observed with the content in the extract of either [3H]inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate or [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, whose formation exhibited kinetics distinct from [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Thus, within 10 s of stimulation with 10 nM formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate content of the extract increased from 0.05 to 0.55 pmol/10(6) cells, equivalent to a change in intracellular concentration from 100 nM to 1.1 microM. These studies demonstrate that neutrophils produce sufficient quantities of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores."
https://openalex.org/W1586453877,"Growth regulators such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) regulate the synthesis and secretion of certain proteins by cells in culture. The secretion pattern of each cell line and the effect of growth regulators on the secretion pattern are unique. EGF increased the secreted and intracellular levels of mitogen-regulated protein (MRP) and major excreted protein (MEP) by Swiss 3T3 cells. MRP is related by sequence to prolactin. MEP is a thiol protease located intracellularly in the lysosomes. EGF also selectively induced a 52,000-dalton mitogen-induced protein (MIP 52) secreted by human fibroblasts. Two types of TGF-betas were tested for their effects on the expression of secreted proteins in mouse and human fibroblasts: TGF-beta from human platelets and a growth inhibitor (GI/TGF-beta) secreted by BSC-1 cells. Each selectively decreased the levels of the two secreted proteins induced by growth factors in mouse embryo 3T3 cells and one secreted protein induced by growth factors in human fibroblasts. Platelet TGF-beta and GI/TGF-beta also induced one 48,000-dalton protein secreted by human fibroblasts. Synthesis of DNA and the incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein in Swiss 3T3 cells were not affected by platelet TGF-beta or GI/TGF-beta. Thus, the inhibitory effect of platelet TGF-beta on the synthesis and secretion of these three proteins is due to a specific effect of platelet TGF-beta on the regulation of MRP and MEP that does not interfere with the ability of EGF to stimulate DNA or protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1607763892,"We report that aurone derivatives of plant extracts produce potent, dose-dependent, and ultimately complete inhibition of three different metabolic monodeiodination pathways catalyzed by rat liver microsomal type I iodothyronine deiodinase. These data show that (3'),4',4,6-(tetra)trihydroxyaurones are the most potent naturally occurring plant-derived inhibitors of this deiodinase enzyme (IC50 V 0.5 microM). Lineweaver-Burk analysis using both L-thyroxine (T4) and 3',5',3-triiodothyronine as substrates suggests a cofactor competitive mechanism of inhibition for 4',4,6-trihydroxyaurone which also can displace 125I-L-T4 from binding to thyroxine-binding prealbumin with a potency comparable to its inhibition of T4-5'-deiodinase. Among type I deiodinase inhibitors, cofactor competition has been observed only for propylthiourea. Computer graphic modeling studies were also carried out to explore aurone conformations and to compare them with those of the thyroid hormones. This analysis shows that the aurones can adopt either a planar or an antiskewed conformation, such as observed for 3',5',3-triiodothyronine, the most potent natural deiodinase substrate inhibitor. The thyroxine-binding prealbumin complex was used to model the deiodinase ligand binding site because of the similarity observed between inhibitor binding affinity and enzyme inhibition characteristics. These studies show that the aurones which adopt an antiskewed conformation can interact favorably in the prealbumin binding site. This model of the deiodinase active site can be used to design other deiodinase inhibitors."

Since uromodulin has been purified to homogeneity, this should allow extensive further characterization of the mechanism of action of both uromodulin and IL-1."
https://openalex.org/W1498506108,"The generation of the two inositol trisphosphate (IP3) isomers, 1,4,5-IP3 and 1,3,4-IP3, and its relation to changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, in response to the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe was studied in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60, induced to differentiate with dimethyl sulfoxide. Stimulation by fMet-Leu-Phe within seconds transiently elevates 1,4,5-IP3 to peak values averaging 8-fold basal levels, and leads to a concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i and to degranulation. These responses are followed by a slower and more sustained rise in 1,3,4-IP3. Alterations in [Ca2+]i modulate differentially the generation of the two IP3 isomers. At [Ca2+]i lower than 30 nM, no IP3 is generated upon fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation. Working at normal resting [Ca2+]i, but preventing the fMet-Leu-Phe induced transient rise in [Ca2+]i (by prior depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and working in calcium-free medium) the fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation of 1,3,4-IP3 levels is attenuated, whereas the response of 1,4,5-IP3 is not significantly altered. Maintained elevation of [Ca2+]i to micromolar levels with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin generates enhanced 1,3,4-IP3 levels in the absence of fMet-Leu-Phe, whereas the fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation of 1,4,5-IP3 generation is markedly inhibited. Pertussis toxin selectively abolishes the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced IP3 production, whereas ionomycin stimulation of 1,3,4-IP3 generation is unaffected. These findings indicate that in intact cells: receptor-triggered phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphodiesterase activation has a minimal Ca2+ requirement, but does not depend on a previous or concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i; Ca2+ elevations above micromolar levels decrease the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced generation of 1,4,5-IP3; and 1,3,4-IP3 generation is not directly linked to receptor activation and appears to result both from increased [Ca2+]i and 1,4,5-IP3 levels."
https://openalex.org/W2160670544,"The physical changes representing a memory are believed to be localized to specific neurons, widely distributed in multiple parallel pathways in the brain. 2-Fluorodeoxyglucose, labeled with two discriminable radioactive tracers, was used to construct quantitative metabolic maps in split-brain cats during a visual task. One side of the brain served to estimate the metabolic variability of nonspecific influences. The other side was used to map metabolic changes related to the presence of previously learned visual cues, as well as changes related to nonspecific influences, in the same periods of time. When the two sides were compared, between 5 million and 100 million neurons (depending upon the significance level selected) were identified in which activity increased during presentation of the familiar cues. The wide distribution of these neurons throughout the brain is compatible with prior evidence of a distributed memory system. However, the large number of neurons involved is difficult to reconcile with theories in which individual neurons are dedicated to specific memories."
https://openalex.org/W1562579131,"The intracellular distribution and diffusivity of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was studied by cryomicrodissection of individual Rana pipiens oocytes. We measured ATP concentrations in the nucleus, in animal and vegetal hemisphere cytoplasm, and in an intracellular reference phase (iRP, a microinjected gelatin organelle) which samples diffusive ATP. Regional concentrations were not equal: nucleus much greater than animal ooplasm greater than vegetal ooplasm. ATP binding and water availability (as solvent) were determined by plotting nuclear and cytoplasmic ATP concentrations as a function of reference phase ATP concentrations (isothermal analysis). The nucleus/iRP isotherm for ATP was an equimolar line, showing that nucleoplasm resembles iRP gelatin (and consequently a simple aqueous solution) in its solvent properties. Cytoplasm/iRP isotherms were more complex, having slopes much less than unity and ordinal intercepts above the graph's origin. They demonstrate the presence in cytoplasm of mechanisms that are capable of excluding and binding ATP. These mechanisms are responsible for the inhomogeneity in ATPs intracellular distribution. In addition, exclusion and binding have different and opposing effects on ATP concentrations in the cell's soluble space, and hence on ATP availability to enter into cellular reactions. It follows that these phenomena must be considered in attempts to model ATPs role in metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1553476760,"Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the circular muscle layer of guinea pig stomach and permeabilized by brief exposure to saponin. Both permeabilized and intact muscle cells contracted in response to cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and acetylcholine, but only permeabilized muscle cells contracted in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). The contractile response to InsP3 was prompt (peak less than 5 s), concentration-dependent (EC50-0.3 microM), and insensitive to antimycin or oligomycin. Contraction induced by either InsP3 or CCK-8 was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in free Ca2+ that was directly correlated with the magnitude of contraction. Both InsP3 and CCK-8 caused rapid net efflux of Ca2+ from cells preloaded with 45Ca2+. Contraction, increase in free Ca2+ concentration, and net 45Ca2+ efflux elicited by a combination of maximal concentrations of InsP3 and CCK-8 were not significantly different from those elicited by maximal concentrations of either agent alone. Repeated stimulation of single muscle cells with either InsP3 or CCK-8 in Ca2+-free medium caused eventual loss of the contractile response to all agents. The response to all agents was restored upon re-exposure of the cell to a cytosol-like concentration of Ca2+, implying equal access of InsP3 and receptor-linked agonists to the same intracellular Ca2+ store. The results demonstrate that InsP3 mimics the effects of receptor-linked agonists on contraction and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in permeabilized smooth muscle cells that retain the functional properties of intact smooth muscle cells and support a role for InsP3 as membrane-derived messenger responsible for mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577741482,"PC12 cells, a cloned rat pheochromocytoma cell line, were treated with digitonin to render the plasma membrane permeable to ions and proteins. At a cell density of 2-6 X 10(5) cells/cm2, incubation with 7.5 microM digitonin permitted a Ca2+-dependent release of 25-40% of the catecholamine within 18 min in the presence of 10 microM Ca2+. Half-maximal secretion occurred at 0.5-1 microM Ca2+. PC12 cultures at lower cell densities were more sensitive to digitonin and gave more variable results. Secretion in the presence of digitonin and Ca2+ began after a 2-min lag and continued for up to 30 min. When cells were treated for 3 min in digitonin and then stimulated with Ca2+ in the absence of digitonin, secretion occurred in the same manner but without the initial lag. Optimal secretion from PC12 cells was also dependent upon the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Permeabilized PC12 cells exhibited a slow time-dependent loss of secretory responsiveness which was correlated with the release of a cytosolic marker, lactate dehydrogenase (134 kDa). This suggests that digitonin permeabilization allows soluble constituents necessary for secretion to leave the cell in addition to allowing Ca2+ and ATP access into the cell interior. Ca2+-dependent secretion was completely inhibited by exposure of digitonin-permeabilized cells to 100 micrograms/ml trypsin (27 kDa), whereas secretion was only slightly inhibited by trypsin exposure prior to digitonin treatment. Thus, an intracellular, trypsin-sensitive protein is probably involved in secretion. The data also indicate that the same population of digitonin-treated cells which responded to Ca2+ was permeable to a 27-kDa protein. 1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol esters which activate protein kinase C enhanced the Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent secretion in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells. Thus, protein kinase C appears to be involved in the regulation of catecholamine secretion from permeabilized PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1535602884,"The TT cells are a continuous line of human C-cells derived from a medullary thyroid carcinoma. These cells produce large quantities of calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by the differential splicing of a single calcitonin gene transcript. We have used specific cDNA probes for calcitonin and CGRP to study the regulation of the calcitonin gene by dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from the TT cells showed hybridization of the calcitonin probe to 3600- and 1000-base RNA species. The CGRP probe hybridized to 3600- and 1050-base RNA species. Dexamethasone treatment (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) of TT cells (for 6 days) caused a dosage-dependent increase in calcitonin mRNA levels and a decrease in CGRP mRNA levels. These findings were confirmed in time course studies where dexamethasone treatment (10(-6) M) caused a 2-13-fold increase in calcitonin mRNA and a 40-60% decrease in CGRP mRNA between 4 and 6 days of treatment; the effect was reversible after dexamethasone withdrawal. After excluding an effect of dexamethasone on calcitonin and CGRP mRNA stability, we have concluded that dexamethasone affects the splicing mechanism to favor production of calcitonin mRNA over CGRP mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1507296955,"Purified osteocalcin from cow and calf bone was analyzed for nonenzymatic glycosylation (glycation) by sodium [3H]borohydride reduction. Calf bone was found to be approximately 5% glycated, while bone from mature cows was 10% glycated. These results were confirmed by a second method which utilizes periodate oxidation followed by formaldehyde fluorescence. Osteocalcin in human bone was also found to be glycated. The content of glycated osteocalcin from the bones of 47 nondiabetic individuals, aged 0.6-97, was dependent upon age. The extent of glycation was lowest in children, was constant through the adult years, and increased linearly in bone taken from individuals aged 60-97. Glycated osteocalcin was purified by boronate affinity chromatography and subjected to one-step Edman degradation. It was established that the site of glycation was the amino-terminal tyrosine. Increases in the amount of glycated osteocalcin in the bones of older individuals may play a role in the pathogenesis of senile osteoporosis and in the osteopenia which may accompany diabetes mellitus."

https://openalex.org/W1605583295,"A new FAD-dependent monooxygenase, 4-aminobenzoate hydroxylase that catalyzes the decarboxylative hydroxylation of 4-aminobenzoate and forms 4-hydroxyaniline in the presence of NAD(P)H and O2 has been purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography, chromatofocusing, and Sephadex G-100 chromatography from Agaricus bisporus, a common edible mushroom. The molecular weight of the enzyme, which consists of a single polypeptide, is 49,000. The enzyme contains 0.91 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme. Stoichiometric studies show that 1 mol of 4-aminobenzoate is converted to an equimolecular amount of 4-hydroxyaniline and CO2 with the consumption of 1 mol each of NADH and molecular oxygen. Results obtained isotopically with 18O2 show that one atom of molecular oxygen is incorporated into 4-hydroxyaniline formed from 4-aminobenzoate. The enzyme is most active between pH 6.5 and 8.0 in the oxidation of NADH and between pH 6.0 and 7.5 in the case of NADPH. The Km values for 4-aminobenzoate, NADH, and O2 are 20.4, 13.6, and 200 microM, respectively, and that for NADPH is 133 microM. Other substituted benzoates with free amino and carboxyl groups in the ortho or para position (e.g. 4-aminosalicylate and anthranilate) serve as substrates for hydroxylation, but, in these cases, H2O2 is formed simultaneously with the hydroxylation. The enzyme is insensitive to the chelators of iron and copper, sodium arsenite, and KCN. Heavy metal ions and p-chloromercuribenzoate severely inhibit the enzyme enzyme"
https://openalex.org/W1488831757,"cDNA analyses predict that the human calcitonin gene encodes the two precursor proteins of calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The mRNAs for the putative precursors of these peptides are derived from alternative processing of the primary transcript of this gene. The 75 amino-terminal residues of each preprohormone are predicted to be identical. We have developed the TT human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line as a model to study human calcitonin gene expression. Mature calcitonin and CGRP are major secretory products of this cell line. Extracts of TT cells radiolabeled with amino acids for 1 h contained only one peak of either immunoprecipitable calcitonin or CGRP on reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Each of these species had an Mr = 12,800 as estimated by gel filtration chromatography. The results of partial amino-terminal microsequencing of these two precursors were identical. Residues 2, 11, and 14 of each precursor were proline, and residues 7, 17, 24, 25, 26, and 29 were leucine. The unique alignment of the positions of these amino acids with the cDNA-predicted sequence for the common region of preprocalcitonin and preproCGRP suggests that the site of signal sequence cleavage occurs after residue 25 of both preprophormones. These studies represent the first identification of procalcitonin (116 amino acids) from a human cell line and of proCGRP (103 amino acids) from any tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1567639684,"Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from rat liver exhibited an azide-insensitive Mg2+-ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump which accumulated Ca2+ at a rate of 5.1 +/- 0.5 nmol of calcium/mg of protein/min and reached a total accumulation of 33.2 +/- 2.6 nmol of calcium/mg of protein in 20 microM Ca2+ at 37 degrees C. Equiosmotic addition of 50 mM Na+ resulted in a loss of accumulated calcium. Measurement of Mg2+-ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the presence of 50 mM Na+ revealed no effect of Na+ on the initial rate of Ca2+ uptake, but a decrease in the total accumulation. The half-maximal effect of Na+ on Ca2+ accumulation was achieved at 14 mM. The Ca2+ efflux rate constant in the absence of Na+ was 0.16 +/- 0.01 min-1, whereas the efflux rate constant in the presence of 50 mM Na+ was 0.25 +/- 0.02 min-1. Liver homogenate sedimentation fractions from 1,500 to 105,000 X g were assayed for azide-insensitive Mg2+-ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation. Na+-sensitive Ca2+ uptake activity was found to specifically co-sediment with the plasma membrane-associated enzymes, 5'-nucleotidase and Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas Na+-insensitive Ca2+ uptake was found to co-sediment with the endoplasmic reticulum-associated enzyme, glucose-6-phosphatase. The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump was also distinguished from the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump by its sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate. Half-maximal inhibition of plasma membrane Ca2+ uptake occurred at 0.8 microM VO4(3-), whereas half-maximal inhibition of microsomal Ca2+ uptake occurred at 40 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1968432290,"This work was aimed at understanding the mechanisms of T-lymphocyte function by studying the cellular distribution and traffic of molecules of the T-cell receptor complex. The accumulation of specific molecules in intracytoplasmic vesicles is related to the activation of T lymphocytes. Some of these molecules include acid hydrolases, the transferrin receptor, and class I antigens of the major histocompatibility complex. Molecules of the T-cell receptor complex have now also been found in intracytoplasmic vesicles in a human T-cell line derived from a lymphoblastic leukemia. Such vesicles were tightly associated with the cytoplasmic microtubule network. One functional aspect of this association is a cellular pathway by which vesicles traveling to and from the cell surface converge in an area of the cells that is rich in processing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2135131794,"Controlled proteolysis of epidermal growth factor from the mouse leads to fragments of mouse epidermal growth factor containing residues 1-48 and 1-45. The COOH-terminal pentapeptide appears to play a crucial role in determining the hydrophobic interactions between the hormone and the stationary phase during gel chromatography on TSK-125 gel. Proton NMR studies indicate that the overall structure of mouse epidermal growth factor is retained in the protein devoid of the COOH-terminal pentapeptide, while subsequent cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-45 and Asp-46 starts to perturb the proton resonances most characteristic of the tertiary structure of the hormone, especially those from the aromatic ring protons of Tyr-37. Consequently, photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization experiments show an increased exposure of Tyr-37 in the fragment of mouse epidermal growth factor containing residues 1-48. Nuclear Overhauser data suggest that structural changes do occur on fragmentation but seem to be localized in the tiered-beta-sheet domain which contains Tyr-37."
https://openalex.org/W1668399282,"There is increasing evidence that protein kinase C plays a role in the transduction of an activation signal in lymphocytes. The bulk of this evidence is based on pharmacological experiments involving the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) as a protein kinase C agonist. However, in cytotoxic T lymphocytes, PMA has been shown to both stimulate and inhibit lytic function. By examining the effects of a series of phorbol esters on protein kinase C activity in lymphocytes, we will demonstrate that these antagonistic effects of PMA on cytotoxic T lymphocyte function are related to multiple effects of PMA on protein kinase C activity."

https://openalex.org/W1600236137,"At an intermediate stage in the hydrolysis of MgATP by actomyosin there is an exchange of oxygen between water and the terminal phosphoryl group of MgATP, tightly bound to the myosin active site. This intermediate oxygen exchange results from the reversible hydrolysis of the bound MgATP. The rate of the exchange cycle (hydrolysis and the reverse) is assumed to be determined by the rate of reverse hydrolysis; and the average time available for exchange is determined by the post-exchange reaction that immediately follows the cycle. Past analytical studies of the exchange, using actomyosin mixtures and myofibrils at room temperature, have revealed two pathways for hydrolysis, operating at a comparable flux but differing greatly in the extent of exchange they support. It is shown here that these pathways also appear over a range of temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C and that temperature had little effect on their relative fluxes. At each temperature, the flux ratio (%) for the low exchange pathway: high exchange pathway was near 50:50 for actomyosin mixtures and 60:40 for myofibrils. Apparently, the rate-limiting steps that determine the fluxes of the two pathways have a similar temperature dependence. However, the analysis indicates that one or both of the steps that determine the extent of exchange (reverse-hydrolysis and/or the post-exchange reaction) shows a different temperature dependence for the two pathways. We interpret this to reflect a difference in the temperature dependence of the post-exchange reaction, which we propose is exceedingly fast and independent of actin concentration along the low exchange route, but slow and dependent on the actin concentration along the high exchange route. Thus at all temperatures over a broad range of actin concentration there are two pathways of comparable flux that differ primarily in the time available for exchange."
