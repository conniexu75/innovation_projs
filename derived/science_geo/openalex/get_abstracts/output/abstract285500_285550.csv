https://openalex.org/W2117071955,"In the cat, the cortical arousal induced by reticular or nociceptive stimulation is more intense and more long-lasting after elimination of the caudal and medial part of the medulla than in preparations with intact brain. This difference is explained by the intervention of a phasic-ascending inhibitory bulbar control secondarily triggered by the mesencephalic activating system."

https://openalex.org/W1974102954,"1. Spectroscopic evidence has been obtained of the occurrence of germanium in certain siderites, siderolites and aerolites. 2. Judging from the number and intensity of spectral lines the germanium in these meteorites is present in traces. 3. Germanium has been extracted from Toluca and Welland siderites. 4. Arsenic has been extracted from Toluca and Welland siderites."
https://openalex.org/W2067651398,"Malpighi's discovery of periodic reversal of direction in the heart-beat of the silkworm pupa and moth has remained almost in oblivion for nearly 260 years. Reaumur held that in the pupa and adult moth the heart beats backward; in the caterpillar, forward. Cornalia confirmed Malpighi's observations regarding the pupa, but made no observations on the adult. Bataillon's description of periodic reversal during and around metamorphosis is mainly correct, but he wrongly held that inverse (backward) circulation exclusively occurs in the pupa after the first few hours and forward circulation exclusively in the adult. Fischer and Gerould independently discovered periodic reversal in the chrysalids of various Lepidoptera (Colias, etc.). Bataillon and Fischer regarded reversal and slow backward beating as due chiefly to increased acidity of the blood at metamorphosis. Gerould later found that periodic reversal is not transitory but characteristic of the adult in Lepidoptera generally, as well as of the prepupa and pupa, and that, as in Ascidians, it cannot be explained by the back-pressure hypothesis which he at first advanced. Its explanation must be sought in chemical conditions, and these conditions persist to the end of adult life."
