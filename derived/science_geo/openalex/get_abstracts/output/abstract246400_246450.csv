Our previous observation that Hsp70 inhibits cytochrome c release in heat-stressed cells led us to examine events occurring upstream of mitochondrial disruption. In this study we examined the effects of heat shock on the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax because of its central role in regulating cytochrome c release in stressed cells. We found that heat shock caused a conformational change in Bax that leads to its translocation to mitochondria, stable membrane association, and oligomerization. All of these events were inhibited in cells that had elevated levels of Hsp70. Hsp70 did not physically interact with Bax in control or heat-shocked cells, indicating that Hsp70 acts to suppress signals leading to Bax activation. Hsp70 inhibited stress-induced JNK activation and inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or by expression of a dominant negative mutant of JNK-blocked Bax translocation as effectively as Hsp70 overexpression. Hsp70 did not protect cells expressing a mutant form of Bax that has constitutive membrane insertion capability or cells treated with a small molecule activator of apoptosome formation, indicating that it is unable to prevent cell death after mitochondrial disruption and caspase activation have occurred. These results indicate that Hsp70 blocks heat-induced apoptosis primarily by inhibiting Bax activation and thereby preventing the release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria. Hsp70, therefore, inhibits events leading up to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in heat-stressed cells and thereby controls the decision to die but does not interfere with cell death after this event has occurred.

Regulated cell death is essential for the proper functioning of all multicellular organisms. Cells that have been damaged by stress have the option of actively engaging the intrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to their self-destruction (1.Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 2.Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3990) Google Scholar). Dismantling of the dying cell is carried out by the caspase family of cysteine proteases, which normally lie dormant in healthy cells (3.Riedl S.J. Shi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). Their activation requires the formation of the apoptosome, an oligomeric complex containing an active initiator caspase (caspase-9), which processes and activates effector caspases (caspases 3, 6, and 7). Formation of the apoptosome occurs through a cytochrome c-mediated conformational change in the cytosolic protein Apaf-1 5The abbreviations used are: Apaf-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; AA2, apoptosis activating compound 2, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]-1H-indole-2,3-dione; BH, Bcl-2 homology; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate hydrate; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; DEVDase, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp cleavage activity; DST, disuccinimidyl tartrate; LEHDase, Leu-Glu-His-Asp cleavage activity; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; dnJNK1, dominant negative JNK1 mutant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PErTA70, PEER (human acute lymphoblastic T cell line) with tetracycline-regulated expression of Hsp70; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein.5The abbreviations used are: Apaf-1, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; AA2, apoptosis activating compound 2, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]-1H-indole-2,3-dione; BH, Bcl-2 homology; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate hydrate; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; DEVDase, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp cleavage activity; DST, disuccinimidyl tartrate; LEHDase, Leu-Glu-His-Asp cleavage activity; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Hsp, heat shock protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; dnJNK1, dominant negative JNK1 mutant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PErTA70, PEER (human acute lymphoblastic T cell line) with tetracycline-regulated expression of Hsp70; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein. that facilitates its oligomerization and pro-caspase-9 recruitment (4.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the process of cell death is controlled by the regulated release of cytochrome c and other proapoptogenic factors such as the apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria (5.Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). This step is under the control of the Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins (6.Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Each of the anti-apoptotic members of this family contains 3 or 4 conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. Their ability to suppress apoptosis is prevented by interactions with pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins. It is believed that discrete stress signals are conveyed to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by diverse BH3-only proteins (6.Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the prosurvival function of these proteins is essential for the activation of the proapoptotic BH1-3 family members Bax and Bak, although some BH3-only members can directly activate Bax (7.Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which stress leads to Bax activation is not completely understood. Once activated, the normally cytoplasmic Bax assumes a conformation that exposes its C-terminal membrane insertion domain allowing it to integrate into the outer mitochondrial membrane where its oligomerization leads to membrane permeabilization (8.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 9.Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar).Another option that is available to cells under stress is to suppress the apoptotic program and attempt to repair the damage. This can be accomplished by members of the heat shock protein family of molecular chaperones. These proteins play essential roles in regulating protein conformation by preventing protein misfolding and aggregation as well as assisting in the productive folding of proteins to their native state (12.Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). When cells are exposed to protein-damaging stresses, the increased burden of non-native protein conformations triggers the transcriptional induction of heat shock protein genes (13.Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Cells recovering from a transient exposure to mild hyperthermia contain elevated levels of heat shock proteins and consequently possess an increased ability to tolerate normally lethal exposures to elevated temperatures, a phenomenon known as induced thermotolerance (14.Gerner E.W. Schneider M.J. Nature. 1975; 256: 500-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This thermotolerant state is in part attributable to the ability of heat shock proteins to inhibit apoptosis (15.Mosser D.D. Martin L.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The induced synthesis of heat shock proteins represents an adaptive response that allows organisms to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions.The ability to suppress apoptosis must be tightly regulated to prevent the inappropriate survival of damaged cells. Deregulated apoptosis is an essential step in tumor progression (16.Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21915) Google Scholar). Tumor cells often contain elevated levels of antiapoptotic proteins or express reduced levels or defective forms of proapoptotic proteins including Bax (17.Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Several of the heat shock proteins are also overexpressed in tumors, and the selective prosurvival advantage that they provide could contribute to the process of tumorigenesis (18.Jaattela M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 19.Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Consequently, targeting heat shock protein function in tumor cells is currently assessed as a potential anticancer therapy (20.Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Clearly, an understanding of how heat shock proteins prevent apoptosis will be needed to effectively judge whether they will serve as useful therapeutic targets.The heat shock proteins appear to be pleiotropic inhibitors of apoptotic pathways. Hsp70, the major stress-inducible heat shock protein, has been shown to inhibit the stress-induced JNK signaling pathway (21.Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 22.Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Rits S. Shifrin V.I. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) as well as events that are independent of caspase activation, including prevention of lysosomal disruption (28.Nylandsted J. Gyrd-Hansen M. Danielewicz A. Fehrenbacher N. Lademann U. Hoyer-Hansen M. Weber E. Multhoff G. Rohde M. Jaattela M. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and nuclear uptake of apoptosis inducing factor (29.Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Whether Hsp70 acts directly to suppress all of these effects to maintain survival under diverse forms of stress-induced apoptosis is not clear. Two studies have reported an ability of Hsp70 to prevent apoptosis without inhibiting cytochrome c release (30.Jaattela M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 31.Li C.Y. Lee J.S. Ko Y.G. Kim J.I. Seo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25665-25671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As well, a number of reports indicate that inhibition of JNK activation is not universally observed in cells overexpressing Hsp70 (21.Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 27.Buzzard K.A. Giaccia A.J. Killender M. Anderson R.L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Recently, the ability of Hsp70 to prevent the cytochrome c/dATP-mediated activation of Apaf-1 in vitro has been questioned (28.Nylandsted J. Gyrd-Hansen M. Danielewicz A. Fehrenbacher N. Lademann U. Hoyer-Hansen M. Weber E. Multhoff G. Rohde M. Jaattela M. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 32.Steel R. Doherty J.P. Buzzard K. Clemons N. Hawkins C.J. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51490-51499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Much of the focus on the antiapoptotic function of Hsp70 has been on events that occur after mitochondrial disruption. In contrast there is very little information on the effects of hyperthermia on the activity of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and how heat shock proteins might regulate their activities. In this study we examined the effects of heat shock on the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of Hsp70. An important question was whether or not Hsp70 could prevent apoptosis after Bax translocation and apoptosome formation had occurred. Our results suggest that inhibition of Bax translocation to mitochondria by Hsp70 is the critical determining factor in the cellular decision to either initiate or suppress heat-induced apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The following primary antibodies were used for Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation experiments: actin, pan Ab-5 mouse monoclonal #ACTN05 (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA); Bak, rabbit polyclonal anti-human Bak #556396 (BD Pharmingen); Bax, mouse monoclonal anti-human Bax directed against amino acids 12-24 #YTH-6A7 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD); Bax, N20 rabbit polyclonal directed against amino acids 11-30 #sc493 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Bax, rabbit polyclonal anti-human Bax directed against amino acids 43-61 #554104 (BD Pharmingen); Bcl-2, ΔC21 rabbit polyclonal #sc783 (Santa Cruz); caspase-3, p17 rabbit polyclonal (DW Nicholson, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Montreal, QC); caspase-9, mouse monoclonal MAB8301 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); COXII, anti-human cytochrome oxidase subunit II mouse monoclonal clone 12C4-F12 #A-6404 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); ERK, p44/43 mitogen-activated kinase antibody rabbit #9102 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); Hsp40, clone 2E1 mouse monoclonal (W.

Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7146-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). PErTA70 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were heat-shocked by placing log-phase cultures into 15-ml centrifuge tubes and immersion in a circulating water bath maintained at 43 ± 0.1 °C. After the hyperthermic treatments, the cells were either diluted in fresh 37 °C medium, transferred to a culture flask and returned to the 37 °C incubator, or placed directly on ice and washed in cold PBS for collection.A HeLa cell line with tetracycline-regulated expression of a Bax-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein (HeLa-rtTA/Bax:YFP) was generated by stable transfection of HeLa-rtTA cells with the plasmid pBI-EYFP:Bax*tk/hygro. The plasmid was constructed by first replacing the GFP sequence in pBI-EGFP (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with YFP from pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). The hygromycin resistance gene, under control of the thymidine kinase promoter (from pCEP4, Invitrogen) was then added to this plasmid. The Bax sequence with an N-terminal linker from the plasmid GFP-Bax (10.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) (obtained from R. J. Youle, National Institutes of Health) was ligated in-frame with the YFP sequence using the unique BsrGI site present in the sequence of both GFP and YFP to create the plasmid pBI-EYFP:Bax*tk/hygro. HeLa-rtTA cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Stably transfected cells were selected with hygromycin B (Invitrogen Inc.) and cloned by limiting dilution. Clones with minimal fluorescence in the non-induced state and highly fluorescent when induced were selected. The HeLa-rtTA and HeLa-rtTA/Bax:YFP cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.To inhibit the activation of ERK or JNK, cells were pretreated with PD98059 (#EI-360 Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) or SP600125 (Anthra[1,9-cd]prazol-6(2H)-one, #EI-305 Biomol) before exposure to hyperthermia. Preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the minimal concentration of each compound that was required to inhibit the activation of each kinase by monitoring ERK and c-Jun phosphorylation by Western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies (p-ERK #9102 Cell Signaling; p-c-Jun KM-1 Santa Cruz). Cells treated with these inhibitors were collected for Western blotting and for analysis of Bax translocation by immunofluorescence staining. Both compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. The concentration of Me2SO in the treated cells was 0.1% or less (except for cells treated with 150 μm PD98059 which received 0.15% Me2SO). Control cells were treated with an equivalent amount of Me2SO.JNK1 was also inhibited by transient overexpression of a dominant negative JNK1 mutant (JNK1 and dnJNK1 expression plasmids were obtained from R. J. Davis, University of Massachusetts) (33.Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). HeLa-rtTA/Bax:YFP cells were transiently transfected with plasmids to express CFP (pECFP-N1), Hsp70 fused to CFP, JNK1, or dnJNK1. Transfections with JNK1 and dnJNK1 also included pECFP-N1 (Clontech) to identify the transfected cells. The pECFP-N1:Hsp70 plasmid was created by inserting a PCR-amplified Hsp70 sequence from pH2.2 (34.Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) that included ScaI and AgeI restriction enzyme sites into the SmaI and AgeI sites in pECFP-N1, which places ECFP at the C terminus of Hsp70. Expression of Bax-YFP was induced 24 h after transfection. After an additional 24 h the transfected cells were exposed to 45 °C for 60 min followed by a return to 37 °C for 1 h before observation. Bax-YFP translocation in the CFP-positive cells was scored with an inverted fluorescence microscope (IRE2, Leica Microsystems, Richmond Hill, ON) equipped with a CCD camera (Orca ER, Hamamatsu), motorized external filter wheels and stage (Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY), and controlled by Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry UK). CFP fluorescence was visualized with the Leica internal filter cube (excitation, 436/20; emission, 480/40). YFP fluorescence in these cells was visualized using external excitation (495/10) and emission (540/50) filters. This was necessary to eliminate CFP fluorescence in the YFP filter channel. Cells were scored in 20 equally distributed regions that were selected by the X-Y stage module of the Openlab software. Viability after hyperthermia was scored in HeLa-rtTA cells that were transfected as described for the Bax-YFP cell line. Viability of the CFP-positive cells was scored as judged by their morphology and attachment to the culture dish.The ability of Hsp70 to prevent cell death in cells expressing a constitutively active form of Bax was examined in HeLa-rtTA cells that were transiently transfected with plasmids to express CFP, Hsp70-CFP, or Bcl-2 together with either GFP-tagged wild-type Bax or mutant BaxS184V (10.Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Each of the Bax expression plasmids is under the control of the tetracycline-regulated transactivator. The tet-inducible Bax plasmids were constructed by inserting BsrGI/XbaI Bax-GFP fragments (plasmids obtained from RJ Youle) into BsrGI/XbaI cut pBI-EGFP (Clontech). The test plasmid to Bax plasmid ratio was 5:1. Bcl-2-transfected cells received a 1:1 mixture of mitochondrial-targeted Bcl-2 (prc-CMVbclact) and ER-targeted Bcl-2 (pcrCMVbcl2cb5) plasmids (obtained from DW Andrews, McMaster University, CA) (35.Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Viability of the GFP-positive cells was assessed by counting the attached flattened cells and rounded detached cells 48 h after transfection.Apoptosome activation was induced by treating cells with apoptosis activator compound 2 (AA2, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]-1H-indole-2,3-dione, #2098, Tocris, Ellisville, MO) (36.Nguyen J.T. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7533-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with various concentrations of AA2 at 37 °C for 6 h or with 20 μm AA2 for various periods of time and then collected for analysis of caspase activation by measuring DEVDase and LEHDase activity and by Western blotting. Apoptosis was also monitored in AA2-treated cells by staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide (4 μg/ml each) and counting cells with normal or apoptotic nuclei using a fluorescence microscope (21.Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar).Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Western blotting was carried out as described previously (24.Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7146-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation 5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in IP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% CHAPS) containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit and adjusted to 1 mg/ml with lysis buffer. Samples containing 300 μg of protein were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Hsp70, anti-Bax (BD Pharmingen #554104), anti-Bak, or normal rabbit serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by the addition of 10 μl of protein A (for anti-Bax, anti-Bak, and normal rabbit serum) or protein G (for anti-Hsp70) EZview Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. Complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed 4× with lysis buffer. Finally the pelleted beads were resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In some experiments the cells were lysed in either 2% CHAPS lysis buffer or 2% CHAPS buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The remaining steps were carried out in the same buffer that was used for cell lysis.Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence analysis, cells (5 × 104) were collected onto glass slides in a cytocentrifuge (Cytospin 4, Shandon Products Inc.), air-dried, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, washed twice with PBS, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with an anti-Bax antibody (YTH-6A7; Trevigen). The cells were then washed 2× with PBS and incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (Sigma-Aldrich), which was included at a concentration of 1 μg/ml with the anti-mouse antibody. After 3 washes with PBS, a fluorescence mounting medium containing anti-fading compounds (DakoCytomation; Carpinteria, CA) was added, and the cells were observed using a Leica IRE-2 fluorescence microscope. Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu ORCA ER digital CCD camera and Openlab software (Improvision; Coventry, England).Preparation of Cytosolic and Membrane Fractions—Subcellular fractions were prepared by digitonin lysis as described by Mikhailov et al. (37.Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Pulkrabek D.J. Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107/ml) were lysed for 2 min at room temperature in digitonin lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% digitonin, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysis was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant, containing soluble proteins, was collected. The pellets were resuspended in the same buffer except that digitonin was replaced with 1% Nonidet P-40 and was incubated on ice for 60 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing the membrane fraction was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. The soluble and membrane fractions were mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer. Equivalent volumes of each fraction were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (12%), and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for detection of Bax. Efficiency of separating membrane and soluble fractions was confirmed by probing for the mitochondrial membrane protein cytochrome oxidase subunit II using anti-human cytochrome oxidase subunit II mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12C4-F12, #A-6404, Molecular Probes).Chemical Cross-linking—Cell extracts were prepared by lysing 5 × 106 cells on ice for 30 min in CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% CHAPS, protease, phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined. Fifty μg of each sample in a total volume of 50 μl was treated with 1 mm ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) (16.1 Å spacer arm) or DST (disuccinimidyl tartrate, 6.4 Å spacer arm) (Pierce). The cross-linkers were freshly dissolved in Me2SO before use. Control extracts received Me2SO alon"

Here, we investigated the effect of AICAR, an AMPK activator, on proliferation of various cancer cells and observed that proliferation of all the examined cell lines was significantly inhibited by AICAR treatment due to arrest in S-phase accompanied with increased expression of p21, p27, and p53 proteins and inhibition of PI3K-Akt pathway. Inhibition in in vitro growth of cancer cells was mirrored in vivo with increased expression of p21, p27, and p53 and attenuation of Akt phosphorylation. Anti-proliferative effect of AICAR is mediated through activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as iodotubericidin and dominant-negative AMPK expression vector reversed the AICAR-mediated growth arrest. Moreover, constitutive active AMPK arrested the cells in S-phase by inducing the expression of p21, p27, and p53 proteins and inhibiting Akt phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of AMPK. AICAR inhibited proliferation in both LKB and LKB knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts to similar extent and arrested cells at S-phase when transfected with dominant negative expression vector of LKB. Altogether, these results indicate that AICAR can be utilized as a therapeutic drug to inhibit cancer, and AMPK can be a potential target for treatment of various cancers independent of the functional tumor suppressor gene, LKB. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) is widely used as an AMP-kinase activator, which regulates energy homeostasis and response to metabolic stress.

It is a heterotrimer containing a catalytic (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ), each of which have at least two isoforms (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). AMPK is called the “fuel gauge” of the biological system, because it is activated under conditions that deplete cellular ATP and elevate AMP levels, such as glucose deprivation, heat shock, hypoxia, and ischemia (2Davies S.P.

Upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates a number of metabolic enzymes involved in ATP-consuming pathways like fatty acid, cholesterol synthesis, and protein synthesis that include enzymes like acetyl-Co enzyme A carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activates ATP-generating process like fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake (8Luo Z.

The mechanisms of activating AMPK include direct allosteric binding of AMP to the γ subunits and phosphorylation, catalyzed by an upstream AMP kinase (AMPKK), recently identified to be LKB1 (STK11) (9Hong S.P.

AMPK is an anti-growth molecule because of its relationship with two tumor suppressor genes: LKB and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex 2). LKB functions as an upstream kinase (AMPKK) that activates AMPK (26Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). LKB mutations result in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, which results in predisposition to cancers of the colon, pancreas, breast, and other sites (27Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G. Warren W. Aminoff M. Hoglund P. Jarvinen H. Kristo P. Pelin K. Ridanpaa M. Salovaara R. Toro T. Bodmer W. Olschwang S. Olsen A.S. Stratton M.R. de la Chapelle A. Aaltonen L.A.

Oncology. 2004; 67: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutations of LKB1 typically occur in the catalytic domain, leading to loss of its kinase activity and presumably a failure to phosphorylate and activate AMPK (30Forcet C. Etienne-Manneville S. Gaude H. Fournier L. Debilly S. Salmi M. Baas A. Olschwang S. Clevers H. Billaud M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). TSC2 forms a complex with TSC1 and inhibits mTOR, leading to inhibition in protein synthesis and negative regulation of cell size and growth (31Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar). Mutations of TSC1·TSC2 causes tuberous sclerosis, which is associated with hamartomatous polyps in multiple tissues and an increased risk of cancers (32Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the effect of AICAR on cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro in various cancer cell lines. AICAR is converted to its triphosphorylated form ZMP, inside the cell, by an adenosine kinase (14Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), which acts as an AMP analogue and activates AMPK and its upstream kinase LKB without affecting the ATP:AMP ratio in the cell (14Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). AICAR-mediated AMPK activation was found to be a proficient inhibitor of cell proliferation and the mechanism of its anti-proliferative effect may be mediated via inhibition of PI3K-Akt pathway and increased expression of cell cycle inhibitory proteins p21, p27, and p53, thereby exhibiting potential as an anti-cancer drug. Reagents and Cell Culture—DMEM/F-12, DMEM/4.5 g of glucose medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Hanks' balanced salt solution were obtained from Invitrogen as was RPMI 1640.

LKB wild type, LKB dominant negative (kinase dead), STRADα and MO25α expression vectors were kind gifts from Dr. Dario R. Alessi (Wellcome Trust Biocenter, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK). Cell Culture—C6 glioma cells, T98G, U87MG, and PC-3 were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM/4.5 g of glucose with 10% FBS. CEM and K-562 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. LKB knock-out and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were a kind gift from Dr. Tomi P. Makela (Institute of Biomedicine and Helsinki University Central Hospital, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland) and were maintained in DMEM/4.5 g of glucose with 10% FBS, essential amino acids, and antibiotics. All treatments were done in the presence of serum. Thymidine Incorporation—Proliferation of cells determined by was [3H]thymidine ribotide ([3H]TdR) incorporation into DNA. 1 × 106 cells per well of adherent cell lines (C6, MCF-7, and PC3) and 0.25 × 106 cells/well of suspension cell lines (NALM-6, CEM, CEMP, and K562) were plated in respective medias. Cells were incubated for 18-24 h with or without the presence of AICAR at the indicated concentrations. Each group was exposed to 37 kBq/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine in the same medium for 6 h. The adherent cells were fixed by 5% trichloroacetic acid and lysed in SDS/NaOH lysis buffer overnight. Radioactivity was measured by Beckman LS3801 liquid scintillation counter (Canada). Suspension cell culture was harvested by cell harvester (Packard instrument Co., Meriden, CT), and radioactivity was measured by 1450 microbeta liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Clonogenic Assay—Cells were treated with AICAR for 18-24 h, trypsinized, counted, and 300 cells/100-mm plate were plated. The cells were allowed to form colonies, and media was changed every third day for 2-3 weeks. The colonies were stained with MTT and enumerated (33Giocanti N. Hennequin C. Rouillard D. Defrance R. Favaudon V. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Assessment of Cell Cycle—Cellular DNA content was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with AICAR or transfections were performed. Cells attached to the plate were collected with trypsin, washed, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and 5 ml of 70% ethanol was added slowly while continuous vortexing of cells and were fixed overnight. Next day, cells were spun, washed, and suspended in 400 μl of PBS with addition of 10 mg/liter RNase A and 75 μm propidium iodide. Cells were acquired by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer) using Modfit LT software. Immunoblot—After a stipulated time of incubation in the presence or absence of AICAR, cells were scraped, washed with Hanks' buffer, and sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Proteins (50 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and incubated overnight in primary antibody (p21, p27, p53, Akt, β-actin, mTOR, PCNA at 1:2000 dilution) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for non-phospho antibodies and containing 5% albumin for phospho-antibodies (Akt-p, mTOR-p at 1:1000 dilution). The blots were washed four times with TTBS (5 min/wash) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). The blots were washed three times in TTBS and once in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature; protein expression was detected with ECL. Animals—Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were purchased from Charles-River Laboratories. Animals were maintained, and all protocols were approved by the animal use committees of the Medical University of South Carolina in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health). Tumor Implantation—C6 glioma cells were prepared fresh from culture to ensure optimal viability of cells during tumor inoculation. The cells were trypsinized, and 106 tumor cells prepared in 100 μl of PBS were injected subcutaneously in the lateral side of the right hind leg of the rats, after shave and sterile preparation. On the 5th day of implantation 100 mg/kg body weight/day of AICAR was given intra-peritoneal until the 14th day, when the animals were sacrificed and the tumor was excised, weighed, and fixed in formalin (34Parsa A.T.

Immunohistochemistry—Tumor sections were processed as previously described (35Nath N. Giri S. Prasad R. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1273-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were microwaved for 10 min in antigen unmasking fluid (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and blocked to reduce nonspecific staining. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:100) followed by tyramide signal enhancement technique (Renaissance TSA for Immunocytochemistry, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per manufacturer's instructions. After washing, slides were air-dried and mounted with aqueous mounting media (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). The sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-60) with an Olympus digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) using a dual band pass filter. Images were captured and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Transfection Studies—Plasmids were purified using the endotoxin-free plasmid midi prep kit (Qiagen). For transient transfections, C6 glioma cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to 60-80% confluence in DMEM/F-12 plus 5% FBS without antibiotics and transfected using FuGENE reagent. 1-3 μg of AMPK DN or AMPKα1CA or AMPKα2 CA expression vector along with 1 μg of eGFP expression vector or insertless expression vector (pcDNA3.1) were used for transfecting. Cells were treated with AICAR for 24 h and processed for GFP-gated DNA analysis by flow cytometry. Similarly, LKB1 wild type (1 μg) and dominant negative (1 μg) along with STRADα (0.5 μg) and MO25α (0.5 μg) expression vectors were used for transfection studies. Antisense Experiments—To decrease the levels of endogenous AMPK, C6 glioma cells were transfected for 48 h with 25 μm phosphothiorated antisense (AS) oligonucleotide (5′-CGCCCGTCGTCGTGCTTCTGC-3′) directly against both the α1- and α2-subunits of AMPK (36Giri S.

Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and a missense (MS) oligonucleotide (5′-CTCCCGGCTTGCTGCCGT-3′) along with eGFP expression vector (36Giri S. Nath N. Smith B. Viollet B. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were transfected with FuGENE reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then treated with AICAR for 24 h and analyzed for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. PI3K Activity—After 2 h of AICAR (1 mm) treatment, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 1 μg/ml p85 mAb. After 2-h incubation at 4 °C, protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and the resulting mixture was further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with PBS, once with 0.5 m LiCl and 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), once in water, and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm EDTA). PI3K activity was determined using a lipid mixture of 100 μl of 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol and 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine dispersed by sonication in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 100 μm ATP, and terminated after 15 min by the addition of 80 μl of 1 n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). Phospholipids were separated by TLC and visualized by exposure to iodine vapor and autoradiography (38Giri S. Rattan R. Singh A.K. Singh I. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5196-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The data were statistically analyzed by performing the Student-Newman-Keuls Test. AICAR Inhibits Proliferation of Cancer Cells—To investigate the effect of AICAR on the growth of various cancer cell lines, namely PC-3 (human prostate cancer cell), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cell line), C6 glioma (rat transformed brain glial cells), U87MG (human astrocytoma cell line), K-562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells), and CEM (human T-lymphoblast cells), cells were plated in their respective medium for growth and treated with different concentrations of AICAR (0.25-1 mm) for 24 h, and cell proliferation was examined by [3H]thymidine uptake. AICAR inhibited the proliferation of all cell lines tested significantly in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). All tested cell lines underwent significant proliferation inhibition, indicating that this phenomenon is widespread and not limited to a specific cell type/line. To further confirm this observation, a clonogenic assay was performed, where cells were treated with AICAR for 24 h, trypsinized and plated at a density of 300 cells/100-mm plate without AICAR. After 3 weeks, formed colonies were counted by staining the live cells with MTT. AICAR treatment significantly reduced the number of colonies being formed as compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that a single treatment of AICAR treatment is sufficient to cause a sustained inhibition of proliferation in different cancer cell lines.FIGURE 2AICAR inhibits clonogenic potential of transformed cells. C6 glioma and PC3 prostate cells were treated with AICAR for 18 h, trypsinized and 300 cells/100-mm plate were plated to form colonies.

To examine this, cells were treated with AICAR (0.5-1 mm), and phases of cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Treatment of cells with AICAR resulted in accumulation of cells in S-phase (peak with slashed bars), with almost no cells detected in M-phase (third peak) suggesting that inhibition in proliferation by AICAR is due to the arrest of cell cycle at S-phase (Fig. 3). AICAR Inhibits Proliferation in Vivo—To investigate whether the anti-proliferative effects of AICAR extends to the in vivo system, we utilized the rat flank tumor model (34Parsa A.T. Chakrabarti I. Hurley P.T. Chi J.H. Hall J.S. Kaiser M.G. Bruce J.N. Neurosurgery. 2000; 47 (discussion 999-1000): 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Wherein, C6 glioma cells (1 × 106) were implanted aseptically in the right flank of the rat, and after 5 days of tumor formation, animals were treated with 100 mg/kg body weight of AICAR intraperitoneally. On day 14, animals were sacrificed, and the tumors were excised, weighed, and fixed. Weight of the tumors was taken as an index of tumor development and progression. AICAR treatment was able to reduce the growth of tumors in animals significantly (>50%) when compared with untreated animals (Fig. 4A). To examine the status of proliferating cells in vivo, immunohistochemistry was performed on the sections of excised tumor tissues for PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), a marker for proliferating cells. AICAR significantly reduced the expression and number of cells exhibiting PCNA expression, indicating that the number of proliferating cells is reduced by AICAR treatment in vivo as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and its expression by Western blot (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, the anti-proliferative effect of AICAR is effective in vivo as well and can be exploited for applications in attenuating cancer cell growth. AICAR Mediates Its Anti-proliferative Action via AMP-activated Protein Kinase—AICAR, is the earliest known AMPK activator, and most of its effects have been shown to be because of AMPK activation, although few reports of its AMPK-independent effects exist (22Xiang X.

https://openalex.org/W2141814583,"That irradiated cells affect their unirradiated ‘bystander’ neighbors is evidenced by reports of increased clonogenic mortality, genomic instability, and expression of DNA-repair genes in the bystander cell populations. The mechanisms underlying the bystander effect are obscure, but genomic instability suggests DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) may be involved. Formation of DSBs induces the phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein, histone H2AX and this phosphorylated form, named γ-H2AX, forms foci at DSB sites. Here we report that irradiation of target cells induces γ-H2AX focus formation in bystander cell populations. The effect is manifested by increases in the fraction of cells in a population that contains multiple γ-H2AX foci. After 18 h coculture with cells irradiated with 20 α-particles, the fraction of bystander cells with multiple foci increased 3.7-fold. Similar changes occurred in bystander populations mixed and grown with cells irradiated with γ-rays, and in cultures containing media conditioned on γ-irradiated cells. DNA DSB repair proteins accumulated at γ-H2AX foci, indicating that they are sites of DNA DSB repair. Lindane, which blocks gap-junctions, prevented the bystander effect in mixing but not in media transfer protocols, while c-PTIO and aminoguanidine, which lower nitric oxide levels, prevented the bystander effect in both protocols. Thus, multiple mechanisms may be involved in transmitting bystander effects. These studies show that H2AX phosphorylation is an early step in the bystander effect and that the DNA DSBs underlying γ-H2AX focus formation may be responsible for its downstream manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W2087736884,"Overexpression of c-Myc results in transformation and multiple other phenotypes, and is accompanied by the deregulation of a large number of target genes. We previously demonstrated that peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), interacts with a region of the c-Myc transcriptional regulatory domain that is essential for transformation. This results either in the suppression or enhancement of some c-Myc functions and in the altered expression of select target genes. Most notably, c-Myc-mediated transformation is inhibited, implying a tumor suppressor role for Prdx1. Consistent with this, prdx1-/- mice develop age-dependent hemolytic anemias and/or malignancies. We now show that erythrocytes and embryonic fibroblasts from these animals contain higher levels of ROS, and that the latter cells show evidence of c-Myc activation, including the ability to be transformed by a ras oncogene alone. In contrast, other primary cells from prdx1-/- mice do not have elevated ROS, but nonetheless show increased oxidative DNA damage. This apparent paradox can be explained by the fact that ROS localize primarily to the cytoplasm of prdx1+/+ cells, whereas in prdx1-/- cells, much higher levels of nuclear ROS are seen. We suggest that increased DNA damage and tumor susceptibility in prdx1-/- animals results from this shift in intracellular ROS. prdx1-/- mice should be useful in studying the role of oxidative DNA damage in the causation of cancer and its prevention by antioxidants. They should also help in studying the relationship between oncogenes such as c-Myc and DNA damage."

We produced an LRAT gene knock-out mouse strain and assessed whether LRAT-/- mice were more susceptible to vitamin A deficiency than wild type (WT) mice. After maintenance on a vitamin A-deficient diet for 6 weeks, the serum retinol level was 1.34 ± 0.32 μm in WT mice versus 0.13 ± 0.06 μm in LRAT-/- mice (p < 0.05). In liver, lung, eye, kidney, brain, tongue, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, the retinol levels ranged from 0.05 pmol/mg (muscle and tongue) to 17.35 ± 2.66 pmol/mg (liver) in WT mice. In contrast, retinol was not detectable (<0.007 pmol/mg) in most tissues from LRAT-/- mice after maintenance on a vitamin A-deficient diet for 6 weeks. Cyp26A1 mRNA was not detected in hepatic tissue samples from LRAT-/- mice but was detected in WT mice fed the vitamin A-deficient diet. These data indicate that LRAT-/- mice are much more susceptible to vitamin A deficiency and should be an excellent animal model of vitamin A deficiency. In addition, the retinol levels in serum rapidly increased in the LRAT-/- mice upon re-addition of vitamin A to the diet, indicating that serum retinol levels in LRAT-/- mice can be conveniently modulated by the quantitative manipulation of dietary retinol.

We have generated an LRAT gene knock-out mouse strain in which only trace amounts of retinyl esters (less than 0.2% of the value in wild type mice) could be detected in the liver and lung. These data are consistent with a recent report (40Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

We then examined the retinol and retinyl ester levels in serum and in some other tissues from the wild type and knock-out mice at various times after maintenance of the mice on a vitamin A-deficient diet. Our results show that the LRAT-/- mice become vitamin A-deficient in a period as short as 6 weeks following removal of vitamin A from their diet. Thus, the LRAT-/- mice rapidly become vitamin A-deficient and have many advantages over WT mice in studies of vitamin A deficiency. Construction of the LRAT Gene Targeting Vector and the Generation of LRAT-/- Mice—A genomic clone (∼18 kb) was isolated from a 129SVJ mouse genomic library (Stratagene, catalog number 946309) and was used to construct the gene targeting vector. The probe for the genomic library screening was a PCR fragment (552 bp), which was amplified from mouse genomic DNA with the primers 5′-ACGCGGGGACCGCCCCCAGGCACACTACC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGTTGGAGACCACCTTCTGAGTGCG-3′ in the LRAT gene. The targeting vector contained a 3.9-kb 5′-arm and a 9-kb 3′-arm. The entire exon 1, which included the ATG start codon for the LRAT protein, was replaced with a neo gene cassette that was flanked by loxP sites. The neo/loxP fragment was inserted between the SacI and SpeI sites (Fig. 1A). An HSV-TK cassette was ligated as the upstream sequence adjacent to the 5′-arm. The targeting vector was introduced into 129SVJ mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (CJ7 line, obtained from Cornell/Sloan Kettering Transgenic Mouse Facility) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad electroporator at a voltage of 230 mV and capacitance of 500 microfarads. Positive clones were isolated with G418 selection (300 μg/ml active G418) and expanded. A total of 96 cell clones were screened, and three positive clones were obtained. The clones that had undergone homologous recombination were identified by Southern blot analysis and were confirmed by flanking probes outside of the construct (P1 and P2 as indicated in Fig. 1A) from both sides (Fig. 1B). After removing the neo/loxP cassette by transient transfection with a Cre expression vector (pBS185, Invitrogen, catalog number 10347-011), the heterozygous LRAT+/- mouse ES cells were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts by the Cornell/Sloan Kettering Transgenic Mouse Facility. The LRAT gene knock-out mice were generated from the chimeric mice (5 chimeras, >90% coat color chimerism) that gave germ line transmission. The mouse genotype was determined by LRAT gene-specific primers in a PCR using tail genomic DNA as the template. The upstream and downstream PCR primers (G1 and G2 as indicated in Fig. 1A) were 5′-TCTGGCATCTCTCCTACGCTG-3′ and 5′-GTTCCAAGTCCTTCAGTCTCTTGC-3′, respectively. A 1.3-kb band from the wild type allele and a 0.5-kb band from the mutant allele were amplified (Fig. 1C). The expression of the LRAT gene in mouse tissues was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Deprivation of Dietary Vitamin A—The pups (C57BL/6J background) were weaned 3 weeks postpartum, and the genotypes were determined by PCR. At 4 weeks, wild type and LRAT-/- mice were divided randomly into two groups. One group was fed the normal vitamin A-sufficient diet (control diet, Harlan TD 88406 supplies ∼19.8 IU (5.94 μg) of vitamin A/g as retinyl palmitate), and the other group was fed a vitamin A-deficient diet (Harlan TD 88407). Serum samples were obtained from the mouse tails at 2-, 4-, and 6-week intervals. At 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and tissue samples were harvested in the dark and stored (without rinsing) at -70 °C until the retinoids were extracted. Analyses of Tissue Retinoids—The frozen tissue samples (∼45-250 mg) from the liver, lung, eye, kidney, pancreas, adipose, skeletal muscle (from quadriceps femoris muscles), brain (from cerebra), and tongue were weighed and homogenized in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (100 μl of PBS per 100 mg of tissue) in glass homogenizers and then transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The volumes were adjusted to 500 μl with cold PBS. The retinoids were extracted into 350 μl of organic solution (acetonitrile/butanol, 50:50, v/v) in the dark as described previously (41Chen A.C. Guo X. Derguini F. Gudas L.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4642-4651PubMed Google Scholar, 42Guo X. Gudas L.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 166-176PubMed Google Scholar). The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Waters Millenium system (Waters). Each sample (100 μl of the 350 μl) was loaded onto an analytical 5-μm reverse phase C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Two mobile phase gradient systems were used, as described previously (41Chen A.C. Guo X. Derguini F. Gudas L.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4642-4651PubMed Google Scholar, 42Guo X. Gudas L.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 166-176PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of retinoids were calculated from the areas under the peaks detected at the wave-length of 340 nm. The levels of retinol and retinyl esters were normalized to the tissue weight. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—The tissues from the liver, lung, kidney, small intestine, and brain were dissected and stored in RNAlater (Ambion) at -70 °C. Total RNA was extracted using the mini RNAeasy columns (Qiagen). Total RNA (1 μg each) was used for reverse transcription in a 20-μl reaction using Super Script™ II Reverse Transcriptase (RT) from Invitrogen, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA thus produced was diluted to 100 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate/water, of which 1 μl was used in a PCR as follows. The gene-specific primers and the number of cycles for PCR are listed as follows. For LRAT (GenBank™ accession number AF255061), the 5′-primer 5′-CTGACCAATGACAAGGAACGCACTC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CTAATCCCAAGACAGCCGAAGCAAGAC-3′ were used for 40 cycles, and a 370-bp product was expected. For Cyp26A1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_007811), the 5′-primer 5-GCAGATGAAGCGCAGGAAATACG-3 and 3′-primer 5-CCCACGAGTGCTCAATCAGGA-3 were used for 36 cycles, and a 635-bp product was expected. For the dehydrogenase/reductase member 1 (Dhrs1, GenBank™ accession number NM_026819), the upstream primer 5-GACTTCCATCCAGGCACGCACTC-3 and downstream primer 5-CATCTAGCCGCCCTTTCTGTTCC-3 were used for 26 cycles, and a 388-bp product was expected. All of these primers are located in two different exons so genomic DNA contamination (if it exists) does not interfere with RNA analyses. Primers for the testis-specific mRNAs, the activator of CREM in testis (5′-primer, 5′-ATGACAAGTAGTCAATTTGATTGT-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-CTAAGCGTCAGTGTCTGCCC-3′), cAMP-responsive element modulator (5′-primer, 5′-ATGACCATGGAAACAGTTGAATC-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-TGGTAAGTTGCCATGTCACC-3′), sperm fibrous sheath component (5′-primer, 5′-TATGCTTTGTGGATGTGTCT-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-TGAGGAGCCAGTTGAGGACA-3′), mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein (5′-primer, 5′-GACTCACTAGACTGCTGAGGA-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-CACCTGGTGGGGACTGTGG-3′), transition protein 1 (5′-primer, 5′-ATGTCGACCAGCCGCAAGC-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-CCACTCTGATAGGATCTTTGG-3′), proacrosin (5′-primer, 5′-GTGTGTGCAGGGTATCCTGAAGGCAAGATT-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-GCGAAGAGAAGGAGGGTGAAAAGAGACCAT-3′), protamine 1 (5′-primer, 5′-ATGGCCAGATACCGATGCTG-3′, and 3′-primer 5′-GTGGCGAGATGCTCTTGAAG-3′), and protamine 2 (5′-primer, 5′-ATGGTTCGCTACCGAATGAGG-3′, and 3′-primer,5′-TTAGTGATGGTGCCTCCTACA-3′), were as described previously (43Zhang D. Penttila T.L. Morris P.L. Teichmann M. Roeder R.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). GAPDH (upstream primer, 5-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3; downstream primer, 5-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3, 23 cycles, expected product size 451 bp) was used as an internal control for the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The PCR was performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 80 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Taq polymerase was from Invitrogen (catalog number 18038-042). The PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel images stained with ethidium bromide were recorded with a FluorChem 8800 system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Statistical Methods—Each experiment was repeated at least three times. The means ± S.E. were calculated using Graphpad Prism Program (version 4.0a). One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in the mean values of retinol levels among multiple experimental groups. The unpaired t test was used to determine differences between two groups. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Production of the Homologous LRAT-/- Mouse Line—To address the physiological functions of the LRAT gene, a targeting vector was constructed (Fig. 1A), and the LRAT gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. That the homologous recombination was correct was demonstrated by using both 5′- and 3′-flanking probes (Fig. 1B). The neo gene cassette was removed from two ES cell clones, and the clones without the neo cassette were used to produce the LRAT gene knock-out mouse line. This is in contrast to the LRAT-/- mice produced by another laboratory, which still contain the neoR gene (40Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The genotype was determined by PCR (Fig. 1C). The expression of LRAT mRNA in the kidney, small intestine, brain, liver, and lung is shown (Fig. 2A). The LRAT transcript was expressed in all tissues tested in wild type mice. In contrast, no expression of the LRAT gene was detected in any of the tissues tested from LRAT-/- mice. The results of the RT-PCR were consistent with the Northern blot analysis using the exon 2 cDNA fragment as a probe (data not shown). To explore the physiological consequences of the disruption of the LRAT gene, a complete necropsy was performed on 4-week-old and 3-month-old mice at the Genetically Engineered Mouse Phenotype Core Facility of Cornell/Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. With a sufficient source of dietary vitamin A (25 IU (or 7.5 μg)/g), the LRAT-/- mice were apparently healthy. However, the testes of the LRAT-/- mice at the age of 4 weeks and at 3 months showed marked hypoplasia and oligospermia (Fig. 2B). In the 4-week-old LRAT-/- mouse, diffuse testicular hypoplasia/atrophy was prominent. The LRAT-/- mice also exhibited oligospermia with the absence of spermatogenic epithelium, dilated seminiferous tubular lumens, and occasional luminal giant cells. A similar but milder change was observed in 3-month-old male LRAT-/- mice. The results of the histological examinations are shown (Fig. 2B). The expression in testis of a panel of testis-specific genes was analyzed at the mRNA level by RT-PCR. The expression of these genes in LRAT-/- testicular tissues was similar to that seen in WT testicular tissues (Fig. 2B). These analyses indicate that there is an absence of mature sperm in the testes of LRAT-/- mice but that the process of spermatogenesis may not be completely disrupted. No other gross differences were seen between the wild type and LRAT-/- mice on histological examination with conventional staining. Levels of Retinol and Retinyl Esters in the Liver and Lung—We then examined the retinol and retinyl ester levels in two major organs for retinol storage, liver and lung, in 10-week-old wild type and LRAT-/- mice. These mice were fed a normal vitamin A-sufficient diet for the 6 weeks after weaning; the analytical results are shown (Fig. 3). The levels of retinyl esters detected in the LRAT-/- livers and lungs were 3.41 ± 0.41 and 1.29 ± 0.43 pmol/mg, respectively, which were 0.15 and 0.08% of the retinyl esters present in the livers (2227.46 ± 436.40 pmol/mg) and lungs (1619.33 ± 373.80 pmol/mg) of the wild type mice (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWORetinol and retinyl esters in tissues The levels of retinol and retinyl esters were measured by HPLC.

https://openalex.org/W2128932427,"Recent cloning of a cold/menthol-sensitive TRPM8 channel (transient receptor potential melastatine family member 8) from rodent sensory neurons has provided the molecular basis for the cold sensation. Surprisingly, the human orthologue of rodent TRPM8 also appears to be strongly expressed in the prostate and in the prostate cancer-derived epithelial cell line, LNCaP. In this study, we show that despite such expression, LNCaP cells respond to cold/menthol stimulus by membrane current (Icold/menthol) that shows inward rectification and high Ca2+ selectivity, which are dramatically different properties from “classical” TRPM8-mediated Icold/menthol. Yet, silencing of endogenous TRPM8 mRNA by either antisense or siRNA strategies suppresses both Icold/menthol and TRPM8 protein in LNCaP cells. We demonstrate that these puzzling results arise from TRPM8 localization not in the plasma, but in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of LNCaP cells, where it supports cold/menthol/icilin-induced Ca2+ release from the ER with concomitant activation of plasma membrane (PM) store-operated channels (SOC). In contrast, GFP-tagged TRPM8 heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells target the PM. We also demonstrate that TRPM8 expression and the magnitude of SOC current associated with it are androgen-dependent. Our results suggest that the TRPM8 may be an important new ER Ca2+ release channel, potentially involved in a number of Ca2+- and store-dependent processes in prostate cancer epithelial cells, including those that are important for prostate carcinogenesis, such as proliferation and apoptosis.

In contrast, sensitivity to cooling temperatures (<22 °C) and menthol is mediated by a structurally distant thermal receptor, TRPM8, belonging to the melastatine (TRPM) subfamily of TRP channels (12McKemy D.D.

Consistent with their role in the sensation of distinct physiological temperatures, thermal receptors are mostly expressed in subsets of sensory neurons, where they participate in the conversion of various thermal stimuli into an electrochemical form valid for further propagation to the integrative centers of the central nervous system as well as to skin cells. Interestingly, the 92% identical human orthologue of a rodent cold receptor, initially termed as trp-p8 (15Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar), is almost exclusively expressed in the male reproductive system. In fact, testis and prostate tissues were shown to be the only normal human tissues outside the nervous system to express cold receptor TRPM8-related transcripts (15Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, while remaining at moderate levels in a normal prostate, trp-p8 expression greatly increases in prostate cancer. Other non-prostatic primary human tumors of breast, colon, lung, and skin also become highly enriched in trp-p8, whereas in the corresponding normal tissues it is virtually undetectable (15Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar). All this suggests that aside from its already established role in cold sensation, TRPM8 is likely to have other important functional roles, especially in the prostate and during carcinogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the characterization of the endogenous TRPM8 in the model system of human LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate, Ref. 16Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) androgen-dependent prostate cancer epithelial cells. We show that LNCaP cells, although expressing TRPM8 transcripts and protein, nevertheless generate a membrane current in response to cold or menthol with drastically different biophysical properties than those initially described for sensory neurons and heterologously expressed TRPM8 (e.g. Refs. 12McKemy D.D.

In contrast to “classical” TRPM8-mediated current (Icold/menthol), which is characterized by outward rectification and poor cationic selectivity (12McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D.

We demonstrate that these puzzling results are explained by the exclusive extraplasmalemmal localization of TRPM8 mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of LNCaP cells, where in response to cold or menthol, it is able to support Ca2+ release. Concomitant ER Ca2+ store depletion activates Ca2+ entry via plasma membrane store-operated channels (SOC). This could be detected in electrophysiological experiments as ISOC/menthol with biophysical properties identical to those of the store-operated currents described in our previous work (17Skryma R.

In contrast, TRPM8 cloned from human prostate and heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells shows dual localization in the ER as well as in the plasma membrane (PM), where it mediates classical Icold/menthol. We also show that TRPM8 expression in LNCaP cells and the associated ISOC/menthol magnitude are androgen-dependent. Our results suggest that TRPM8 may be an important ER Ca2+ release channel potentially involved in a number of Ca2+- and store-dependent processes in prostate cancer epithelial cells, including those that are important for prostate carcinogenesis, such as proliferation and apoptosis.

The average cell capacitance of LNCaP and HEK-293 (wild-type and TRPM8-expressing) cells were 23.6 ± 1.9 pF and 19.4 ± 1.6 pF, respectively. The composition of the normal extracellular solutions used for electrophysiological recordings was (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 0.3 Na2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 4 NaHCO3, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH). The extracellular solution used to record Ca2+-carried ISOC/menthol contained (in mm): 150 n-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), 10 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.3 with HCl). Changes in external solutions were carried out using a multibarrel puffing micropipette with a common outflow, positioned in close proximity to the cell under investigation. During the experiment, the cell was continuously superfused with the solution via a puffing pipette to reduce the possibility of artifacts occuring because of the switch from a static to a moving solution and vice versa. Complete external solution exchange was achieved in <1 s. The intracellular pipette solution used to record ISOC/menthol in LNCaP cells contained (in mm): 100 NMDG, 20 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 8 EGTA, 3.1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.3 with HCl). Otherwise we used K+- or Cs+-based intracellular solutions (in mm): 100 KOH (CsOH), 40 KCl (CsCl), 5 HEPES, 8 EGTA, 3.1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.3 with glutamic acid). The free concentrations of divalent cations in the solution containing a chelating agent were estimated using WinMaxc 1.7 software (22Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. For all Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiological experiments, the temperature of the cell bath solution was adjusted to 36 °C, unless otherwise specified. Cloning of trpm8 cDNA and Fusion Protein Construction—The trpm8 gene from normal human prostate was cloned from 1 μg of human prostate poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech). Primers for TRPM8 amplification were: 5′-ACCAGCTAGCATGTCCTTTCGGGCAGCCGGGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGATCTCGAGTTTGATTTTATTAGCAATCTCTTTCA-3′ (backward). The trpm8 gene from LNCaP cells was cloned from 4 μg of total mRNA by RT-PCR using SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), Random Hexamer Oligonucleotides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), forward primer: 5′-CCTGCTTGACAAAAACCGTC-3′, backward primer: 5′-TCTCAAGGTCTCAGCACACTA-3′ and BD Advantage™ 2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech). PCR products of about 3.5 kbp were cloned into the pcR2.1 vector with a TOPO® TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). After sequencing, the plasmid was digested by EcoRI (New England Biolabs), and the two restriction fragments were ligated into a pcDNA4 vector (Invitrogen) predigested with EcoRI. Correct trpm8 gene insertion was confirmed by restriction analysis of positive clones. RT-PCR Analysis of TRPM8 Expression—Total RNAs were isolated from several cell lines: LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3, PNT1A, and HEK-293 cells as described (31Bidaux G. Roudbaraki M. Merle C. Crepin A. Delcourt P. Slomiany C. Thebault S. Bonnal J.L. Benahmed M. Cabon F. Mauroy B. Prevarskaya N. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To detect TRPM8 cDNAs, PCR was performed by adding 2 μl of the RT template to a mixture of: 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 25 μl. DNA amplification conditions included an initial denaturation step of 7 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 40 s at 72 °C, and finally 7 min at 72 °C. Primers used to amplify TRPM8 were: 5′-GATTTTCACCAATGACCGCCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCCAGCAGCATTGATGTCG-3′ (backward). Transient Transfection—HEK-293 cells were cultured in 35-mm diameter Petri dishes for cell recordings (Nunc) until 50-60% confluency. Then cells were transiently transfected by either 2 μg (in 35-mm dishes) of plasmid (transfecting either pEGFP/TRPM8-N1, or pcDNA4/TRPM8 plus pEGFP-N1 at a 5:1 ratio or pEGFP-N1 alone) using a Gene Porter™2 Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. (GTS), San Diego, CA). siRNA Cell Transfection—LNCaP cells were transfected overnight with 100 nm siRNATRPM8, using either 5 μl or 15 μl of TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus Inc., Madison, WI). Ready-to-use siRNATRPM8 (processing option: A4) with the sense sequence of: 5′-TCTCTGAGCGCACT ATTCA(dTdT)-3′ (position 894-912 on TRPM8 sequence, GenBank™ accession number: NM_024080.3) was synthesized by Dharmacon Inc. Control siRNA experiments were performed either by applying the transfection reagent alone (vehicle) or by transfecting a specific siRNA against Pannexin 1 protein (siRNAPan) 5′-ACGATTTGAGCCTCTACAA(dTdT)-3′ (position 1361-1379 on Pannexin 1 sequence, GenBank™ accession number: NM_015368). Immunohistochemistry—60% confluent LNCaP cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde-1× PBS for 15 min. After three washes, cells were either incubated in FITC-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, C-1655, Sigma-Aldrich, dilution: 1:2000) diluted in 1× PBS at room temperature for 20 min and then washed three times before permeabilization or were directly permeabilized in PBS-gelatin (phosphate-buffered saline, gelatin 1.2%) complemented with 0.01% Tween 20 and 100 mm glycine for 30 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the cells were co-incubated with a primary rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPM8 antibody (code: ab3243, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted (1:200) in PBS-gelatin for 1 h at 37 °C. After thorough washes in PBS-gelatin, the slides were treated with the corresponding Alexa Fluor 546-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (A-21206, Molecular Probes, using the dilution: 1:4000) diluted in PBS-gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes in PBS-gelatin and one in PBS, the slides were mounted with Mowiol®. Fluorescence analysis was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (488-nm excitation for FITC and 546 nm for Alexa-546) connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m with a 40 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Both channels were excited, collected separately, and then merged to examine colocalization. The image acquisition characteristics (pinhole aperture, laser intensity, etc.) were the same throughout the experiments to ensure the comparability of the results. Using confocal microscope software (AIM 3.2, Zeiss, Le Pecq, France), the colocalization coefficients were calculated in the manner defined by Manders et al. (24Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Alen J.A. J. Microsc. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). For the immunofluorescence quantification of TRPM8 expression in LNCaP cells transfected with either control or anti-TRPM8 siRNAs, all confocal images were acquired under standard conditions (pinhole aperture, laser intensity, etc.) and analyzed using confocal microscope software (AIM 3.2, Zeiss) to determine the specific mean cell intensity for each experiment and then to calculate the average and standard deviation for four independent areas. Western Blot Assay—The total protein fraction from the cells of interest was harvested in PBS and then sonicated in an ice-cold buffer (pH 7.2) containing (in mm): 20 HEPES, 50 NaCl, 10 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma), and a phosphatase inhibitor (sodium orthovanadate, Sigma). Samples (40 μg each) were electrophoretically analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gel using SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred for 1.5 h (50 mA, 25 V) onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% TNT-milk (15 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) for 30 min at room temperature, then soaked overnight at +4 °C either in a 1:500 diluted primary rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPM8 antibody (code: ab3243, Abcam), or in a 1:500 primary rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (Neomarkers, MS-1295-P) both diluted in 3% TNT-milk. After three 15-min washes in TNT, the membrane was transferred into anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Chemicon), diluted in 3% TNT-milk (1:20,000) for 1 h. After three 10-min washes in TNT, the membrane was processed for chemiluminescent detection using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were then exposed to X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY). Ca2+ Imaging—Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) was measured using ratiometric dye Fura-2 and quantified according to Grynkiewicz et al. (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For confocal [Ca2+]c imaging, cells were loaded with non-ratiometric Fluo-3AM dye. During measurements, the cells were bathed in the same normal extracellular solution used for electrophysiological recording. To produce Ca2+-free conditions, CaCl2 was removed from this solution, and EGTA (0.5 mm) was added. For Ca2+ imaging within the ER, LNCaP cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded with 5 μm Mag-Fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes), for 45 min at 37 °C. After incubation with the dye, the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized: cells were rinsed briefly in a high K+ solution of the following composition (in mm): KCl, 125; NaCl, 25; HEPES, 10; EGTA, 1; CaCl2, 0.5; MgCl2, 0.1 (free Ca2+ clamped to 170 nm, pH 7.2), and exposed for 1 min to the same solution at 37 °C in the presence of digitonin (0.5 mg/ml). Permeabilized cells were then continuously perfused with the high K+ solution supplemented with 0.2 mm Mg-ATP. Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using PulseFit (HEKA Electronics) and Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test (p < 0.05 is considered significant) and analysis of variance tests followed by Tukey-Kramer post-tests. Expression of Full-length TRPM8 in LNCaP Cells—Although previous studies have shown the expression of TRPM8 transcripts (15Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang L. Barritt G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8365-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and even protein labeling (26Zhang L. Barritt G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8365-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) in LNCaP cells, to be a necessary prerequisite for functional studies, we first sought to confirm endogenous TRPM8 mRNA expression in these cells by RT-PCR and to compare that to other cell lines of prostatic origin. Fig. 1A shows that out of four prostatic cell lines tested: namely the normal prostate epithelial cell line PNT1A, the androgen-dependent prostate cancer epithelial cell line LNCaP and androgen-independent prostate cancer epithelial cell lines DU-145 and PC-3, only in LNCaP cells could the TRPM8 mRNA-specific amplification fragment be detected. No such fragment was evident in the most popular heterologous expression system, namely wild-type HEK-293 cells. Given that expression of endogenous full-length TRPM8 transcript has never been demonstrated in LNCaP cells, and the degree of its homology to human TRPM8 is not known, we isolated the 3312-bp open reading frame of the full-length TRPM8 cDNAs from both LNCaP cells and human prostate (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Sequencing of both clones showed quite perfect homology between them (99.97%) and to other published human sequences. Analysis of all TRPM8 clones available from GenBank™ revealed two sites of possible single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at positions: 173 (T ↔ C) and 2383 (A ↔ G) (see TABLE ONE). Thus, from a molecular perspective, endogenous TRPM8 in LNCaP cells is basically identical to the TRPM8 expressed in native human prostate.TABLE ONESNP comparison of different TRPM8 open reading frames with the TRPM8 sequence cloned from LNCaP cellsClonesSNP at position 173SNP at position 2383NucleotideAmino acidNucleotideAmino acidAY328400 (prostate tissue)CThrGAlaDQ139309 (LNCaP)CThrAThrNM_024080TIleAThrAY090109TIleAThrAB061779CThrAThrNT_005120.14CThrAThrEST:BE390627.1CThrEST:BE274448.1CThrMouse (NP_599013)CThrAThrRat (NP_599198)CThrAThrConsensusCThrAThr Open table in a new tab Transfection of HEK-293 cells with a pEGFP vector containing a TRPM8 cDNA insert (which we cloned from human prostate, GenBank™: AY328400; HEK-293/pEGFP-TRPM8 cells) resulted in the appearance of TRPM8 mRNA-specific amplification fragments detected by RT-PCR. However in both the wild-type (HEK-293/wt) and the empty vector-transfected (HEK-293/pEGFP) HEK-293 cells, no such fragment could be detected (Fig. 1B). Using the pEGFP-TRPM8 plasmid for HEK-293 cell transfection directs the expression of the fusion construct, in which GFP is attached to the TRPM8 C terminus. Such a construct is advantageous when studying the subcellular distribution of heterologously expressed TRPM8 based on GFP fluorescence. However, the influence of GFP on TRPM8 functional properties cannot be excluded. Therefore, for functional studies of recombinant TRPM8, we also used HEK-293 cells transiently co-transfected with separate pcDNA4 plasmid containing the TRPM8 cDNA insert and pEGFP plasmid (HEK-293/pcDNA4-TRPM8+pEGFP cells), as well as a HEK-293 cell line newly created in our laboratory, stably expressing TRPM8 under the tetracycline-inducible promoter (HEK-293/TRPM8 cells). The same cells, but without tetracycline induction, were used for control purposes (HEK-293/ctrl cells), because RT-PCR detection of TRPM8 expression in such cells was negative (data not shown).

One of them was purified by acetone fractionation, ion exchange, and molecular sieving chromatography. It has a molecular size of 21.5 kDa and contains fucose, xylose, galactose, and sulfate in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.5:2.0:2.0 and contains trace amounts of glucuronic acid. Chemical analyses, methylation studies, and NMR spectroscopy showed that the polysaccharide has a unique structure, composed of a central core formed mainly by 4-linked β-galactose units, partially sulfated at the 3-O position. Approximately 25% of these units contain branches of oligosaccharides (mostly tetrasaccharides) composed of 3-sulfated, 4-linked α-fucose and one or two nonsulfated, 4-linked β-xylose units at the reducing and nonreducing end, respectively. This sulfated galactofucan showed no anticoagulant activity on several “in vitro” assays. Nevertheless, it had a potent antithrombotic activity on an animal model of experimental venous thrombosis. This effect is time-dependent, reaching the maximum 8 h after its administration compared with the more transient action of heparin. The effect was not observed with the desulfated molecule. Furthermore, the sulfated galactofucan was 2-fold more potent than heparin in stimulating the synthesis of an antithrombotic heparan sulfate by endothelial cells. Again, this action was also abolished by desulfation of the polysaccharide. Because this sulfated galactofucan has no anticoagulant activity but strongly stimulates the synthesis of heparan sulfate by endothelial cells, we suggested that this last effect may be related to the “in vivo” antithrombotic activity of this polysaccharide. In this case the highly sulfated heparan sulfate produced by the endothelial cells is in fact the antithrombotic agent. Our results suggested that this sulfated galactofucan may have a potential application as an antithrombotic drug.

Our results suggested that this sulfated galactofucan may have a potential application as an antithrombotic drug. The leading causes of death in the United States are diseases that involve heart and blood vessels and, consequently, thrombosis. The incidence of death because of thrombosis is almost two times higher than the next cause, cancer (1National Vital Statistics Reports. 2003; 51: 4-9Google Scholar). Most thromboembolic processes require anticoagulant therapy. This explains the current efforts to develop specific and potent anticoagulant agents.Unfractionated heparins and low molecular weight heparins are the only sulfated polysaccharides currently used as anticoagulant drugs. However, these compounds have several side effects such as bleeding and thrombocytopenia (2Moll S. Roberts H.R. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Colliec S. Fisher A.M. Tapon-Bretaudier J. Boisson-Vidal C. Durand P. Josefonvicz J. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 143-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, the commercial sources of heparins are mainly pig and bovine intestine. The possibility that prions and viruses could be carried by these molecules in addition to the increasing needs for antithrombotic therapies indicate the necessity to look for alternative sources of anticoagulant agents.Marine brown algae are an abundant source of anticoagulant polysaccharides. They contain a variety of sulfated l-fucans with anticoagulant activity (4Nader H.B. Lopes C.C. Rocha H.A.O. Santos E.A. Dietrich C.P. Curr. Pharm.

The proposed mechanisms of action of these compounds are predominantly related to the “in vitro” inhibition of factors Xa and IIa mediated by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II. Besides the anticoagulant activity, some sulfated fucans possess other important pharmacological activities such as anticomplementary, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antitumoral, antiviral, antipeptic, and antiadhesive activities (12Haroun-Bouhedja F.

Res. 2001; 34: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Most of the structural requirements for the anticoagulant activity of sulfated fucans have not yet been determined; consequently, the structure-activity relationships remain to be elucidated. Most of the difficulties for these studies arise from the fact that these compounds are very heterogeneous polysaccharides, which give complex NMR spectra with broad signals hampering resolution (17Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. Gray E. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 77: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is not always possible to define whether these algal polysaccharides have repetitive units. Furthermore, the structure of sulfated fucans varies according to the species of algae, as it is the case for heparan sulfates in vertebrates (5Dietrich C.P. Farias G.G.M. Abreu L.R.D. Leite E.L.

Thus, each new sulfated polysaccharide purified from a marine alga is a new compound with unique structures and, consequently, with potential novel biological activities.Here we report the purification, structural characterization, and pharmacological activities of a new sulfated polysaccharide from the brown alga Spatoglossum schroederi. This polysaccharide has a unique structure, composed of a central core of 4-linked, partially 3-sulfated β-galactose units. Approximately 25% of these units contain branches of oligosaccharides formed by nonsulfated β-xylose and 3-sulfated α-fucose units linked to the O-2 position of the central core. Of particular significance was the finding that this sulfated galactofucan has no anticoagulant activities but shows a potent antithrombotic activity with no hemorrhagic effect. We attributed the antithrombotic activity of this sulfated polysaccharide to its potent effect stimulating the synthesis of a highly sulfated heparan sulfate by the endothelial cells of the vascular wall.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Chondrointin 4-sulfate was purchased from Miles Laboratories (Elkhart, IN). Heparan sulfate from bovine pancreas and heparin from bovine mucosa were gifts from Dr. P. Bianchini (Opocrin Research Laboratories, Modena, Italy). Propylenediamine (1,3-diaminopropane) was purchased from Aldrich. Glucose, glucuronic acid, xylose, fucose, galactose, and chondroitinase AC and ABC were obtained from Sigma. Heparitinases I and II were prepared from induced Flavobacterium heparinum cells by methods described previously (20Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L.S. Pinhal M.A.S. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C.

Human factor Xa (FXa) 2The abbreviations used are: FXafactor XaHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyFCSfetal calf serumNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The synthetic substrate for FXa (benzoyl-Ile-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide; S2222) and for thrombin (H-d-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide; S2238) were obtained from Chromogenix AB (Mölndal, Sweden). Antihrombin was prepared as described (19Hoffman D.L. Am. J. Med. 1989; 87 (-S26): S23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Extraction of Polysaccharides—The marine alga S. schroederi was collected on the seashore of Natal, RN, Brazil. Immediately after collection, the alga was dried at 50 °C under ventilation and was ground in a blender. The seaweed was then treated with acetone to eliminate lipids and pigments. One hundred grams of defatted, dried, and powdered alga were suspended in 500 ml of 0.25 m NaCl, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with NaOH. Twenty mg of maxatase, an alkaline protease from Sporobacillus (Biobras, MG, Brazil), was added to the mixture for proteolytic digestion. After 18 h of incubation at 60 °C under agitation, the mixture was filtered through cheesecloth. The filtrate was fractionated by precipitation with acetone as follows: 0.5 volumes of ice-cold acetone was added to the solution under gentle agitation and maintained at 4 °C for 24 h. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min), dried under vacuum, resuspended in distilled water, and analyzed. The operation was repeated by adding 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, and 2.0 volumes of acetone to the supernatant. The fraction precipitated with 0.9 volume of acetone (200 mg) contains the sulfated galactofucan used in the present work. This polysaccharide was further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Lewatite from Bayer, São Paulo, Brazil) eluted stepwise with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.25-3.0 m). The eluates were precipitated with 2 volumes of methanol (18 h, 4 °C). The precipitates were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min), dried, and resuspended in distilled water for subsequent analysis. The fraction eluted from the resin with 2 m NaCl was further purified by molecular sieving in Sephadex G-75 (120 × 1.8 cm). About 50 mg of sulfated galactofucan, dissolved in 2 ml of water, were applied to the column and eluted with a solution of 0.2 m acetic acid and 6 m urea, and fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed by the phenol/H2SO4 reaction.Analysis of the Acidic Polysaccharides by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Agarose gel electrophoresis of the acidic polysaccharides was performed in 0.6% agarose gels (7.5 × 10 cm, 0.2 cm thick) prepared in four different buffers as follows: 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane acetate buffer, pH 9.0; discontinuous buffer 0.04 m barium acetate, pH 4.0; 0.05 m diaminopropane acetate, pH 9.0; 0.05 m KCl-HCl buffer, pH 2.0, or 0.06 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, as described previously (21Dietrich C.P. McDuffie N.M. Sampaio L.O. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 130: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Bianchini P. Nader H.B. Takahashi H.K. Osima B. Straus A.H. Dietrich C.P. J. Chromatogr. 1980; 196: 455-462Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the fractions (about 50 μg) were applied to the gel and subjected to electrophoresis. The gel was fixed with 0.1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide solution for 4 h, dried, and stained for 15 min with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol. The gels were then destained with the same solution without the dye. The molecular weight was determined by HPLC in 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5% ethanol, using a GF-250 column (Asahipak GF series, Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Yakoo, Japan). The column was calibrated with standard glycosaminoglycans.Chemical Analyses—The polysaccharides were hydrolyzed with 5 m trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting monosaccharides were converted to their alditol acetate derivatives and analyzed by gas chromatography. Fucose, xylose, and uronic acid content of the polymers were also estimated by the methods described by Dische (23Dische Z. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1962; 1: 501-503Google Scholar, 24Dische Z. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1962; 1: 484-488Google Scholar, 25Dische Z. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1962; 1: 497-501Google Scholar). Total sugars were estimated by the phenol/H2SO4 reaction (26Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 250-256Crossref Scopus (39948) Google Scholar). After acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharides (6 n HCl, 100 °C, 4 h), the sulfate content was measured by the toluidine blue method, as described previously (27Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The type of uronic acid was determined by electrophoresis in Whatman No. 3MM paper in 0.25 m ammonium formate buffer, pH 2.7 (28Kozakai M. Yosizawa Z. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 78: 425-429Google Scholar). The protein content was measured as described by Spector (29Spector J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar).Desulfation and Methylation of Fucan—Desulfation of the polysaccharide was performed by solvolysis in dimethyl sulfoxide as used previously for desulfation of a sulfated fucan (30Vilela-Silva E.S.A. Castro M.O. Valente A.P. Biermann H.C. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The native and desulfated polysaccharides (10 mg) were subjected to three rounds of methylation, according to Patankar et al. (31Patankar M.S. Oehninger L. Barnett T. Williams R.L. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21770-21776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methylated polysaccharides were hydrolyzed in 5 m trifluoroacetic acid for 5 h at 100 °C and reduced with borohydride, and the alditol acetates were acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (1:1, by volume) (32Kircher H.W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1103-1106Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The alditols acetates of methylated sugars were dissolved in ethanol and analyzed in a gas chromatography/mass spectrometer.NMR Experiments—1H and 13C spectra of the fucan were recorded using a Bruker DRX 600 apparatus with triple resonance probe (30Vilela-Silva E.S.A. Castro M.O. Valente A.P. Biermann H.C. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). About 15 mg of each sample was dissolved in 0.7 ml of 99.9% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). All spectra were recorded at 60 °C with HOD suppression by presaturation. COSY, TOCSY, and 1H/13C HMQC spectra were recorded using states-times proportion phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension. TOCSY spectra were run with 4096 × 400 points with a spin-lock field of ∼10 kHz and a mixing time of 80 ms. HMQC spectra were run with 1024 × 256 points and globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulses for decoupling. NOESY spectra were run with a mixing time of 100 ms. Chemical shifts are relative to external trimethysilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm for 1H and to methanol for 13C.Anticoagulant Activity of the Galactofucan—All the coagulation assays (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time; TT, thrombin time, and HEPTEST®) were performed with a coagulometer, as described earlier (33Dietrich C.P. Paiva J.F. Castro R.A.B. Chavante S.F. Jeske W. Fareed J. Gorin P.A.J. Mendes A. Nader H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and were measured by using human plasma from Roche Applied Science. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times on different days (n = 6).Antithrombotic Activity—The inhibition of venous thrombosis produced after venae cavae ligature by sulfated polysaccharide was measured by the method of Reyers et al. (34Reyers I. Mussoni A.L. Donati M.B. Gaetano G. Thromb. Res. 1980; 18: 669-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, the method consisted of exposing 1 cm of the inferior venae cavae of rats (below the left renal vein) and performing a ligature with cotton thread (number 8) 5 min after intravenous injection of the test substance. The abdominal cavity was then closed. After 2-24 h, the cavity was reopened, and the eventual thrombi formed were removed from the vein, washed, blotted with filter paper, dried under vacuum for 24 h, and weighed. At specific times, the sulfated polysaccharide was injected endovenously in a volume of 0.2 ml of saline. Ten determinations for each dose were performed. Heparin was used as control. The animal assays were approved by the Ethical Animal Research Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo.Hemorrhagic Effect—Hemorrhagic activity in a rat tail model of the polysaccharides was assayed as described previously (35Dietrich C.P. Shinjo S.K. Moraes F.A. Castro R.A.B. Mendes A. Gouvea T.C. Nader H.B. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1999; 25: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following anesthesia with nembutal (40 mg/kg) and urethane (0.8 g/kg), scarification with a razor blade (1-2 mm deep and 5 mm long) was made 15 mm from the distal part of the rat tail (males, 3 months old). The tail was then immersed in isotonic NaCl, scraped with gauze, and immersed again in fresh saline to observe bleeding. The duration of bleeding of the control ranged from 30 to 60 s. Grazed tails were also immersed in saline solution containing sulfated galactofucan or heparin in different concentrations for 2 min and washed extensively with saline. The treated tails were then immersed in isotonic saline solution, and the amount of blood was measured by protein determination (29Spector J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 142-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as the sum of protein values of each tube minus the amount of blood present before exposure to the test substance.Effect of Polysaccharides on the Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate by the Endothelial Cells—The effect of polysaccharide stimulation of the synthesis (36Nader H.B. Bounassisi V. Colburn P. Dietrich C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) of an antithrombotic heparan sulfate (37Colburn P. Buonassisi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) by rabbit aorta endothelial cells (38Buonassisi V. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1612-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) was performed essentially as described for heparin and other antithrombotic compounds (39Pinhal M.A.S. Walenga J. Jeske W. Hoppensteadt D. Dietrich C.P. Fareed J. Nader H.B. Thromb. Res. 1994; 74: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, at the end of the incubation, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with serum-free F-12 medium. Protein-free heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains were prepared from the culture medium by incubating the sample with 0.1 mg of SUPERase for 4 h at 60 °C. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was heated for 7 min at 100 °C, and the radiolabeled glycosaminoglycans were precipitated with 2 volumes of methanol in the presence of carrier heparan sulfate. The heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate synthesized by these cells and secreted to the medium were quantified and characterized by their electrophoretic mobility in agarose gel and enzymatic degradation with glycosaminoglycan lyases (chondroitinases AC and ABC and heparitinases) as described previously (36Nader H.B. Bounassisi V. Colburn P. Dietrich C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Pinhal M.A.S. Walenga J. Jeske W. Hoppensteadt D. Dietrich C.P. Fareed J. Nader H.B. Thromb. Res. 1994; 74: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled compounds were visualized by exposure of the gel after drying and staining to a Kodak blue x-ray film. The radioactive bands were scraped from the gel and counted in a liquid scintillation counter using Ultima Gold (Packard Instrument Co.). Cell protein was estimated by a Coomassie Blue method. All the experiments were performed in triplicate for each data point. The bars of the figures indicate the ± S.E.Effect of Polysaccharide on Cell Growth—Rabbit aorta endothelial cells were grown in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Cultilab, São Paulo, Brazil), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Sigma) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 2.5% CO2. Endothelial cells, at 1 × 105 cell/plate, were seeded in 35-mm culture plates. The cells were maintained at G0 phase for 24 h by incubation in F-12 medium without serum. Cells were released from the G0 phase by addition of F-12 medium plus 10% FCS in the absence (control) or presence of 100 μg/ml sulfated galactofucan or heparin. Proliferation was measured by daily cell count (in triplicate) for 9 days. The cell viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion (40Porcionatto M.A. Moreira C.R. Lotfi C.F. Armelin H.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Thymidine Incorporation—The cell cycle was analyzed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Quiescent cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (0.25 μCi/ml) in the absence (control) or the presence of sulfated galactofucan or heparin (100 μg/ml) for various times. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 3.5 m urea in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The incorporated radioactivity in the cells was determined by scintillation counting as described previously (40Porcionatto M.A. Moreira C.R. Lotfi C.F. Armelin H.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Assay for Factor Xa Activity—Confluent endothelial cells grown in 100-mm culture plates were incubated for 24 h (37 °C, 2.5% CO2) in F-12 medium without phenol red in the presence or absence of sulfated galactofucan (100 μg/ml). At the end of the incubation, conditioned media were removed, and aliquots (10-100 μl) were assayed for FXa. F-12 medium not exposed to the cells was used as a negative control. The conditioned media were also tested after incubation with heparitinases (50 μl to a final volume of 500 μl in the presence of 0.05 units of heparitinases at 30 °C, pH 7.0, overnight), and aliquots proportional to the original volume were assayed for FXa. These enzymes are free of proteolytic activity (20Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Tersariol I.L.S. Pinhal M.A.S. Oliveira F.W. Moraes C. Dietrich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16807-16813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay for FXa consisted of preincubating 5 μl of FXa (20 nm) with the different media (10-100 μl) in 96-well plate for 5 min at 37 °C. An aliquot of 5 μl of the synthetic substrate (S2222) (4.0 mm) was added to a final volume of 200 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 3000 s. The activity was continuously monitored by measurement of the absorbance at 405 nm (41Campos I.T.N. Silva M.M. Azzolini S.S. Souza A.F. Sampaio C.A.M. Fritz H. Tanaka A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Tecan, model Sunrise, Grödig, Austria) and the software Magellan version 5.01 (Tecan, Grödig, Austria). Three different sets of experiments were performed in duplicate for each condition investigated. The results were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism version 3.0, and each point represents the mean ± S.E. The results are expressed as the ratio of the absorbance for the different experimental conditions relative to the negative control. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance test of p < 0.05 and Student's t test of p < 0.05.RESULTSPurification of a Sulfated Galactofucan—In a previous work we purified a sulfated fucan from the marine alga S. schroederi, designated as “fucan A” (6Leite E.L. Medeiros M.G.L. Rocha H.A.O. Farias G.G.M. Silva L.F. Chavante S.F. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Plant Sci. 1998; 132: 215-228Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, we did not succeed in obtaining purified fractions of another sulfated polysaccharide present in high amounts in the extracts from the alga, originally d designated as “fucan B.” We now applied a simple methodology for the purification of these polysaccharides, based on precipitation with different concentrations of acetone. The electrophoretic mobility of the various fractions on agarose gel, using diaminopropane/acetate buffer, is shown in Fig. 1A. Although the electrophoretic profiles show the presence of two or even three bands in the various fractions, clearly precipitation with 0.9% (v/v) acetone yields a single spot, whose electrophoretic mobility corresponds to fucan B, as we reported previously (5Dietrich C.P. Farias G.G.M. Abreu L.R.D. Leite E.L. Silva L.F. Nader H.B. Plant Sci. 1995; 108: 143-153Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar).The chemical composition of the fractions obtained at various concentrations of acetone is shown in TABLE ONE. The relative proportions of sugars vary among the various fractions. Thus, uronic acid is the main sugar present in the polymers precipitated with 0.5 and 0.6% of acetone, possibly due to the presence of alginic acid. Neutral sugars and sulfate are found in greater amounts in the 0.7-2.0% acetone fractions. It is clear that the relative amounts of these sugars vary according to the fraction. Of course this variation in the sugar composition may be a consequence of different types of polysaccharides found in these fractions, except for the one obtained with 0.9% acetone. This fraction shows a single electrophoretic band on agarose gel, and the sugar composition reported in TABLE ONE possibly indicates the occurrence of a sulfated polysaccharide in S. schroederi, containing galactose, fucose, sulfate, xylose, and traces of uronic acid, which we hereby will designate as sulfated galactofucan. These fractions were not contaminated with laminarans (a group of the reserve β-d-glucans found in brown algae) because glucose was not detected.TABLE ONEChemical composition of acidic polysaccharides from S. schroederi obtained by acetone precipitation The chemical composition of the sulfated galactofucan fraction is indicated by italic type.Fraction (acetone volume)PolysaccharidesMolar ratios to fucoseXyloseUronic acidGalactoseSulfate%aPercentages was determined by phenol-H2SO4 reaction0.538.00.68.01.30.635.20.64.00.31.30.712.20.90.51.51.70.95.80.60.21.63.01.15.80.70.11.32.21.32.60.90.30.72.82.00.30.40.11.12.2a Percentages was determined by phenol-H2SO4 reaction Open table in a new tab We further purified the sulfated galactofucan that is the fraction precipitated with 0.9% acetone, using ion exchange chromatography on a Lewatite resin.

https://openalex.org/W2001118852,"A novel form of translational regulation is described for the key polyamine biosynthetic enzyme S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC). Plant AdoMetDC mRNA 5′ leaders contain two highly conserved overlapping upstream open reading frames (uORFs): the 5′ tiny and 3′ small uORFs. We demonstrate that the small uORF-encoded peptide is responsible for constitutively repressing downstream translation of the AdoMetDC proenzyme ORF in the absence of increased polyamine levels. This first example of a sequence-dependent uORF to be described in plants is also functional in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The tiny uORF is required for normal polyamine-responsive AdoMetDC mRNA translation, and we propose that this is achieved by control of ribosomal recognition of the occluded small uORF, either by ribosomal leaky scanning or by programmed -1 frameshifting. In vitro expression demonstrated that both the tiny and the small uORFs are translated. This tiny/small uORF configuration is highly conserved from moss to Arabidopsis thaliana, and a more diverged tiny/small uORF arrangement is found in the AdoMetDC mRNA 5′ leader of the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, indicating an ancient origin for the uORFs.

There are two characterized types of uORF: sequence-independent uORFs, where uORF recognition, uORF termination efficiency, intercistronic distance, and sequence affect reinitiation efficiency at the downstream ORF (but the uORF-encoded peptide is not important), and sequence-dependent uORFs, where the nascent uORF peptide causes ribosome stalling during translational elongation or termination.

The mammalian AdoMetDC uORF encodes the hexapeptide MAGDIS and is located 14 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ cap. MAGDIS-mediated translational regulation of the AdoMetDC mRNA depends on cell type (15Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol.

Plant AdoMetDC mRNAs possess long 5′ leader sequences of at least 500 nucleotides containing a pair of uORFs that overlap by one nucleotide (19Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The 5′ tiny uORF and the overlapping 3′ small uORF consist of 3–4 and 48–54 codons, respectively, and their highly conserved arrangement predates the origin of flowering plants (19Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that the plant AdoMetDC mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by polyamines and that the small uORF represses downstream translation under normal growth conditions (20Hanfrey C. Franceschetti M. Mayer M.J. Illingworth C. Michael A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44131-44139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Removal or truncation of the small uORF abolishes translational control, disrupts polyamine levels, severely perturbs growth of transgenic plants (20Hanfrey C. Franceschetti M. Mayer M.J. Illingworth C. Michael A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44131-44139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and results in the depletion of chloroplast RNA-binding proteins (21Franceschetti M. Perry B. Thompson B. Hanfrey C. Michael A.J. FEBS Letts. 2004; 576: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we show that the tiny and small uORFs are essential for translational regulation by polyamines, acting as a dual component mechanism; the sequence-independent tiny uORF is required for normal levels of polyamine responsiveness, and the sequence-dependent small uORF is required for downstream translational repression. Our results are consistent with the proposal that polyamine-responsive translational repression of the AdoMetDC mRNA is due to a ribosomal switch from the noninhibitory tiny uORF to the inhibitory small uORF. The small uORF peptide is the first sequence-dependent uORF identified in plants, and it is likely to target a highly conserved component of the translational machinery, because the Arabidopsis small uORF is also repressive in a sequence-dependent manner in S. cerevisiae. In addition, we found that the AdoMetDC mRNA from the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains a more diverged tiny/small uORF arrangement containing a perfectly preserved intron position in the small uORF, suggesting that the plant AdoMetDC mRNA uORFs represent an ancient mechanism for translational regulation in response to polyamines. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutants of the AdoMetDC1 cDNA were produced using the Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants were constructed using the SAMDC1 plasmid (which contains the wild type AdoMetDC1 cDNA in a pBluescript KS vector) (19Franceschetti M. Hanfrey C. Scaramagli S. Torrigiani P. Bagni N. Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), except for MUT2 and MSM, for which the MUT mutant was used as the template. Construction of the MUT and TAG mutants was described previously (20Hanfrey C. Franceschetti M. Mayer M.J. Illingworth C. Michael A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44131-44139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers employed were 5′-GCTCCAAGAGGCCATCCTCAGTACCAGCGTGC-3′ for EXT, 5′-ATAAAAGCGTGATTGAGATTATGATGGAGTCG-3′ for TTG (removing the tiny uORF) and MUT2 (used on the MUT template, removing both uORFs), and 5′-GCGTGAATGAGATTATAATCGAGTCGAAAGGTGG-3′ for TIN (removing the small uORF); the altered bases are underlined. A primer that disrupted the unique ApaI site in pBluescript was used for the selection of mutants. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The MSM mutant was constructed using the MUT plasmid as template and the mutagenic primer 5′-CTCCAAGAGGCCATTCCTGAGTACCAGCG-3′ (inserted base underlined). The resulting cDNA has no small uORF, which has been replaced by a C-terminally extended tiny uORF, where the new tiny uORF stop codon coincides with the stop codon of the wild type small uORF. The FS mutant was constructed using a two-step mutagenesis. First, an extra nucleotide was inserted in the small uORF, near the 3′ end, using the mutagenic primer 5′-GCTCCAAGAGGCCATACCTGAGTACCAGCG-3′ (inserted nucleotide underlined). The newly created mutant plasmid was then used as the template for the second mutagenesis step, in which a nucleotide was deleted near the 5′ end of the small uORF sequence, with the mutagenic primer 5′-GAGATTATGATGGAG(t)CGAAAGGTGG-3′ (the deleted nucleotide, bracketed and in lowercase, was missing from the primer sequence). The FS plasmid has a frameshifted small uORF sequence such that 45 of the encoded 52 amino acids differ from the wild type, but the position of the small uORF within the cDNA is unaltered. The F-S/TTG double mutant plasmid has the frameshifted small uORF and no tiny uORF and was produced using an overlapping PCR approach. Two first step PCR amplifications were carried out, using the FS plasmid as template and primer pairs 5′-TTACCACCTTTCGCTCCATCATAATCTCAATCACGCTTTTATATATAAATGAAGATCGAT-3′ plus the T3 primer and 5′-ATCGATCTTCATTTATATATAAAAGCGTGATTGAGATTATGATGGAGCGAAAGGTGGTAA-3′ (mutated bases underlined) plus 5′-AGAGAACGATTGGATCCGGGAACCAGCAGAAAA-3′ (BamHI recognition site from SAMDC1 sequence underlined). Aliquots of these two reactions were combined in a second step PCR with the T3 primer and 5′-AGAGAACGATTGGATCCGGGAACCAGCAGAAAA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). From the resultant product, a 0.4-kbp SalI-BamHI fragment consisting of the 5′ leader from FS with the tiny uAUG mutated to UUG was excised and used to replace the equivalent SalI-BamHI fragment from FS. Plasmid Construction—The 5′ leader sequences from the Arabidopsis AdoMetDC1 cDNA in pBluescript (SAMDC1) and the various mutants were PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-TTAAGAGCTCTCAACTTAATCGTTTCTCTC-3′ (SacI site underlined) and 5′-CTCCCATGGCTCGCCTTGTTGTGTGAGCG-3′ (NcoI site underlined). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and checked for errors by sequencing. SacI-NcoI fragments containing the 5′ leaders were then used to replace the TMV Ω sequence in the pUC118-based vector pSLJ4D4 (22Jones J.D. Shlumukov L. Carland F. English J. Schofield S.R. Bishop G.J. Harrison K. Transgenic Res. 1992; 1: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). From the resultant plasmids, 4.4-kbp EcoRI-HindIII fragments containing the CaMV 35 S RNA promoter, the 5′ leader variants, the Escherichia coli β-glucosidase (GUS) coding sequence, and the octopine synthase terminator were cloned into the binary vector pBin19 for tobacco transformation and into pBI101 (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), from which the original gusA ORF had been removed, for Arabidopsis transformation. For expression in yeast, 2.4-kbp XhoI-XbaI fragments containing the 5′ leader variants and the gusA coding sequence were cloned into the pYES2 expression vector (Invitrogen), downstream of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The SAM-GUS construct is a translational fusion between the AdoMetDC1 small uORF and the initiation codon of the gusA ORF and was constructed using an overlapping PCR approach. The 5′ leader of AdoMetDC1, up to and including the 13th codon of the small uORF, was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-TTAAGAGCTCTCAACTTAATCGTTTCTCTC-3′ (SacI site underlined) and 5′-GGGTTTCTACAGGACGTAACATACTGCTGGACTTCTTTTT-3′ (gusA homologous sequence underlined), and the 5′ end of the gusA sequence was amplified using the primers 5′-GCATAATTACGAATATCTGCA-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGAAGTCCAGCAGTATGTTACGTCCTGTAGAAACCC-3′ (AdoMetDC1 homologous sequence underlined). Aliquots of these two reactions were combined in a second step PCR with the primers 5′-TTAAGAGCTCTCAACTTAATCGTTTCTCTC-3′ (SacI site underlined) and 5′-GCATAATTACGAATATCTGCA-3′. From the resultant product, a 0.3-kbp SacI-BclI fragment consisting of the 5′ leader of AdoMetDC1, translationally fused at the 13th codon of the small uORF to the first 77 bp of the gusA ORF, was cloned into pSLJ4D4. For yeast expression of this construct, a 2.2-kbp XhoI-XbaI fragment containing the translational fusion and the complete gusA coding sequence was cloned into pYES2. Plant Transformation and Growth Conditions—For tobacco transformation, constructs in the pBin19 binary vector were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 and used to inoculate leaf discs of Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi XHFD8 as previously described (23Burtin D. Michael A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transgenic plantlets were selected on kanamycin and once rooted were transferred to soil in a greenhouse and grown at 25 °C with a 16-h light period. For Arabidopsis transformation the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype was grown in the greenhouse with long days (16 h of light) at 20 °C, and transformation was performed using the floral dip method (24Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different GUS constructs in pBI101 were introduced into the A. tumefaciens strain C58 GV3101. Transgenic seeds were selected by germination on kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Transformants were transplanted to soil and grown in a greenhouse, and analyses were performed on seeds from self-fertilization of these T1 plants. For tobacco seedling experiments, 100 seeds were surface-sterilized, washed, and transferred to a 1-liter conical flask containing 200 ml of Gamborg B5 medium (3.16 g/liter Gamborg B5 salts, 20 g/liter glucose, 0.5 g/liter MES, pH 5.7) and grown in the dark with shaking at 80 rpm and 25 °C for 3 weeks. These T1 seedlings were a mix of the segregating homozygous, heterozygous, and azygous siblings derived from self-fertilization of the T0 generation transgenic plants. For Arabidopsis seedling experiments, 500 T2 sterilized segregating seeds from lines containing single transgene insertion loci, as determined by segregation analysis, were placed in a 1-liter flask of 200 ml of Gamborg B5 medium with half-strength sucrose (10 g/liter) and grown with shaking at 80 rpm and 25 °C for 10 days. All of the seedlings grown in the presence of polyamines (and also controls) were washed five times with sterile water. Yeast Transformation and Analysis—The S. cerevisiae strain, 2602 (MATα ura3-52 his6 leu2) (obtained from H. Tabor, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), was used for GUS expression studies. Yeast cultures were grown aerobically at 25 °C in minimal SD medium. Yeast transformation was performed using a modified lithium acetate procedure (25Elbe R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed yeast strains were grown in 100 ml of SD medium lacking glucose, with 2% galactose, at 25 °C for 16 h. The cultures were divided into two 50-ml aliquots; the cells from one were pelleted and set aside at -70 °C for GUS activity assays. Total RNA was isolated from the remaining cells using the rapid RNA isolation method (26Piper P.W. Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York, NY1994: 135-146Google Scholar). For Northern analysis, 3 μgof total RNA was separated on 1.2% agarose formaldehyde denaturing gels and hybridized with the gusA sequence from pSLJ4D4 and rehybridized with the yeast TY element (27Mellor J. Fulton S.M. Dobson M.J. Wilson W. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Nature. 1985; 313: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—The wild type AdoMetDC1 cDNA and mutant cDNAs within the pBluescript KS vector were linearized at the 3′ end by digestion with NotI, before being in vitro transcribed using the RiboMax T3 kit (Promega). Reactions including 3 mm m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G RNA capping analogue (Invitrogen) were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Unincorporated NTPs and cap were removed from reactions by spin dialysis with Sephadex G-50, prior to quantification of RNA by spectrometry. One microgram of each RNA transcript was translated in the wheat germ extract system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were performed in 40 μl, with 130 mm potassium acetate and 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h and transferred to -20 °C. For visualization of in vitro translation products, aliquots of reactions were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled bands were quantified using a FujiBas 1500 phosphorimaging device. GUS Enzyme Assay—Ground Arabidopsis tissue was assayed for GUS activity using the GUS-Light assay system (Tropix, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Tissue extracts were incubated with substrate for 1 h at room temperature, and light signal output was measured using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany). Protein contents of extracts were measured using the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and GUS activity was expressed as relative light units/μg of protein. Tobacco tissue GUS activity was measured using a fluorescence assay (β-glucuronidase activity detection kit; Sigma-Aldrich) rather than a chemiluminescence assay because of discontinuance of the GUS-Light kit manufacture. Tissue extracts were incubated with the 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide substrate for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence generated by the 4-methylumbelliferone product was measured in a Versafluor fluorometer (Bio-Rad). Duplicate assays were performed for each extract, two extractions were performed per sample, and the activity was expressed as nmol 4-methylumbelliferone produced h-1 mg-1 protein. The cells from galactose-induced yeast cultures were resuspended in 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7.0, and vortexed on ice in the presence of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the extract was assayed using the GUS-Light system, as described above. The Plant AdoMetDC Small uORF Is Required for Polyamine-responsive Translational Regulation—Previously we demonstrated that the plant AdoMetDC mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by excess polyamines and that the small uORF participates in translational repression of the AdoMetDC mRNA under normal growth conditions (20Hanfrey C. Franceschetti M. Mayer M.J. Illingworth C. Michael A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44131-44139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, it was not determined whether the small uORF is involved in the post-transcriptional repression of AdoMetDC in response to polyamines. To ascertain the role of the small uORF in polyamine-responsive, post-transcriptional regulation of AdoMetDC, we used reporter constructs containing the E. coli β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter transcribed from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (Fig. 1). Inserted between the gusA ORF and the promoter was either the Arabidopsis AdoMetDC1 mRNA wild type 5′ leader sequence (SAM construct) or a site-directed mutant in which the small uORF AUGs and the tiny uORF stop codon were removed, thereby C-terminally extending the tiny uORF (MUT construct). The GUS construct lacks any AdoMetDC 5′ leader sequence. T1 generation seeds of self-fertilized transgenic tobacco lines expressing these reporter constructs were sown in liquid growth medium in the dark with different concentrations of spd and spm (Fig. 2). The relative translation (calculated as the GUS activity divided by the gusA mRNA level normalized to ubiquitin mRNA) of each construct in the absence of added polyamines indicated that the MUT construct was translationally derepressed 1.7-fold relative to the SAM construct, and removal of the 5′ leader (GUS construct) resulted in a 4-fold derepression. Excess polyamines are inhibitory to normal translation (29Giannakouros T. Nikolakaki H. Georgatsos J.G. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1990; 99: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and exogenously supplied polyamines decreased the translational efficiency of each construct in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). However, the wild type AdoMetDC mRNA leader construct (SAM) was markedly more sensitive to polyamines than the MUT or GUS constructs. At 500 μm each of spd and spm there was a 43-fold translational repression of the SAM construct, a 5-fold repression of the MUT construct and 2-fold repression of the GUS construct.FIGURE 2Effect of polyamines on translational efficiency of Arabidopsis AdoMetDC leader constructs in T1 transgenic tobacco seedlings. Relative translation was calculated as the GUS activity divided by the gusA mRNA level for each construct. gusA mRNA levels were normalized to ubiquitin mRNA level for each construct. For each construct 100 seedlings were grown in the dark, in liquid Gamborg B5 medium for 3 weeks. The mRNA levels were quantified from RNA gel blots performed with 10 μg of total RNA. The effect of different concentrations of equimolar spd and spm together was assessed; C is the control with no added polyamines. The error bars indicate the standard errors of triplicate GUS assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Removal of the Tiny uORF Results in Translational Repression in the Absence of Added Polyamines—The 5′ tiny uORF overlaps the translationally repressive small uORF by one nucleotide, occluding the AUG of the small uORF, in a highly conserved configuration (Fig. 3). Arabidopsis AdoMetDC tiny uORF has gained a codon relative to rice, pine, and moss, resulting in two adjacent AUG codons for the tiny uORF/small uORF junction. The Arabidopsis tiny uORF termination codon overlaps the second AUG of the small uORF by one nucleotide. We removed the tiny uORF by changing its AUG to UUG using site-directed mutagenesis (TTG construct; Fig. 1). In young expanding leaves of T0 generation transgenic tobacco plants, removal of the tiny uORF resulted in a 95% reduction in relative translation of the AdoMetDC 5′ leader in the absence of exogenously added polyamines (SAM versus TTG constructs; Fig. 4A). Elimination of the tiny uORF resulted in a 93% reduction in the relative translation of the AdoMetDC 5′ leader sequence in tobacco seedlings grown in liquid culture, in the absence of added polyamines (SAM versus TTG construct; Fig. 4B). The addition of polyamines at 500 μm each of spd and spm caused a 77% reduction in translational efficiency of the SAM construct in tobacco seedlings (Fig. 4B). This is a smaller repressive effect than observed in the experiment shown in Fig. 2, probably because of the addition of polyamines at day 13, rather than at day 0, for the experiment in Fig. 4B. A similar polyamine-independent translational repression (83%) due to elimination of the tiny uORF was observed with dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings in liquid culture (SAM versus TTG construct; Fig. 4C), whereas the addition of 100 μm each of spd and spm caused a 72% reduction in translational efficiency of the wild type SAM construct (a lower concentration of polyamines was used with Arabidopsis because of greater growth sensitivity of seedlings to the added polyamines). These results demonstrate that the tiny uORF is a key component of the polyamine responsiveness of the AdoMetDC mRNA 5′ leader because its elimination causes translational repression of the downstream cistron in the absence of increased polyamine levels. With both tobacco and Arabidopsis seedlings, exogenously added polyamines further repressed the translational efficiency of the TTG construct where the tiny uORF was eliminated (a further 5.2% for tobacco and 14% for Arabidopsis; Fig. 4, B and C).FIGURE 4Elimination of the tiny uORF results in polyamine-independent translational repression. Relative translation of the GUS reporter constructs (A) was determined in extracts from leaves of T0 generation transgenic tobacco plants grown in a greenhouse with 16 h of daylight. Relative translation was calculated according to the legend for Fig. 2. Tenμg of RNA/sample was used for the RNA gel blots from which mRNA levels were quantified. The results represent the means of n independent transgenic lines (SAM, 9; TTG, 6; FS, 11; MSM, 14). The error bars indicate the standard errors. B shows relative translation in T1 transgenic tobacco seedlings (200 seedlings/liter flask). spd and spm (PA) were added at 500 μm each, together at day 13, and the seedlings were grown for 3 weeks in total in the dark. The results represent the means of two representative independent transgenic lines for SAM and FS constructs and three lines for the TTG construct. C, relative translation in T2 transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings (500 seedlings/liter flask). spd and spm (PA) were added at 100 μm each, together at day 0, and the seedlings were grown for 2 weeks in total in the dark. The results represent the means of two independent transgenic lines for each construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Small uORF Is a Sequence-dependent uORF—To unequivocally determine the importance of the small uORF-encoded peptide, two new constructs were made (Fig. 1) that frameshifted the small uORF but did not extend the reading frame beyond the normal stop codon.

Environmental and endogenous agents constantly subject DNA and RNA to damage. Alkylating agents cover a spectrum of chemicals that in their most simple form methylate DNA or RNA. The subsequent distribution of methylated products of the reaction of methylating agents with nucleic acids depends on the nature of the agent. SN1 alkylating agents react via a carbonium ion intermediate whereas SN2 agents interact directly with DNA (1Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Under these circumstances different sites on nucleic acids are modified. In addition to the alkylating agent, the structure of the DNA also plays a role. Regions of single-stranded nucleic acids favor reaction at sites that are virtually untouched in double-stranded nucleic acids. For example, position 1 of Ade is not modified to any extent in double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA), 2The abbreviations used are:dsdouble-stranded2OGα-ketoglutarate Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenaseABHhuman AlkB homologuemAbhmouse AlkB homologueODNoligodeoxyribonucleotidepoly(A)polyribonucleotide Apoly(C)polyribonucleotide Cpoly(dA)polydeoxyribonucleotide Apoly(dC)polydeoxyribonucleotide Csssingle-strandedNTAnitrilotriacetic acid[3H]MNUN-[3H]methyl-N-nitrosoureaDMSdimethylsulfate whereas in single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) it becomes a major target (1Singer B.

The genetic work in E. coli was important, but without function, progress in the line of AlkB lagged behind that of other DNA repair studies (10Volkert M.R. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1988; 11: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Volkert M.R. Gately F.H. Hajec L.I. Mutat. Res. 1989; 217: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Volkert M.R. Hajec L.I. Nguyen D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1196-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even the isolation of a human homologue of AlkB, ABH1, failed to provide insight as to function of this group of proteins (13Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Wang R.P. Shell B.K. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1996; 24: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using a host cell reactivation assay, alkB mutants were shown to efficiently process chemically methylated ds-DNA phage, but not chemically methylated ss-DNA phage (14Dinglay S. Gold B. Sedgwick B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Dinglay S. Trewick S.C. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Genes. Dev. 2000; 14: 2097-2105PubMed Google Scholar). That provided an important clue to the nature of AlkB. Crucial information in elucidating the enzymatic function of AlkB was provided by bioinformatics analysis that showed AlkB belonged to a large class of enzymes known as 2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenases (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome. Biol. 2001; 2: 7.1-7.8Crossref Google Scholar). Once the link between the AlkB and the 2OG family was established, two groups showed that AlkB was in fact a member of the family and that AlkB released methyl groups not only from 1-meAde and 3-meCyt, but also 3-meThy and 1-meGua (17Trewick S.C.

A. 2004; 101: 14051-14056Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The identification of an activity for AlkB accelerated the field, and two homologues of human origin, ABH2 and ABH3, were isolated based on BLAST searches of databases. These proteins were both demonstrated to be active on methylated substrates (22Aas P.A. Otterlei M. Falnes P.O. Vagbo C.B. Skorpen F. Akbari M. Sundheim O. Bjoras M. Slupphaug G. Seeberg E.

A. 2002; 99: 16660-16665Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, a and b). Although ABH2 and ABH3 were active, ABH1, the first member in the ABH series, was not active in biochemical or complementation assays. Another bioinformatics search revealed a number of potential members of the series (24Kurowski M.A. Bhagwat A.S. Papaj G. Bujnicki J.M. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This suggests that there are a number of homologues related to AlkB that cover most phyla. One method to elucidate biological and biochemical function is to work in related organisms. Probably the most studied mammal aside from humans is mouse. The model presented by mouse has been exploited by targeted deletion of genes by homologous recombination. Therefore, we have isolated cDNAs coding for two mouse homologues of ABH2 and ABH3. We have expressed those sequences, produced proteins that were purified to homogeneity, demonstrated activity on both DNA and RNA substrates, determine the kinetics for the release of methyl groups from DNA, and show the tissue distribution in mouse and human of the RNA for both genes. We also have isolated and expressed cDNAs for ABH4-8 and discuss the results of experiments on the purported relation between these proteins and the activities of ABH2 and ABH3. Strains—The F′-plasmid was introduced into E. coli strains HK81 (wild type) and HK82 (alkB) as described (15Dinglay S. Trewick S.C. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Genes. Dev. 2000; 14: 2097-2105PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the strains HK81/F′ and HK82/F′, respectively (the HK81 and HK82 strains were kindly provided by Michael Volkert) (5Kataoka H. Yamamoto Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kataoka H. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 198: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Volkert M.R. Gately F.H. Hajec L.I. Mutat. Res. 1989; 217: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures of XL1-Blue (donor), HK81 (recipient), and HK82 (recipient) were diluted 20-fold and grown to approximately A600 0.5. Cells were mixed in ratio donor/recipient = 1:10 and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was streaked out on LB plates with 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. HK82 (alkB DE3) was constructed using the λDE3 lysogenization kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression and purification of all the human or mouse AlkB homologues were conducted in this strain. Purification of Human ABH2 and ABH3 and Mouse mAbh2 and mAbh3—Human ABH2 and ABH3 cDNAs were obtained by RT-PCR with total RNA of LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Mouse Abh2 and Abh3 cDNAs were obtained from the IMAGE consortium, and IMAGE Clone IDs for expressed sequence tags (EST) clones are 4196765 (mABH2) and 3993214 (mABH3). The cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, and subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites (ABH2) or BamHI/SalI sites (ABH3, mABH2, and mABH3) of the expression vector pET28a(+) (Novagen). All sequences for mAbh2, mAbh3, ABH4-ABH8 have been submitted to GenBank™. His-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain HK82 (alkB DE3) in LB medium. Bacterial pellets were lysed and sonicated in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) with 1 mg/ml of lysozyme. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and the extracts were loaded onto a Ni-NTA flow column, which was washed first with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The bound proteins were released from the column with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and each of 50 mm, 100 mm and 250 mm imidazole, respectively) (Qiagen). We further purified the fractions obtained from the Ni-NTA columns by ion exchange with CM Sepharose® Fast Flow and FPLC with Superose® 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the relevant fractions were pooled. Point mutations in human or mouse AlkB homologues were introduced by QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the mutant human ABH2 (D173A), ABH2 (H236A), human ABH3 (D193A), human ABH3 (H257A), mAbh2 (D151A), mAbh2 (H214A) mAbh3, and (D193A), mAbh3 (H257A) were confirmed by sequencing the entire coding sequence. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified in the same manner as the wild-type proteins. Preparation of Methylated DNA and RNA—Poly(A), poly(C), poly(dA), and poly(dC) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The homopolymers, single-stranded M13mp18, and single-stranded DNA oligo 5′-AAAGCAAGAAACGAAAAAGCGAAA-3′ (40 μg) were incubated in sodium cacodylate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.25) in the presence of 0.1 mCi of N-[3H]methyl-N-nitrosourea (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C for 2 h. The nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of NaCl (final concentration of 1 m) and 2.5 volume of 100% ethanol. The ethanol precipitation step was repeated once more, followed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) to remove traces of free radioactivity. For generation of double-stranded 3H-methylated substrate, the single-stranded [3H]CH3-ODN was incubated in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of non-methylated complementary strand for 20 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and then placed on ice. The double-stranded substrate was generated immediately prior to the experiment. The ss-M13mp18 DNA was treated with various concentrations of MMS in 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.25) for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by ethanol precipitation of the DNA, and resuspension in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The ss-DNA ODNs with one 1-meA or 3-meC (ChemGenes) were obtained from the Midland Certified Reagent Company. Assay for Complementation Using MMS-treated M13mp18 ss—DNA-competent cells (HK81/F′ and HK82/F′) were prepared by treatment with cold 0.1 m CaCl2 immediately prior to the experiment. Incubation of MMS-treated M13 ss-DNA (1 μg) in the absence or presence of mammalian AlkB homologues (10 pmol) was performed in reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8), 40 μm FeSO4, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 2 mm ascorbate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After the reaction, the ss-DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, and 200 ng was used for each transformation. Release of Radioactivity by 2OG Activity of AlkB Homologues—[3H]MNU-treated DNA or RNA (typically 0.2 μg, containing 1000 dpm. label) was incubated in reaction mixture for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of varying amounts of mammalian AlkB homologues in the following buffer: 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8), 40 μm FeSO4, 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 2 mm ascorbate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated in the presence of carrier calf thymus DNA, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by scintillation counting. Assay for Repair of 1-meA or 3-meC in Site Specifically Modified ODNs—The sequences of ss-DNA oligos with a 1-methyl dA or 3-methyl dC were as follows: 5′-AAAGCAGmAATTCGAAAAAGCGAAA-3′, 5′-AAAGCACmCGGTCGAAAAAGCGAAA-3′. The ss-DNA oligos (at least in 3-fold molar excess compared with the ABH2 or 3) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end, and incubated with 50 pmol of human or mouse ABH2 and ABH3 and for 30 min at 37 °C in the same buffer as for the complementation assay. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, ss-DNA oligos were annealed with a 3-fold molar excess of non-methylated complementary strand for 20 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0), and then subjected to EcoRI or HpaII treatment for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The restriction enzyme cleavage was verified on 20%(w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The gels were dried and exposed overnight to storage phosphor screens and were scanned at 200 micron resolution using a Typhoon 9410 Variable using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics) Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Steady-state Kinetics of ABH2 and ABH3—Determination of the kcat and Km values of the ABH2 and ABH3 was made by varying the substrate concentration (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nm). The substrates used were the same ODNs as those in the previous section. Both ss- and ds-DNA substrates were used. The total protein concentration in each case was 5 pm. Reactions were performed for 60 min or adjusted to ensure that less than 20% of the substrate was expended. All reactions were performed in triplicate and analyzed using Hanes plots according to Equation 1, [ODNTotal]/v=[ODNTotal]/Vmax+Km/Vmax(Eq. 1) where ODNtotal is the total ODN substrate concentration, Vmax is the enzyme maximum reaction velocity, v is the initial reaction velocity, and Km is the Michaelis constant. Reactions of ds-DNA substrates with ABH2 were performed in 150 mm NaCl in the reaction buffer based on results with respect to dependence on salt concentration. NMR Studies—The wild-type and mutant ABH2 and ABH3 proteins were characterized by one-dimensional NMR experiments to ensure that the amino acid substitutions do not disrupt the overall structural integrity of the protein. The samples for NMR measurements were at ∼1 mg/ml concentration, in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer in 95% H2O, 5% D2Oat pH 6.0. One-dimensional 1H experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with four channels, pulse shaping, and pulsed field gradient capabilities. The spectra were collected with 8192 complex points and 8000 Hz spectral width. Northern Blot Analysis—Human or mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ Northern blots were obtained from Clontech. The membranes were hybridized with a probe containing the complete cDNA of human or mouse AlkB homologues. A probe specific for β-actin was used as a control. Membranes were exposed overnight to storage phosphor screens and were scanned at 200 micron resolution using a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Signal quantification was performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Cloning and Sequence Alignment of mABH2 and mABH3—Mouse homologues of human ABH2 and 3, mAbh2 and mAbh3, were cloned by homology to the corresponding human proteins. The alignment of the proteins using ClustalW is shown in Fig. 1c. The identity between the mouse and human proteins suggests that the function should be conserved in these derivatives. The identity between mAbh2 and ABH2 is over 75.1%, but that is due mainly to differences in the N-terminal end of the proteins. In contrast, the identity for mAbh3 and ABH3 is 85.7% with the majority of bases that differ spread throughout the two sequences. There are a number of sequences that are conserved for all five sequences in Fig. 1c. These sequences indicated in yellow could have structural or catalytic roles. Among these, there is a cluster that has H separated by an amino acid and DDE (for ABH2, D173, Fig. 1c). This region could have a role in catalysis. The AlkB protein is very close in its sequence alignment in this region with the only difference being a lysine substituted in the sequence to separate the two consecutive aspartic acids. These alignments are close, but functional assays on the proteins must be performed to indicate that the proteins have the same activities. Interestingly, there is only 27% identity between mAbh2 and mAbh3. The identity drops to 19.1 or 12.6% when the AlkB is compared independently to mAbh2 or mAbh3. Even though the identity in bioinformatics alignments involving mAbh2 and mAbh3 with AlkB is low, both proteins still are active against similar substrates (see below). Expression and Purification of mAbh2 and mAbh3—To study the biochemical properties of mAbh2 and mAbh3, we expressed the mAbh2 and mAbh3 proteins using a T7 RNA polymerase promoter-based system in E. coli HK82(DE3) (alkB-) with His6 tags to use Ni-NTA chromatography in the initial purification step. Further purification of the proteins was performed using CM-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography to obtain homogeneous proteins (Fig. 2a). To compare the proteins to their human counterparts, the ABH2 and ABH3 were isolated using similar methods. To ensure that the major peaks from the final columns corresponded to the activity of the peaks observed for the proteins, we monitored the activity against a number of 3H-labeled substrates (Fig. 2b). Both mAbh2 and mAbh3 (not shown) purification demonstrated that the major peaks obtained in the final purification were the major activities obtained. Expression of the ABH2, ABH3, mAbh2, and mAbh3 produced more than 10 mg/liter of purified protein. mAbh2 and mAbh3 Reactions Complement Sensitivity of E. coli alkB-Strain HK82 to MMS-treated M13mp18—To test the activities of the purified proteins and their capacity to complement an alkB-deficient E. coli strain, ss-M13mp18 DNA was treated with MMS, the methylated ss-DNA treated with one of the AlkB homologue proteins, and transformed into an alkB strain (HK82) or as a control, a wild-type strain (HK81) (Fig. 3). If the methylated ss-DNA is not reacted with one of the AlkB homologue proteins, the transformation efficiency in the HK82 alkB- strain as determined by plaque formation is almost two orders of magnitude less than when the modified ss-DNA is treated with an AlkB homologue prior to transformation. In this assay, transformation efficiency is determined by the number of plaques formed compared with unmodified ss-M13mp18 DNA. The modified ss-DNA was transformed into the wild-type strain, HK81, without reaction with any of the AlkB homologues and demonstrated to have similar transformation efficiency to that of the modified ss-DNA treated with AlkB homolgues, but transformed into the HK82 alkB-deficient strain. Any of the AlkB homologues (ABH2, ABH3, mAbh2, or mAbh3) used for treatment of modified ss-DNA yielded transformation efficiencies comparable to that for transformation into the wild-type HK81 strain. Therefore, the mAbh2 and mAbh3 have similar activities to ABH2 and ABH3 that restore the transformation efficiency of methylated ss-DNA. mAbh2 and mAbh3 Remove Methyl Groups from 1-meA and 3-meC—The AlkB homologues repair the alkylated base via an oxidative mechanism that releases formaldehyde and does not involve scission of the phosphodiester backbone (17Trewick S.C.

To study the release of methyl groups by the 2OG activity of AlkB homologues, we used an assay based on ODNs with unique modifications of 1-meA or 3-meC in restriction enzyme cleavage sites. The modified ODN is first treated with the AlkB homologue. If ss, the ODN must be annealed to the complementary ODN prior to restriction enzyme cleavage. The ds-ODN is then reacted with a restriction enzyme and the ODN is cleaved if the methyl group on 1-meA or 3-meC has been removed. Following restriction endonuclease cleavage, the products are separated using denaturing PAGE. Fig. 4 shows results from the use of this assay for ss-DNA substrates. If there is no modified ODN, all DNA is cleaved by EcoRI. However if a 1-meA is present in the first A in the EcoRI restriction site, the DNA is not cleaved by the restriction enzyme. Partial removal of the 1-meA by the ABH2, ABH3, mAbh2, or mAbh3 restores the restriction site and permits cleavage by EcoRI. To test the universality of this assay, we also built a 1-meA ODN with a HindIII site and placed the 1-meA at the first A of the recognition sequence. In this case, no inhibition of the cleavage is observed (data not shown). Therefore, this is a useful assay, but not every restriction site can be employed. An assay to monitor 3-meC activity based on the same principles was also developed. In this case, 3-meC was inserted into an ODN at the first C position of a HpaII site. The same procedure was followed to demonstrate activity for the 1-meA assay, except that HpaII restriction endonuclease cleavage was used. Fig. 5 unambiguously demonstrates that there is only cleavage of the ODN when 3-meC has been removed from the HpaII site. We also tested KpnI and HhaI restriction sites in a similar assay, but found that KpnI and HhaI cleavage, although inhibited, did not yield clear results as did use of the HpaII site (data not shown). The use of this assay method should greatly simplify the determination of kinetics and the study of AlkB homologues. The structural integrity of mutant AlkB proteins was evaluated by one-dimensional NMR spectra. The one-dimensional NMR spectra of the wild-type and mutant proteins were nearly identical, particularly in the region of the spectra corresponding to signals of methyl and methylene groups, which include those from amino acid residues in the hydrophobic core of the protein, such as Ile, Leu, and Val. The one-dimensional spectra indicate that the hydrophobic core of the protein is intact in the mutants, and therefore, the amino acid substitutions do not disrupt the overall three-dimensional structure of the protein (data not shown). ABH2 and mAbh2 Remove Methyl Groups from Single-stranded RNA and DNA Substrates—The AlkB homologues were tested against a number of substrates for activities removing methylation damage. The substrates were ODNs, polydeoxyribonucleotides, or polyribonucleotides that were modified using [3H]MNU. The rate of release of radioactivity is similar for mAbh2 and ABH2 for ODNs, either single- or double-stranded that are modified with [3H]MNU (Fig. 6, a and c). By contrast, mAbh3 and ABH3 release radioactivity from ss-ODNs much faster than from ds-ODNs (Fig. 6, b and d). The ss-polydeoxyribonucleotides, ss-polyribonucleotides, and M13mp18 were also examined for the release of radioactivity. For mAbh2 and ABH2, there are again similarities. Release of the radioactivity from [3H]CH3-poly(dA) or [3H]CH3-poly(dC) is at least 10-50-fold more rapid than release of radioactivity from [3H]CH3-poly(A) or [3H]CH3-poly(C) (Fig. 6, e and g). We also examined the release of radioactivity from [3H]CH3-M13mp18 and found that less than 10% of the total radioactivity in the assay was released by mAbh2 or ABH2 treatment. However, release of radioactivity from the [3H]CH3-M13mp18 substrate by mAbh2 was significantly lower than for ABH2. Thus, the mAbh2 removes 1-meA or 3-meC from both RNA and DNA, but there is a distinct bias for the removal from DNA. For mAbh3 and ABH3, release of methyl groups from polydeoxyribonucleotide and polyribonucleotide substrates had similar efficiencies, showing that mAbh3 and ABH3 recognize RNA and DNA (Fig. 6, f and h). It is also possible that the mAbh2, mAbh3, ABH2, or ABH3 could harbor activities associated with exo or endonucleases that would release radioactivity in the assays. To show that the activities are not associated with exo or endonucleases, we end-labeled either an ODN or a polyribonucleotide and treated these substrates with the enzymes. Only minor amounts of radioactivity were released by the purified AlkB homologues (see supplementary data) from the 3′-end of the ODN. A control using exonuclease I, a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease, shows that the pattern expected for the degradation for that type of exonuclease. No degradation of the ODN by the AlkB homologues is observed, consistent with the absence of exo or endonuclease activity. The fact that the intensities of the full-length ODNs that are 5′-end-labeled do not change, argues that there is no 5′ → 3′ exonuclease. In another experiment, poly(C) RNA was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Again, no degradation of the ribonucleotide is observed, suggesting that the activity releasing tritium into the medium is not caused by exonuclease degradation of polyribonucleotides (supplementary data). We also modified ODNs with unlabeled DMS and monitored the release of formaldehyde using the Nash assay. This demonstrated that the reaction of the four AlkB homologues all released formaldehyde (data not shown). The ensemble of the experiments on the DNA substrates shows that the mAbh2 and mAbh3 release methyl groups from DNA using a mechanism similar to that of AlkB or the ABH2 or ABH3.

https://openalex.org/W2007508109,"Nod1 is an intracellular pattern recognition molecule activated following bacterial infection, which senses a specific muropeptide (l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-DAP (diaminopimelic acid); “TriDAP”) from peptidoglycan. Here we investigated the molecular basis of TriDAP sensing by human (h) Nod1. Our results identified the domain responsible for TriDAP detection in the center of the concave surface of hNod1 leucine-rich repeat domain. Amino acid residues critical for sensing define a contiguous surface patch that is largely conserved in Nod1 proteins from different species. Accordingly, the distinct specificities of human versus murine Nod1 toward muropeptide detection were also found to lie in this central cleft. Several splicing variants of Nod1 lacking repeats 7-9 have been characterized recently, the relative balance of which is thought to correlate with the onset of asthma or inflammatory bowel disease. We demonstrated that these isoforms failed to transduce NF-κB activation upon muropeptide stimulation. This study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the detection of bacterial peptidoglycan by Nod1 and suggested that defects in Nod1-dependent peptidoglycan sensing may contribute to elicit certain inflammatory disorders.

The innate immune system has evolved means to mediate recognition of microbes through the specific detection of highly conserved structures. Such conserved microbial motifs are generally molecules from the cell wall or nucleic acids, and in the case of bacteria, these include lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acid, flagellin, and CpG DNA. Recently, studies focusing on the innate immune responses to peptidoglycan have gained substantial attention through the identification of new classes of peptidoglycan sensors, both in mammals and Drosophila (1.Girardin S.E.

However, although a clear role for PGRPs in triggering innate immune responses has been demonstrated unequivocally in Drosophila, the function of mammalian PGRPs remains elusive. In addition to PGRPs, recent evidence has now clearly identified the Nod proteins, Nod1 and Nod2, which are two members of the growing family of Nod-like receptors (NLRs; also known as CATERPILLER), as intracellular sensors of peptidoglycan (3.Chamaillard M.

Upon activation, Nod proteins trigger the activation of NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and caspase pathways, which in turn governs some of the host responses to bacterial infection. Nod proteins have been shown to play a key role in host response to a variety of bacterial infections, including Shigella flexneri, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.Opitz B.

In addition, the key role of Nod proteins in the modulation of inflammatory processes is highlighted by the recent identification of the genetic association between mutations in Nod2 and several inflammatory disorders, including Crohn's disease (18.Hugot J.P.

More recently, studies have also identified polymorphisms in Nod1 associated with genetic predisposition to inflammatory bowel disease (22.McGovern D.P. Hysi P. Ahmad T. van Heel D.A. Moffatt M.F. Carey A. Cookson W.O. Jewell D.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1245-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), atopic eczema (23.Weidinger S. Klopp N. Rummler L. Wagenpfeil S. Novak N.

However, in the latter case, a link between the genetic observation and any functional significance remains to be clearly addressed, because the polymorphisms found lie within the ninth intron of the Nod1 gene. It has been proposed by the authors of the two studies that these mutations might affect the relative abundance of specific Nod1 splice variants. It is becoming clear that Nod proteins, via the specific detection of muropeptide motifs, are key molecules involved in innate immunity and inflammation. However, the molecular basis of peptidoglycan detection by Nods remains largely undefined. First, it is still not known whether Nod proteins interact directly with peptidoglycan fragments or whether sensing involves additional protein intermediates. Also, crystal structures of Nod LRR domains are still lacking, which restricts our current knowledge of structure-function for these pattern-recognition molecules (PRMs). In the case of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the most widely studied family of mammalian pattern-recognition molecules, detection of microbial patterns also occurs through the LRR ectodomain. Still, a decade of intensive investigation on TLRs did not lead to substantial understanding of microbial detection by TLRs at a molecular level. However, with the recent characterization of the first structure of the LRR domain from TLR3 (25.Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), one can now expect that some of these questions will be solved in the near future. In this context, we have undertaken an approach based on mutagenesis (either deletions or site-directed point mutations) to gain more insight into the molecular basis of peptidoglycan detection by Nod1. We mapped the region responsible for TriDAP sensing within Nod1 LRR to a contiguous patch of amino acid residues in the center of the inner concave surface of the LRR. Because recent evidence has identified the existence of several Nod1 splicing variants and their correlation with an increased risk for asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (22.McGovern D.P. Hysi P. Ahmad T. van Heel D.A. Moffatt M.F. Carey A. Cookson W.O. Jewell D.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1245-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24.Hysi P. Kabesch M. Moffatt M.F. Schedel M.

Genet. 2005; 14: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we analyzed these variants for their ability to sense peptidoglycan and muropeptides. These isoforms all contained only a part of the TriDAP sensing domain, and consequently, we observed that only the full-length molecule could transduce NF-κB activation upon stimulation. Together, this study illustrates the importance of defining with precision the molecular determinants responsible for detection of peptidoglycan by Nod1 and suggests a link between defective Nod signaling and the onset of inflammatory disorders. Muramyl Peptides—The experimental procedures relative to the synthesis of the muramyl peptides used in this study have been described elsewhere (8.Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D.

Reagents—Endotoxin-free fetal calf serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT) and was used after heat inactivation 56 °C for 30 min. All cell culture reagents and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. Muramyl dipeptide (MDP-LD) was from Calbiochem and reported to be 98% pure by TLC. Synthetic FK156 was obtained from Fujisawa Inc. (Japan). Limulus Amebocyte Assay—All reagents used in this study tested negative for lipopolysaccharide contamination by the Limulus amebocyte assay, according to manufacturer's recommendations (QCL-1000, BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). These reagents include M-TriDAP, TriDAP, MDP, and FK156. Expression Plasmids and Transient Transfections—The expression plasmid for human Nod1 was from Gabriel Nunez (Ann Arbor, MI). The expression plasmid for human Nod2 was from Gilles Thomas (Fondation Jean Dausset/CEPH, Paris, France). The expression plasmid for mouse Nod1 was from InvivoGen (Toulouse, France). The chimeric molecules hNod1-LRR hNod2 and hNod1-LRR hIPAF were obtained by PCR, using standard procedures. The expression plasmid for human IPAF was from Jurg Tschopp and Fabio Martinon (ISREC, Lausanne, Switzerland). The site chosen for the domain swap in hNod1 sequence was amino acid 641 (VESF↓NQV). On the side of hNod2 and hIPAF sequences, the sites chosen for swapping were positions 730 (APGE↓AKSV) and 595 (IPDY↓LFDF), respectively. The empty vector pcDNA3.1 and the NF-κB reporter Igκ-luciferase were from Invitrogen. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) in HEK293 as described previously (10.Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K.

NF-κB Activation Assays—Human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Studies on the synergistic activation of NF-κB by peptidoglycans or muramyl peptides were carried out as described previously (10.Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M.

Briefly, cells were transfected with 75 ng of the reporter plasmid Igκ-luc plus the following vectors: 1 ng of hNod1 or hNod2, 0.5 ng of mNod1. Muramyl peptides were added in the cell culture medium 10 min prior addition of the transfection mix (FuGENE plus DNA). The empty vector was used to balance the transfected DNA concentration. NF-κB-dependent luciferase assays were performed in duplicate, and the data represent at least three independent experiments. Data show mean ± S.E. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The 30 mutations introduced into the LRR domain of hNod1 were obtained individually by PCR, using standard procedures. Briefly, pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (see the list below) were designed to carry the mutation of interest. These oligonucleotides were used as primers for circular PCR, to amplify the whole pcI-hNod1 plasmid. Amplified plasmids were selected using the DpnI restriction enzyme. For each mutant, the HindIII-NotI domain spanning the LRR domain of hNod1 was then subcloned into a pcI-hNod1 vector that had not been subjected to PCR and had been fully sequenced previously. This subcloning step was performed to avoid possible mutations in the rest of the hNod1 cDNA sequence. Following subcloning, the whole HindIII-NotI region was fully sequenced (Millgen, France) to ensure that the mutation of interest was present and that no additional mutation was introduced by the PCR. Generation of Nod1 Isoforms Δ10, Δ10-11, and Δ10-12—The three Nod1 constructs Δ10, Δ10-11, and Δ10-12 were generated by PCR according to standard methods. The oligonucleotides used are listed below. Briefly, couples of primers 1F/2R, 1F/2Rbis, 1F/2Rter, 3F/6R, 4F/6R, and 5F/6R were used to amplify regions of hNod1 by using full-length hNod1 expressing vector as a template, leading to the generation of PCR products A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively. PCR products A-F were excised from gel and purified, and A/D, B/E, and C/F were annealed and used together with primers 1F and 6R for a second round of PCR, therefore amplifying regions corresponding to constructs of interest D10, D10-11, and D10-12, respectively. Finally, PCR products were digested by using HindIII-NotI restriction enzymes, and the fragment obtained was used to exchange the HindII-NotI fragment from a new (non PCR-amplified) expression vector encoding for hNod1. Following subcloning, sequencing was performed (Millgen, France) to ensure that the right constructs were generated.

Oligonucleotides Used for the Generation of Nod1 Constructs Δ10, Δ10-11, and Δ10-12—The following oligonucleotides were used: 1F GCCTGCGGGGCTACCTGAAG; 2R GTGGAGATGCCGTTGGACGCAAGCCCAACCTCAGAGATTGATTTG; 3F GTTGGGCTTGCGTCCAACGGCATCTCCAC; 6R CTAGTTGTGGTTTGTCCAAACTCATC; 4F GTTGGGCTGACCCAAAATGAACTCAACGATG; 2Rbis GTTGAGTTCATTTTGGGTCAGCCCAACCTCAGAGATTGATTTG; 5F GTTGGGCTTATCCAGAATCAGATCACAGCTAAG; and 2Rter CTTAGCTGTGATCTGATTCTGGATAAGCCCAACCTCAGAGATTGATTTG. Early studies on Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 had demonstrated the key role of the LRR domain in achieving bacterial sensing (10.Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K. Labigne A. Zahringer U. Coyle A.J. DiStefano P.S. Bertin J. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 19.Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether the specificity for certain muropeptides (i.e. specific detection of MDP versus M-TriDAP) is carried exclusively by the LRR domain. To this end, we constructed chimeric molecules hNod1-LRRhNod2 and hNod1-LRRhIPAF in which the LRR domain of hNod1 was exchanged with the one for hNod2 and hIPAF, respectively (Fig. 1A). We observed that hNod1-LRRhNod2 could not detect TriDAP but rather MDP (Fig. 1B), thereby showing that the LRR domain is responsible for the specific detection of muropeptides by Nod molecules. As a negative control, swapping the LRR domains of Nod1 and IPAF (a molecule closely related to Nod1 and Nod2) resulted in a molecule (hNod1-LRRhIPAF) unable to detect both TriDAP and MDP (Fig. 1B), although expressions of hNod1-LRRhNod2 and hNod1-LRRhIPAF were comparable (data not shown). It must be noted that hNod1-LR-RhNod2, as does Nod2, detected specifically MDP LD, but not the inactive enantiomer MDP LL (Fig. 1B). This illustrates the fact that LRR domains carry the global specificity for muropeptide detection, even at the stereoisomeric level. In an attempt to narrow down the region responsible for TriDAP sensing in hNod1 LRR, several deletion mutants were generated (Fig. 2, A and B). However, this strategy was inappropriate because none of the mutants could retain any sensing of TriDAP (Fig. 2C), strongly suggesting that the structural integrity of the LRR domain is required to achieve full muropeptide detection. Next, an approach based on single amino acid mutagenesis was chosen. The LRR domain of hNod1 contains 10 repeats and is expected to fold into the right-handed, curved solenoid structure characteristic of these proteins (Fig. 3A). In most LRR domains, the long β-sheet forming the inner concave face is usually involved in protein-protein interactions (27.Schubert W.D. Urbanke C. Ziehm T. Beier V. Machner M.P. Domann E. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. Heinz D.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we selected three positions at the center of the β-strand from each repeat, whose side chains are predicted to be accessible for ligand interactions and generated 30 mutants in hNod1 LRR (Fig. 3B). By the strategy used, all mutations could be aligned to corresponding positions within each repeat (Fig. 3C). In order to minimize the risk of generating mutant molecules that would be unstable or misfolded because of the amino acid exchange, the substitutions chosen were variable depending on the nature of the amino acid to replace (Fig. 3D). All these mutants were expressed and retained their basal capacity to activate the NF-κB pathway when overexpressed (Fig. 4A). It must be noted that most of the differences in NF-κB activation between the 30 mutants correlated with expression levels, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we concluded from these experiments that none of the mutants displayed any drastic artifactual loss of function because of defects of expression or stability. Next, each mutant was compared with the wild-type form of hNod1 for its capacity to detect TriDAP (Fig. 5A). We observed that mutations in the fifth and sixth repeats (mutants 13-18), as well as mutation 23 (W874S) in repeat 8, dramatically affected sensing, reducing TriDAP detection by more than 80%. Mapping the effect of these mutants into the concave surface of hNod1 LRR revealed that the amino acid residues critically affecting TriDAP sensing define a contiguous patch toward the C-terminal end of the middle β-strands (Fig. 5B, left), which closely matches the pattern of strictly conserved residues in available Nod1 sequences from different species (Fig. 5B, right).FIGURE 3Choice of the amino acids for site-directed mutagenesis in the LRR domain of hNod1.

A, human HEK293 epithelial cells were transfected with 25 ng of expression vectors encoding for hNod1 mutations 1-30, according to numbering from the N terminus to the C terminus of the LRR domain. The activity of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene induced by the simple overexpression of each mutant in HEK293 cells was measured. For each mutant, the results obtained are from three independent experiments done in duplicate; the six values of NF-κB activation obtained were then pooled and reported to the level of activation by wild-type (WT) hNod1. B, cellular extracts from HEK293 cells analyzed in A were collected (six independent points per mutant were pooled) and analyzed for expression of the mutant forms of hNod1 by Western blot, using a polyclonal antibody against hNod1. The relative expression level of each mutant can be compared with the one of wild-type Nod1 presented on the 1st lane of the Western blot. Note that the differences in autoactivation by overexpression of the mutants (seen in A) strongly correlate with the relative expression of each mutant (seen in B). This suggests that the mutations are likely to affect the expression/stability of hNod1 rather than the intrinsic ability of the molecule to activate the NF-κB pathway.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Identification of the region responsible for specific muramyl peptide detection within hNod1 LRR domain.

Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a key enzyme in the generation of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. Here, we found that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is essential for LPS-induced cPLA2 activation and lipid release. Inhibition of TLR4 protein expression by TLR4 small interfering RNA or neutralization of TLR4 by the specific antibody against TLR4/MD2 blocked cPLA2 phosphorylation and cPLA2-hydrolyzed arachidonic acid release. Furthermore, activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway by LPS regulated cPLA2 activation and lipid release. cPLA2 phosphorylation and cPLA2-hydrolyzed lipid release were significantly impaired when TLR4 adaptor protein, either MyD88 or TRIF, was knocked down in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Similarly, LPS-induced arachidonate release was inhibited in cells transfected with a dominant-negative MyD88 or TRIF construct. Subsequently, cPLA2 activation could be suppressed by inhibition of the TLR4 adaptor protein-directed p38 and ERK MAPK pathways. These findings suggest that, in LPS-induced inflammation, the TLR4-mediated MyD88- and TRIF-dependent MAPK pathways result in cPLA2 activation and production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators.

Stimulation of macrophages with LPS results in the production of various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 and pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) (5Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). These potent protein- and lipid-based mediators participate in the innate immune response and may also lead to a harmful or damaging host response to bacterial infection. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome, including severe septic shock and multiple organ system failure (2Cohen J.

In mammals, the TLR family comprises at least 11 members (TLR1-TLR11) expressed on the surface of macrophages and other innate immune cells (11Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Sci.

TLRs act as primary innate immune sensors, each of which specifically recognizes distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns (10Takeda K. Kaisho1 T. Akira S. Annu. Rev.

Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TLRs by TLR ligands triggers the recruitment of the cytoplasmic adaptor protein MyD88 and accordingly culminates in the activation of two distinct downstream signaling pathways, the transcription factor NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines (15Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). TLR4 is the signaling receptor of LPS (16Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D.

After recognizing LPS in the presence of LPS-binding protein, CD14, and MD2 protein, TLR4 activates the common MyD88-dependent signaling pathway as well as a MyD88-independent pathway that is unique to TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways, leading to interferon-β production (15Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 19Yeh W.C. Chen N.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 736-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Hoebe K. Du X.

In the MyD88-independent pathway, TLR4 interacts with the adaptor protein TRIF, instead of MyD88, to activate NF-κB and MAPK as well as interferon-β induction (20Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H.

Thus, the LPS signaling pathways show a bipartite nature. Both TRIF and MyD88 are independently capable of initiating signaling events that lead to pro-inflammatory cytokine production (19Yeh W.C. Chen N.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 736-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S.

However, the mechanism by which LPS induces the production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators in macrophages remains to be further determined. PAF and eicosanoids, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes, are the major constituents of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, which play a critical role in inflammation and host defense (22Henderson W.R.

When LPS and other inflammatory stimuli activate macrophages, the lipid mediators are synthesized de novo from membrane phospholipid through a cascade of enzymes (22Henderson W.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121: 684-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The initial step of eicosanoid bio-synthesis, which is thought to be the rate-limiting step, is arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids by activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). The liberated arachidonic acid is the common precursor molecule of all eicosanoids and is in turn converted to prostaglandins and thromboxanes by the cyclooxygenase pathway and to leukotrienes by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (22Henderson W.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121: 684-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 23Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the release of arachidonate, lysophospholipid is formed and can be enzymatically converted to PAF (30Venable M.E. Olson S.C. Nieto M.L. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7965-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As an important rate-limiting enzyme in the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid release, cPLA2 plays a key role in initiating and regulating the multistage biosynthetic process of eicosanoid production (22Henderson W.R.

Furthermore, the bone marrow-derived mast cells from these mice fail to produce eicosanoids in either immediate or delayed phase responses (42Fujishima H. Sanchez Mejia R.O. Bingham III, C.O.

Because cPLA2 is essential for production of lipid mediators, to address the mechanism by which cPLA2 is activated and leads to lipid production in macrophage responses to LPS will be a key to understanding the production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators in LPS-induced inflammation. Here, we report that cPLA2 activation and lipid release are regulated by TLR4 signaling in LPS-activated macrophages. The regulation is through TLR4-mediated MyD88- and TRIF-dependent MAPK signaling pathways.

[3H]Arachidonic acid release and Western blot analysis were performed after 36 h of transfection. RNA Interference—For the plasmid constructs of mouse TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the inserts were prepared by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: TLR4 siRNA, gatccGTTCCATTGCTTGGCGAATTTCAAGAGAATTCGCCAAGCAATGGAACTTTTTTg (sense) and aattcAAAAAAGTTCCATTGCTTGGCGAATTCTCTTGAAATTCGCCAAGCAATGGAACg (antisense); MyD88 siRNA, gatccGGTGTCGCCGCATGGTGGTTTCAAGAGAACCACCATGCGGCGACACCTTTTTTg (sense) and aattcAAAAAAGGTGTCGCCGCATGGTGGTTCTCTTGAAACCACCATGCGGCGACACCg (antisense); and TRIF siRNA, gatccGCTATGTAACACACCGCTGTTCAAGAGACAGCGGTGTGTTACATAGCTTTTTTg (sense) and aattcAAAAAAGCTATGTAACACACCGCTGTCTCTTGAACAGCGGTGTGTTACATAGCg (antisense).

The correct structures of the positive clones were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The siRNA constructs were then transfected into RAW264.7 cells by Nucleofection electroporating transfection. Puromycin (4 μg/ml)-resistant cell clones were isolated. The stable cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 4 μg/ml puromycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The interference of TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against mouse TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF. Western Blot Analysis—RAW264.7 cells and TLR4, MyD88 or TRIF knockdown RAW264.7 cells were grown on 6-well plates with stimuli or other treatment as indicated. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (0.3 ml/well; 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The cell lysates were centrifuged, and equivalent amounts of lysate protein were loaded onto 8-16% Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. After washing, the blots were developed with the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the signals were captured on x-ray films or an Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co.). [3H]Arachidonic Acid Release—RAW264.7 cells; TLR4, MyD88, or TRIF knockdown RAW264.7 cells; or cells transfected with the plasmid with or without wild-type or dominant-negative mutant TRIF and MyD88 were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 μCi of [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (150-230 Ci/mmol/ml; Amersham Biosciences). The medium was removed, and the cells were washed thoroughly and incubated in fresh medium with or without the various treatments as indicated. At the time points indicated, the media were collected and centrifuged, and the radioactivity was determined in the supernatants. The data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of -fold stimulation compared with the control in triplicate experiments. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay for NF-κB Activation—RAW264.7 cells or TLR4 knockdown RAW264.7 cells were cultured until they reached 70-85% confluence. The NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct (a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Ulrich Siebenlist, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) was cotransfected with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) into the cells by Nucleofection electroporating transfection. The cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well. The following day, the cells were treated as indicated. After 6 h of stimulation, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega), and reporter gene activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay reporter system (Promega Corp.) and a Victor2 plate reader luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

LPS Induces cPLA2 Activation in Mouse RAW264.7 Macrophages—To examine whether TLR4 is required for cPLA2 activation, we used LPS preparations to stimulate the mouse macrophages for various times. We then tested cPLA2 activation first by measuring phosphorylation of cPLA2 by Western blot analysis with the antibody against phospho-cPLA2 or total cPLA2. Fig. 1A shows that phosphorylation of cPLA2 became evident at 30 min after LPS stimulation, peaked at 2 h, and slowly declined thereafter. However, total cPLA2 did not show any change in expression at the different time points. As a positive control, LPS-induced IκBα degradation, which results in the release and activation of NF-κB, was observed at 30 min and returned to the base-line level by 2-3 h (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the LPS preparation used to induce the activity of cPLA2 in our experiments activates the TLR4 signaling pathway. We next determined the activation of cPLA2 by measuring the release of its catalytic product arachidonic acid from [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled RAW264.7 cells. After stimulation with different types of LPS and lipid A (which is the core component of LPS), the arachidonic acid release was significantly increased in an LPS dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Although cPLA2 is a major enzyme of arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids, secretory PLA2, another member of the PLA2 superfamily with a low molecular mass, may also mediate arachidonic acid release (48Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). To determine whether LPS-induced arachidonic acid release is specifically catalyzed by cPLA2, the specific chemical inhibitors of cPLA2 and secretory PLA2 were used to treat RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, the cPLA2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate markedly blocked arachidonic acid release by LPS. In contrast, the secretory PLA2 inhibitor thioetheramide-PC did not inhibit the LPS response, suggesting that arachidonic acid release in response to LPS is due mainly to activation of cPLA2. TLR4 Mediates LPS-induced cPLA2 Activation and Lipid Release— Two lines of evidence suggest that TLR4 is the receptor that mediates the LPS signal to cPLA2 activation and lipid release. First, RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with the monoclonal antibody to mouse TLR4/MD2 (MTS510), which specifically inhibits cytokine production induced by lipid A (which is the core component of LPS) (49Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We confirmed that antibody MTS510 inhibited lipid A-induced TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation using a luciferase reporter assay as well (data not shown). Likewise, Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that antibody MTS510 significantly blocked cPLA2-hydrolyzed arachidonic acid release after lipid A or LPS stimulation. By contrast, the control monoclonal antibody against TLR3 did not inhibit either lipid A- or LPS-induced arachidonic acid release in macrophages. Second, RAW264.7 cells were stably transfected with a vector expressing TLR4 siRNA or nonspecific siRNA. Western blot analysis indicated the silencing of TLR4 expression in RAW264.7 cells by TLR4 siRNA (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the knockdown of TLR4 signaling in macrophages, we measured LPS-induced NF-κB promoter activity using the luciferase reporter plasmid in TLR4 siRNA-treated RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2D,NF-κB promoter activity was suppressed after LPS stimulation, suggesting the inhibition of TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation by TLR4 siRNA. We next examined LPS-induced arachidonic acid release and cPLA2 phosphorylation in TLR4 knockdown RAW264.7 cells. The results in Fig. 2E show that the arachidonic acid release induced by LPS was suppressed in TLR4 siRNA-treated cells compared with control siRNA-treated cells. In addition, Western blotting showed reduced cPLA2 phosphorylation in TLR4 knockdown RAW264.7 cells after LPS stimulation (see Fig. 4).FIGURE 4TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF siRNAs decrease the phosphorylation of cPLA2, p38, and ERK. RAW264.7 cells were stably transfected with the control siRNA, TLR4 siRNA, TRIF siRNA or MyD88 siRNA construct. cPLA2, p38, and ERK phosphorylation was examined by Western blotting with antibodies against phosphorylated (p) and total cPLA2, p38, and ERK, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both the TRIF and MyD88 Adaptor Proteins of the TLR4 Signaling Pathway Are Involved in LPS-induced cPLA2 Activation and Lipid Release—Both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways in TLR4 signaling are capable of activating downstream NF-κB and MAPK pathways (20Hoebe K.

We generated MyD88 and TRIF knockdown RAW264.7 cells by transfection of MyD88 and TRIF siRNA constructs into the macrophages, respectively. Western blot analysis using antibodies against MyD88 and TRIF showed that MyD88 protein expression was knocked down by MyD88 siRNA, but not by TRIF siRNA. Likewise, TRIF siRNA inhibited TRIF protein expression, but did not affect MyD88 protein expression (Fig. 3A). Subsequently, cPLA2-hydrolyzed arachidonic acid release and cPLA2 phosphorylation were assessed in the MyD88 and TRIF knockdown macrophages after LPS stimulation. Arachido"
https://openalex.org/W2091145752,"Although previous studies suggested that the tumorigenicity of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) was due to its negative regulation of p53, the p53-independent interactions may be equally as important. During recent studies utilizing MDM2 inhibitors, we noted that E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) was down regulated upon inhibition of MDM2, regardless of the p53 status of the cancer. The present study investigated the mechanisms responsible for the MDM2-mediated increase in E2F1 expression. MDM2 prolongs the half-life of the E2F1 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination. MDM2 displaces SCF(SKP2), the E2F1 E3 ligase. Direct binding between MDM2 and E2F1 is necessary for the negative effects of MDM2 on E2F1 ubiquitination, and deletion of the MDM2 nuclear localization signal does not result in loss of the ability to increase the E2F1 protein level. The downregulation of E2F1 upon MDM2 inhibition was not due to either pRB or p14(Arf). In addition, E2F1 was responsible for at least part of the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by MDM2 knockdown. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that stabilization of the E2F1 protein is likely another p53-independent component of MDM2-mediated tumorigenesis. More knowledge about the MDM2-E2F1 interaction may be helpful in developing novel anticancer therapies."

We characterized the catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity of these isoforms by using recombinant proteins.

We examined the effects of cGMP on cAMP hydrolysis in these fractions.

These findings indicate that the contribution of PDE3 isoforms to the regulation of cAMP hydrolysis in intracellular compartments of human myocardium and the effects of PDE3 inhibition on cAMP hydrolysis in these compartments are highly dependent on intracellular [Ca2+] and [cAMP], which are lower in failing hearts than in normal hearts. cGMP may amplify cAMP-mediated signaling in intracellular compartments of human myocardium by PDE3-dependent and PDE3-independent mechanisms.

PDE3 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases are important in the regulation of intracellular cAMP content in cardiac myocytes (1Shakur Y. Holst L.S. Landstrom T.R. Movsesian M. Degerman E. Manganiello V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 241-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three isoforms of PDE3 have been identified in human myocardium (2Choi Y.H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Wechsler J. Choi Y.H. Krall J. Ahmad F. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38072-38078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). They appear to be generated from the PDE3A gene by a combination of alternative transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing, and their amino acid sequences are identical except for the presence of different lengths of N-terminal sequences containing membrane association domains and sites for activation by phosphorylation (Fig. 1). PDE3A-136, present exclusively in microsomal fractions of human myocardium, contains two membrane association domains, “NHR1” and “NHR2,” and three sites for phosphorylation and activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase B. PDE3A-118, present in microsomal and cytosolic fractions of human myocardium, lacks NHR1 and the most upstream phosphorylation site, whereas PDE3A-94, also present in microsomal and cytosolic fractions of human myocardium, lacks NHR1, NHR2, and all three phosphorylation sites. The existence of these isoforms is likely to be important with respect to the intracellular compartmentation of cAMP metabolism. In cardiac myocytes, cAMP content is regulated differentially in intracellular compartments represented in microsomal and cytosolic fractions. Changes in cAMP content in these compartments correlate with changes in the phosphorylation of different substrates of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and with different physiologic responses (4Hayes J.S.

In cardiac myocytes from rat hearts, different cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases have been shown to regulate cAMP-mediated signaling in spatially and functionally distinct intracellular compartments (11Zaccolo M.

The fact that there are differences among PDE3 isoforms in human myocardium with respect to intracellular localization domains suggests that these isoforms may be involved in this compartmentation in this tissue. Furthermore, the N-terminal sequence differences among these isoforms might be expected to affect their catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity, as occurs with isoforms in the PDE4 family (13Bolger G.B.

Any such differences are likely to be pertinent to the inotropic actions of PDE3 inhibitors, because these drugs affect cAMP hydrolysis in microsomal and cytosolic fractions of cardiac myocytes with different potencies (15Shakur Y.

Card Fail. 2003; 9: 475-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These considerations may also have some influence on cGMP-mediated signaling in cardiac muscle. The cAMP hydrolytic activity of PDE3 is inhibited competitively by cGMP, and inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis by cGMP has been shown to contribute to several actions of cGMP, including the stimulation of renin secretion, the potentiation of vasodilatory responses to adrenomedullin, the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the potentiation of delayed rectifier K+ currents in sino-atrial cells (17Kurtz A.

Differences in the sensitivities of PDE3 isoforms in different intracellular compartments to inhibition by cGMP might therefore be important in cGMP-mediated signaling in cardiac myocytes. Our goal was to gain insight into the possible role of PDE3 isoforms in the compartmental regulation of cAMP metabolism in human myocardium. We characterized the catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity of these isoforms, and we examined their contribution to total and to cGMP-regulated cAMP hydrolytic activity in cytosolic and microsomal fractions of human myocardium.

Virus pools were prepared by infecting 4.5 × 108 Sf9 cells suspended in 450 ml of Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen). Unless otherwise stated, all steps were carried out at 27 °C. When cell death reached 50%, cell suspensions were sedimented at 3,000 rpm (JA-20; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and the supernatant was collected. 20 ml of this supernatant were added to 2.0 × 108 Sf9 cells suspended in 200 ml of SFM medium. When cell death in this population reached 20%, cell suspensions were sedimented at 1,200 rpm (JA-20; Beckman Instruments) for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended, and incubated for 15 min in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm TES, 3The abbreviations used are:TESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidrtrecombinant 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Lysates were prepared by hand homogenization (glass-Teflon, 10-20 strokes). After an additional 15 min on ice, suspensions were sedimented at 14,000 rpm (JA-20; Beckman Instruments) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were used for the experiments described below. N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid recombinant Preparation of Subcellular Fractions of Human Myocardium—Human left ventricular myocardium was obtained from the explanted hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing cardiac transplant. Cytosolic and KCl-washed microsomal fractions were prepared by homogenization and differential sedimentation as described previously (3Wechsler J. Choi Y.H. Krall J. Ahmad F. Manganiello V.C.

Immunoprecipitation of PDE3 from Subcellular Fractions—Undiluted rabbit polyclonal antibody (3 μl) raised against the C terminus of human PDE3A (2Choi Y.H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) was incubated with 30 μl of packed G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4°C. Beads with bound antibody were sedimented at 4,000 rpm for 3 min in a Hermle Z180m centrifuge (Labnet, Edison, NJ) and washed with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.4, 4 °C). This process was repeated three times. Cytosolic fractions containing 50 pmol/min of cAMP hydrolytic activity (measured at 0.1 μm cAMP as described below) were added to the antibody/G-Sepharose beads and co-incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were removed by sedimentation at 14,000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C. Western Blotting—Lysates of Sf9 cells were dissolved in SDS buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes (2Choi Y.H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). PDE3 was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of rtPDE3 Isoforms—C-terminal FLAG-tagged rtPDE3 protein was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Varying amounts of Sf9 cell lysates were incubated overnight in wells of Nunc Immuno-polystyrene plates with Maxisorb surfaces (VWR Scientific, Denver, CO) at 4 °C. After blocking with 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2. ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) reagent (Sigma) was added at 0.22 mg/ml, and color development (millioptical density/min) was monitored over a 20-min time course. C-terminal FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was used as a standard. For all determinations, calculations of the amount of FLAG-tagged protein were based on readings in the range through which the rate of color development varied linearly with the amount of protein per well. Quantitation of Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase Activity and Its Inhibition—Cyclic nucleotide hydrolytic activity in Sf9 cell lysates was quantified at 30 °C by using the two-step snake venom method with [3H]cAMP and [3H]cGMP as substrates (2Choi Y.H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). EGTA, CaCl2, and calmodulin (provided by Donald Blumenthal, University of Utah) were included as indicated in the text. Km values for cAMP and cGMP hydrolytic activity and Ki values for inhibition of cAMP hydrolytic activity by the competitive inhibitor cilostazol were calculated by nonlinear regression using the equation v/Vmax = [S]/(Km(1 + ([inhibitor]/Ki)) + [S]). Values for kcat were calculated using the equation kcat = Vmax[PDE3]. PDE3 activity in subcellular fractions of human myocardium was quantified by measuring cAMP hydrolysis as described above in the absence and presence of cilostazol. To minimize possible inhibition of other subfamilies of PDE3 at maximally inhibitory concentrations of cilostazol, these measurements were made at concentrations of cilostazol that inhibited cAMP hydrolytic activity by rtPDE3A submaximally; PDE3 activity was calculated by dividing the amount of activity inhibited by cilostazol in subcellular fractions by the fractional inhibition of rtPDE3 activity at the same cilostazol concentration. Catalytic Activity and Inhibitor Sensitivity of PDE3 Isoforms—Our first objective was to determine whether there were differences among the three PDE3A isoforms in human myocardium with respect to catalytic activity. To do this, we characterized the catalytic activity of FLAG-tagged recombinant forms of PDE3A-136, PDE3A-118, and PDE3A-94. The apparent molecular weights of the expressed proteins were consistent with published values (3Wechsler J. Choi Y.H. Krall J. Ahmad F. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38072-38078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and there was no evidence of proteolysis of any of the isoforms (Fig. 2). There were no significant differences among the three PDE3 isoforms with respect to Km for cAMP (TABLE ONE). Our quantitation of rtPDE3 isoforms by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed a comparison of kcat values for these different isoforms, and we found no significant differences among them in this regard. The variance among preparations with respect to values for kcat was large, however, and the possibility of small differences among the isoforms with respect to kcat cannot be excluded.TABLE ONECatalytic activity of rtPDE3 isoforms Each value represents the mean ± S.D. for three to five different preparations of FLAG-tagged rtPDE3A.IsoformKm, cAMPkcat, cAMPnmmin–1PDE3A-13688 ± 1129 ± 11PDE3A-11893 ± 1630 ± 18PDE3A-9479 ± 2131 ± 7 Open table in a new tab We proceeded to examine the sensitivities of the cAMP hydrolytic activity of these isoforms to the competitive inhibitors cGMP and cilostazol. Because cGMP and cAMP are competitive substrates for PDE3, the sensitivity of its cAMP hydrolytic activity to inhibition by cGMP is reflected in the Km value for cGMP. There were no significant differences among the three PDE3A isoforms in this regard (TABLE TWO). In the case of cilostazol, which is not a substrate, we measured the Ki values for the inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis. As with cGMP, all three PDE3A isoforms were comparable in their sensitivity to inhibition by cilostazol (TABLE TWO). Similar results were obtained for inhibition by the competitive inhibitor milrinone (data not shown).TABLE TWOSensitivities of rtPDE3 isoforms to inhibition by cGMP and cilostazolKm, cGMPKi, cilostazolnmnmrtPDE3A-13630 ± 550 ± 10rtPDE3A-11820 ± 239 ± 11rtPDE3A-9428 ± 356 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Contribution of PDE3 Isoforms to cAMP Hydrolytic Activity in Human Myocardium—Our second objective was to examine the contribution of PDE3 isoforms to cAMP hydrolytic activity in subcellular fractions of human myocardium. This was done under several conditions. First, we considered that changes in intracellular [Ca2+] in diastole and systole might affect the contribution of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterases in human myocardium, and we therefore measured cAMP hydrolytic activity in the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. at 2.0 mm EGTA) or in the presence of 200 μm CaCl2 and 50 nm calmodulin. We also measured cAMP hydrolytic activity in the presence of 0.1 and 1.0 μm cAMP, two concentrations that are likely to be physiologically relevant based on the published Km values for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (27Taskén K. Solberg R. Foss K. Skålhegg B. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Hardie D.G. Hanks S.K. Facts Book on Protein Kinases. Academic Press, London1995: 58-63Google Scholar), in order to examine the possible effects of increases in [cAMP] that might result from increased β-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Such increases would be expected to increase the contribution of other cAMP phosphodiesterases whose affinity for cAMP is lower than that of PDE3. We first quantified the effect of [cAMP] and Ca2+/calmodulin on the activity of PDE3 itself. As expected (Fig. 3), the activity of rtPDE3A-136 increased when [cAMP] was raised from 0.1 to 1.0 μm. Ca2+/calmodulin affected neither the activity of rtPDE3A nor its sensitivity to inhibition by cilostazol or cGMP. We proceeded to measure cAMP hydrolytic activities in subcellular fractions of human myocardium. At 0.1 μm cAMP, PDE3 comprised the majority of cAMP hydrolytic activity in microsomal fractions in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 4). At 1.0 μm cAMP, PDE3 activity increased, but its relative contribution to total cAMP activity was reduced to a small degree by a slightly greater increase in the activity of other (cilostazol-insensitive) cAMP phosphodiesterases. Results in cytosolic fractions were quite different. At 0.1 μm cAMP, PDE3 comprised the majority of cAMP hydrolytic activity in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 4). In the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, however, the relative contribution of PDE3 to cAMP hydrolytic activity was markedly reduced by a large increase in the activity of cilostazol-insensitive, Ca2+/calmodulin-activated cAMP phosphodiesterases (presumably PDE1). As in microsomal fractions, raising the cAMP concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 μm increased the activity of PDE3 in cytosolic fractions, but its relative contribution to total cAMP hydrolytic activity declined because of a larger increase in the activity of cilostazol-insensitive cAMP phosphodiesterases. The decrease in the relative contribution of PDE3 to total cAMP hydrolysis was decreased even further by the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin and the consequent increase in the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated cAMP phosphodiesterases. At 1.0 μm cAMP, in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, PDE3 consisted of <20% of the total cAMP hydrolytic activity in cytosolic fractions. Effects of cGMP on cAMP Hydrolytic Activity—Our third objective was to examine the effect of cGMP on cAMP hydrolysis in subcellular fractions. Because cGMP is a competitive inhibitor of PDE3 activity, and because cGMP analogues and agents that raise cGMP content can raise intracellular cAMP content in cardiac myocytes (21Patel K.N. Yan L. Gandhi A. Scholz P.M. Weiss H.R. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Wen J.F. Cui X. Jin J.Y. Kim S.M. Kim S.Z. Kim S.H. Lee H.S. Cho K.W. Circ.

Pharmacol. 2003; 481: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), our expectation was that cGMP would inhibit cAMP hydrolysis under different conditions to an extent that would reflect the contribution of PDE3 to total cAMP hydrolytic activity. We first examined the effects of 1.0 μm cGMP on rtPDE3A activity at different concentrations of cAMP in the absence or presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. The sensitivity of PDE3A cAMP hydrolytic activity to inhibition by cGMP was not affected by Ca2+/calmodulin at cAMP concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 μm (Fig. 5). We proceeded to quantify the effect of 1.0 μm cGMP on the cAMP hydrolytic activity in subcellular fractions. In microsomal fractions, at both 0.1 and 1.0 μm cAMP, 1.0 μm cGMP inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase activity (Fig. 6). This inhibition was unaffected by the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, and the magnitude of inhibition at 0.1 μm cAMP was comparable with the relative contribution of PDE3 to total activity (Fig. 4). These findings are consistent with the notion that cGMP inhibits cAMP hydrolysis in microsomal fractions by inhibition of PDE3. The somewhat lower magnitude of inhibition seen at 1.0 μm cAMP is consistent with the lower inhibitor:substrate ratio at this concentration. In contrast, in cytosolic fractions the inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis by cGMP was greater than could be explained on the basis of the contribution of PDE3 to cAMP hydrolytic activity, particularly in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Figs. 4 and 6). This suggested that cGMP was also inhibiting non-PDE3 cAMP hydrolytic activities in these fractions. To test this, we examined the inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis by cGMP in cytosolic fractions from which PDE3 had been removed by immunoprecipitation with anti-PDE3 antibodies. cGMP had a significant inhibitory effect on non-PDE3 (cilostazol-insensitive) cAMP hydrolytic activity in these fractions (Fig. 7). The fact that a magnitude of this effect was greatly increased in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin suggests it reflected inhibition of isoforms in the PDE1 family, which also hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP in a mutually competitive manner (31Sharma R.K. Hickie R.A. Schudt C. Dent G. Rabe K.F. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 65-80Crossref Google Scholar). In previous studies, we identified three isoforms of PDE3 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase localized to different intracellular compartments of cardiac myocytes. Our intent in this study was to gain further insight into the possible roles of these isoforms in the compartment-selective regulation of cAMP-mediated signaling in human myocardium. Our first consideration was whether these isoforms would differ with regard to their catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity. In the PDE4 family, as in the PDE3 family, alternative transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing yields isoforms with conserved C-terminal catalytic domains but different N-terminal domains. Differences in the N-terminal domains of PDE4 isoforms result in major differences in their catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity, suggesting that these N-terminal domains have an important role in regulating enzyme activity (13Bolger G.B.

We therefore expected to find significant differences in catalytic activity and inhibitor sensitivity among the three PDE3 isoforms attributable to differences in their N-terminal sequences. Instead, we found that the three PDE3 isoforms are comparable with respect to both Km and kcat values for cAMP, as well as with respect to their sensitivity to competitive inhibitors of cAMP hydrolysis. (To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of kcat values among PDE3A isoforms.) These observations suggest that the role of the N terminus in PDE3 isoforms is likely to have more to do with intracellular localization than with the allosteric effects on the C-terminal catalytic region. Interactions between the N terminus of PDE4 and other proteins appear to be involved in the intracellular localization of these isoforms (37Huston E. Beard M. McCallum F. Pyne N.J. Vandenabeele P.

The division machinery of bacteria is an attractive target because it comprises seven or more essential proteins that are conserved almost throughout the bacteria but are absent from humans. We describe the development of a cell-based assay for inhibitors of cell division and its use to isolate a new inhibitor of FtsZ protein, a key player in the division machinery. Biochemical, cytological, and genetic data are presented that demonstrate that FtsZ is the specific target for the compound. We also describe the effects of more potent analogues of the original hit compound that act on important pathogens, again at the level of cell division. The assay and the compounds have the potential to provide novel antibiotics with no pool of pre-existing resistance. They have provided new insight into cytokinesis in bacteria and offer important reagents for further studies of the cell division machinery."

The cellular signal transduction pathways induced by CXCL12 have been well characterized in leukocytes. Interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4 leads to the release of the G protein subunits Giα and Gβγ from intracellular domains of CXCR4. These subunits then bind and activate downstream enzyme systems including phospholipase C, which leads to a transient increase in the level of intracellular Ca2+, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which results in activation of AKT and subsequently, cell migration (15Ganju R.K.

In contrast, the role of CXCR4, including characterization of signal transduction mechanisms in cell types other than leukocytes is less well established despite the fact that CXCR4 is expressed in most tissues and organs. Cross-talk between GPCRs and growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (RTKs) induced signaling pathways has become increasingly well documented in different cellular systems. For example, EGFR is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to CCL11, a ligand for the GPCR CCR3, leading to MAP kinase activation and IL-8 production in bronchial epithelial cells (18Adachi T. Cui C.H. Kanda A. Kayaba H. Ohta K. Chihara J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, both PDGFR and EGFR are phosphorylated by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator that is a ligand for the S1PR family of GPCRs, leading to activation of effectors downstream of PDGFR and EGFR including Shc, and the p85 regulatory subunit of the class IA PI3K (19Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1050-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, examples of transactivation of GPCRs by RTKs are less abundant, although recently it has been shown that IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of CCR5 in MCF-7 cells. Chemotaxis induced by IGF-1 was inhibited by a neutralizing anti-CCL5 antibody, which indicates that transactivation of CCR5 by IGF-1 is indirect, requiring production of a CCR5 ligand (20Mira E.

Because investigating interactions between different receptor classes is essential for our understanding of the mechanisms by which cells process multiple signaling inputs, we have examined potential cross-talk in the signal transduction pathways induced following ligation of CXCR4 and IGF-1R. Our data demonstrate the existence of a physical association between IGF-1R, CXCR4, and the G protein subunits, Giα and Gβ in the breast cancer epithelial cell lines, MDA-MB-231. This interaction drives a unidirectional transactivation of CXCR4 and G proteins by IGF-1 leading to cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is independent of the CXCR4 chemokine ligand, CXCL12. These data indicate the existence of a novel form of transactivation between these two important receptors. Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions—Breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

Pertussis toxin (PTX) was purchased from Sapphire Bioscience, NSW, Australia. Retroviral-mediated RNAi Knockdown of CXCR4—The shRNA retroviral expression vector was constructed by subcloning the human H1 gene promoter into the self-inactivating pMSCV plasmid.

The 21-nucleotide CXCR4 target sites at position 470–490 of human CXCR4 cDNA are indicated in capitals in the oligonucleotide sequences. Previously described oligonucleotides containing specific target sequences for Renilla luciferase were used to produce the expression vector for the negative control (22Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). To produce retroviral supernatants, 293T packaging cells were transfected with 10 μg of specific or control expression vectors, 8 μg of pVPack-VSV-G, 8 μg of pVPack-GP (Stratagene), and 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) without fetal calf serum and without antibiotics, essentially as recommended by the supplier. The medium was replaced 16 h later, and virus-containing supernatants were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm Minisart syringe filter (Sartorius AG, Gottingen, Germany), and polybrene (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in a 60-mm tissue culture dish at ∼40% confluency, and 24 h later the cell medium was removed before 5 ml of specific or control viral supernatants were added. The supernatant was replaced by cell growth medium after 6 h of infection. The infected cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C before being plated at 1:20 dilution for the selection of individual clones in puromycin (5 ng/ml) -containing media. After 1 week, individual clones were picked and expanded for further analysis. Immunofluorescent Staining and Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells were trypsinized and suspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA and 0.04% sodium azide). After the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK) in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, Fc receptors were blocked with purified human IgG (Sigma) (10 μg per 106 of cells) at room temperature for 30 min. The blocked cell suspension (50 μl) was aliquoted to each round bottom tube and incubated each with tested or isotype control Abs at 4 °C for 30 min. For IGF-1R detection, the cells were labeled with hybridoma supernatants and washed with staining buffer, followed by staining with PE-conjugated anti-mouse detection Abs. For CXCR4 detection, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CXCR4. The labeled cells were washed with staining buffer followed by phosphate-buffered saline and then detected on a FACscan (BD Australia). Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis was measured in a Modified Boyden chamber using polycarbonate filters (8 μm for MDA-MB-231 cells and 12 μm for MCF-7 cells, Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD) coated with 25 μg/ml collagen type I (Sigma) in 10 mm acetic acid. Cell suspensions in serum-free medium (RPMI 1640) containing 0.5% BSA were preincubated with calcein-AM (1 μg/ml of final concentration, Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) for 30 min before being loaded in the upper chamber (5 × 104 viable cells/well) whereas the lower chamber contained various concentrations of CXCL12 and/or IGF-1. After the chamber was incubated at 37 °C (4 h for MDA-MB-231 cells and 6 h for MCF-7 cells), membranes were taken out, and cells on the upper surface were removed. The transmigrated cells on the lower surface were measured by their fluorescent intensity using Molecular Imager® Fx (Bio-Rad) and expressed as a migration index, representing the fluorescent signals of stimulated cells compared with those of non-stimulated cells. Kinase Receptor Activation Assay (KIRA)—The KIRA assay was performed with modifications to a previously described protocol (23Sadick M.D. Intintoli A. Quarmby V. McCoy A. Canova-Davis E. Ling V. J.

After 10 min of stimulation, cell lysates were prepared by addition of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor solution (Sigma) and then transferred to 96-well white polystyrene plates (Greiner Bioone, Germany) which were precoated with anti-IGF-1R antibodies (mAb 24-31) diluted in 50 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6 (0.25 μg/well), and blocked with 0.5% BSA in TBST. After overnight incubation, the plates were washed with TBST, and the activated receptor complex formed was detected by incubating with europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 (10 ng/well) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with distilled water, the plates were added with DELFIA enhancement solution (100 μl/well). Time-resolved fluorescence was then measured using 340-nm excitation and 610-nm emission filters on a BMG Lab Technologies Polarstar™ Fluorometer. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blot Analyses—Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min in Triton-lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich). The lysates were centrifuged at 1,4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble materials, and the supernatants were collected. Total protein was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, the lysates (1 mg of total proteins) were incubated with 1 μg of either anti-IGF-1R 2C8, anti-human CXCR4 12G5, or IgG control antibodies, monoclonal anti-HA, at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-coated microbeads at 4 °C for 1 h and purified on magnetic microcolumns (Miltenyi Biotec). The bound proteins were eluted from the column in preheated sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). For whole lysate sample preparation, the lysates (50 μg of total proteins/well) were denatured by boiling for 5 min in sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates and whole lysates were then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™ P, Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed by Western blotting. The transferred membranes were blocked with 1% casein (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with primary Abs (1:1000 of polyclonal anti-CXCR4, 1:500 of anti-Giα and -Gβ) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). Membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of CXCR4 and IGF-1R on the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cell Lines—Two breast cancer cell lines, the non-metastatic MCF-7 and metastatic MDA-MB-231, were characterized in terms of the expression and function of CXCR4 and IGF-1R. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression of both CXCR4 and IGF-1R on both cell types (Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE). MCF-7 cells expressed both receptors at high levels (94.74 ± 4.01% of positive cells with a geometric mean of 65.28 ± 17.08% for CXCR4 and 98.85 ± 0.69% of positive cells with a geometric mean of 26.75 ± 7.12% for IGF-1R) whereas MDA-MB-231 cells showed a high level of CXCR4 (95.71 ± 1.10% positive cells with a geometric mean of 77.32 ± 18.77%) and a lower level of IGF-1R expression (22.65 ± 9.34% of positive cells with a geometric mean of 13.10 ± 3.47%). Western blot analysis also confirmed the expression of CXCR4 and IGF-1R in both cell lines (data not shown).TABLE ONEFlow cytometric analysis of CXCR4 and IGF-1R expression on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cellsCell line% Cells positiveGeometric meanCXCR4 expression B300aB300, positive control cell line for huCXCR4.49.63 ± 23.24bData are pooled from three separate experiments and presented as mean ± S.D.38.03 ± 6.59 MCF-794.74 ± 4.0165.28 ± 17.08 MDA-MB-23195.71 ± 1.1077.32 ± 18.77IGF-1R expression P6cP6, positive control cell line for huIGF-1R.98.05 ± 1.38154.72 ± 35.96 huIRB+dhuIRB+, positive control cell line for human insulin receptor B.1.41 ± 0.3616.11 ± 4.15 MCF-798.85 ± 0.6926.75 ± 7.12 MDA-MB-23122.65 ± 9.3413.10 ± 3.47a B300, positive control cell line for huCXCR4.b Data are pooled from three separate experiments and presented as mean ± S.D.c P6, positive control cell line for huIGF-1R.d huIRB+, positive control cell line for human insulin receptor B. Open table in a new tab Chemotactic Response of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cells to CXCL12 and IGF-1—The function of CXCR4 and IGF-1R on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was examined by testing the migrational response of the cells to respective ligands, CXCL12 and IGF-1, using a modified Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay. Interestingly, even though CXCR4 expression was similar on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, only the former responded to CXCL12 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, both cell lines migrated in response to IGF-1. However, in keeping with the lower level of IGF-1R expression, IGF-1-induced chemotaxis of MDA-MB-231 cells was lower than that observed in MCF-7 cells. Additional experimentation was conducted in MDA-MB-231 cells to determine the effect of combined stimulation with CXCL12 and IGF-1. The results of these experiments indicated an additive effect of those ligands on chemotaxis of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2B). CXCL12 Does Not Transactivate IGF-1R on MDA-MB-231 Cells—To investigate potential cross-talk between CXCR4 and IGF-1R-induced signal transduction pathways, we initially determined whether there is cross-activation of IGF-1R by CXCL12 on MDA-MB-231 cells. Because activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1 leads to the rapid formation of a tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor complex, a KIRA assay was performed to compare the levels of IGF-1R activation induced by CXCL12 and IGF-1. Preliminary experiments indicated that in P6 (positive control), MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, maximal levels of activated IGF-1R complex formed after stimulation with 10 nm IGF-1 at 10 min (data not shown). Therefore, in subsequent experiments, the cells were stimulated with various concentrations of IGF-1 and CXCL12 for 10 min. The results of these experiments indicate that IGF-1 dose-dependently induced the activation of IGF-1R in all three cell lines (Fig. 3A) whereas CXCL12 failed to do so at any of the concentrations tested (Fig. 3B). Pertussis Toxin Inhibits CXCL12- and IGF-1-induced Chemotaxis but Does Not Affect the Activation of IGF-1R Induced by IGF-1 in MDA-MB-231 Cells—To investigate the involvement of Giα in IGF-1-induced chemotaxis of MDA-MB-231 cells, the cells were treated with various concentrations of PTX, a specific inhibitor of Giα subunits. The cells were then tested for their chemotactic response to various concentrations of both CXCL12 and IGF-1. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, PTX at a concentration of 10 ng/ml completely blocked the response to CXCL12 and partially inhibited that to IGF-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Similar levels of inhibition were observed when the cells were pretreated with 100 and 1,000 ng/ml PTX (data not shown). These data indicate a contribution of Giα to IGF-1-induced chemotaxis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with PTX had no effect on IGF-1-induced chemotaxis at any of the three doses tested (Fig. 4C). To test the possibility that blocking Giα with PTX inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1, the lysates of cells untreated or treated with PTX were assayed for the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated IGF-1R complex formed in response to IGF-1 using the KIRA assay. Two different doses of PTX (10 and 100 ng/ml) failed to alter the level of IGF-1R activation in either MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5, A and B) indicating that Giα is not involved in IGF-1-induced formation of the activated IGF-1R complex. RNAi of CXCR4 Inhibits Both CXCL12- and IGF-1-induced Chemotaxis but Has No Effect on the Activation of IGF-1R in MDA-MB-231 Cells—The involvement of CXCR4 in IGF-1-induced chemotaxis of MDA-MB-231 cells was examined using CXCR4-deficient cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing either RNAi to knockdown CXCR4 or a retrovirus expressing specific target sequences for Renilla luciferase as a negative control. Individual clones were isolated and characterized for CXCR4 surface expression by flow cytometry and CXCR4 function was determined by assessing calcium mobilization and chemotaxis in response to CXCL12. Compared with wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells and the negative control clone, RNAi clones 11, 21, and 27 demonstrated a significant reduction of surface CXCR4 expression (Fig. 6A, shown only for clone 11) and of calcium mobilization in response to CXCL12 (data not shown). The surface expression of IGF-1R was not affected by RNAi CXCR4 knockdown in any of the clones (Fig. 6A shown only for clone 11). Compared with wild-type cells and the negative control clone, RNAi clones 11, 21, and 27 displayed a significant reduction in chemotaxis in response to CXCL12 (Fig. 6B) and IGF-1 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, knockdown of CXCR4 did not have any effect on IGF-1-induced IGF-1R activation as determined in the KIRA assay (Fig. 6D). IGF-1R Is Physically Associated with CXCR4 and G Protein Subunits in Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 Cells, but IGF-1 Activates the CXCR4 Signaling Pathway through G Proteins Only in MDA-MB-231 Cells—The nature of the interaction between IGF-1R, CXCR4, and G proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated. Immunoprecipitations were performed on cell lysates using an anti-IGF-1R mAb, anti-human CXCR4, or control IgG, followed by Western blots for either CXCR4, Giα, or Gβ. The immunoprecipitations with control IgG failed to coprecipitate CXCR4, Giα2, and Gβ, despite the fact that these latter three proteins were readily detectable in whole cell lysates subjected directly to Western blot (Fig. 7A). In contrast, immunoprecipitation of IGF-1R and CXCR4 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells led to coprecipitation of all three proteins, indicating the existence of a constitutive complex between IGF-1R, CXCR4, Giα2, and Gβ. Of note, the levels of Giα2 and Gβ in immunoprecipitates of the two receptors consistently appeared to be higher in MDA-MB-231 cells than in MCF-7 cells. The ability of IGF-1 to transactivate CXCR4 was investigated by examining the effect of stimulation with IGF-1 on the level of association of Giα2 and Gβ with CXCR4 (Fig. 7B). The results of these experiments showed that stimulation of MCF-7 cells with IGF-1 failed to release either Giα2 or Gβ from the CXCR4/IGF-1R complex, whereas, in contrast, both Giα2 and Gβ were released from the complex in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here we present evidence of cross-talk between CXCR4 and IGF-1R in the human epithelial breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. The basis of this cross-talk appears to depend on a physical association between CXCR4 and IGF-1R. It is unidirectional, involving activation of G protein subunits by IGF-1 that is dependent on the presence of a functional pool of CXCR4, but independent of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12. These observations potentially have major implications for our understanding of the intracellular signaling of these two important receptors in both normal and pathological situations. In this study, two breast cancer cell lines, the non-metastatic MCF-7 and the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 were characterized in terms of expression and function of CXCR4 and IGF-1R. MCF-7 cells exhibited a high level of IGF-1R expression and a strong chemotactic response to IGF-1 whereas MDA-MB-231 cells expressed a lower level of the receptor and a lower response to IGF-1. The lower level of IGF-1R expression in the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells compared with the non-metastatic MCF-7 cells correlates well with the results of a recent study demonstrating that reduced expression of IGF-1R in MCF-7 cells leads to a more metastatic phenotype in those cells (26Pennisi P.A. Barr V. Nunez N.P. Stannard B. Le Roith D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6529-6537PubMed Google Scholar). Although the two cell lines expressed high levels of CXCR4, only MDA-MB-231 cells responded functionally to CXCL12, indica"

However, the underlying mechanisms for this synergy remain unclear. Here we show, utilizing bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from Btk and Lyn knock-out mice, that activation of Btk via Lyn plays a key role in promoting synergy. As in human mast cells, SCF enhanced degranulation and cytokine production in BMMCs. In Btk-/- BMMCs, in which there was a partial reduction in the capacity to degranulate in response to antigen, SCF was unable to enhance the residual antigen-mediated degranulation. Furthermore, as with antigen, the ability of SCF to promote cytokine production was abrogated in the Btk-/- BMMCs. The impairment of responses in Btk-/- cells correlated with an inability of SCF to augment phospholipase Cγ1 activation and calcium mobilization, and to phosphorylate NFκB and NFAT for cytokine gene transcription in these cells. Similar studies with Lyn-/- and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs indicated that Lyn was a regulator of Btk for these responses. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that Btk is a key regulator of a Kit-mediated amplification pathway that augments FcϵRI-mediated mast cell activation.

However, antigen-induced triggering of mast cells in vivo is likely to occur with a background of stem cell factor (SCF)-mediated Kit activation, as SCF is essential for the growth, differentiation, homing, and survival of mast cells (2Galli S.J.

By mimicking this situation in vitro, we have demonstrated that SCF dramatically augments both antigen-mediated degranulation and cytokine generation in these cells (3Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M.

The subsequent elevation of intracellular calcium levels and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) leads to degranulation (14Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), whereas activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway induces arachidonic acid metabolite release (15Hirasawa N.

A parallel pathway controlled by the Src kinase, Fyn, also appears to help regulate FcϵRI-dependent mast cell activation (17Parravicini V. Gadina M. Kovarova M. Odom S. Gonzales-Espinosa C.

Many of these same signaling events are initiated upon binding of SCF to Kit (18Linnekin D. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) but are insufficient on their own to induce degranulation (4Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E.

Our previous studies have suggested that this may be related to the inability of SCF to induce phosphorylation of LAT (3Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and downstream activation of PKC (4Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E. Satterthwaite A.B.

Nevertheless, SCF can potentiate FcϵRI-mediated degranulation and phosphorylation of NTAL as well as enhance calcium mobilization (3Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). How SCF augments these responses, however, was unclear. Given that the tyrosine kinase, Btk, is thought to play a role in the regulation of PLCγ-mediated calcium mobilization for both the B cell receptor (19Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I.

Satterthwaite A.B. Kato R.M. Asai K. Hartman S.E. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Lowell C.A. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we have examined whether Btk played a similar role in Kit-mediated responses. By use of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from gene-deficient mice, Btk was not only found to be essential for the ability of SCF to potentiate antigen-mediated degranulation but was also found to be required for the ability of Kit to regulate cytokine production in antigen-stimulated cells. Mast Cells—The Btk-/-, Lyn-/-, Btk-/-/Lyn-/- knock-out, and wild type (WT) mice used in this study have been described previously (20Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Satterthwaite A.B. Kato R.M. Asai K. Hartman S.E. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Lowell C.A. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mice were cross-bred on a C57BL/6 × 129/Sv genetic background. The wild type mice were derived from the same parental lines as the knock-out mice. Breeding pairs heterozygous for Lyn, Btk (males were either Btk-/Y or +/Y), or both were set up to generate both wild type and knock-out mice within the same litter. Whenever possible, littermates were compared directly. All animals were housed within the same room. The genotype of these mice was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR of tail biopsies and by immunoblot analysis of proteins extracted from the BMMCs derived from these mice. Bone marrow obtained by femur lavage was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing IL-3 as described (13Tkaczyk C. Beaven M.A. Brachman S.M. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48474-48484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The studies were then conducted on BMMCs after 4-6 weeks in culture. Cell Activation—For degranulation and signaling studies, cultured BMMCs were sensitized overnight with anti-mouse monoclonal dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE (100 ng/ml) (Sigma) in IL-3-free RPMI medium and then rinsed with HEPES buffer (21Lin P. Fung S.J. Chen T. Repetto B. Huang K.S. Gilfillan A.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The cells were triggered in the same buffer with DNP-human serum albumin (HSA) (0-100 ng/ml) and/or murine SCF (0-100 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 30 min for the degranulation studies or for the indicated periods for the signaling studies. For cytokine mRNA and release studies, cells were similarly sensitized but triggered for 4 or 10 h, respectively, in RPMI. Degranulation Assay—Degranulation was monitored by the release of β-hexosaminidase into the supernatants (22Chaves-Dias C. Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Kirshenbaum A.S. Cunha-Melo J.R. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6647-6656Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, BMMCs, sensitized as above, were triggered in 96-well plates (5 × 105 cells per well, 100 μl final volumes). The reactions were terminated by centrifugation (3000 rpm) at 4 °C, and the supernatants were aliquoted to 96-well plates for β-hexosaminidase assay. The remaining cells were lysed by adding distilled water and freeze-thawing, and then aliquots were similarly assayed for β-hexosaminidase content. Degranulation was then calculated as the percentage of total (cells and supernatants) β-hexosaminidase content found in the supernatants following challenge. Cytokine Production—RNase protection assays (RPA) were utilized to measure mRNA levels for multiple cytokines and chemokines following cell activation. Cells were sensitized and then triggered as above at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml. Messenger RNA was extracted by lysing the cells with 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. Chloroform (200 μl) was added to the lysates, and the mixtures were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Isopropyl alcohol (500 μl) was then added to the aqueous phases, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min to precipitate RNA. Ten μg of RNA was used in the mRNA assay by using an in vitro transcription kit and pre-designed or custom-designed RPA templates (BD Biosciences). RPA was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions; however, the synthesized radioactive probes labeled with [α-33P]UTP were purified with a probequant G-50 microcolumn (Amersham Biosciences) instead of ethanol precipitation, and the protected mRNA was precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate containing Glyco-blue (Ambion, Austin, TX). The gels were prepared with 80 ml of SequaGel-6 (National Diagnostics, Inc.), 20 ml of SequaGel-complete (National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA), and 10% ammonium persulfate (Sigma). Levels of the secreted cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and TNF-α were measured in the supernatants of activated BMMCs by ELISA (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Cell Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates and/or immunoprecipitates were prepared as described (23Tkaczyk C. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and aliquots loaded onto 4-12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen). The proteins were then separated by electrophoresis in MES buffer (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, the proteins were probed for immunoreactive proteins utilizing the following antibodies: goat anti-Btk pAb, goat anti-Tec pAb, anti-Itk pAb, anti-Lyn pAb, anti-Fyn pAb, anti-Blk pAb, anti-Yes pAb, antic-Fos pAb, anti-c-Jun pAb, anti-Syk pAb (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Hck pAb and anti-Src pAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15) (Sigma); anti-phospho-Btk (Tyr(P)-223) pAb, anti-phospho-Src (Tyr(P)-416) pAb, anti-phospho-AKT (Ser(P)-473) pAb, anti-phospho-ERK (Thr(P)-202 and Tyr(P)-204), anti-phospho-JNK (Thr(P)-183 and Tyr(P)-185) pAb, anti-phospho-p38 (Thr(P)-180 and Tyr(P)-182) pAb, anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser(P)-73) pAb, and anti-phospho NFκB (Ser(P)-536) pAb (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti-phospho-NFAT (Ser(P)-54) pAb and antiphospho-PLCγ1 (Tyr(P)-783) pAb (BIOSOURCE). Unless specified, pAbs were of rabbit origin. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-goat (The Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA), or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and then by ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). As described previously (20Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Satterthwaite A.B. Kato R.M. Asai K. Hartman S.E. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Lowell C.A. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and as discussed below, there were no apparent differences in the expression of signaling molecules (apart from Btk and Lyn) in the knock-out BMMCs. Therefore, protein loading of the samples was normalized by stripping and then probing for actin or alternatively by probing identically loaded membranes for either actin or Syk. To quantitate changes in protein phosphorylation, the ECL films were scanned by using an ImageQuant 5.0 scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Intracellular Calcium Determination—Calcium flux was measured in the BMMCs following loading of the cells with Fura-2 AM ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (13Tkaczyk C. Beaven M.A. Brachman S.M. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48474-48484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed, and resuspended in HEPES buffer containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin and sulfinapyrazone (0.3 mm) (Sigma), and then placed in a 96-well black culture plate (20,000 cells/well) (CulturPlat-96 F, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence was measured at two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence readings was calculated following subtraction of the fluorescence of the cells that had not been loaded with Fura 2-AM. To investigate the role of Btk in Kit-mediated responses, we utilized BMMCs derived from the bone marrow of Btk-/- mice. Because previous studies had suggested that Btk and Lyn had both redundant and opposing functions in antigen-dependent mast cell (20Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Satterthwaite A.B. Kato R.M. Asai K. Hartman S.E. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Lowell C.A. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cell activation (24Satterthwaite A.B. Lowell C.A. Khan W.N. Sideras P. Alt F.W. Witte O.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we compared the responses in the Btk-/- BMMCs to those obtained in WT, Lyn-/-, and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out BMMCs. The Btk-/-, Lyn-/-, and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMC genotypes were confirmed by probing lysates from these cells for Btk and Lyn (data not shown). The levels of expression of the other Tec kinases, including Tec and Itk (as controls for Btk) and other Src kinases, including Blk, Fgr, Fyn, Hck, c-Src, and Yes (as controls for Lyn), were unaffected in these cells, apart from a slight reduction in the expression of Fgr in the Lyn-/- and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs (data not shown). Both antigen and SCF induced the phosphorylation of Btk in WT mouse BMMCs (Fig. 1, a and b); however, maximum phosphorylation observed with SCF was of a lesser magnitude than that observed with antigen. Although there was little evidence of synergy in the responses at early time points (0-120 s), when cells were co-stimulated with SCF and antigen, Btk phosphorylation was more sustained than was observed with the individual stimulants. As expected, this phosphorylination was not detected in the Btk-/- BMMCs (Fig. 1, c and d). In addition, the phosphorylation of Btk was substantially reduced in the Lyn-/- BMMCs indicating that the phosphorylation of Btk was largely dependent on Lyn. Stimulation of BMMCs with antigen, but not SCF, resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of the Src kinases (Fig. 1, e and f), although Src kinases were constitutively phosphorylated to some degree. In the Lyn-/- BMMCs there was virtually no phosphorylation of the Src kinases in both stimulated and non-stimulated BMMCs. Thus, the major Src kinase phosphorylated both constitutively and inducibly by antigen in the BMMCs was Lyn. However, overexposure of the gels revealed that SCF, but not antigen, also resulted in a lesser phosphorylation of another Src kinase that was not Lyn (Fig. 1e). There was little change in the phosphorylation of the Src kinases in the Btk-/- BMMCs, thus confirming that the phosphorylation of Btk is downstream of Lyn. To establish that SCF potentiated FcϵRI-dependent responses in WT mouse BMMCs as was the case in human mast cells (3Hundley T.R. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Andrade M.V. Metcalfe D.D. Beaven M.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E. Satterthwaite A.B. Nahm D.-H. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we examined degranulation and cytokine production in response to SCF, antigen, or both in combination. Fig. 2a shows that SCF, at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml, induced little degranulation. When added concurrently with antigen, however, SCF induced a marked concentration-dependent potentiation of antigen-mediated degranulation. Similarly, SCF and antigen acted in synergy to increase the message of multiple cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, TNF-α, and interferon-γ (Fig. 2b). To confirm that the potentiation of cytokine message levels translated into increases in cytokine protein, the release of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-13 was examined by ELISA 10 h following challenge with SCF with or without antigen. Again, as in human mast cells (4Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E. Satterthwaite A.B. Nahm D.-H. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), cytokine secretion was minimally elevated in response to either SCF or antigen alone, but when added in combination, there was a marked synergistic enhancement of cytokine production (Fig. 2, c-e). As reported (20Kawakami Y. Kitaura J. Satterthwaite A.B. Kato R.M. Asai K. Hartman S.E. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Lowell C.A. Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1210-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), antigen-mediated degranulation ∼50% in both the Btk-/- and Lyn-/- was reduced by BMMCs when compared with WT controls and was virtually abolished in the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out BMMCs (Fig. 3a). SCF was unable to potentiate the residual antigen-mediated degranulation (i.e. 10-15%) in the Btk-/- and the Lyn-/- BMMCs and the minimal degranulation in the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out BMMCs (Fig. 3b). This is in contrast to SCF-mediated potentiation of degranulation induced by minimally effective concentrations of antigen as shown previously in Fig. 2a. Production of TNF-α and IL-6 and IL-13 (Fig. 3, c-e, respectively) in response to SCF and antigen or both in combination was reduced by ∼50% in the Btk-/- BMMCs, potentiated in the Lyn-/- BMMCs, and virtually reduced to background levels in the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out BMMCs, as compared with WT BMMCs. In contrast to degranulation, however, an additive response to the combination of SCF and antigen was still observed in Btk-/- BMMCs, although the net response was still ∼50% that in WT BMMCs. In the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out BMMCs, however, production of cytokines was virtually ablated. Similar responses were observed at the message level as determined by RPA (data not shown). Activation of PLCγ1 and PI 3-Kinase—Our previous studies suggested that the ability of SCF to potentiate antigen-mediated degranulation was associated with an enhancement of calcium mobilization (4Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E. Satterthwaite A.B. Nahm D.-H. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As both PLCγ1- and PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways control FcϵRI-mediated degranulation in human mast cells via regulation of calcium mobilization (13Tkaczyk C. Beaven M.A. Brachman S.M. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48474-48484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we next examined whether these signaling events were ablated in the Btk-/-, Lyn-/-, and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs. PLCγ1 and PI 3-kinase activation was monitored by the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 or AKT, respectively (13Tkaczyk C. Beaven M.A. Brachman S.M. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48474-48484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both SCF and antigen stimulated PLCγ1 phosphorylation in WT BMMCs, and the combination of both stimuli resulted in an additive and more sustained phosphorylation than that induced by either stimulant alone (Fig. 4, a, b, e, and f). We were unable to detect PLCγ2 phosphorylation in response to SCF and antigen by utilizing a commercially available anti-phospho-PLCγ2. However, following immunoprecipitation with an anti-PLCγ2 antibody and then probing with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we observed that although both antigen and SCF induced PLCγ2 phosphorylation, these responses were not additive (data not shown). In contrast to PLCγ1 phosphorylation, the effects of SCF and antigen on AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 4, c, d, g, and h) were not additive. Rather, antigen induced a decrease in the more predominant SCF-mediated AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 4, c and d). This was likely because of Lyn-mediated down-regulation of PI 3-kinase activation, as the inhibitory response was reversed in the Lyn-/- and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs but not the Btk-/- BMMCs (Fig. 4, g and h). The lack of synergistic enhancement of AKT phosphorylation in the Lyn-/- and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs likely reflects the fact that both a Lyn-dependent inhibitory pathway, potentially via SHIP (25Hernandez-Hansen V. Smith A.J. Surviladze Z. Chigaev A. Mazel T. Kalensnikoff J. Lowell C.A. Krystal G. Sklar L.A. Wilson B.S. Oliver J.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and a Lyn-dependent activation pathway, potentially via Syk (26Li H.-L. Davis W.W. Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Pure E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6890-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), for antigen-induced PI 3-kinase activation are blocked in these cells. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the slight increase in AKT phosphorylation observed in response to antigen in the WT cells is absent in the Lyn-/- and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs (Fig. 4, g and h) Btk-deficient BMMCs exhibited a slight reduction in PLCγ1 phosphorylation in response to antigen and SCF (Fig. 4, e and f). However, the ability of SCF to potentiate antigen-mediated PLCγ1 phosphorylation was completely blocked in the Btk-/- BMMCs, and the combination of antigen and SCF appeared to result in phosphorylation levels that were slightly lower than that observed with antigen alone (Fig. 4, e and f). In Lyn-/-, as well as Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs, the ability of antigen in the absence or presence of SCF to induce PLCγ1 phosphorylation was completely blocked. As a result, the synergistic increase in PLCγ1 phosphorylation in response to SCF and antigen added concurrently was reduced to close to base line in the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out cells. Thus, although Lyn was required for phosphorylation of PLCγ1 in response to antigen, Btk was central to the ability of SCF to potentiate this response. Calcium Mobilization—As with human mast cells (4Tkaczyk C. Horejsi V. Iwaki S. Draber P. Samelson L.E. Satterthwaite A.B. Nahm D.-H. Metcalfe D.D. Gilfillan A.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), SCF and antigen acted in synergy to enhance calcium mobilization in WT BMMCs (Fig. 5a). In the Btk-/- BMMCs, the initial increases in calcium mobilization in response to antigen (Fig. 5b) or SCF (Fig. 5c) when added separately or concurrently (Fig. 5d) were still observed. These responses, however, were substantially lower and less sustained than those observed in the WT BMMCs. In contrast, in the Lyn-/- BMMCs, the increase in calcium levels was delayed but eventually reached levels that were similar to those in WT BMMCs. As was the case with degranulation, the residual calcium flux in the antigen-challenged Btk-/- (Fig. 5e) or Lyn-/- BMMCs (Fig. 5f) could not be further potentiated by SCF. In the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- double knock-out BMMCs, the calcium response to both stimuli was virtually ablated (Fig. 5, b-d). Taken together, the above data support the concept that the ability of SCF to potentiate antigen-mediated calcium mobilization, hence degranulation, was entirely dependent on Btk, and this was at the level of PLCγ1 activation but downstream of PI 3-kinase activation. MAPK and Transcription Factor Phosphorylation—We next examined if the observed deficiencies in cytokine production in the Btk-/-, Lyn-/-, and Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs correlated to reduced activation of MAPKs and specific transcription factors. In WT BMMCs, the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPKs was augmented by co-stimulation with antigen and SCF compared with the effects of the individual stimulants added alone (Fig. 6). There was no reduction in the synergistic phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the Btk-/- and Lyn-/- BMMCs (Fig. 6, a and b) and only a slight reduction in the Btk-/-/Lyn-/- BMMCs. In contrast, the synergy between antigen and SCF in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK"

Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). MCT isoforms have been reported for most tissues, where the removal or supply of l-lactate (pyruvate or other monocarboxylates) is related to different metabolic conditions. The MCT isoform 1 (MCT1) has been found in most tissues; in the brain, MCT1 appears to be located mainly in glial cells (2Bröer S. Rahman B. Pellegri G. Pellerin L. Martin J.-L. Verelysdonk S.

MCT1 has a Km value for l-lactate of 3–5 mm and is believed to be associated in the glia-neuron lactate shuttle (5Deitmer J.W.

Lactate is exported from astrocytes via MCT1 and is then taken up by neurons via the high-affinity MCT2 (Km∼0.5 mm). The significance of this lactate shuttle has been demonstrated by showing that synaptic activity recovers and is maintained under glucose-deprived conditions after addition of lactate (7Schurr A.

We have expressed MCT1 in Xenopus oocytes and injected isoform II of CA, which has been shown to be present also in astrocytes (15Jeffrey M. Wells G.A. Bridges A.W. J. Comp. Pathol. 1991; 104: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that CA binds to the MCT1 in the cell membrane of the oocyte and greatly enhances the H+ flux via the MCT1. Surprisingly, the MCT1-CA interaction was independent of added CO2/HCO3- and not sensitive to the CA inhibitor ethoxyzolamide. A preliminary account of some of the results has been communicated in abstract form (16Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 449 (abstr.): S33Google Scholar). Constructs, Oocytes, and Injection of cRNA and Carbonic Anhydrase— For oocyte expression rat MCT1 cloned in the vector pGEMHeJuel, which contains the 5′- and the 3′-untranscribed regions of the Xenopus β-globulin flanking the multiple cloning site, was used (2Bröer S.

Plasmid DNA was linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA-polymerase in the presence of the cap analogon m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (mMessage mMachine, Ambion Inc.) to produce a capped RNA transcript. The cRNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit and stored at –70 °C in DEPC-H2O. Integrity of the cRNA was checked by formaldehyde-gel electrophoresis. X. laevis females were purchased from Horst Kähler, Hamburg, Germany. Oocytes were isolated and singularized by collagenase (collagenase A, Roche Applied Science) treatment in Ca2+-free oocyte Ringer solution at room temperature for 2 h. The singularized oocytes were left overnight in Ca2+-containing oocyte Ringer solution to recover. The oocyte saline solution (OR2+) had the following composition (in mm): NaCl, 82.5; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; Na2HPO4, 1; HEPES, 5, titrated with NaOH to pH 7.0 or 7.4. The bicarbonate-containing saline solution contained (in mm): NaCl, 72.5; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; Na2HPO4, 1; NaHCO3, 10 (pH 7.0) or 24 (pH 7.4), gassed with 5% CO2 and HEPES, 5, to stabilize the pH. Lactate (3 and 10 mm) was added as sodium lactate and exchanged for equimolar amounts of NaCl. Oocytes at stages V and VI were then selected and injected with 7 ng of MCT1-cRNA using glass micropipettes and a microinjection device (Nanoliter 2000, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Control oocytes were injected with an equivalent volume of DEPC-H2O. CA was directly injected into the oocytes. Therefore 50 ng of CA, isolated from bovine erythrocytes (C3934, Sigma), dissolved in 25 nl of DEPC-H2O, was injected 20–28 h before using oocytes for electrophysiological measurement. Control oocytes were injected with 25 nl of DEPC-H2O alone. For co-injection of CA with anti-CA, a mixture of CA and a 1.5-fold amount of anti-CA (rabbit anti-carbonic anhydrase II (Bovine Erythrocytes) polyclonal antibody, AB1243, Chemicon Europe, Hofheim, Germany) was prepared 1–2 days before injection to allow enough time for anti-CA to bind to the CA. Injection of the CA + anti-CA mixture was carried out as described for the CA. C-terminal Deletion in the MCT1D56 Mutant—Deletion of the C-terminal tail of MCT was carried out by using site-directed mutagenesis with modified oligonucleotide primers, as first described by Weiner et al. (18Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For the deletion, the base triplet, coding for the 56th amino acid from the C-terminal onward, was changed from CGA (arginine) to TGA (stop). For selection of the mutants, a second SpeI restriction side (ACTAGTG) was added by changing the base triplet coding for the 55th amino acid (leucine) from CTT to CTA. The mutation was carried out by using a PCR reaction with the whole pGHJMCT1 plasmid as template and the following sense and a complementary antisense primer (changed nucleotides are written in bold): 5′-GGC ATC AAT TAT TGA CTA GTG GCC AAA GAA-3′. After DpnI digestion of the template DNA, the mutated construct was retransformed into the Escherichia coli strain XL1 blue. Mutations were verified by restriction digestion and cDNA sequencing. RNA was then produced as described above. Intracellular pH Measurements—For measurement of intracellular pH and membrane potential, double-barreled pH-sensitive microelectrodes were used; the manufacture and application have been described in detail previously (19Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, two borosilicate glass capillaries of 1.0 and 1.5 mm in diameter were twisted together and pulled to a micropipette. The ion-selective barrel was silanized with a drop of 5% tri-N-butylchlorsilane in 99.9% pure carbon tetrachloride backfilled into the tip. The micropipette was baked for 4.5 min at 450 °C on a hotplate. H+-sensitive mixture (Fluka 95291, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was backfilled into the tip of the silanized ion-selective barrel and filled up with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The reference barrel was filled with 3 m KCl. To increase the opening of the electrode tip, it was bevelled with a jet stream of aluminum powder suspended in H2O. Calibration of the electrodes was carried out in OR2+ with a pH of 7.0 and 6.4. The recording arrangement was the same as described previously (19Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28057-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The central and the reference barrel of the electrodes were connected by chlorided silver wires to the head stages of an electrometer amplifier. Electrodes were accepted for use in the experiments when their response exceeded 50 mV per unit change in pH; on average, they responded with 54 mV for unit change in pH. In the experimental chamber they responded faster to a change in saline pH than the fastest reaction expected to occur in the oocyte cytosol. As described previously (3Bröer S. Schneider H.-P. Bröer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) optimal pH changes were detected when the electrode was located near the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This was achieved by carefully rotating the oocyte with the impaled electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C). Only oocytes with a membrane potential negative to –30 mV were used for experiments. Buffering Power and Proton Fluxes—The measurements of pHi were stored digitally using homemade PC software based on the program LabView and could be converted into intracellular H+ concentration, [H+]i. This should provide changes in the [H+]i, which take into account the different pH base lines, e.g. as measured in HEPES- and CO2/HCO3--buffered saline solutions (20Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28057-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Amplitude and rate of change of the measured pHi or of the [H+]i were continuously recorded. The intrinsic buffering power βi was calculated from the maximal “instantaneous” pHi changes recorded when changing from HEPES- to 5% CO2/10 mm HCO3--buffered saline solution. The CO2-dependent buffering power, βCO2, was calculated from the intracellular bicarbonate concentration in the oocytes, βCO2 = 2.3 · [HCO3-], and the bicarbonate concentration was obtained from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The total buffer capacity, βt, was defined as the sum of βi and βCO2. Net H+ flux JH (mm/min), defined as the net transport of acid and/or base equivalents across the cell membrane, was calculated as the product of the rate of pHi change, ΔpHi/t, and the buffering power β. For calculation of the flux rates in HEPES-buffered saline solution, ΔpHi/t was multiplied with the intrinsic buffer capacity βi of the oocyte. For calculation of the flux rate in CO2/HCO3--buffered saline solution, ΔpHi/t was multiplied with the total buffering capacity βt (20Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28057-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Voltage Clamp Recording—A borosilicate glass capillary, 1.5 mm in diameter, was pulled to a micropipette and backfilled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of the electrode measured in oocyte saline solution was around 1 megohm. For voltage clamp recording, both electrodes were connected to the head stages of an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The experimental bath was grounded with a chlorided silver wire coated by agar dissolved in OR2+. Determination of CA Activity—Activity of CA was determined by monitoring the 18O depletion of doubly labeled 13C18O2 through several hydration and dehydration steps of CO2 and HCO3- at 25 °C (21Silverman D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 732-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Sültemeyer D.F. Fock H.P. Canvin D.T. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reaction sequence of 18O loss from 13C18O18O(m/z = 49) over the intermediate product 13C18O16O (m/z = 47) and the end product 13C16O16O (m/z = 45) was monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MSD 5970; Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) by coupling the machine to a cuvette via an aqueous membrane inlet system. The relative 18O enrichment was calculated from the measured 45, 47, and 49 abundance as a function of time according to: log enrichment = log [49 × 100/(49 + 47 + 45)]. For the calculation of the CA activity of the sample, the rate of 18O degradation was obtained from the linear slope of the log(enrichment) over the time, using the spreadsheet-analyzing software Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software Inc.). The rate was compared with the corresponding rate of the non-catalyzed reaction. For the experiments, the cuvette was filled with 10 ml of OR2+ with a pH of 7.35 according to the mean intracellular pH of CA-injected oocytes and tempered to 25 °C. 1 μg of CA was added directly as protein, dissolved in water in a concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. Oocytes, injected with 50 ng of CA each, were pipetted into the cuvette in a batch of 20, making a total amount of 1 μg of CA. Covalent Coupling of Carbonic Anhydrase and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) to Sepharose and Non-covalent Binding of Glutathione S-transferase to Glutathione-Sepharose—For pulldown assays CA and, as control, BSA, were linked covalently to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly CA and BSA were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated with activated N-hydroxysuccinimide-Sepharose beads (5 mg of protein/ml medium) overnight at 4 °C. The remaining active groups were blocked for 3 h at room temperature with 0.5 m ethanolamine/0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0. To remove uncoupled protein, the beads were washed alternately with 0.2 m NaHCO3/0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0, and 0.2 m NaOAc/0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0. The efficiency of protein coupling was assessed by comparing protein content before and after coupling on SDS-PAGE/Coomassie stain. GST expressed in E. coli was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). BL21 cells then were transformed with the vector pGEX 4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and cultured, and at A578 nm of 0.7, expression of the GST protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation for 3 h at 29°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 5000 × g) and lysed by sonification, and proteins were extracted with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 150 mm NaCl/50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) (Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation (50,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min) the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline, and the amount of purified GST bound to the Sepharose was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. In Vitro Translation of MCT1 and MCT1D56 and Pulldown Assays on Immobilized CA-Sepharose—In vitro translation of MCT1 and MCT156 in pGEMHeJuel was performed under the control of the T7 promoter using the TnT7® Quick translation kit (Promega). Therefore 1 μg of cDNA and 10 μCi of l-[35S]methionine were incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a final volume of 30 μl. After incubation for 90 min at 30 °C, the probes were frozen at –20 °C. The in vitro translated products were checked by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device before they were used for the pulldown assays. 7 μlof the protein probes were diluted in 1 ml of RIPA-CaMg buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 50 μl of CA-Sepharose (∼3.75 mg/ml), GST-Sepharose (∼0.1 mg/ml), and BSA-Sepharose (∼3.75 mg/ml) equilibrated in RIPA-CaMg buffer. Protein columns were washed five times for 5 min with 1 ml of RIPA-CaMg buffer at room temperature. Columns and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (8% (w/v) SDS, 120 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerine, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and transferred to SDS-PAGE. After drying, gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens. Calculation and Statistics—Statistical values are presented as means ± S.E. For the calculation of significance in differences, Student′s t test or, if possible, a paired t test was used. A typical experiment, which we used for analysis of the effect of CA on the activity of MCT1, is shown in Fig. 1. Oocytes were injected with 14 ng of MCT1-cRNA and either 25 μl of CA (50 μg) or 25 μl of H2O 20–28 h before the experiment. The oocytes were voltage clamped at –40 mV, and intracellular pH changes, converted to changes in [H+]i, were measured with ion-selective microelectrodes. Lactate (3 and 10 mm) was applied for 5–10 min to activate the MCT1, both in HEPES-buffered, nominally CO2/HCO3--free saline solution (which contains less than 70 μm HCO3- at pH 7.0) and, for comparison, in saline solution buffered with 5% CO2/10 mm HCO3- (pH 7.0). The [H+]i changes in oocytes injected with CA (Fig. 1A) occurred much faster during the application of lactate and also upon the addition of CO2/HCO3-, as compared with the [H+]i changes measured in oocytes injected with H2O instead of CA (Fig. 1B). Ethoxyzolamide (EZA, 10 μm), an inhibitor of CA, slowed the CO2-dependent [H+]i changes but not the lactate-induced acidification in CA-injected oocytes and was without effect in the H2O-injected oocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). We have analyzed the change of [H+]i and the rate of [H+]i change in both types of oocytes, as shown for the superimposed traces of [H+]i changes evoked by lactate in HEPES-buffered saline solution (Fig. 1C). The change of [H+]i plotted against time indicated for both lactate concentrations that transport is considerably faster in oocytes injected with CA (Fig. 1D). The half-time of the [H+] change was 22 s in CA-injected oocytes and 43 s in H2O-injected oocytes. Surprisingly, this augmentation of transport activity via the MCT1 was achieved in HEPES-buffered, nominally CO2/HCO3--free saline solution and was not affected by EZA. In both cases the enhancement of the rate of [H+]i change by CA was 3–5-fold (Fig. 1, E and F). The membrane current measured at a holding potential of –40 mV remained virtually constant (not shown here), as the MCT1, cotransporting one lactate anion with one H+, is electroneutral, as demonstrated previously (3Bröer S. Schneider H.-P. Bröer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Becker H.M. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MCT1 and CA, stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies, were clearly visible in the cell membrane of the oocytes injected with cRNA of MCT1 or injected with CA (data for CA not shown here; for MCT1 data see Ref. 23Becker H.M. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There was no staining of the oocyte cytosol, indicating that both proteins were incorporated into or attached to the cell membrane. Native oocytes, labeled with antibodies against CA or MCT1, showed no staining at all. Native oocytes, which were injected with H2O instead of MCT1-cRNA but also injected with CA, showed a fast acidification upon the addition of CO2/HCO3-; the rate of [H+]i change was about four times greater than in oocytes injected with H2O instead of CA (Fig. 2, A–C). This increase in the rate of [H+]i change induced by CA was fully reversed by the CA inhibitor EZA (Fig. 2, D and E). The rate of acidification induced by propionate (10 and 20 mm) was not affected by the injection of CA in native oocytes (Fig. 2, F and G), indicating that active CA does not per se stimulate the rate of [H+]i change. The buffer capacity of the oocyte cytosol was determined by the CO2-induced intracellular pH change (intrinsic buffer capacity βi) and by using the bicarbonate concentration calculated under steady-state conditions in CO2/HCO3--buffered saline solution (CO2-dependent buffer capacity βCO2), the sum of both giving the total buffer capacity βt (23Becker H.M. Bröer S. Deitmer J.W. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 235-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3A, the buffer capacities remained unaffected by the presence of either CA or EZA, indicating that CA did not contribute to the global cytoplasmic buffering of oocytes. This does not exclude, however, that CA might still contribute to the local buffer capacity near the cell membrane, where the CA is located (as will be discussed later). With the buffer capacity and the rate of pH change known, the rate of H+ flux (JH) was calculated and plotted for the MCT1-expressing oocytes with and without injected CA in the absence and presence of EZA (Fig. 3, B and C). Because the global oocyte buffer capacity was not affected (see above), the H+ flux rate reflected a similar difference between the CA-injected and the H2O-injected oocytes. A 3–5-fold increase in H+ flux rate in CA-injected oocytes was obtained during activation of MCT1 by lactate both in the presence and absence of EZA and in the absence and presence of CO2/HCO3-. These results suggest that the presence of CA increases the transport activity of the MCT1 by a mechanism that is independent of CO2/HCO3- and of the inhibition of the CO2 reaction center of CA by EZA. We tried to inhibit the effect of CA on MCT1 transport activity by injecting antibodies against CA (anti-CA) alone and together with CA into oocytes. In comparison with a MCT1-expressing oocyte with CA injected alone, the rate of [H+]i change induced by lactate (in HEPES-buffered saline solution) was much slowed in oocytes into which CA and anti-CA or anti-CA alone was injected (Fig. 4, A and B). The lactate-induced rate of [H+]i change in oocytes into which CA and anti-CA were injected was the same as in oocytes injected only with anti-CA but was 2–3 times smaller than in oocytes injected with CA. In contrast, the rate of CO2-induced acidification in oocytes injected with CA and anti-CA was intermediate to that with oocytes injected with CA alone and to that in oocytes injected only with anti-CA (Fig. 4, C and D). In the presence of EZA (10 μm), no difference in the CO2-induced rate of [H+]i change was detected between all three types of oocytes. The injection of BSA, instead of anti-CA, in MCT1-expressing oocytes injected with CA had no effect on the CA-induced increase of the rate of the lactate-induced acidification and the amplitude of acidification caused by the application of CO2. These results suggest that injection of CA together with its antibody results in complete inhibition of the CA-mediated enhancement of the lactate-induced rate of [H+]i change via MCT1 activity but only in a partial inhibition of the CA-mediated facilitation of the CO2-induced rate of [H+]i change. We measured the activity of the CA as injected into the oocytes 20–24 h after injection of 50 ng of CA into each oocyte using mass spectrometry. CA activity measured in vitro (addition of 1 μg of CA) and in 20 oocytes (corresponding to 1 μg of CA with 50 ng injected into each oocyte) showed an activity of around 25 units/ml, whereas no activity was measured in the absence of CA (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, CA injected into oocytes had the same activity as CA in vitro, although the reaction of CA-injected oocytes was accompanied by a small delay, as expected. Addition of anti-CA antibody to CA, both in vitro and in oocytes, did not inhibit the measured CA activity. These results indicate that the CA used was neither degraded in the oocytes nor affected in its catalytic activity by the antibody. We hypothesized that the facilitation of H+ flux via the MCT1 by CA injected into the oocytes might be achieved by binding of CA to MCT1 at the C terminus, as has been shown for other anion transporters (24Pushkin, A., Abuladze, N., Gross, E., Newman, D., Tatishchev, S., Lee, I., Fedotoff, O., Bondar, G., Azimov, R., Ngyuen, M., and Kurtz, I. J. Physiol. (Lond.) 559, 55–65Google Scholar). We therefore deleted the C terminus of the MCT1 by cutting 56 amino acids from the C terminus by using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated MCT1 (MCT1D56) was then expressed in oocytes as described under “Materials and Methods.” To check for the deletion of the C terminus, MCT1D56-expressing oocytes were stained with an antibody against the C terminus of the MCT1. The fluorescently labeled antibody showed no visible staining in the cell membrane or in the cytosol (data not shown). MCT1D56 showed, in comparison with the wild-type MCT1, a much reduced transport activity, indicated by a decrease in the lactate-induced rate of [H+]i change by 70–85%. There was still detectable transport activity in MCT1D56-expressing oocytes, as measured by the change in pHi and the labeled lactate flux, which was well above the control in native oocytes. The facilitation of the rate of [H+]i change by CA, as observed in the wild-type MCT1, was completely suppressed in the MCT1D56 mutant (Fig. 5, A–C). The rate of [H+]i change was the same in MCT1D56-expressing oocytes whether or not CA or H2O had been injected (Fig. 5D). The CO2-induced rate of H+ flux was, however, still increased 4–5 times by the injection of CA in oocytes expressing the MCT1D56 mutant, as compared with oocytes injected with H2O instead of CA (Fig. 5E). These results indicated that deletion of the C terminus of the MCT1 abolished the effect of injected CA on the lactate-induced, but not on the CO2-induced, rate of acidification. To demonstrate the direct binding between MCT1 and CA, MCT1 cDNA was translated in vitro, and the MCT1 protein was incubated in RIPA-CaMg buffer with immobilized CA. After extensive washing, bound MCT1 protein was eluted by SDS sample buffer. As shown in Fig. 6), MCT1 (43 kDa) was retained on CA. No binding of MCT1 was observed when the in vitro translated protein was incubated with BSA-coupled Sepharose or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose or on blocked NHS-Sepharose (Fig. 6, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Recently it has been shown that the binding of the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) or the chloride/bica"

These sugar chains play a key role in modulating cell-cell interactions, principally during embryonic development, neural plasticity, and tumor metastasis. The degree of polymerization (DP) of polySia chains on N-CAM is postulated to be of critical importance in regulating N-CAM function. There are limitations, however, in the conventional methods to accurately determine the DP of polySia on N-CAM, the most serious being partial acid hydrolysis of internal α2,8-ketosidic linkages that occur during fluorescent derivatization, a step necessary to enhance chromatographic detection. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a facile method that combines the use of Endo-β-galactosidase to first release linear polySia chains from N-CAM, with high resolution high pressure liquid chromatography profiling. This strategy avoids acid hydrolysis prior to chromatographic profiling and thus provides an accurate determination of the DP and distribution of polySia on N-CAM. The potential of this new method was evaluated using a nonpolysialylated construct of N-CAM that was polysialylated in vitro using a soluble construct of ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV. Whereas most of the oligosialic acid/polySia chains consisted of DPs ∼50–60 or less, a subpopulation of chains with DPs ∼150 to ∼180 and extending to DP ∼400 were detected. The DP of this subpopulation is considerably greater than reported previously for N-CAM.

The post-translational polysialylation of N-CAM decreases N-CAM-dependent cell adhesion and migration, and in this sense, polySia functions as an antiadhesive glycotope. With the exception of polySia-N-CAM expression during neural development, the biological function of polysialylation in eukaryotes remains largely unknown (3.Troy F.A. Rosenberg A.

These transferases are usually expressed at high levels in embryonic tissues, principally brain and kidney, and at lower levels in adult tissues. An important exception to this paradigm is the persistent level of expression in regions of the brain showing neural plasticity, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, dentate gyrus, and olfactory bulb (22.Suzuki M.

Although chicken and mouse N-CAM both have six potential N-glycosylation sites, only two of the three sites in the fifth Ig-like domain appear to be polysialylated (23.Close B.E. Mendiratta S.S.

This is an important finding, because it shows that more than one glycan chain can be polysialylated, which is in contrast to the popular schematic diagrams often depicting polySia on N-CAM as a single, long chain (18.Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36.Angata K. Fukuda M.

It has been postulated, but not proven, that the DP of polySia on N-CAM may be a critically important structural feature regulating N-CAM function by influencing cell-cell, cell-substratum and polySiaantipolySia antibody interactions (32.Acheson A. Sunshine J.L. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 35.Seidenfaden R. Krauter A. Schertzinger F. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hildebrandt H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31863-31870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a paucity of information about how the DP may change during neuronal development in those regions of the brain showing neural plasticity or in human cancer cells expressing polysialylated N-CAM. To ultimately understand the relationship of DP to biological function, it is imperative that we be able to accurately determine the DP and to determine how this changes during N-CAM-mediated processes. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to develop new methods to accurately determine the full length of polySia chains on N-CAM and not simply to determine the DP of the major subset of chains that have already undergone some acid hydrolysis during fluorescent derivatization (43.Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31863-31870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 49.Inoue S. Lin S.L. Lee Y.C. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a new strategy to determine the DP of polySia on N-CAM without first subjecting the chains to acid hydrolysis before high resolution HPLC profiling. Materials—A full-length construct of STX (pcDNA3.1-STXfV5His), a soluble form of (pcDNA3.1-STXsV5His) fused with either V5 and His6 epitope tags at the C terminus and a soluble FcN-CAM (mouse homologue) were kindly provided by Dr. K. J. Colley (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL). The soluble mouse homologue of FcN-CAM was originally developed by Dr. Genevieve Rougon (Marseille, France). Anti-polySia antibody (12F8) was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). 2-Aminoacridon (AMAC), 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), and 3′- or 6′-sialyllactose were purchased from Sigma. Endo-β-galactosidase (Endo-β-Galase) from Escherichia freundii was purchased from V-LABS, Inc. (Covington, LA). The DNAPac PA-100 anion exchange column was purchased from Dionex Corp. (Sunnyvale, CA). The TSK-gel ODS-120T reverse phase column was purchased from Tosho (Tokyo, Japan). Colominic acid was purchased from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Construction of an Expression Plasmid of a Soluble Construct of STX with N-terminal V5 and His Tags—A DNA fragment encoding for a truncated form of STX and lacking the 46-amino acid sequence at the N terminus was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3.1-STXfV5His as a template and the following primers: 5′-GCGATATCGGCCCTCGAGAGCTTACATAGCAAATCTAA-3′ and 5′-TTTCTAGACTACGTGGCCCCATCGCACTGGC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The inserted fragment was removed by digestion with XbaI and EcoRV, and ligated into pcDNA3.1-STXsV5His through the same site (pcDNA3.1-STXs). The DNA fragment coding for V5 and His6 epitope tags was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3.1 plasmid as a template and the following primers: 5′-TGGATATCATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCC-3′ and 5′TGCTCGAGATGGTGATGGTGATGATGAC-3′. The DNA fragment coding V5 and His6 epitope tags subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector was removed by digestion with XhoI and EcoRV and ligated into pcDNA3.1-STXs through the same site (pcDNA3.1-V5HisSTXs). Expression and Purification of the Soluble Form of STX—The soluble form of STX, designated STX(s), was prepared by transfection of the expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1-V5HisSTXs, into COS7 cells. Transfection was carried out according to Qiagen protocol for Superfect. After 24–36 h, the culture medium containing the secreted enzyme was collected. The enzyme was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) as follows. To 10 ml of culture medium containing STX(s) were added 50 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads were washed with 5 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. After sequentially washing with 3 volumes each of 10, 30, and 60 mm imidazole, STX(s) was eluted with 3 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The 200 mm imidazole fraction was concentrated, and the buffer was changed to 50 mm MES (pH 6.1) containing 10% glycerol using a YM-30 Millipore filter. SDS-PAGE/silver stain and Western blotting with an anti-V5 mAb was used to analyze STX during the purification procedure. Purification of FcN-CAM—The cell culture medium of COS7 cells transfected with the FcN-CAM expression plasmid was applied to a Protein A-Sepharose column (1 ml, 1.5 × 0.6 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl. Proteins bound to Protein A-Sepharose were eluted with 6 ml of ImmunoPure Gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce). The eluate was collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10K dialysis cassette (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and concentrated using a YM-50 Millipore filter. SDS-PAGE and Comassie Blue staining were used to determine the purity of the FcN-CAM. Construction of Full-length PST Form with V5 and His6 Tags at the N Terminus—A DNA fragment encoding for full-length form of PST was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3.1-PSTfV5His as a template and the following primers: 5′-TAGATATCGGCCCTCGAGATGCGCTCCATTAGGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTAGATTATTGCTTTACACACTTTCCTG-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The inserted fragment was removed by digestion with XbaI and EcoRV and ligated into pcDNA3.1-PSTfV5His through the same site (pcDNA3.1-PSTf). The DNA fragment coding for V5 and His6 epitope tags was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3.1 plasmid as a template and the following primers: 5′-TGGATATCATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCC-3′ and 5′-TGCTCGAGATGGTGATGGTGATGATGAC-3′. The DNA fragment coding V5 and His6 epitope tags subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector was removed by digestion with XhoI and EcoRV and ligated into pcDNA3.1-PSTf through the same site (pcDNA3.1-V5HisPSTf). Reconstituted in Vitro PolyST Assay—Incorporation of Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac into FcN-CAM as the exogenous acceptor substrate was carried out by a modification of the polyST assay developed earlier in our laboratory (29.Sevigny M.B. Ye J. Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Troy F.A.II Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All incubation mixtures contained 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.1), 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CMP-Neu5Ac, purified FcN-CAM (0.6 μg of protein), and STX(s) (3 μg of protein) in a total volume of 15 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, polysialylation of N-CAM was qualitatively assessed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis both before and after treatment with endo-N-acylneuraminidase (Endo-N) or Endo-β-Galase using either anti-polySia or anti-N-CAM mAbs. A portion of the incubation mixture was also subjected to DP analysis, as described below. In contrast to the polyST activity in embryonic chick brain membranes, STX activity in the reconstituted assay was not influenced by dithiothreitol. Determination of the DP of PolySia: Release of the PolySia Chains from FcN-CAM by Endo-β-Galase—To determine the DP of the polySia chains synthesized by the polySTs on FcN-CAM in the reconstituted in vitro assay, the polysialylated N-CAM product described above was first purified by adsorption onto Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 μl of beads were incubated with 0.4 units of Endo-β-Galase in 40 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.9, containing 0.5% CHAPS at 37 °C for 12 h. An identical incubation mixture without Endo-β-Galase was included as a control. After incubation, the beads were sedimented by centrifugation (15,000 × g/∼30 s), washed with distilled water, and the supernatant fractions were combined. The supernatant fractions containing the polySia chains released by Endo-β-Galase were subjected to high resolution separation on a HPLC anion exchange column, as described below. The amount of Sia in each fraction was then quantitatively determined using the DMB method (50.Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 51.Hara S. Yamaguchi M. Takemori Y. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 377: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The washed beads were also subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis and blotted using the anti-polySia antibody, 12F8. When compared with the minus enzyme control, this provided an independent assessment of the efficacy of Endo-β-Galase release of the polySia chains from FcN-CAM. The reaction conditions developed here did not result in hydrolysis of the internal α2,8-sialyl linkages, as assessed by a second control incubation mixture wherein an authentic sialyloligomer of DP 15 was incubated under identical conditions (see “Results”). We also discovered that inclusion of the CHAPS detergent in the incubation mixture was essential for the Endo-β-Galase-catalyzed release of polySia chains from embryonic chick brain membranes. These chains were more resistant to release by Endo-β-Galase than those synthesized in vitro. CHAPS had only a modest effect on release of polySia from the polysialylated FcN-CAM. This finding suggests that there may be some structural (e.g. sulfated GlcNAc residues) and/or conformational differences between the two different forms of polysialylated N-CAM. Identification of Galactose as the 2-Aminoacridon (AMAC) Derivative in the PolySia Chains (DP 120–130) Released from N-CAM by Endo-β-Galase—PolySia chains released from the N-linked glycans on N-CAM by Endo-β-Galase would be expected to have a galactosyl residue at their reducing termini (Fig. 1). To verify the presence of Gal, polySia chains that eluted from the HPLC column with a DP 120–130 were isolated, hydrolyzed in 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 30 min and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Derivatization with AMAC was carried out by a modification of a previously described procedure (52.Lehrman M.A. Gao N. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dried samples were resuspended in 10 μl of distilled water to which was added an equal volum"

Thermodynamic analysis predicts that partial GSH depletion will cause an oxidative shift in the thiol redox potential. To investigate the acute bioenergetic consequences, neurons were exposed to monochlorobimane (mBCl), which depletes GSH by forming a fluorescent conjugate. Neurons transfected with redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein showed a positive shift in thiol redox potential synchronous with the formation of the conjugate. Mitochondria within neurons treated with mBCl for 1 h failed to hyperpolarize upon addition of oligomycin to inhibit their ATP synthesis. A decreased ATP turnover was confirmed by monitoring neuronal oxygen consumption in parallel with mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and GSH-mBCl formation. mBCl progressively decreased cell respiration, with no effect on mitochondrial proton leak or maximal respiratory capacity, suggesting adequate glycolysis and a functional electron transport chain. This approach to “state 4” could be mimicked by the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor bongkrekic acid, which did not further decrease respiration when administered after mBCl. The cellular ATP/ADP ratio was decreased by mBCl, and consistent with mitochondrial ATP export failure, respiration could not respond to an increased cytoplasmic ATP demand by plasma membrane Na+ cycling; instead, mitochondria depolarized. More prolonged mBCl exposure induced mitochondrial failure, with Δψm collapse followed by cytoplasmic Ca2+ deregulation. The initial bioenergetic consequence of neuronal GSH depletion in this model is thus an inhibition of ATP export, which precedes other forms of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Together with the overactivation of glutamate receptors (excitotoxicity), oxidative stress is a result of the bioenergetic crisis that characterizes ischemia and plays a central role in the pathophysiology of the consequent neuronal damage (3.Fiskum G. Rosenthal R.E. Vereczki V. Martin E. Hoffman G.E. Chinopoulos C. Kowaltowski A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage and can be strongly sensitized to other injurious stimuli by levels of oxidative stress that are nontoxic per se (4.Arundine M. Aarts M. Lau A. Tymianski M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8106-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ca2+ homeostasis is lost more quickly in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) 2The abbreviations used are: CGNs, cerebellar granule neurons; PTP, permeability transition pore; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; mBCl, monochlorobimane; GST, glutathione S-transferase; [Ca2+]c, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; TMRM+, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; roGFP2, redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein-2; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone.2The abbreviations used are: CGNs, cerebellar granule neurons; PTP, permeability transition pore; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; mBCl, monochlorobimane; GST, glutathione S-transferase; [Ca2+]c, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; TMRM+, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; roGFP2, redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein-2; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone., which show higher superoxide levels prior to the application of toxic concentrations of glutamate (5.Vesce S. Kirk L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tripeptide glutathione is a key antioxidant that maintains protein thiols in a reduced state and scavenges H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase (6.Dringen R. Kussmaul L. Gutterer J.M. Hirrlinger J. Hamprecht B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7.Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). In vivo, mitochondrial glutathione is partially lost during ischemia (8.Anderson M.F. Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and its supplementation in the form of glutathione ethyl ester can reduce the infarct size (9.Anderson M.F. Nilsson M. Eriksson P.S. Sims N.R. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 354: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although mitochondria within cells deprived of GSH can eventually release cytochrome c and undergo opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) (10.Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Fanelli C. Rotilio G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50420-50428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the initial bioenergetic consequences of GSH depletion remain unclear. Thermodynamic and kinetic factors predict that the steady-state thiol redox potential will be very sensitive to changes in total glutathione pool size (7.Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar, 13.Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This may lead to the oxidative damage of key mitochondrial proteins. Indeed, either an inhibitor of GSH synthesis or the direct removal of reduced GSH with ethacrynic acid causes the inactivation of complexes I (14.Hsu M. Srinivas B. Kumar J. Subramanian R. Andersen J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and II/III and IV (15.Heales S.J. Davies S.E. Bates T.E. Clark J.B. Neurochem.

Lett. 1999; 264: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that becomes apparent several hours from the beginning of treatment. An intriguing target for thiol oxidation is represented by the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), which functions as a dimer and can be progressively inhibited as the intermolecular oxidation of thiol groups increases (17.Majima E. Ikawa K. Takeda M. Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29548-29554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This loss of ADP/ATP exchange activity precedes the formation of intramolecular cross-linking, which seems to require stronger oxidative conditions and may be related to mitochondrial PTP opening (18.Costantini P. Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L. Larochette N. de Pablo M.A. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19.McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this study, we rapidly depleted neuronal glutathione by conjugation with monochlorobimane (mBCl), a glutathione S-transferase (GST) substrate that is extensively used to assay glutathione pools (20.Barhoumi R. Bailey R.H. Burghardt R.C. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21.Kamencic H. Lyon A. Paterson P.G. Juurlink B.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286 (H. J.): 35-37BCrossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The intracellular thiol redox potential was detected with a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein variant (22.Dooley C.M. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22284-22293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), whereas population cell respiratory rates were monitored in parallel with cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) (23.Jekabsons M.B. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32989-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), allowing glutathione depletion to be correlated with a rapid inhibition of ATP turnover that became evident within the first hour of treatment. The data suggest that a restriction of mitochondrial ATP export to the cytoplasm, consistent with ANT inhibition, is the first event occurring in this model of GSH depletion. Reagents—Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM+), Fluo-4FF, Fluo-5F, and mBCl were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein-2 (roGFP2) cDNA was a kind gift of S. James Remington (University of Oregon, Eugene). Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. All other reagents were from Sigma. Preparation of CGNs—CGNs were prepared from 7-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (24.Courtney M.J. Lambert J.J. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3873-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications. Cells were plated onto Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglasses at a density of 380,000 cells/well or onto 22 × 40-mm coverslips at a density of 3 × 106 cells/coverslip. Coverslips had previously been coated with 33 μg/ml polyethyleneimine. Cultures were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 mm glucose, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 24 h after plating, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to inhibit growth of non-neuronal cells. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air and used for experiments at 7-9 days in vitro. Experimental Buffers—Standard “high KCl” buffer consisted of 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 20 mm TES, 15 mm glucose, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, and 0.2 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.3) at 37 °C. Some experiments were conducted in “low KCl” buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 20 mm TES, 15 mm glucose, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.3) at 37 °C. Functional Confocal Microscopy—Imaging of single neurons plated onto Lab-Tek 8-well chambered coverglasses was performed in a Pascal confocal system (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) using an Axio-vert 100M inverted microscope with a ×20 air objective and argon (488 nm) and helium/neon (543 nm) lasers. Control and experimental wells were imaged in parallel using a computer-controlled motorized stage and Physiology software, which allows parallel or sequential acquisition of time courses. For simultaneous detection of [Ca2+]c and Δψm (see Fig. 7), neurons were loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4FF (0.5 μm; as acetoxymethyl ester; Ca2+ Kd = 9.7 μm) and TMRM+ (5 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C. This concentration of TMRM+ was insufficient for aggregation in the matrix (i.e. the experiment was performed in “non-quench mode”) (25.Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), meaning that a decrease in either the plasma membrane or mitochondrial membrane potential was reflected in a reduction in whole cell fluorescence. In experiments in which [Ca2+]c transients following KCl-induced plasma membrane depolarization were detected, neurons were loaded with 0.5 μm Fluo-5F (Ca2+ Kd = 2.3 μm). Fluo-4FF and Fluo-5F were excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected between 505 and 530 nm. TMRM+ was excited at 543 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was collected between 560 and 615 nm. Under both conditions, TMRM+ was always present in the buffer throughout the experiment (25.Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Respirometer—Respiration of intact neurons in situ was measured as described previously (23.Jekabsons M.B. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32989-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A 22 × 40-mm glass coverslip with attached cells was assembled in a closed RC-30 imaging chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and then mounted on an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with ×20 and ×40 objectives. A miniature polarographic Clark-type oxygen electrode for perfusion systems with 116-inch fittings (Microelectrodes Inc., Bedford, NH) was used to monitor the oxygen tension in the eluted buffer. The flow rate was typically kept at 40-60 μl/min to provide sufficient oxygen depletion for detection. In experiments in which brevetoxin was employed, the buffer was also supplemented with 1 μm MK-801 to ensure that the results observed did not originate from the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. 3 nm TMRM+ was present in the buffer (non-quench mode conditions). A chart recorder was wired to an OM-4 oxygen meter (Microelectrodes, Inc.) to provide a continuous trace of the oxygen depletion (and hence respiration) of the cells. The microscope was equipped with a CoolSNAPHQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and MetaFluor and MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). TMRM+ and mBCl were excited via S555/20x and D380/13x filters, respectively (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). The emission from both fluorophores was collected through a 73101 dual band emission filter. roGFP2 was excited via a D480/30x filter, and the emission was collected through the 73101 filter. Transfection of roGFP2—Cultured neurons were transfected following a published protocol (26.Dalby B. Cates S. Harris A. Ohki E.C. Tilkins M.L. Price P.J. Ciccarone V.C. Methods. 2004; 33: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), with modifications. On day 0, following attachment to their coverslips, CGNs were transferred to culture medium without penicillin and streptomycin and incubated with 0.8 μg of roGFP2 cDNA and the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000. After 2 h, neurons were returned to the usual culture medium and used for experiments after day 6. Monitoring Δψm with Rhodamine 123—Rhodamine 123 in quench mode is the most sensitive means of detecting small changes in Δψm (25.Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were incubated in low KCl buffer and exposed to 2.2 μm rhodamine 123 for 15 min at 37 °C (to attain quench mode conditions). Cells were then rinsed with fresh buffer and imaged with the Olympus IX81 microscope. Rhodamine 123 was excited via a D480/20x filter, and the emitted fluorescence was collected through a 51000m filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Given the relatively low membrane permeability, rhodamine 123 leaks out of the cells very slowly and therefore was not present in the media during the experiments. Determination of ATP/ADP Ratios—Total cellular ATP/ADP ratios were determined using a luciferase chemiluminescence assay (Calbiochem). Cells were incubated in low KCl buffer under the relevant conditions and lysed, and extracts were assayed for ATP according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pyruvate kinase (2 units/assay) was added to the buffer supplied with the kit. The increase in chemiluminescence was recorded in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunny-vale, CA). Once the ATP signal was detected, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate was added, and the further increase in chemiluminescence due to the conversion of ADP to ATP was determined. Immunocytochemistry—Neurons plated onto Lab-Tek 4-well chambered slides were washed with 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. A purified mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) that recognizes the native form of cytochrome c (1:100 dilution) was added to the coverslips (overnight, 4 °C). The cells were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with TOTO-3 before mounting the slides on ProLong Gold medium (both reagents from Molecular Probes). The samples were imaged with a Nikon PCM 2000 confocal system equipped with argon (488 nm) and helium/neon (633 nm) lasers. Statistical Analysis—All data analyzed were collected from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as means ± S.E. Data from two populations were compared with the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test was used in the analysis of three or more experimental groups. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Conjugation of Endogenous GSH with mBCl Oxidizes the Thiol Redox Potential—mBCl becomes fluorescent when conjugated to GSH by intracellular GST. The reaction is highly selective for glutathione over other intracellular thiols (27.Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), but is not a good indicator of subcellular distribution because GSTs are present in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion (28.Raza H. Robin M.A. Fang J.K. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the probe eventually accumulates in the nucleus (Fig. 1) (29.Keelan J. Allen N.J. Antcliffe D. Pal S. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Another substrate for GST, ethacrynic acid, has been frequently used to deplete cells of GSH (16.Seyfried J. Soldner F. Schulz J.B. Klockgether T. Kovar K.A. Wüllner U. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 264: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30.Muyderman H. Nilsson M. Sims N.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8019-8028Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, ethacrynic acid also directly inhibits mitochondrial complex II (31.Manuel M.A. Weiner M.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976; 198: 209-221PubMed Google Scholar) and, in our hands, caused a partial drop in Δψm when added to CGNs. An additional advantage of mBCl is that the reaction course can be followed by the development of fluorescence, as mBCl depletes GSH by forming the adduct GSH-mBCl (Fig. 1A), with the reaction usually reaching completion within 60 min. A major advance in the ability to monitor thiol redox potentials has come as a result of the development of roGFP analogs by substituting surface-exposed residues of the chromophore with cysteines (22.Dooley C.M. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22284-22293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Notably, an analog of roGFP2 (redox-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein) expressed in the cytoplasm of yeast cells appears to directly equilibrate with the cytoplasmic glutathione couple (32.Ostergaard H. Tachibana C. Winther J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although the redox state of roGFPs can be monitored ratiometrically by excitation at 400/480 nm (22.Dooley C.M. Dore T.M. Hanson G.T. Jackson W.C. Remington S.J. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22284-22293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), the presence of the mBCl adduct interferes with the emission from 400 nm excitation, and so only 480 nm excitation was employed. When excited at 480 nm, oxidation of roGFP2 will result in a lower fluorescence emission, whereas its reduction will cause fluorescence enhancement. The validity and sensitivity of the construct in CGNs were established by applying 500 μm H2O2 to elicit exogenous oxidative stress. The treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in roGFP2 emission (Fig. 1B) that was reversed by the thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol. The endogenous oxidative stress induced by 100 μm mBCl caused a slower but equally extensive oxidation of roGFP2 that was reversed by dithiothreitol, confirming the ability of GSH depletion to cause an oxidative intracellular thiol redox potential shift. Depletion of GSH Affects Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis—Because the active synthesis of ATP by the mitochondrial ATP synthase slightly decreases Δψm by utilizing the proton current, it follows that addition of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin will acutely hyperpolarize the mitochondria. Conversely, mitochondria that have inhibited respiratory chains or that have leaky inner membranes can reverse the ATP synthase to maintain a suboptimal Δψm by utilizing glycolytic ATP. In this case, oligomycin will depolarize the inner membrane. This “oligomycin null point” assay (33.Rego A.C. Vesce S. Nicholls D.G. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34.Rego A.C. Ward M.W. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can therefore be used to investigate the bioenergetic status of the mitochondrial population within a single cell body. Fig. 2A (panels i-iii) shows responses of representative neurons whose Δψm hyperpolarized, was unchanged, or depolarized in response to the inhibitor, respectively. Because rhodamine 123 is in “quench mode,” hyperpolarization will cause further sequestration and quenching of the dye inside the matrix and decrease the whole cell fluorescence. The final addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) to totally release the dye into the cytoplasm confirms that the experiment is performed under quench mode conditions. As expected, oligomycin decreased the fluorescence in a majority of control neurons (53%) (Fig. 2A, panel i). By contrast, the large majority of mBCl-treated cells (83%) did not undergo a detectable change in fluorescence following oligomycin addition, whereas 15% of the cells showed mitochondrial depolarization upon addition of oligomycin, indicating that, in some mitochondria, the membrane potential was sustained by the ATP synthase running in reverse. The unchanged rhodamine 123 fluorescence observed in most mBCl-treated cells upon oligomycin addition suggests that the mitochondria are close to respiratory state 4 (35.Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 3. Academic Press Ltd., London2002Google Scholar), i.e. with little ATP turnover. This could be due either to a decreased cellular ATP demand or to an inhibition of the generation or export of ATP from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm. The former would result in an increased total cellular ATP/ADP ratio, whereas the latter would decrease the ratio. A 75-min exposure to mBCl caused a significant decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio compared with control cells (2.76 ± 0.29 versus 4.83 ± 0.36) (Fig. 2B). This decrease was similar to that induced by oligomycin (2.54 ± 0.18). ATP synthase reversal induced by the inhibition of complex I with rotenone and by the protonophore FCCP caused a greater reduction in the ATP/ADP ratio (to 1.9 ± 0.16 and 1.2 ± 0.23, respectively). The decreased ratio is thus consistent with inhibited generation or export of ATP from the matrix. Mitochondria in CGNs Exposed to mBCl Approach State 4—To confirm and quantify the above observations, the O2 consumption of intact neurons attached to their coverslips was determined (Fig. 3) with a cell respirometer assembly as described previously (23.Jekabsons M.B. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32989-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were either perfused with standard high KCl buffer + 0.1% Me2SO (control) until mitochondrial inhibitors were added or switched to buffer additionally containing 100 μm mBCl after basal respiration was assessed. Rates of respiration were calculated from the perfusion rate times the difference between the downstream oxygen tension during chamber perfusion and that recorded when the chamber was bypassed with a shunt. The basal respiration of control neurons was stable until oligomycin-containing medium was perfused. The inhibitor decreased respiration to 44 ± 6% of the basal level, the residual value reflecting the inherent proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 3A). Thus, almost half of the basal respiration was used to compensate for the endogenous mitochondrial proton leak, whereas the remainder reflected basal ATP turnover. The effect of 100 μm mBCl was to initiate within 15 min a slowing of the basal respiration that progressed as GSH was conjugated to mBCl over a 60-min period (Fig. 3B). At that point, ATP turnover in the cells (calculated as the oligomycin-sensitive component of respiration) had decreased to <50% of that in control cells. Notably, mBCl caused no significant change in state 4 respiration (following oligomycin addition); thus, there was no uncoupling or permeability transition induction following 60 min of mBCl exposure, and the decrease in total respiration could be ascribed to an inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. The respirometer also allows maximal respiratory capacity to be quantified. Following the addition of the protonophore FCCP, mBCl-exposed neurons increased their respiration to the same extent as control cells (203 ± 42% over the state 4 rate in control cells versus 180 ± 30% in mBCl-treated cells) (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that this acute GSH depletion did not detectably restrict substrate delivery or electron transfer activity. This contrasts with long-term partial glutathione depletion that manifests as an inhibition of complex I activity in PC12 cells (36.Jha N. Jurma O. Lalli G. Liu Y. Pettus E.H. Greenamyre J.T. Liu R.M. Forman H.J. Andersen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26096-26101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The respirometer was mounted on an epifluorescence microscope, which allows imaging of multiple fluorescence indicators at a single cell level (see “Materials and Methods”). Thus, when 100 μm mBCl was added, we could confirm that the fluorescence of the intracellular adduct GSH-mBCl reached a plateau within 1 h (see Fig. 1A). Also the fluorescence from cells equilibrated with 3 nm TMRM+ indicated that there was no detectable depolarization of either plasma or mitochondrial membrane potentials during this period (Fig. 4). Because respiratory capacity is not rate-limiting, the approach to state 4 following mBCl addition could be due to a decreased capacity for mitochondrial ATP synthesis (ATP synthase inhibition) or to inhibited export to the cytoplasm (ANT inhibition), whereas a decreased cellular ATP demand (e.g. inhibited ion pump activity) would be inconsistent with the decreased ATP/ADP ratio observed (Fig. 2B). Because of reports showing ANT sensitivity to thiol oxidation (18.Costantini P. Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L. Larochette N. de Pablo M.A. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19.McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a partial inhibition of this protein appears a plausible mechanism for the observed effects. In support of this view, incubation with the cell-permeant ANT inhibitor bongkrekic acid (10 μm) induced a decline in basal respiration; but, as with 60 min mBCl exposure, the approach to state 4 was incomplete, and an additional effect of oligomycin was apparent (Fig. 3C). If bongkrekic acid and mBCl were affecting cell respiration via alternative mechanisms, their combined effects should be additive and produce a greater decrease in respiration. To investigate this, we perfused cells with mBCl for 30 min, switched to buffer containing mBCl + bongkrekic acid for an additional 30 min, and then assessed the oligomycin-ins"
https://openalex.org/W2022930162,"The c-Myc oncoprotein is a general transcription factor whose target genes dictate the c-Myc phenotype. One such target of c-Myc, ‘onzin’, is normally expressed at high levels in myeloid cells and is dramatically downregulated in response to c-Myc overexpression. We show here that short hairpin interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous onzin results in a reduced growth rate and a proapoptotic phenotype. In contrast, onzin overexpression in fibroblasts is associated with an increased growth rate, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, loss of the G2/M checkpoint, and tumorigenic conversion. Onzin-overexpressing cells fail to induce p53 in response to apoptotic stimuli and contain higher levels of the active, phosphorylated forms of Akt1 and, more strikingly, of Mdm2. Using yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we show that onzin directly interacts with both proteins. Green fluorescent protein tagging also confirms directly that Akt1 and Mdm2 colocalize with onzin, although the precise subcellular distribution of each protein is dependent on its relative abundance. Collectively, our results identify onzin as a novel regulator of several p53-dependent aspects of the c-Myc phenotype via its dramatic effect on Mdm2. This is reminiscent of the c-Myc → p19ARF--∣ Mdm2 pathway and might function as a complementary arm to ensure the proper cellular response to oncogenic and/or apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1993181949,"The regulation of the two isoforms of phospholipase C-γ, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2, by cell surface receptors involves protein tyrosine phosphorylation as well as interaction with adapter proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) generated by inositol phospholipid 3-kinases (PI3Ks). All three processes may lead to recruitment of the PLCγ isozymes to the plasma membrane and/or stimulation of their catalytic activity. Recent evidence suggests that PLCγ may also be regulated by Rho GTPases. In this study, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were reconstituted in intact cells and in a cell-free system with Rho GTPases to examine their influence on PLCγ activity. PLCγ2, but not PLCγ1, was markedly activated in intact cells by constitutively active Rac1G12V, Rac2G12V, and Rac3G12V but not by Cdc42G12V and RhoAG14V. The mechanism of PLCγ2 activation was apparently independent of phosphorylation of tyrosine residues known to be modified by PLCγ2-activating protein-tyrosine kinases. Activation of PLCγ2 by Rac2G12V in intact cells coincided with a translocation of PLCγ2 from the soluble to the particulate fraction. PLCγ isozyme-specific activation of PLCγ2 by Rac GTPases (Rac1 ≈ Rac2 > Rac3), but not by Cdc42 or RhoA, was also observed in a cell-free system. Herein, activation of wild-type Rac GTPases with guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate caused a marked stimulation of PLCγ2 but had no effect on the activity of PLCγ1. PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 have previously been shown to be indiscriminately activated by PtdInsP3in vitro. Thus, the results suggest a novel mechanism of PLCγ2 activation by Rac GTPases involving neither protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor PI3K-mediated generation of PtdInsP3. The regulation of the two isoforms of phospholipase C-γ, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2, by cell surface receptors involves protein tyrosine phosphorylation as well as interaction with adapter proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) generated by inositol phospholipid 3-kinases (PI3Ks). All three processes may lead to recruitment of the PLCγ isozymes to the plasma membrane and/or stimulation of their catalytic activity. Recent evidence suggests that PLCγ may also be regulated by Rho GTPases. In this study, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were reconstituted in intact cells and in a cell-free system with Rho GTPases to examine their influence on PLCγ activity.

These include enzymes, ion channels and transporters, transcription factors, scaffolding proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, as well as proteins involved in the regulation of exocytosis, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 5McLaughlin S.

The results presented herein demonstrate that PLCγ2, but not PLCγ1, is activated by Rac GTPases in both cellular and cell-free systems by a mechanism(s) that involves translocation of the cytosolic PLCγ2 isozyme to cellular membranes but is apparently independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and inositol phospholipid 3-kinase-mediated generation of PtdInsP3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polyclonal antisera reactive against human PLCγ2 (catalog numbers sc-9015 and sc-407), rat PLCδ1 (catalog number sc-7520), human Rac2 (catalog number sc-96), Gβ1–4 (catalog number sc-378), and RhoGDIα and -β (catalog number sc-359) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antisera reactive against bovine PLCβ1, human PLCβ2, human PLCβ3, and bovine PLCγ1 (37Carozzi A. Kriz R.W. Webster C. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were gifts of Dr. Peter J. Parker. The cDNA of human Rac3 inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) was obtained from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO).Plasmids—The cDNAs of human Cdc42, human RhoA (GenBank™ accession number X05026), human Rac1, human Rac2, human Rac3, bovine PLCβ1, human PLCβ2, and human PLCβ3 were ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) or pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen). The cDNAs of rat PLCδ1, bovine PLCγ1, and human PLCγ2 were obtained in pMT2 (38Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) from Dr. Matilda Katan. For production of recombinant baculoviruses, the cDNAs of bovine PLCγ1 and human PLCγ2 were ligated into the XbaI site of pVL1392. The cDNA of human Rac3 was ligated into the SmaI/XbaI site of pVL1393.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 41965-039) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, catalog number 10270-106) and 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 25 mm HEPES buffer solution (all from PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany). Prior to transfection, COS-7 or HEK293 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at densities of 1 × 105 and 2 × 105 cells per well, respectively, and grown for 24 h in 1 ml/well of the same medium. One hour before transfection, the medium was replaced with 1 ml/well of fresh medium. For transfection of COS-7 cells, plasmid DNA (1.0 μg DNA/well) was mixed with 2.0 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM® I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the addition of the DNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 complexes to the dishes, the cells were incubated for a further 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 without changing the medium. For transfection of HEK293 cells, the CalPhos™ mammalian transfection kit (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA (1.0 μg DNA/well) was mixed with 6.2 μl of 2 m calcium solution (BD Biosciences), 50 μl 2× HEPES-buffered saline (BD Biosciences), and sterile water to obtain a total volume of 100 μl. After the addition of the transfection solution to the dishes, the cells were incubated for 3.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with 1 ml/well of fresh medium, and the HEK293 cells were incubated for a further 20.5 h under the same conditions.Radiolabeling of Inositol Phospholipids and Analysis of Inositol Phosphate Formation—Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 or HEK293 cells were washed once with 0.5 ml/well of buffer A containing 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4, and then supplied with 0.4 ml/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal calf serum and supplements as specified above, 10 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (catalog number TRK317, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany), and 10 mm LiCl. The cells were incubated in this medium for 20 h, washed once with 0.4 ml/well of buffer A, and then lysed by addition of 0.2 ml/well of 10 mm ice-cold formic acid (39Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). After keeping the samples on ice for 30 min, 0.3 ml/well of 10 mm NH4OH was added for neutralization, and the sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a column containing 0.25 ml of Dowex® 1 × 8–200 ion exchange resin (catalog number 217425, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), that had been converted to the formate form and equilibrated with H2O as described (40Camps M. Hou C. Jakobs K.H. Gierschik P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The columns were washed twice with 3.5 ml each of 60 mm sodium formate and 5 mm sodium tetraborate, and inositol phosphates were eluted with 3 ml of 1 m ammonium formate and 100 mm formic acid. The eluate was supplemented with 15 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold™, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany), and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The columns were reused after regeneration as described previously (40Camps M. Hou C. Jakobs K.H. Gierschik P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Subcellular Fractionation—HEK293 cells (2.7 × 106) were grown on 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected as described above using the CalPhos™ mammalian transfection kit. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were scraped into 0.15 ml of ice-cold buffer B containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The cells were homogenized by forcing the suspension ten times through a 0.45 × 25-mm needle attached to a disposable syringe. After removal of unbroken cells and nuclei by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.Production of Recombinant Rho GTPases and Recombinant PLCγ Isozymes in Baculovirus-infected Insect Cells—For production of recombinant Rho GTPases, Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were grown at 27 °C in suspension culture in TNM-FH medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (catalog number P04–83500, PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) Pluronic® F-68 (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamicin (PAA Laboratories), and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone®, Invitrogen) in a 1800-ml Fernbach culture flask. Cells (1.2 × 109) were incubated at 27 °C with recombinant baculovirus in 400 ml of medium at 80 rpm on a rotary shaker with an amplitude of 25 mm. Three days after infection, the cells were harvested at room temperature by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min followed by two washes with 100 ml each of buffer A. To obtain detergent-solubilized Rho GTPases, the cells were resuspended in 15 ml per 109 intact cells at the time of cell harvesting of ice-cold buffer C containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 μm GDP and homogenized using a precooled 5-ml Teflon-glass homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was collected from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Rho GTPases were solubilized by resuspending the membranes in 2 ml per 109 intact cells at the time of cell harvesting of ice-cold buffer C containing 23 mm sodium cholate and incubating this mixture for 90 min at 4 °C with vigorous vortexing every 10 min. Insoluble material was removed from this suspension by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting detergent extract was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. For production of recombinant PLCγ isozymes, Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in adherent culture in TNM-FH medium (catalog number T3285, Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (catalog number F7524, Sigma) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cells (120 × 106) were incubated at 27 °C in 96 ml of medium. Three days after infection, the cells were detached from the plastic surface, harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice at room temperature with 32 ml each of buffer A, and then resuspended in 1.2 ml of ice-cold buffer B. The cells were homogenized by forcing the suspension six times through a 0.45 × 25-mm needle attached to a disposable syringe.

Treatment of macrophages with forskolin enhanced [3H]thymidine uptake and increased cell number, and both were profoundly reduced by prior treatment of cells with H-89, a specific PKA inhibitor. Incubation of macrophages with forskolin triggered the activation of Akt, predominantly by phosphorylation of Ser-473, as measured by Western blotting and assay of its kinase activity. Akt activation was significantly inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin, specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but not by H-89. Incubation of macrophages with forskolin also increased Epac1 and Rap1·GTP. Immunoprecipitation of Epac1 in forskolin-stimulated cells co-immunoprecipitated Rap1, p-AktThr-308, and p-AktSer-473. Silencing of CREB gene expression by RNA interference prior to forskolin treatment not only decreased CREB protein and its phosphorylation at Ser-133, but also phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, and Thr-308. Concomitantly, this treatment inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake and reduced forskolin-induced proliferation of macrophages. Forskolin treatment also inhibited activation of the apoptotic mechanism while promoting up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic pathway. We conclude that forskolin mediates cellular proliferation via cAMP-dependent activation of both PKA and Epac.

The PKA-dependent effects of cAMP on cell growth inhibition are mediated via activation of Rap1, which binds Raf1 and prevents its activation by Ras and thus inhibits ERK activation. In cells, where cAMP stimulates cell proliferation it activates Rap1, which in turn activates B-Raf (5.Stork P.J. Trends Biochem. Sc. 2003; 28: 267-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This action of cAMP is independent of Ras and provides a pathway for ERK activation. Rap1 is activated rapidly in response to a variety of extracellular and intracellular second messengers, which in certain cases directly bind and activate specific Rap1/GEFs, which include C3G, cAMPGEFs, Cal-DAGGEF, and PDZGEF (3.Tasken L.

Cell-cell interactions are often accompanied by cell spreading that increases the surface contact area between the cells. cAMP induces integrin-mediated cell adhesion through Epac1-Rap1 signaling pathway. In this study, we have examined the effect of elevating intracellular cAMP levels on primary macrophage proliferation by both Epac-1-Rap1 and PKA-CREB signaling pathways. In these studies, we have used forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator and a prototype for elevating cAMP levels, for raising intracellular cAMP levels. We show here that in murine peritoneal macrophages, both these pathways regulate forskolin-induced DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. Furthermore, studies employing the silencing of CREB gene expression indicate that both these pathways exhibit cross-talk at the level of Akt activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Culture media were purchased from Invitrogen.

Here, we report that VDUP1 expression is significantly increased in rat hearts following acute myocardial ischemia, suggesting it may have important regulatory effects on cardiac physiological processes during periods of oxidative stress. Transfection of H9C2 cardiomyoblasts with a sequence-specific VDUP1 DNA enzyme to down-regulate VDUP1 mRNA expression significantly reduced apoptosis and enhanced cell survival under conditions of H2O2 stress, and these effects involved inhibition of ASK1 activity. Direct intracardiac injection of the DNA enzyme at the time of acute myocardial infarction reduced myocardial VDUP1 mRNA expression and resulted in prolonged reduction in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ASK1 activity. Moreover, down-regulation of VDUP1 was accompanied by significant reduction in cardiac expression of pro-collagen type I α2 mRNA level, as well as marked reduction in myocardial scar formation. These features were accompanied by significant improvement in cardiac function. Together, these results suggest a direct role for VDUP1 in the adverse effects of ischemia and oxidative stress on cardiomyocyte survival, left ventricular collagen deposition, and cardiac function. Strategies to inhibit VDUP1 expression and/or function during acute ischemic events may be beneficial to cardiac functional recovery and prevention of left ventricular remodeling.

The disulfide reductase Trx is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed small protein that participates widely in thiol-dependent cellular reductive processes, including signal transduction and regulation of the activity of transcription factors such as TFIIIC, NF-κB, and glucocorticoid receptors (3Cromlish J.A.

In addition to its direct effects on electron transfer, Trx functions to maintain intracellular redox homeostasis through its action as a physiological inhibitor of the apoptosis signal-regulated kinase-1 (ASK1), a pivotal component in cellular apoptotic responses to cytokine- and stress-induced signals (6Saitoh M.

Trx directly binds to ASK1, inducing its ubiquitination and degradation and resulting in inhibition of cellular apoptosis (9Liu Y. Min W. Circ.

These intrinsic properties of Trx are of central importance to the maintenance of healthy mammalian tissue function, including the cardiovascular system (10Shioji K. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yodoi J.

This protein, also termed “vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1” (VDUP1) because of its induction in HL-60 cells differentiated by vitamin D3 (12Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Recent in vitro studies have shown that VDUP1 overexpression results in inhibition of proliferation of several cell types, including induction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis (16Wang Y. De Keulenaer G.W. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26496-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although deficits in antioxidants and increased oxidative stress accompanying myocardial infarction have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of post-infarct heart failure, a possible role for VDUP1 in the adverse outcomes accompanying myocardial ischemia has not yet been investigated.To develop a clinically relevant approach to inhibit VDUP1 expression, we focused on the use of a new generation of catalytic nucleic acids containing DNA molecules with catalytic activity for specific RNA sequences (19Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 20Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13330-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These DNA enzymes exhibit greater catalytic efficiency than hammerhead ribozymes, offer greater substrate specificity, are more resistant to chemical and enzymatic degradation, and are far cheaper to synthesize. Using a sequence-specific DNA enzyme to down-regulate VDUP1 mRNA in vitro and in vivo, we evaluated the role of VDUP1 in cardiomyocyte survival, cardiac functional recovery, and myocardial remodeling after oxidative stress and acute myocardial ischemia. Our data demonstrate that VDUP1 is a critical mediator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial scar formation after oxidative stress and acute ischemia and suggest that therapeutic approaches to reduce myocardial VDUP1 expression may be of benefit in inducing cardiac functional recovery and preventing adverse myocardial remodeling after acute ischemia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Subtractive Hybridization—This technique enabled comparison of the pattern of gene expression between hearts from normal rats and rats who underwent left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation 48 h earlier. Briefly, messenger RNA was isolated from each heart, and 1 μg was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis with random primers. The subtractive hybridization was performed with the PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech), following the manufacturer's recommendations. After second strand synthesis, the two cDNA libraries were digested with RsaI. Digestion products of the “tester” library were ligated to a specific adapter (T7 promoter), then hybridized with a 30-fold excess of the “driver” library for subtraction. After hybridization, the remaining products were further amplified by PCR. In the forward subtraction, which determines the genes that are overexpressed in the ischemic sample, the ischemic tissue is the tester and the normal tissue is the driver. In the reverse subtraction, the tester and the driver are switched to determine the genes that are down-regulated in the ischemic sample.DNA Enzyme Synthesis and in Vitro Cleavage—DNA enzymes with inverted thymidine (leading to a 3′-3′ linkage) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and purified by RNase-free high-performance liquid chromatography.

After further culture for 20 h, cells were stimulated with different concentrations of H2O2. For the apoptotic assay, cells were subsequently lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science, cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) according to the instruction manual of the company, and 20 μl of lysate supernatant was used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reaction to measure A405 nm to A490 nm. For survival assay, after completion of stimulation, cells were cultured in 100 μl of medium for an addition 4 h and then 20 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (catalog no. G3582, Promega) was added to each well. Two hours later, the absorbance values at 490 nm were measured.ASK1 Kinase Activity Assay—At 70% confluence, rat fetal H9C2 cardiomyocytes seeded in 100-mm dishes were transfected for 4 h with transfection solution containing 1 μm VDUP1 DNA enzyme or scrambled DNA enzyme and 8 μl/ml SuperFect. After removal of transfection solution, cells were cultured for another 4 h in normal medium and then stimulated for 20 h by 37.50 μm H2O2. 24 h after completion of transfection, cells were lysed on ice in 0.6 ml of 1× ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and underwent brief sonication.

To measure kinase activity, the bead pellet was suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer, and 1 μg of myelin basic protein (1 μg/μl) and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl) were added. After the kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), and the phosphorylated myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography and analyzed by an image analyzer.Thioredoxin-reducing Activity Assay (Insulin-reducing Assay)—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus protein inhibitors). Cell extracts (20 μg) were preincubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 2 μl of dithiothreitol activation buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 70 μl to reduce Trx, then 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 200 μl of 1 m HEPES (pH 7.6), 40 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, 40 μl of NADPH (40 mg/ml), and 500 μl of insulin (10 mg/ml) was added. The reaction began with the addition of 10 μl of rat Trx reductase (400 μg/360 μl, specific activity of 12.5 units/mg, American Diagnostics), and incubation continued for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml 6 m guanidine-HCl and 1 mm 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl disulfide (Sigma). The absorbance at 412 nm was measured.Animals, Surgical Procedures, and DNA Enzyme Administration—Rowett (rnu/rnu) athymic nude rats (body weight of 220-250 g, Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were used in studies approved by the Columbia University Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (4 mg/ml and 10 μl/g of body weight). A midline cervical skin incision was made along with reflection of the muscles overlying the trachea. Room air was provided through the endotracheal tube connected to a rodent ventilator (Harvard, South Natick, MA). Normal chest expansion was noted similar to that found in conscious rats. The heart was exposed through the left thoracotomy incision. The left auricle was slightly retracted exposing the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, which was ligated with a 7-0 silk suture 1-3 mm from tip of the normally positioned left auricle. Following LAD ligation or sham procedure, rats were divided into groups that received three intracardiac injections of E4 DNA enzyme (200 μm, 50 μm, 10 μm), three intracardiac injections of E0 scrambled control, or three intracardiac injections of saline. Each group consisted of 6-8 rats. The baseline echo prior to heart attack and echo at 48 h following heart attack were measured, but all animals for histological and echo analysis were excluded if they did not survive beyond the 48-h baseline assessment.In Situ Hybridization—VDUP1 mRNA in paraffin-embedded heart sections was detected by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled antisense probe and visualized as blue by combination of NBT/BCIP and alkaline phosphatase. The hybridization procedure follows the manual of universal RISH &AP Detection kit (catalog no. HKD30, Zymed Laboratories, CA) except for the following modifications: hybridization for 30 h at 37 °C and antibody incubation for 12 h at 37 °C. The digoxigenin end-labeled antisense probe was 5′-gagcactttggtctggccattggcaaggtaagtgtgccgggccaca-3′, and control digoxigenin sense probe was 5′-tgtggcccggcacacttaccttgccaatggccagaccaaagtgctc-3′ (synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies).Quantitation of Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis—For in situ detection of apoptosis at the single cell level we used the TUNEL method of DNA end-labeling mediated by deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (Roche Applied Science). Rat myocardial tissue sections were obtained from LAD-ligated rats at 2 weeks after injection of either saline or DNA enzymes, and from healthy rats as negative controls. The TUNEL stain was visualized with a substrate system in which nuclei with DNA fragmentation stained blue (BCIP/NBT substrate system, DAKO, Carpentaria, CA). To determine the proportion of blue-staining apoptotic nuclei within myocytes, tissue was counterstained with a monoclonal antibody specific for Troponin I (Sigma) and avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The myocytes were visualized brown following exposure in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride solution mixture (Sigma). Tissue sections were examined microscopically at 40× magnification, and at least 100 cells were counted in a minimum of 8 high power fields.Immunohistochemical Staining of ASK1 and Phospho-ASK1—Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Histostain-SP kit (catalog no. 95-9551, Zymed Laboratories, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The slides were incubated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-rat ASK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-Phospho-ASK1 at Thr-845 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) overnight at 4 °C. ASK1 and Phospho-ASK1 positively staining cells are visualized as brown and sections counterstained in hematoxylin solution.Histology and Measurement of Infarct Size—Following excision at 2 weeks, left ventricles from each experimental animal were sliced at 10-15 transverse sections from apex to base. Representative sections were fixed in formalin and stained for routine histology to determine cellularity of the myocardium, expressed as cell number per high power field (600×). A Masson's trichrome stain was performed, which labels collagen blue and myocardium red, to evaluate collagen content on a semiquantitative scale (0 to 3+), with 1+ light blue, 2+ light blue and patches of dark blue, and 3+ dark blue staining. This enabled measurement of the size of the myocardial scar using a digital image analyzer. The lengths of the infarcted surfaces, involving both epicardial and endocardial regions, were measured with a Planimeter digital image analyzer and expressed as a percentage of the total ventricular circumference. All studies were performed by a blinded pathologist. Infarct size was expressed as percentage of total left ventricular area.Analyses of Myocardial Function—Echocardiograph studies were performed using a high frequency liner array transducer (SONOS 5500, Hewlett Packard, Andover, MA). Two-dimensional images were obtained at mid-papillary and apical levels. End-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV) left ventricular volumes were obtained by area-length method, and percent left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated as [(EDV - ESV)/EDV] × 100.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. or S.D. Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSMyocardial VDUP1 mRNA Expression in Vivo Is Increased following Acute Ischemia—During a series of experiments employing cDNA subtractive hybridization to identify patterns of changes in gene expression between normal and ischemic rat hearts, we identified VDUP1 mRNA as being overexpressed in rat myocardium 48 h after LAD ligation. By RT-PCR, increased myocardial VDUP1 mRNA expression was shown to have 20% higher mean levels of VDUP1 mRNA in hearts from LAD-ligated rats than those from normal rats (Fig. 1a, p < 0.01). Because VDUP1 is a key mediator of physiological cell processes triggered by oxidative stress (12Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 20Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13330-13342Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), which specifically targeted one sequence of VDUP1 mRNA near its translation start codon (Fig. 1b, GenBank™ accession number U30789, position 967-985). Fig. 1c shows that the VDUP1-specific DNA enzyme E4 cleaved a synthetic VDUP1 RNA oligonucleotide in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, a control DNA enzyme E0 containing a scrambled sequence had no cleavage activity even at high concentration (5 μm) and with incubation of 2 h. To confirm the cleavage activity of VDUP1 DNA enzyme when present intracellularly, H9C2 cardiomyoblast cells were transfected with E4 or E0 DNA enzymes complexed with the transfection reagent SuperFect. The relative amount of VDUP1 mRNA in treated cells was measured by RT-PCR at various time points and normalized to GAPDH mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1D, VDUP1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in E4-treated cells, to a maximum of 70% below those in E0-treated controls (p < 0.01).VDUP1 DNA Enzyme Transfection Reduces Apoptosis of H9C2 Cells and Increases Their Survival in Response to H2O2 Stress—We next tested the ability of the VDUP1 DNA enzyme to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival of H9C2 cardiomyoblast cells cultured with different concentrations of H2O2. Cell lysate supernatants were used in cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine cytoplasmic mono- and oligonucleosome release. As shown in Fig. 2a, the VDUP1 DNA enzyme E4 used at 1 μm decreased apoptosis of H9C2 cells by means of 34 and 41% in the presence of 50 and 100 μm H2O2 stimulation, respectively, compared with control conditions where H9C2 cells were transfected with the scrambled DNA enzyme E0 (both p < 0.05). Moreover, consistent with the observed reduction in apoptosis, H9C2 cells transfected with E4 demonstrated 113 and 149% higher mean survival rates than E0-transfected cells (Fig. 2b) on culture with 50 and 100 μm H2O2 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The effect of VDUP1 down-regulation was dose-dependent, with an increase in DNA enzyme concentration to 5 μm resulting in 46% reduction in H9C2 apoptosis and increased survival to 201% of control following culture in 100 μm H2O2 for 50 min (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results demonstrated that down-regulation of VDUP1 by the DNA enzyme E4 augmented resistance of H9C2 cells to H2O2-mediated stress injury and promoted their survival.FIGURE 2In vitro effect of VDUP1 DNA enzyme on apoptosis, survival, ASK1 kinase activity, thioredoxin-reducing activity, and collagen expression.a, reduced apoptosis of H9C2 cells undergoing H2O2 stress after VDUP1 DNA enzyme transfection (data were expressed as mean ± S.E., n = 4), as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA.

Here we show that these interactions are differentially regulated and exert distinct effects on CaMKII activity. Nonphosphorylated and Thr<sup>286</sup>-autophosphorylated CaMKII bind to α-actinin with similar efficacy, but autophosphorylation at Thr<sup>305/306</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin binding significantly reduce this binding. Moreover, α-actinin antagonizes CaMKII activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin, as assessed by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. CaMKII binding to densin (1247-1542) is partially independent of Thr<sup>286</sup> autophosphorylation and is unaffected by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent autophosphorylation or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin. In addition, the CaMKII binding domain of densin-180 has little effect on CaMKII activity. In contrast, the interaction of CaMKIIα with NR2B requires either Thr<sup>286</sup> autophosphorylation or the binding of both Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin and adenine nucleotides. NR2B inhibits both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent and autonomous activities of CaMKII by a mechanism that is competitive with autocamtide-2 substrate, non-competitive with syntide-2 substrate, and uncompetitive with respect to ATP. In combination, these data suggest that dynamically regulated interactions with CaMKII-associated proteins could play pleiotropic roles in finetuning CaMKII signaling in defined subcellular compartments."

The metabolic fate of GroPCho in eukaryotic cells is currently not known. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two open reading frames predicted to contain glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domains, YPL110c and YPL206c. Pulse-chase experiments were conducted to monitor GroPCho metabolic fate under conditions known to alter CDP-choline pathway flux and consequently produce different rates of formation of GroPCho. From this analysis, it was revealed that GroPCho was metabolized to choline, with this choline serving as substrate for renewed synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. YPL110c played the major role in this metabolic pathway. To extend and confirm the metabolic studies, the ability of the ypl110cΔ and ypl206cΔ strains to utilize exogenous GroPCho or glycerophosphoinositol as the sole source of phosphate was analyzed. Consistent with our metabolic profiling, the ypl206cΔ strain grew on both substrates with a similar rate to wild type, whereas the ypl110cΔ strain grew very poorly on GroPCho and with moderately reduced growth on glycerophosphoinositol.

Jackson T.R. Daum G. Lipid Metabolism and Membrane Biogenesis. 6. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 5-88Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PtdCho is synthesized through two different pathways (2.Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CDP-choline (CDP-Cho) or Kennedy pathway involves the activation of choline (Cho) to CDP-Cho via a phosphorylcholine (P-Cho) intermediate for condensation with diacylglycerol to produce PtdCho. Through the methylation pathway, PtdCho is produced through sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. When Cho is not present in the growth medium, the activity of the CDP-Cho pathway is not reduced; instead, Cho derived from turnover of PtdCho produced by the methylation pathway is used for PtdCho synthesis through the CDP-choline pathway (3.Patton-Vogt J.L.

Both the CDP-choline and methylation pathways are subject to regulation by the Ino2p and Ino4p transcription factors (2.Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

When inositol is available as a precursor, the activity of the methylation pathway is reduced by transcriptional repression of the methyltransferase-encoding genes OPI3 and CHO2, as is expression of CKI1 and CPT1 encoding the first and the third enzymes of the CDP-Cho pathway. The addition of Cho to inositol-containing medium further reduces transcription of these genes through an as yet to be determined mechanism. In contrast to phospholipid biosynthesis, much less is known about their catabolism. In yeast, PtdCho can be degraded by B and D type phospholipases. The major PtdCho phospholipase D is Spo14p, catalyzing the scission of a phosphoester bond to produce phosphatidic acid and Cho. Spo14p is essential for sporulation and Sec14p-independent secretion (3.Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Three different genes coding for phospholipase B activities (PLB1 to -3) have been identified in S. cerevisiae whose protein products are located at the plasma membrane and within the periplasmic space. None of the three genes are essential, since the triple mutant strain is viable. Of these phospholipase B activities, Plb1p is the main activity responsible for PtdCho deacylation at the plasma membrane with its production of GroPCho released into the extracellular medium (7.Fyrst H.

This phospholipase B, termed neuropathy target esterase (Nte1p in yeast), is a devoted phospholipase B against only CDP-Cho pathway-derived PtdCho. Inhibition of its activity chemically or genetically results in slow neurodegeneration in mice and Drosophila (11.Winrow C.J. Hemming M.L. Allen D.M. Quistad G.B. Casida J.E. Barlow C. Nat.

We present metabolic evidence indicating that intracellular GroPCho is further metabolized and that the Cho moiety is reused for PtdCho biosynthesis. We also present evidence showing that the yeast YPL110c and YPL206c open reading frames (ORFs), the sole two yeast ORFs that are predicted to contain the canonical glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain, are involved in intracellular GroPCho recycling to PtdCho as well as in the utilization of exogenous GroPCho and glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) as phosphate sources for yeast growth. Materials—Radiolabeled [methyl-14C]choline was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Silica gel thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Whatman. Glycerophosphocholine (cadmium salt) was from Sigma. Cadmium was removed by elution through a column (2.7 × 18 mm) of Dowex 50W (Na+ form) at pH 5 and developed with water. GroPCho eluting in the flow-through was washed from the column, and its concentration was estimated by phosphorus determination (14.Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Deacylation of phosphatidylinositol was performed with methylamine essentially as described (15.Hama H. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. Methods. 2000; 20: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GroPIns was chromatographed as described above for GroPCho, and its concentration was determined by phosphorus assay. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—Standard yeast genetic techniques were used (16.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. Cells were routinely grown aerobically at 25 °C in synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose supplemented as required for cell growth. For yeast growth on alternate phosphate sources, synthetic defined medium was prepared as described (17.Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. KH2PO4 (1 g/liter) was replaced with KCl (1 g/liter), and inositol was added to 75 μm. This medium was then supplemented with KH2PO4, GroPIns, or GroPCho. Growth was monitored by turbidity measurement at 600 nm on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer.TABLE ONEYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0Euroscarfypl110cΔBY4741 ypl110c::ΔkanMxEuroscarfypl206cΔBY4741 ypl206c::ΔkanMxEuroscarfgit1ΔBY4741 git1::ΔkanMxEuroscarfypl110cΔ ypl206cΔBY4741 ypl110c::ΔkanMx ypl206c::ΔkanMxThis study Open table in a new tab Analysis of GroPCho Metabolism—Logarithmically growing yeast cells in minimal glucose medium containing the nutritional requirements for cell growth were harvested, washed with fresh medium, and recultured in identical medium containing 1.8 μm [14C]Cho (55 mCi/mmol) for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were centrifuged, washed in fresh medium, and recultured for 90 min in identical medium containing 1 mm nonradiolabeled Cho prewarmed to 37 °C. Under these conditions, high CDP-Cho-derived PtdCho biosynthesis and consequent high Nte1p-mediated PtdCho degradation were induced, resulting in 70–80% of the label being associated with intracellular GroPCho. Alternative procedures were followed as outlined in the legends to Figs. 1 and 2 to monitor GroPCho transformations under differing culture conditions. When yeast cells were chased in the absence of exogenous Cho, three washes with Cho-free medium were performed to ensure removal of external Cho to well below the affinity of the Cho transporter. Aliquots of cells were removed at various time points, and cells were concentrated by centrifugation. The supernatant (medium fraction) and the cells were submitted to radiolabeled metabolite analysis and lipid phosphorus determination as described. Total uptake was considered to be the radioactivity incorporated into the cells at the zero time point of the chase.FIGURE 2YPL110c and YPL206c gene products differentially affect GroPCho turnover. A, diagram of the experimental design. Wild type, ypl110cΔ::kanMx, and ypl206cΔ::kanMx strains were grown to midlog phase in minimal supplemented glucose medium. Cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 0.1 μCi/ml [14C]Cho (55 mCi/mmol) for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were harvested, washed, and recultured for 90 min in fresh medium containing 1 mm nonradioactive Cho warmed to 37 °C to induce the accumulation of radiolabeled intracellular GroPCho. At the end of this period, a sample was withdrawn to monitor the extent of GroPCho accumulation. Cells were harvested and resuspended in minimal glucose medium containing 1 mm nonradioactive Cho prewarmed to 25 °C and incubated for 60 min. This second chase period at 25 °C was intercalated to allow for a reduction of CDP-Cho-derived PtdCho biosynthesis rate and Nte1p-mediated GroPCho formation. At time 0, cells were harvested and exhaustively washed with and recultured in medium with or without 1 mm nonradioactive Cho prewarmed to 25 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots of the culture were analyzed for radioactivity distributed among the indicated Cho-containing metabolites. B, radioactivity distribution among Cho-containing metabolites. C, radioactivity distribution profiles of intracellular Cho and P-Cho. Total radioactivity incorporated by the three strains was essentially identical. Data are expressed as a percentage of total label recovered in each fraction at each time point.

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold water, resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (1/1, v/v), and disrupted for 1 min at 4 °C using a BioSpec Multi-Bead Beater containing 0.5 g of 0.5-mm acid-washed glass beads. The beads were washed with 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2/1, v/v), and 1.5 ml of water and 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (5/1, v/v) were added to the combined supernatant to facilitate phase separation. Phospholipids in the organic phase were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Whatman Silica Gel 60A plates using the solvent system: CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/CH3COOH (70/30/2/2, v/v/v/v). Cho-containing metabolites in the aqueous phase were separated in a solvent system consisting of CH3OH, 0.6% NaCl, NH4OH (50/50/5, v/v/v). Plates were scanned with a BioScan radiolabel imaging scanner, and the corresponding bands were scraped into vials for scintillation counting. Metabolite identity was based on the mobility of known standards. Standard Procedures—Protein mass was determined using the Lowry method (18.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lipid phosphorus as described by Ames and Dubin (14.Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deacylation of PtdCho mediated by Nte1p leads to intracellular GroPCho formation, and the extent of this reaction correlates well with the activity of the CDP-Cho pathway. The addition of Cho into the growth medium and temperature elevation promote both a high rate of CDP-Cho-derived PtdCho synthesis and an accumulation of intracellular GroPCho. Measurements of intracellular GroPCho content in yeast cells range from 0.1 nmol/OD for cells growing at 30 °C without exogenous Cho to 2 nmol/OD for cells growing at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm Cho in the growth medium (13.Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analyses using radiolabeled Cho performed by us (19.Fernández Murray J.P. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8544-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and by others (13.Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that there is not a significant increase in GroPCho accumulation in the extracellular medium upon temperature elevation, a stimulus that elicits Nte1pmediated intracellular GroPCho formation. These results suggest that yeast cells control intracellular GroPCho content through a mechanism distinct from excreting GroPCho out of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of intracellular GroPCho metabolic fate, we performed pulse-chase analysis using [14C]Cho. Wild type yeast cells were labeled with [14C]Cho for 30 min at 25 °C, and then the labeled cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled Cho to chase the radiolabel into GroPCho. Indeed, after this labeling protocol, 70–80% of the label was associated with intracellular GroPCho (19.Fernández Murray J.P. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8544-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A second chase followed in which the cells were cultured at 37 °C in the absence or the presence of 1 mm unlabeled Cho (Fig. 1). The time course analysis of label distribution among Cho-containing metabolites from aqueous and organic intracellular fractions, as well as extracellular medium, during the second chase period revealed two different patterns of radioactivity distribution depending on Cho availability. In the presence of 1 mm Cho, a slight increase in label associated with GroPCho was observed. In stark contrast, when Cho was absent from the medium, a large increase in label associated with PtdCho was observed along with a concomitant diminution of radioactivity associated with GroPCho. Under both conditions, the label recovered in the medium was only 6–7% of the total. The results indicate that intracellular GroPCho is not a refractory end product of PtdCho catabolism but instead can be further metabolized to PtdCho. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases have been characterized from several sources (20.Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21.van der Rest B. Rolland N. Boisson A.M. Ferro M. Bligny R. Douce R. Biochem.

J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4569-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They exhibit hydrolytic activity against different glycerophosphoalcohols producing sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and the corresponding alcohol (EC 3.1.4.46). S. cerevisiae possesses two ORFs, YPL110c and YPL206c, that probably code for glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activities, since their ORFs are predicted to contain a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase motif. An intracellular GroPIns glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity in yeast has been proposed, since it was clearly demonstrated that S. cerevisiae can use GroPIns both as a phosphate and inositol source with only intact GroPIns imported into the cell (17.Patton J.L. Pessoa-Brandao L. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3379-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Almaguer C. Cheng W. Nolder C. Patton-Vogt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31937-31942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A second type of enzymatic activity toward the ester bond of glycerophosphoalcohols was described in crude cellular extracts that resulted in the production of glycerol and the corresponding phosphoalcohol (EC 3.1.4.38), and very recently a mammalian member of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family was determined to possess this activity toward GroPCho producing glycerol and P-Cho (26.Sakagami H. Aoki J. Natori Y. Nishikawa K. Kakehi Y. Natori Y. Arai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23084-23093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cleavage of GroPCho by these types of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activities could release Cho (EC 3.1.4.46) or P-Cho (EC 3.1.4.38) for potential use by the CDP-Cho pathway for PtdCho synthesis. From our results, the observed change of radioactivity distribution during the second chase period in the absence of Cho is consistent with the presence of an intracellular glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. The results are consistent with a pathway of circular flux whereby Cho released from GroPCho is reused for PtdCho biosynthesis. In the experiments performed in the presence of 1 mm exogenous Cho, the specific radioactivity of [14C]Cho-containing metabolites would continuously decrease during the chase. This fact, together with the slight increase in labeling of GroPCho probably reflects an increase in GroPCho levels. This interpretation would be in agreement with previous data (13.Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3756-3763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the specific activity of [14C]Chocontaining metabolites would remain almost unchanged when the cells were incubated in the absence of external Cho. Our observed net transfer of label from GroPCho to PtdCho under conditions of no external Cho and growth at 37 °C reflects a reduction in intracellular GroPCho and indicates that under these conditions the rate of GroPCho production mediated by Nte1p is slower than the rate of GroPCho consumption mediated by a presumptive glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity. Similar pulse-chase analyses of Cho-containing metabolites were performed for ypl110cΔ and ypl206cΔ strains (Fig. 1). The radioactivity distribution profiles of these strains were similar to that observed for wild type strain in the absence or presence of 1 mm Cho. This was surprising, since these are the only two yeast ORFs with a predicted glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase motif. We reasoned that the elevated temperature of 37 °C used throughout the chase could mask any potential biochemical effect derived from the absence of these genes, since under this condition there is high CDP-Cho-derived PtdCho biosynthesis and consequent Nte1p-mediated PtdCho deacylation, and thus a further increase in label associated with GroPCho due to the absence of a GroPCho consuming pathway would be barely detectable. Indeed, in the absence of Cho, resulting in a diminution of CDP-choline pathway flux, a small decrease in the rate of transfer of label from GroPCho to PtdCho was consistently observed for ypl110cΔ and ypl206cΔ strains in comparison with wild type cells. To circumvent this problem, we performed another set of pulsechase analyses, schematically outlined in Fig. 2A, but monitored labeled GroPCho metabolism at 25 °C. Yeast cells were labeled with [14C]Cho at 25 °C for 30 min and then cultured at 37 °C for 90 min in the presence of 1 mm Cho to accumulate 70–80% of the radiolabel into GroPCho. In order to decrease the sustained PtdCho synthesis and degradation that takes place at 37 °C, the cells were transferred into identical medium containing 1 mm Cho prewarmed to 25 °C and cultured for a further 60 min. This was followed by continued growth at 25 °C but in the absence or the presence of 1 mm unlabeled Cho (Fig. 2, B and C). When the cells were cultured in the absence of Cho, a transfer of radioactivity from GroPCho to PtdCho was observed for wild type, ypl110cΔ, and ypl206cΔ strains (Fig. 2B). As was observed when the chase was performed at 37 °C (Fig. 1), the rate of radioactivity transfer from GroPCho to PtdCho was slightly reduced for ypl110cΔ and ypl206cΔ strains in comparison with wild type cells. Under Cho-replete conditions, differing metabolic profiles for each strain were very evident. These results illustrate that YPL110c is a major contributor of GroPCho consumption, whereas YPL206c plays a far less prominent role (Fig. 2B). Also, since Cho uptake and flux through the CDP-Cho pathway measured in ypl110cΔ and ypl206cΔ strains were essentially similar to those parameters for wild type cells (data not shown), we can conclude first that the rate of diminution of the specific activity of Cho-containing metabolites is the same for all three strains, and second, the rate of PtdCho deacylation mediated by Nte1p is also the same for the three strains. The transfer of label from GroPCho to PtdCho observed for each strain suggests that the GroPCho pool is not at steady state upon temperature reduction and would progress to reach a concentration where the rate of GroPCho consumption equals the rate of PtdCho deacylation, with the different radioactivity distribution profiles reflecting the steady state GroPCho concentration of these strains. A detailed time course analysis of radioactivity associated with intracellular Cho and P-Cho (Fig. 2C) shows an acute and transient increase in both metabolites for wild type and ypl206cΔ strains triggered by temperature diminution but much less pronounced for the ypl110cΔ strain. These results strongly reinforce our presumption that YPL110c gene product functions as a major glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity involved in GroPCho catabolism and suggest that it promotes the scission of the ester bond between Cho and glycerol 3-phosphate moieties of GroPCho in vivo. At 37 °C under Cho-replete conditions, the flux through the CDP-Cho pathway is high, as is GroPCho formation, leading to accumulation of the label in this metabolite (Fig. 1). Although the specific activity of the Cho-containing metabolites was continuously decreasing, the label associated with Cho and P-Cho never exceeded 1% (see the legend to Fig. 1), since those metabolites were actively consumed through the CDP-Cho pathway. Upon temperature diminution to 25 °C, the flux through this pathway was reduced, and the absence of the YPL110C gene product clearly affected the progression with which new steady states involving Cho-containing metabolites were reached over time. The presence of YPL110C gene product led to a transient increase of the Cho and P-Cho pool during this transition as accumulated GroPCho was consumed faster than produced, and the pools of Cho and P-Cho expanded as their rates of consumption were reduced. In the ypl110cΔ strain, this transient increase of Cho and P-Cho pools was barely detected, and the GroPCho pool reached steady state at higher levels under Cho-replete conditions. The simultaneous expansion of both Cho and P-Cho pools is consistent with the presumption that the YPL110C gene product performs as a phosphodiesterase activity toward GroPCho producing Cho (and glycerol 3-phosphate), which is rapidly phosphorylated by Cho kinase. Alternatively, the higher expansion of the P-Cho pool compared with the Cho pool could be regarded as an index that the other ester bond is cleaved. We do not favor such an interpretation. First, further auxiliary hypotheses should explain the minor but consistent expansion of the Cho pool observed in the presence of the YPL110c gene product. Second, all of the biochemically characterized enzymes that possess canonical glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domains and exhibit such an activity in vitro cleave glycerophosphoalcohols, producing the corresponding alcohol and glycerol 3-phosphate (20.Zheng B.

Our attempts to directly measure glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity against GroPCho or GroPIns in whole cell extracts, soluble or particulate fractions prepared from wild type, ypl110cΔ, ypl206cΔ, and ypl110cΔ ypl206cΔ strains have yet to meet with success. Furthermore, our use of purified recombinant Ypl110c and Ypl206c proteins as sources of enzyme did not render any positive results. Several parameters were manipulated in order to measure enzyme activity including buffer composition and pH, the presence of various divalent cations, the presence of detergents, substrate concentration, incubation time, and amount of protein.

Sequences of model peptides were acetyl-Tyr-Cys-amide (YC), acetyl-Tyr-Ala-Cys-amide (YAC), acetyl-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Cys-amide (YAAC), and acetyl-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Cys-amide (YAAAAC). Results indicate that nitration and oxidation products of tyrosyl residue in YC and other model peptides were barely detectable. A major product detected was the corresponding disulfide (e.g. YCysCysY). Spin trapping experiments with 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) revealed thiyl adduct (e.g. DMPO-SCys-Tyr) formation from peptides (e.g. YC) treated with MPO/H2O2 and MPO/H2O2/NO2-. The steady-state concentrations of DMPO-thiyl adducts decreased with increasing chain length of model peptides. Blocking the sulfydryl group in YC with methylmethanethiosulfonate (that formed YCSSCH3) totally inhibited thiyl radical formation as did substitution of Tyr with Phe (i.e. FC) in the presence of MPO/H2O2/NO2-. However, increased tyrosine nitration, tyrosine dimerization, and tyrosyl radical formation were detected in the MPO/H2O2/NO2-/YCSSCH3 system. Increased formation of S-nitrosated YC (YCysNO) was detected in the MPO/H2O2/·NO system. We conclude that a rapid intramolecular electron transfer reaction between the tyrosyl radical and the Cys residue impedes tyrosine nitration and induces corresponding thiyl radical and nitrosocysteine product. Implications of this novel intramolecular electron transfer mechanism in protein nitration and nitrosation are discussed.

The goal of the present study was to monitor the influence of a cysteine residue on tyrosine nitration. Several studies have shown that tyrosine nitration is a selective process that is controlled by various microenvironmental factors (hydrophobicity, CO2 levels, membrane oxygen concentration, acidic environment, and amino acid sequence) (16Khairutdinov R.F.

Previously, we have shown, using membrane-incorporated tyrosine analogs and tyrosyl peptides, that dityrosine formation is not a significant reaction process for tyrosyl radicals in membranes due to hindrance of free diffusion of tyrosyl radicals (22Zhang H. Joseph J. Feix J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7675-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the location of the tyrosyl probe in the membrane determines the transmembrane nitration profile (23Zhang H. Bhargava K. Keszler A. Feix J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8969-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Literature data show that the CO2 levels greatly influence the kinetics of tyrosyl nitration in proteins (24Gow A. Duran D. Thom S.R. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem.

Factors influencing nitration of tyrosyl residues in protein are not fully known. As discussed in previous reviews (12Greenacre S.A. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic.

Yudkoff M. Raman C.S. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), the local environment of tyrosine residues within the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein will probably influence the site of tyrosine nitration. Although no specific amino acid sequence criteria exist for predicting tyrosine nitration or lack thereof, it has been shown, as originally suggested, that protein tyrosyl nitration is (i) enhanced when tyrosine is situated closer to a negatively charged amino acid (i.e. glutamate or aspartate) and (ii) decreased when tyrosine residue is present in the vicinity of a cysteinyl or methionine residue (12Greenacre S.A.

However, detailed quantitative analysis of these effects on tyrosyl nitration is lacking, although a more recent report focused on the effect of lysine residues on tyrosyl nitration (27Shao B.

These involve either the catalytic action of heme peroxidases (e.g. myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase) using nitrite and H2O2 as substrates and/or the nitrative chemistry of peroxynitrite. In this study, we investigated the effects of cysteine on tyrosyl nitration (or tyrosine on cysteine oxidation) in model peptides subjected to oxidation by myeloperoxidase (MPO) 2The abbreviations used are: MPOmyeloperoxidaseDBNBS3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acidDMPO5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxideDTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceFCN-acetyl phenylalaninylcysteine amideMMTSmethylmethanethiosulfonate·NO2nitrogen dioxide radicalYCN-acetyl tyrosylcysteine amideYACN-acetyl tyrosylalaninylcysteine amideYAACN-acetyl tyrosylalaninylalaninylcysteine amideYCysCysYdisulfide formed from YCY(NO2)CN-acetyl nitrotyrosylcysteine amideFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)-methoxycarbonylDICdiisopropylcarbodiimideHOBt1-hydroxybezotriazoleESI-MSelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometryHRPhorseradish peroxidaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyYCysNOS-nitrosated YCMSmass spectrometryDEA-NO2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide sodium salt./H2O2 and NO2-.

The following chemicals and enzymes were purchased from various sources as indicated: tyrosine, hydrogen peroxide, sodium nitrite, sodium bicarbonate, 3-nitrotyrosine, N-ethylmaleimide, cysteine, and GSH were from Sigma; myeloperoxidase was from Calbiochem. Rink amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin and all Fmoc-protected amino acids were from Calbiochem. Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 1-hydroxybezotriazole (HOBt), triisopropylsilane, methylmethanethiosulfonate (MMTS), N-methylpyrrolidione (NMP), and piperidine were purchased from Fisher. The sequences of the peptides used in this study are given in Fig. 2S. The peptides were chemically synthesized using the standard Fmoc solid phase peptide-based synthetic procedure on an Advanced Chemtech model 90 synthesizer (Louisville, KY) (23Zhang H. Bhargava K. Keszler A. Feix J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8969-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rink amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin (loading 0.72 mmol/g) was used as a solid support. Fmoc-protected amino acids were coupled as HOBt-esters. All amino acids were double coupled using HOBt/DIC. The following steps were performed in the reaction vessel for each double coupling: deprotection of the Fmoc group with 20% piperidine in NMP for 30 min (twice), three NMP washes, two dichloromethane washes, first coupling for 1 h with a 5-fold excess of Fmoc amino acid in 0.5 m HOBt and 0.5 m DIC, second coupling using a fresh addition of the same reagent for 1 h, followed by three NMP washes, and two dichloromethane washes. Final acetylation was performed using an acetic anhydride/HOBt/DIC mixture for 30 min (twice). The resin was washed twice with dichloromethane and three times with methanol and then dried under vacuum prior to cleavage. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin with 90% trifluoroacetic acid containing triisopropylsilane for 3 h at room temperature. The resin was removed by filtration and washed with trifluoroacetic acid, and the combined trifluoroacetic acid filtrates were evaporated to dryness under a steam of dry N2 gas. The oily residue was washed three times with cold ether to remove the scavengers, and the dry crude peptide was dissolved in acetonitrile/H2O (1:1) and lyophilized. The crude peptides were purified by a semipreparative reverse phase HPLC on a RP-C18 (10 × 250 mm) column using a CH3CN/water gradient (5-25% CH3CN over 60 min) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 3 ml/min with detection at 280 nm. The disulfide of YC peptide (YCysCysY) was synthesized as follows. YC peptide (30 mm) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm DTPA was incubated with 30 mm hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was injected into a RP-C18 semipreparatory column, and YC peptide disulfide was eluted at 26 min using a CH3CN/water gradient (5-25% CH3CN over 60 min) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Detection was at 280 nm. The structure of the disulfide product was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis (M + H+, 649.3). The YC peptide dityrosine (bis-N-acetyl tyrosylcysteine amide) was prepared as follows. The YC disulfide (15 mm) was incubated with 10 mm H2O2 and 100 μg of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then mixed with β-mercaptoethanol (500 mm), and HRP was removed by ultracentrifugation (Mr 3000 cut-off). The product (YC dityrosine) was purified by a preparative HPLC (C-18, 250 × 10 mm) using a fluorescence detector (excitation 294 nm; emission, 410 nm). The YC dityrosine was eluted by a linear CH3CN gradient as above. The product was further confirmed by ESI-MS. Nitrated YC peptide (Y(NO2)C) was prepared as follows. The YCysCysY peptide (1 mm) was mixed with peroxynitrite (10 mm) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then mixed with 500 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 20 min. The resulting Y(NO2)C peptide was purified using a preparative HPLC. Nitro peptides show a characteristic UV-visible spectrum. Upon adding NaOH, the 350 nm absorption peak in MeOH was shifted to 430 nm with an extinction coefficient of 4100 m-1 m-1. The structure of Y(NO2)C was verified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer. 20 mm YC was mixed with 20 mm sodium nitrite in 0.03 m HCl for 10 min at room temperature. The solution was then neutralized by 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 100 μm DTPA. YCysNO (yield >95%) was verified by ESI-MS (M + H+; 355), UV absorption (λmax = 335 nm) and by Hg2+-induced cleavage. Typically, peptides (0.3 mm) were incubated with NaNO2 (0.5 mm), H2O2 (0.1 mm), and MPO (30 nm) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding catalase (200 units) and analyzed by HPLC. Repeat injections in 24 h showed no significant oxidation of YC under these experimental conditions. All reagents were purged with argon gas for 60 min before experiments. YC (150 μm) was incubated with H2O2 (50 μm), MPO (30 nm), and DEA-NO (10-50 μm) in a phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding iodoacetamide (20 mm) and analyzed by HPLC. Repeat injections within 24 h showed no significant loss of YCysNO under these experimental conditions. Typically, 20 μl of sample was injected into an HPLC system (HP1100) with a C-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) equilibrated with 5% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide and its product were separated by a linear increase of CH3CN concentration to 25% in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution was monitored using the on-line UV-visible and fluorescence detectors. YC and nitrated YC were eluted at 12 and 17.5 min, respectively. Nitration of tyrosine with or without cysteine by MPO/H2O2/NaNO2 was performed under the same conditions, and the products were analyzed as reported previously (36Goss S.P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thiyl Radical Trapping—A typical incubation mixture consisted of a peptide or tyrosine (1 mm) and cysteine (1 mm), MPO (50 nm), H2O2 (1 mm), and 150 mm DMPO in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm). The reaction was initiated by adding H2O2. Samples were subsequently transferred to a 100-μl capillary tube, and EPR spectra were recorded within 30 s after starting the reaction. EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker ER 200 D-SRC spectrometer operating at 9.8 GHz and a cavity equipped with a Bruker Aquax liquid sample cell. Typical spectrometer parameters were as follows: scan range, 100 G; field set, 3505 G; time constant, 0.64 ms; scan time, 10 s; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver gain, 5 × 104; and microwave power, 10 milliwatts. The spectra shown were the average of 10 scans. Tyrosyl Radical Trapping—Incubations consisting of a peptide or tyrosine (1 mm) and cysteine (1 mm), MPO (100 nm), and DBNBS (20 mm) in a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (0.1 mm) were rapidly mixed with H2O2 (1 mm). Samples were subsequently transferred to a 100-μl capillary tube, and ESR spectra were taken within 30 s after starting the reaction. Typical spectrometer parameters were as follows: scan range, 100 G; field set, 3505 G; time constant, 0.64 ms; scan time, 20 s; modulation amplitude, 2.0 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver gain, 5 × 105; and microwave power, 20 milliwatts. The spectra shown were the average of 30 scans. The minimum energy conformations of the peptides and their global minima in the presence of water molecules were computed by the Metropolis Monte Carlo approach using a random variation of the randomly selected torsional angles (37von Freyberg B. Braun W.J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 1065Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The starting configurations of the peptides were linear, corresponding to an all-trans backbone configuration with an N-terminal acetyl and C-terminal amide group. The molecular mechanics calculations were performed using an Amber 99 force field methodology. The structures calculated by Metropolis Monte Carlo were reminimized by the conjugate gradient method. Energy minimization was terminated when the gradient root mean square was below 0.01 mol/kcal. The selected lower energy conformers of each peptide were solvated by TIP3P water molecules and reminimized again. Characterization of Tyrosylcysteine Peptides—TABLE ONE lists the amino acid sequences of model peptides and oxidation/nitration products along with the mass spectral data. The intramolecular distances between the tyrosyl oxygen atom and the cysteinyl sulfur atom calculated from the lowest energy conformations in an aqueous environment using the HyperChem 7.1 Package Program (Hypercube Inc.) are shown (see supplemental Fig. 1S).TABLE ONECharacterization of peptidesPeptidesM + H+Distance between Oy and Sc atomsÅYC326.14.45YAC397.24.42YAAC468.24.75YAAAAC610.24.54YCysCysY649.2CYYC649.2Y(NO2)C371.2 Open table in a new tab MPO/H2O2/NaNO2-dependent Oxidation and Nitration of Peptides Containing Tyrosine and Cysteine Residues—The aim of these experiments was to determine the effect of the cysteine residue on nitration and oxidation of the tyrosine group present in model peptides (see supplemental Fig. 2S). MPO/H2O2/NaNO2-dependent nitration/oxidation of YC peptide was monitored by HPLC with UV-visible detection at 280 nm for tyrosyl residue and at 350 nm for nitro tyrosyl residue. The HPLC/fluorescence (excitation, 290 nm; emission, 410 nm) was used for detecting the dityrosyl product of YC (Fig. 1). The authentic YC peptide (300 μm), YC nitration product (Y(NO2)C; 0.1 μm), dityrosyl product (bis-N-acetyl tyrosylcysteine amide; 0.1 μm), and the disulfide product (YCysCysY; 150 μm) were detected at 16, 18, 29, and 32 min, respectively (Fig. 1, A-C). Incubation of YC peptide with MPO, H2O2, and NaNO2 in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) for 30 min at room temperature failed to yield detectable levels of nitrated tyrosine or the dityrosyl product (Fig. 1, A and C). However, upon UV-visible analysis at 280 nm, a new product eluting at 32 min was detected (Fig. 1A, a-d). By comparison with the HPLC profile of the authentic YC disulfide, the peak detected at 32 min was attributed to YCysCysY, a disulfide formed from YC. Incubations of YC with MPO/H2O2 also yielded YCysCysY but no dityrosine peptide (bis-N-acetyl tyrosylcysteine amide) (Fig. 1C, a-e). In the presence of H2O2 alone, a slight increase in disulfide YCysCysY was detected (Fig. 1A, a) due to H2O2-dependent oxidation of cysteine to the corresponding disulfide. These data are in contrast to the results obtained with tyrosine alone in the MPO/H2O2/NO2- system, where a substantial but significant increase in nitrotyrosine and dityrosine formation was noted (see TABLE TWO).TABLE TWONitration and oxidation products of YC dipeptide and other model peptidesExperimental conditionsaAll reactions were incubated at room temperature for 0.5 h, and concentrations were determined by HPLCProductYCMPONaNO2H2O2YCYCysCysYY (NO2)CCYYCμmnmμmμmμm300305005055 ± 20115 ± 12NDbND, not detectedND30030050182 ± 761 ± 10NDND3000050271 ± 1117 ± 4NDND3003050010041 ± 12120 ± 10NDND300300100129 ± 1871 ± 4NDND30000100252 ± 1130 ± 6NDNDYC-SSCH3 (300 μm)30500100ND22 ± 71.4 ± 0.1Tyr (300 μm)3050010023 ± 25.3 ± 0.1YAC (300 μm)3050050117 ± 193 ± 8NDNDYAC (300 μm)30050216 ± 339 ± 1NDNDYAC (300 μm)0050277 ± 718 ± 1NDNDYAAC (300 μm)3050050215 ± 242 ± 2NDNDYAAC (300 μm)30050248 ± 225 ± 1NDNDYAAC (300 μm)0050278 ± 312 ± 2NDNDYAAAAC (300 μm)3050050254 ± 322 ± 2NDNDYAAAAC (300 μm)30050273 ± 712 ± 3NDNDYAAAAC (300 μm)0050283 ± 38 ± 2NDNDa All reactions were incubated at room temperature for 0.5 h, and concentrations were determined by HPLCb ND, not detected Open table in a new tab Additional confirmation of disulfide formation in this system (i.e. YC/MPO/H2O2/NO2-) was obtained by incubating the reaction mixture with β-mercaptoethanol. As shown in Fig. 1A, the disulfide YCysCysY was reduced back to the parent YC peptide. To further demonstrate that YC disulfide is the only oxidation product formed in this system, an additional aliquot of fresh reagents (MPO/H2O2/NaNO2) was added to the original reaction mixture after 30 min and incubated further for another 30 min. HPLC analysis did not reveal any other products other than the disulfide YCysCysY (Fig. 1A). Further confirmation of the product analysis was obtained by mass spectrometry. Fig. 1A (trace d, inset) shows the HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of the incubation mixture obtained 30 min after oxidation of YC by MPO/H2O2/NaNO2. The peak eluting at 32 min in Fig. 1A was analyzed by HPLC/ESI-MS. The mass spectral analysis of this peak is identical to the m/z pattern of the authentic YC disulfide (M + H+: 649; M + 2H+: 325). Incubation of other model peptides (YAC, YAAC, and YAAAAC) with MPO/H2O2/NaNO2 also yielded exclusively the corresponding disulfide products (i.e. YACysCysAY, YAACysCysAAY, and YAAAACysCysAAAAY) with little or no formation of nitrated and dityrosyl products; as shown in TABLE TWO, the yields of disulfide decreased with increasing peptide chain lengths. These results indicate that MPO/H2O2/NaNO2-dependent oxidation of YC and related homologs yields the corresponding disulfide as the only major product and that the extent of formation of nitrated tyrosine and dityrosine oxidation products was negligible (TABLE TWO). Intermediacy of Thiyl Radicals Formed during MPO/H2O2/NO2--dependent Oxidation of Tyrosylcysteine Model Peptides—To investigate whether MPO/H2O2/NaNO2 induces formation of disulfide from YC, YAC, YAAC, or YAAAAC peptides via a radical mechanism, we used the DMPO spin trap to detect the corresponding thiyl radicals (38Saez G.

Incubation of YC with MPO, H2O2, and NaNO2 in a phosphate buffer containing DTPA (100 μm) yielded a four-line EPR spectrum (Fig. 2A) with the hyperfine coupling constants, αN = 15.2 G and αH = 16.2 G, that are similar to the values reported for the DMPO-glutathionyl adduct (αN = 15.2 G and αH = 16.4 G). Pretreatment of the YC peptide with N-ethylmaleimide, a thiol-blocking reagent, inhibited the DMPO-thiyl adduct formation. To verify that tyrosyl residue is required for thiyl radical formation in YC peptide, we performed the oxidation of a dipeptide, FC (tyrosine replaced by a phenylalanine) in the MPO/H2O2/NO2- system. Oxidation of FC in MPO/H2O2 and DMPO did not yield a detectable ESR signal (Figs. 2A and 3C). A small amount of DMPO-SCysF adduct (αN = 15.1 G and αH = 16.3 G) detected in the presence of added NO2- was presumably from ·NO2-mediated oxidation of the"
https://openalex.org/W2033053403,"c-Src associates with and is activated by the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase, but is unable to bind the EGFR. Although c-Src has been found to interact directly and specifically with the ErbB-2 receptor, the significance of this interaction is unclear. Using both chimeric receptor and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, the region of interaction of c-Src on ErbB-2 was identified. Significantly, EGFR could be converted into a receptor capable of binding c-Src by replacement of a catalytic domain of ErbB-2. We further demonstrated that MDCK cells that express mutant EGFR that are competent in c-Src recruitment lose epithelial polarity in organoid cultures, whereas cells overexpressing the wild-type EGFR retain a polarized phenotype. ErbB-2-dependent activation of c-Src results in disruption of epithelial cell-cell contacts leading to cell dispersal that correlates with the re-localization of phospho-MAPK to focal adhesions. Taken together, these observations suggest that recruitment of c-Src to these closely related EGFR family members plays a critical role in modulating cell polarity."

Escherichia coli produces ∼80 structurally and immunochemically distinct capsular polysaccharides (1Jann K. Jann B. Sussman M. Escherichia coli: Mechanisms of Virulence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1997: 113-143Google Scholar). These major surface structures define the K antigen in serotyping analyses, and they form a surface structure known as the capsule. The capsule is a continuous and coherent surface layer, and its primary role is to provide a protective barrier and maintain the cell in a hydrated state. It is also an important virulence determinant that enables pathogenic bacteria to evade or counteract the nonspecific host defense during the early (preimmune) phase of infection by interfering with the action of complement and phagocytes (1Jann K. Jann B. Sussman M. Escherichia coli: Mechanisms of Virulence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1997: 113-143Google Scholar). Capsular polysaccharides vary in monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkages, and substitution with side branch glycoses and non-carbohydrate residues. Based on structural, genetic, and biochemical criteria, the capsules of E. coli have been classified into four groups (2Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and in terms of biosynthesis, there are two distinct pathways. Groups 1 and 4 capsules use a Wzy-dependent system, whereas assembly of groups 2 and 3 follows an ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent process. Both biosynthesis mechanisms are widely represented in capsules and other glycoconjugates in a variety of bacterial species. The E. coli system therefore serves as a paradigm for this process in a broad range of bacteria, including significant pathogens of plants, livestock, and humans (2Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 3Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 4Whitfield C. Paiment A. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The current working model for the Wzy-dependent assembly pathway is based on dissection of the system by biochemical and genetic means with some interpretation of corresponding reactions in lipopolysaccharide O antigen synthesis (3Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 4Whitfield C. Paiment A. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this model, individual repeat unit oligosaccharides are assembled on undecaprenol diphosphate lipid carriers at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, which provide a pool of subunits for assembly. These intermediates are then transported across the inner membrane in what is proposed to be a “flippase”-type reaction by a process involving the Wzx protein. Once the oligosaccharide moiety is transferred to the periplasm, it forms the substrate for the polymerization machinery. The characteristic component of this process is the putative polymerase Wzy, an integral inner membrane protein. These initial steps in the Wzy-dependent pathway are conserved in groups 1 and 4 E. coli capsules and in lipopolysaccharide O antigens, capsules, and exopolysaccharides from a variety of bacteria. Notably, these early reactions are found in some Gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococci and streptococci (4Whitfield C. Paiment A. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The terminal stages in assembly of these polymers on bacterial cell surfaces differ according to the nature of the glycoconjugate involved and the structure of the cell envelope (i.e. Gram-negative versus Gram-positive). The terminal stages in group 1 capsule assembly require the outer membrane protein Wza, a member of the outer membrane auxiliary family (5Paulsen I.T. Beness A.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2685-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The presence of Wza is essential for the assembly of the prototype group 1 capsule structure on the surface of E. coli serotype K30 (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Wza forms stable oligomeric “donut”-shaped complexes with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa, and a preliminary study of Wza, based on small two-dimensional crystalline areas, revealed ring-like complexes with an average outer diameter of ∼90–110 Å and a central stained region of ∼20–35 Å in diameter (20Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional structure for Wza, calculated using single particle analysis of cryo-negatively stained data (9Beis K. Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kamis A.B. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28227-28232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), revealed that Wza forms an octamer with an unusual rotational organization. Oligomeric Wza appears to be formed by a novel tetrameric ring of dimerically associated Wza (i.e. Wza is a tetramer of dimers). Viewed from the side, the oligomer has two distinctive layers with a cavity in the center of the complex (9Beis K. Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kamis A.B. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28227-28232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Wza is thought to provide a capsule translocon for export of capsular polysaccharide across the outer membrane, and it certainly has structural features in common with members of the secretin superfamily of proteins (e.g. PilQ, pIV, PulD, XcpQ, and YscC (10Bitter W. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 179: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Bitter W. Koster M. Latjinhouwers M. de Cock H. Tommassen J. Mol.

These secretins translocate a variety of proteins and pili through the outer membrane. However, Wza shares no sequence homology with them (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The remaining outer membrane component Wzi is required for surface association of the capsule (15Rahn A. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5882-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the means of capsule attachment is currently unclear. The polymerization and assembly of group 1 capsular polymer appears to be a coupled process in that mutants defective in late steps do not accumulate intracellular or periplasmic polymer (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This would suggest a connection between the inner and outer membranes, and Wza can, in fact, be cross-linked to an integral inner membrane component, Wzc in vivo (20Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of the highly conserved Wzc homolog from E. coli K12 predicts a bitopic protein with large cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains (17Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37339-37348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and no structural studies have been performed in detail on any member of the Wzc family. In Gram-positive bacteria, functional homologs of Wzc are composed of two polypeptides, one representing the periplasmic component and the other the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (4Whitfield C. Paiment A. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2491-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Cozzone A.J. Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Duclos B. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 170-181Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Wzc from E. coli K30 contains tyrosine autokinase activity with seven tyrosine residues in the last 17 residues (ASSYYRYGHNHYGYSYYDKK721) (16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Paiment A. Hocking J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the prototype system from E. coli K30, capsule assembly is dependent on the activity of Wzc and its cognate cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine phosphatase, Wzb (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Analysis of different wzc mutants with defects in the Walker box or in the C-terminal tyrosine-rich domain indicated that both are essential for capsule assembly and that the phosphorylation process occurs via trans-phosphorylation requiring the interaction of Wzc monomers (16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). No single tyrosine residue is essential or required for function in capsule assembly; it appears that the load of tyrosine phosphorylation rather than precise location is important for function (19Paiment A. Hocking J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The requirement for the Wzb phosphatase is consistent with a cycling of phosphorylation during export (16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The absence of Wzc does not prevent the cell from making K30 antigen oligosaccharides, but high molecular weight capsular polymers are absent (6Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, Wzc may provide a key role in regulating capsule formation and coupling Wza to the inner membrane. Structural studies of the protein apparatus employed in carbohydrate export remain in their infancy, yet these molecular machines are very important in understanding the biology of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and the development of possible new anti-microbial drugs directed against this essential feature in many pathogens. To further understand this complex system, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the inner membrane protein Wzc to a resolution of 14 Å. This is the first structural data available on this important class of integral inner membrane protein. Wzc Purification—The open reading frame of the gene encoding E. coli Wzc with an N-terminal His tag (His6-Wzc) was cloned in the expression vector pWQ305 (20Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G.

Expression of Wzc was induced at A600 = 0.5 with 0.02% (w/v) l-arabinose, and the cells were grown for a further 4 h at 37°C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g (4 °C) for 15 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bacterial cells were disrupted using a French press (110 megapascals), and the crude extract was fractionated by ultracentrifugation (85,000 × g). Cell envelopes were resuspended in solubilizing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside (DDM) 4The abbreviations used are: DDM, dodecyl maltoside; PFO, perfluoro-octanoic acid; CTF, contrast transfer function; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. ) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 85,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with solubilizing buffer containing 0.008% (w/v) DDM and eluted with a step gradient using the same buffer containing 1 m imidazole. The sample was then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-base, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.008% (w/v) DDM and loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Pharmacia). The His6-Wzc was then eluted using 1.2× column volumes of the same buffer, with one major peak at ∼350 kDa. The sample was dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-base, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.008% (w/v) DDM. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight showed that the Wzc protein was purified in a fully phosphorylated state with all C-terminal Tyr residues modified (data not shown). Perfluoro-octanoic Acid (PFO)-PAGE of Oligomeric Wzc—PFO-PAGE was performed using a variation on previously reported methods (22Ramjeesingh M.H.L. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 10-μl Wzc samples (50–600 μg/ml) were mixed 1:1 with PFO sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 8% (w/v) Na-PFO, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Samples were then loaded onto 7.5% slab gels containing 375 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and run in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm glycerol, and 8% (w/v) Na-PFO for 2 h (100 V) at 4 °C. All gels and solutions were precooled to 4 °C for several h before use. Cryo-negative Staining of Wzc—Carbon-coated copper grids (No. 400) were glow-discharged and placed shiny side down on the surface of a 3-μl droplet of sample containing 50 μg/ml His6-Wzc for 2 min and then immediately placed on a 10-μl droplet of freshly prepared 12% (w/v) ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (pH 6.8) containing 1% (w/v) trehalose for several seconds. Grids where then briefly blotted onto double-layered Whatman 50 filter paper, and data were immediately recorded in Oxford system cryo-stage at ∼100 K. Images for each oligomeric complex were recorded and processed as described in Table 1.TABLE 1Cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis informationMicroscopePhilips CM200 FEGModeTEM low dose recording at 100KOperating voltage200 kVMicrograph filmKodak SO-163ScannerUMAX Photolook 3000–256 greyscaleSpot size6Electron dose (electron/Å2)<15Calibrated magnification37.6×Processing Å/pixel3.39SampleWzcWzc Ni-NTA-goldDefocus range (μm)–1.8 to –2.6–1.2 to –2.0Selection box size (Å)164164Total particles selected5,5151,750Particle classes12462Reconstruction mask radius (Å)130130Spatial resolution of volume at FSC = 0.5 (Å)1422 Open table in a new tab Image Processing and Structure Calculation from Single Particle Data—Particles were interactively selected using BOXER software and contrast-normalized. The contrast transfer function (CTF) for each micrograph was determined using the program CTFIT (23Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar), and corrections for amplitudes and phases for particles in each dataset were applied using a structure factor dataset to flip phases (kindly provided by Dr. Steve Ludtke, National Center for Macromolecular Imaging). A set of reference-free class averages were then generated with the complex orientated in multiple particle positions. By following previously described strategies (13Collins R.F. Frye S.A. Kitmitto A. Ford R.C. Tonjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39751-39756Google Scholar), a preliminary three-dimensional model was determined from class averages that represented distinct views of the Wzc complex. The relative orientations of the characteristic views were determined using a Fourier common lines routine, and the resulting averages were combined to generate the preliminary three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional structure was subsequently refined using C4 symmetry, using eight rounds of iterative projection matching, with each refinement assessed by examining convergence by comparison of the Fourier shell correlation of the three-dimensional models generated from each iteration. The final three-dimensional volume was fully converged after six rounds of iterative refinement, and resolution was determined by Fourier shell correlation analysis as previously described (13Collins R.F. Frye S.A. Kitmitto A. Ford R.C. Tonjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39751-39756Google Scholar). Ni-NTA Nanogold Labeling of His6-Wzc—10 μl of N-terminal His6-Wzc (50 μg/ml) was incubated with 3.3 μl (1.8 nm) of Ni-NTA-nanogold (Nanoprobes) for 18 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge for 10 min before cryo-negative staining as described above. Homology Modeling—The crystal structure of chain A of the septum site-determining protein MinD (complexed with Mg-ADP) of the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus horikoshii was used for fitting to the Wzc structure using residues 15–171 (156 amino acids out of 243 total) of the MinD chain A, a region that shares 24% identity and 42% similarity with a continuous region of the Wzc amino acid sequence and which corresponds to ∼61% of its predicted cytoplasmic domain. The BLAST score was 2e-06 for the overall comparison, and examination showed that many of the identical residues are involved at the nucleotide-binding pocket (data not shown). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of Cryo-negatively Stained Wzc Samples—Fig. 1A shows an area of a micrograph of cryo-negatively stained, DDM-solubilized His6-Wzc. As can be seen, the population of complexes was homogeneous, well dispersed, and uniform in size. The inset boxes in Fig. 1A show a magnified and low pass-filtered montage of particles selected for analysis in this study. Two types of high contrast projections could be easily observed from the bulk of the data. One class of particle was between 90 and 100 Å in width with a square appearance and a large stained center. The other class of particles was slightly larger (∼110 × 100 Å) and had a two-layered rounded rectangular appearance with a stain-filled line running along the center of the particle. Analysis of the total selected particles (n = 5515), using reference-free two-dimensional projection classification, identified many additional views of the Wzc particles, some of which are displayed in Fig. 1B. The most obvious class was the particle top view, which had an evident 4-fold rotational symmetry axis. The rounded rectangular particles had a strong bilateral symmetry and represent the side view of the Wzc oligomer (Fig. 1B). The other class averages represented various intermediate orientations between these two archetypal projections (Fig. 1B, central panels). The reference-free classification shows that the particles were positioned within the preservative stain layer in multiple orientations and so were suitable for Euler angle determination using cross-common line projection matching (23Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Identification of C4 Rotational Symmetry in Tetrameric Wzc Complexes—In addition to the 4-fold organization of His6-Wzc observed on TEM “raw” data, several other analyses independently demonstrated that Wzc has a tetrameric organization. First, purification of Wzc using size exclusion chromatography produced one sample peak, which eluted at 350–400 kDa (Fig. 2A). The nature of these Wzc oligomers was further characterized using analytical PFO-PAGE. PFO is a “mild” detergent that preserves high affinity interactions in many membrane protein complexes (22Ramjeesingh M.H.L. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Separation of the Wzc population clearly identified two main bands that migrated at ∼90 kDa and ∼350 kDa (Fig. 2B). Given that the Wzc monomer is 82 kDa, the bands are interpreted as monomeric and tetrameric Wzc species. The formation of the tetramer is not an artifact of the protein concentration and is observed across a wide range of protein concentrations (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). Several bands were observed with molecular masses in excess of 500 kDa; however no larger oligomer complexes were observed by TEM (Fig. 1A). These bands may therefore represent transient oligomer-oligomer contacts in PFO or correspond to the higher molecular mass aggregates we occasionally observed. To quantify the obvious 4-fold symmetry apparent in the reference-free two-dimensional projection classification of Wzc, rotational power analysis was applied to the single particle data (Fig. 2C). This eliminated the possibility of a quasisymmetrical C4 (2–2) arrangement, because strong correlation peaks were only observed for C1, C2, and C4 rotational symmetries, with the strongest signal originating from the C4 comparison. Three-dimensional structure calculations on the Wzc data set were therefore performed using C4 symmetry. Three-dimensional Structure of the Wzc Complex—A three-dimensional structure was calculated from the Wzc single particle data set with C4 symmetry imposed. A molecular envelope of Wzc thresholded at 1 σ above the mean density would accommodate a molecular mass of ∼350 kDa, assuming a protein packing density of 0.73 g/cm3 (24Harpaz Y. Gerstein M. Chothia C. Structure (Camb.). 1994; 2: 641-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This data is consistent with a protein complex of this size (a Wzc tetramer of ∼320 kDa with additional associated detergent). The final resolution of the volume was estimated to be 14 Å using the Fourier shell correlation = 0.5 criteria routinely used for cryo-TEM reconstructions (25Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Plenum Press, San Diego, CA1996Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The iterative structure refinement converged after six rounds, and matrix vector analysis of the asymmetric triangle (Fig. 3A, inset) revealed no significant gaps in data sampling through three-dimensional space. Fig. 3B shows a surface rendering of the Wzc oligomer density map. Viewed from the top, at a threshold of 2 σ above the mean density, the complex is virtually sealed with small holes around the uppermost surface. The top view of the complex is rounded square, with a square edge of 100 Å and a corner-corner distance of 123 Å. The side view of Wzc shows it is slightly longer (∼110 Å high) and has a distinctive appearance similar to an extracted molar tooth with distinctive domed “crown” and separate “root” regions. The upper crown is ∼55 Å high and forms a ring of connected density (∼20–25 Å thick) around the periphery of the complex. From the underside of the crown, four unconnected roots ∼65 Å high emerge. To put the size of the Wzc structure in an in vivo context, the thickness of the E. coli inner membrane measured by cryo-TEM methods in frozen hydrated sections is ∼60 Å (26Matias V.R. Al-Amoudi A. Dubochet J. Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6110-6118Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Membrane Orientation of the Wzc Complex in the Cytoplasmic Membrane—Wzc is a bitopic inner membrane protein, and the periplasmic location of the domain flanked by the two transmembrane segments has been established by Wzc-PhoA fusion experiments (17Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37339-37348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The C terminus must be cytoplasmic to facilitate tyrosine phosphorylation, and as a consequence, the N terminus must also be located in the cytoplasm. To investigate the membrane orientation of the Wzc three-dimensional structure in a quantitative fashion, the N-terminal His6 tag was exploited for Ni-NTA-nanogold labeling; this label is a highly specific His6 reagent that is pH neutral and non-denaturing. Using Ni-NTA-nanogold to label oligomeric complexes may also aid single particle averaging, because the prominent electron density acts as a “target” for two-dimensional alignment algorithms (www.nanoprobes.com). Fig. 4A shows a montage of cryo-negatively stained Wzc particles, which have been incubated with Ni-NTA-nanogold. These Wzc complexes were essentially identical in appearance to those observed without nanogold (Fig. 1A), but multiple gold densities can be easily observed bound to the proteins. With a smaller gold-labeled data set, we were able to generate a second three-dimensional structure at ∼22 Å with additional bound gold density contained within the volume (Fig. 4B). Nanogold (shown in gold) was found in two locations: on the upper half of the root regions and at the bottom of the cavity formed by the roots underneath the crown. As this second Ni-NTA-nanogold location is not physically connected to the protein envelope, it may also represent nonspecific binding or trapped gold particles. However, the location of gold in either position suggests that the roots contain the N terminus and hence are in the cytoplasm, whereas the crown is in the periplasm. Given the location of the N terminus on a root, the alternatively flipped orientation is inconsistent with relative observed volumes of the protein domains. We therefore predict that the root contains the tyrosine kinase domain and is cytoplasmic. For further confirmation, the structure of MinD (an ATP-binding protein) from P. horikoshii was manually fitted into an individual root volume (Fig. 5) (see “Materials and Methods”). There is a good volume match between the MinD model and molecular envelope of Wzc, and this is consistent with our experimentally determined location of the two domains. It should be appreciated that, at 14 Å resolution, the MinD model can only act as an appropriately sized globular volume, and precise orientation of the model within the root domain is not possible. The overall appearance of the structure further suggests this orientation; the roots are globular and compact as would be expected for a soluble kinase-like domain.FIGURE 5Orientation of the His6-Wzc tetramer in the cytoplasmic membrane. The figure illustrates modeling of MinD fragment into the root densities of the Wzc three-dimensional structure. The volume is displayed at 1 σ (red mesh) and 1.5 σ (blue mesh) above the mean density, and the fitted MinD α-polypeptide chain is shown in black. Scale bar = 100 Å. The schematic on the far right shows the predicted topology of Wzc approximately matched with the corresponding domain distribution within the three-dimensional structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional Significance—The E. coli K12 and K30 Wzc homologs share sequence (65% identity; 90% similarity) and topological conservation, and they appear to perform similar functions (27Reid A.N. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The K12 homolog has been reported to form higher molecular weight aggregates, such as trimers and hexamers after cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (17Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37339-37348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the subsequent finding that Wzc can be cross-linked to Wza (20Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) complicates these interpretations. The data described above give unambiguous evidence of the existence of Wzc tetramers. Oligomerization of Wzc is mostly driven by contacts with the periplasmic portions of the protein. Interestingly, this domain contains sequences with a high probability of forming coiled-coil structures (28Morona R. van Den Bosch L. Daniels C. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which are often implicated in protein-protein interactions in a variety of different systems (29Burkhard R. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 204-218PubMed Google Scholar). Although we see no interaction between the roots, such an interaction is predicted from the capacity of the protein to trans-phosphorylate (16Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); adjacent Wzc complexes could be involved in this but seem less likely. The possible role of additional proteins and cellular factors in mediating conformational changes that would facilitate interactions between the roots and phosphorylation are beyond the scope of this study. Cell envelope-spanning multienzyme complexes have been identified in other assembly systems, and some of these contain intracellular membrane-associated proteins with ATPase motifs. For example, the type II protein-secretion pathway in Vibrio cholerae requires the cytoplasmic EpsE ATPase for formation of a subcomplex with membrane proteins EpsL and EpsM (30Sandkvist M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This may serve to couple energy to protein export through the trans-envelope type II complex (31Camberg J.L. Sandkvist M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 32Robien M.A. Krumm B.E. Sandkvist M. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 657-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). EpsE is proposed to form a hexameric ring-like structure, and it represents a larger hexameric ATPase family involved in protein secretion (reviewed in Ref. 31Camberg J.L. Sandkvist M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the type IV secretion system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, VirB4 is one of at least three ATPases associated with the inner membrane (31Camberg J.L. Sandkvist M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In a comparable manner, Wzc may be involved in the assembly of a functional capsule assembly complex or in providing energy for capsule export. Wzc is not related in sequence or domain organization to these proteins, and the wzc mutants so far studied provide no additional insight into such possibilities. Although the structure reported here is from a fully phosphorylated Wzc derivative, phosphorylation is not essential for oligomer formation per se (data not shown), and its role could be confined to mediating additional interactions in a larger biosynthetic complex or dictating specific functions within the complex. Interaction of Wzc with Wza—Experimental data clearly indicate that Wza and Wzc interact (20Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent evidence implicates the periplasmic domain in these interactions, and there is an element of sequence specificity in the recognition of Wza homologs by their cognate Wzc proteins (27Reid A.N. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These interactions are essential for function in capsule assembly. The oligomeric structure of Wza is an octamer (9Beis K. Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kamis A.B. Whitfield C. Naismith J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28227-28232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Nesper J. Hill C.M.D. Paiment A. Harauz G. Beis K. Naismith J.H. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49763-49772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas Wzc is a tetramer. Despite the difference in organization, it is striking that both Wza and Wzc oligomers share 4-fold rotational symmetry and furthermore have very similar widths. This is very suggestive that a specific complex forms between the two oligomers during carbohydrate export. If such a direct complex exists, it would span the periplasmic space. Analogous membrane-spanning complexes are predicted and modeled for several systems (e.g. the type I hemolysin export system requires the assembly of the HlyABD-TolC complex (33Thanabalu T. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6487-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and the AcrAB-TolC drug efflux pump from E. coli (34Nikaido H. Zgurskaya H.I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 215-218PubMed Google Scholar)). In these systems, structural details are largely absent, although a cryo-TEM reconstruction has been performed on the “needle” complex of the type III protein-secretion system (8Marlovits T.C. Kubori T. Sukhan A. Thomas D.R. Galan J.E. Unger V.M. Science. 2004; 306: 1040-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, the differences in the process and proteins involved in type III secretion and those involved in capsular polysaccharide export prevent any extrapolation from the type III protein structural studies. Rather, further structural studies will be required to characterize the putative Wza-Wzc system. Cryo-electron microscopy provides a unique methodology to investigate the structure and interactions of the capsule export system proteins. After establishing the “building blocks” of this biosynthetic machine, it is anticipated that the interactions of larger assemblies will be amenable to study in the future. A structural understanding of the mechanisms of capsule export would not only provide a rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies but could also illuminate and inform Gram-negative secretion processes in general. We thank Prof. Per Bullough and Dr. Peiyi Wang for excellent cryo-electron microscopy facilities and support and Dr. Jeremy Derrick for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2015584929,"ATP7A is a P-type ATPase involved in copper(I) homeostasis in humans. It possesses a long N-terminal tail protruding into the cytosol and containing six copper(I)-binding domains, which are individually folded and capable of binding one copper(I) ion. ATP7A receives copper from a soluble protein, the metallochaperone HAH1. The exact role and interplay of the six soluble domains is still quite unclear, as it has been extensively demonstrated that they are strongly redundant with respect to copper(I) transport in vivo. In the present work, a three-domain (fourth to sixth, MNK456) construct has been investigated in solution by NMR, in the absence and presence of copper(I). In addition, the interaction of MNK456 with copper(I)-HAH1 has been studied. It is proposed that the fourth domain is the preferential site for the initial interaction with the partner. A significant dependence of the overall domain dynamics on the metallation state and on the presence of HAH1 is observed. This dependence could constitute the molecular mechanism to trigger copper(I) translocation and/or ATP7A relocalization from the trans-Golgi network to the plasmatic membrane.

Copper, an essential trace metal, is utilized as a cofactor in a variety of redox and hydrolytic proteins, which in eukaryotes are found in various cellular locations (1.Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). However, copper can be potentially toxic in vivo, and thus its intracellular concentration is presumably strictly controlled (2.O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Disruption of copper homeostasis leads to illness, such as in Menkes or Wilson diseases (5.Menkes J.H. Alter M. Steigleder G.K. Weakley D.R. Sung J.H. Pediatrics. 1962; 29: 764-779PubMed Google Scholar). These latter diseases are caused by mutations in ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively, which translocate copper in the trans-Golgi network or across the plasma membrane (3.Harrison M.D. Jones C.E. Solioz M. Dameron C.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4.Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Even though ATP7A and ATP7B contain six cytosolic copper(I)-binding domains, it appears that one domain (7.Iida M. Terada K.

In addition, only one of the two most C-terminal metal-binding domains is sufficient for correct protein relocalization (10.Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas both C-terminal metal-binding domains (i.e. the fifth and sixth domains) are needed to regulate copper affinity and protein phosphorylation rates (11.Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 2789: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In humans, the function of HAH1 is to transfer copper(I) to the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins (12.Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Cizewski Culotta V. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This process has been investigated through a variety of low-resolution techniques, suggesting that there may be preferential interaction sites within the cytoplasmic tail (13.Walker J.M. Huster D.

Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The possible differentiation in vivo among the six domains, their possible reciprocal interaction(s), and the interactions with HAH1 and with copper(I) are all open matters of discussion. Here, these matters are addressed through the NMR investigation of a three-domain ATP7A construct, spanning domains 4 through 6 (MNK456 hereafter). 2The abbreviations used are: MNK456, three-domain ATP7A construct spanning domains 4–6; MNK56, two-domain ATP7A construct containing domains 5 and 6; MNK2, second binding domain of the ATP7A protein; MNK4, fourth binding domain of the ATP7A protein; MNK5, fifth binding domain of the ATP7A protein; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′ maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; DTT, dithiothreitol; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.2The abbreviations used are: MNK456, three-domain ATP7A construct spanning domains 4–6; MNK56, two-domain ATP7A construct containing domains 5 and 6; MNK2, second binding domain of the ATP7A protein; MNK4, fourth binding domain of the ATP7A protein; MNK5, fifth binding domain of the ATP7A protein; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′ maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; DTT, dithiothreitol; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. This construct presents several points of interest: (i) it contains the last two domains, which are important for catalytic phosphorylation of ATP7B (11.Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 2789: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar); (ii) it contains domain 4, one of the proposed favored interaction sites with HAH1 (14.van Dongen E.M. Klomp L.W. Merkx M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); and (iii) domains 4 and 5 are connected by a 41-residue linker, whereas domains 5 and 6 are connected by a 6-residue linker (shortest interdomain linker in ATP7A). This combination provides insight into the global dynamics and domain interplay of the N-terminal tail of the enzyme and thus information on possible molecular mechanisms in vivo. The three C-terminal metal-binding domains of ATP7A have been expressed as a single construct in Escherichia coli and purified using affinity chromatography based on the use of a His6 tag. The protein has been produced in M9 minimal medium and enriched in 15Nor 15N and 13C for NMR studies. The thermal stability of apoMNK456 has been investigated through 1H-15N HSQC spectra (16.Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-188Crossref Scopus (2417) Google Scholar) at various temperatures, from 298 K up to 323 K. The protein was metallated by titrating it with an acetonitrile complex of copper(I) after reduction with a 5-fold excess of DTT. The titration was followed through 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The MNK56 and MNK4 constructs have been similarly produced in E. coli from rich medium cultures. The protein showed significant precipitation over a span of 1–2 days at concentrations above 500 μm. To minimize sample aggregation and obtain the best quality spectra, NMR samples were typically 200–300 μm in a 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. All spectra were acquired using cryoprobe technology at 500 (for protein dynamics measurements) or 800/900 MHz (for experiments for resonance assignment) spectrometers. The NMR frequencies of backbone nuclei have been assigned using a standard approach based on triple resonance experiments and are given in the supplementary material for both the apo and the fully metallated state (Cu3MNK456) (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The backbone dynamics of MNK456 was studied in the apo form as well as in Cu3MNK456 through the analysis of 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOEs (17.Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The interaction with the human copper(I) chaperone HAH1 has been studied through NMR by titrating isotopically enriched apoMNK456 with unlabeled copper-(I) HAH1 up to a HAH1:MNK456 molar ratio of 8:1. In addition, the backbone dynamics of MNK456 was also studied in the presence of HAH1 at various molar ratios (1:1, 2:1, 4:1). ApoHAH1 was purified from rich medium cultures as described previously (18.Anastassopoulou J. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Katsari E. Rosato A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13046-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), reduced with 2-fold DTT, and then metallated by adding a slight excess of [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ in a N2 atmosphere chamber. Samples were then passed on a desalting column to remove DTT and acetonitrile. The degree of metallation of HAH1 was checked by NMR and found to be essentially 100%. For titrations, copper(I)-HAH1 was added to reduced apoMNK456 samples from which DTT had been removed using a desalting column, in a N2 atmosphere chamber. Relative ratios of HAH1:MNK456 were measured from the intensity of well resolved NMR signals in the methyl region. For chemical labeling experiments, 400 pmol of apoMNK456 alone or in the presence of copper(I)-HAH1 were incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of the cysteine-directed reagent 7-diethylamino-3-(4′ maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM, Sigma) for 2.5 min in the dark under anaerobic conditions. The reaction was quenched with a 10-fold molar excess of β-mercaptoethanol over CPM. The same experimental setup has been used for MNK56 and MNK4. To investigate the role of the various domains within MNK456, the latter construct was partially proteolyzed with trypsin at a 1:2000 (w/w) ratio for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) protease inhibitor. The proteolyzed MNK456 fragments were separated on a 15% Tricine gel, and the separation of the CPM-labeled peptides was monitored under UV light using a Gel-Doc system. The protein fragments were also stained with Coomassie R250. The present protocol is essentially the same as that described elsewhere (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the case of the MNK56 and MNK4 constructs, no digestion was performed. The NMR spectra of MNK456 are quite crowded and showed broadening due to conformational exchange processes, thus complicating the analysis and interpretation of spectra (supplemental Fig. S1). The observed broadening experienced a significant enhancement with increasing protein concentration. The problem was particularly evident for domain 5, as also observed for the isolated domain (15.Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The complexity and behavior of MNK456 in solution prevented a de novo structural characterization of the protein. As the NMR structure of all of the individual domains is available (15.Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19.Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), backbone amide chemical shifts, which are excellent reporters of tertiary structure changes (20.Wishart D.S. Case D.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 338: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), could be compared. Fig. 1 indeed shows that the structure of the three metal-binding domains is conserved in apoMNK456, as significant variations are localized only next to linker regions and are a consequence of the peptide bonds at the N and C termini of each domain (see Equation 1 below). Δδcombind=(Δδ(H))2+125(Δδ(N))22eq 1 After the addition of a 1.0 equivalent of copper(I) to apoMNK456, signals from the residues in the loop containing the metal-binding cysteines (loop I) of the metallated fourth and sixth domains were both already observable (supplemental Fig. S2). In the fifth domain, the signals from the residues in loop I are not observed in the apo or in the copper(I) form. The relative intensity of the signals of the metallated fourth and sixth domains indicates that they have similar affinity for copper (within 20%). When increasing the Cu:MNK456 ratio, broadening of several signals within and close to the metal-binding loops of all three domains is observed. In the fifth domain most signals, even far from the metal-binding region, become extremely weak or undetectable. Based on 15N relaxation data, a distinct dynamic behavior is observed in different MNK456 regions (Fig. 2). Each of the three domains appears to be individually rigid in solution on the subnanosecond time scale, as shown by the relatively uniform 15N R1 and NOE values within each domain, whereas the first linker region experiences extensive dynamics on the same time scale. The overall dynamics of the multidomain construct is somewhat complex. Domain 4 reorients in solution more freely than the other two domains, being allowed to do so by the long flexible linker I (shown in Fig. 2 by the higher R1 and lower R2 values). Indeed, the correlation time for tumbling in solution of domain 4, as calculated from R2/R1 values, is significantly lower than for domains 5 and 6 (7.1 ± 0.3, 12.8 ± 1.3, and 10.8 ± 1.3 ns for domains 4, 5, and 6 respectively). Note that the above values for the correlation times should be regarded as estimates because they are based on the assumption of isotropic reorientation in solution. Conformational equilibria are present in domains 5 and 6, which tumble in solution with similar rates. The similar tumbling rate of the two C-terminal domains is in agreement with what observed for a Bacillus subtilis homolog of ATP7A (21.Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Gonnelli L. Su X.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50506-50513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and can be ascribed to the shortness of linker II. A small degree of uncoupling in the motion of domains 5 and 6 is possibly reflected in the slightly higher correlation time of the former, even though the difference is hardly statistically significant. Loading apoMNK456 with copper(I) induces a constraining of the motional freedom of domain 4 (Fig. 3A), in which apparent correlation time increases from 7.1 ± 0.3 to 8.3 ± 0.6 ns. The mobility of domain 6 appears, instead, globally unaltered. It was not possible to estimate the mobility of domain 5 in the presence of copper(I) because of the aforementioned difficulty in observing signals from its nuclei.FIGURE 3Variation in 15N relaxation parameters between Cu3MNK456 and apoMNK456 (A) and between apoMNK456 in the presence of 3 equivalents of copper(I)-HAH1 and apoMNK456 (B). The simultaneous reduction of R1 values and increase of R2 values indicate a restriction in domain motion in solution (e.g. for domain 4 in panel A, i.e. upon copper(I) binding), which is quantified by an increase in the correlation time for tumbling. Vice versa, an increase of R1 values and reduction of R2 values indicate enhanced tumbling rates, corresponding to a smaller correlation time for tumbling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When apoMNK456 is presented with copper(I)-HAH1, the metal ion is transferred from the chaperone to the ATPase. As shown in Fig. 4, signals of Cys17 and Val18 in the metal-binding loop (loop I) of the apo form of domain 4 disappear upon the addition of copper(I)-HAH1 at a HAH1:MNK456 ratio slightly exceeding 1.0 (i.e. when only one copper(I) ion is available per MNK456 molecule), suggesting a slow kinetics of exchange similar to isolated MNK2 and MNK5 domains (15.Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A reduction of the intensity of signals from the metal-binding loop of domains 5 and 6 is also observed during the titration, but this is much shallower than for domain 4, suggesting that in the initial stages (HAH1: MNK456 ratio up to 1.0) of the titration copper is preferentially transferred to domain 4. The chemical shift variations observed during the titration are very small. Signals from copper(I) domain 6 appear at a HAH1:MNK456 ratio of 2:1, showing that copper(I) eventually is loaded in this domain. To analyze independently the possible preferential interaction of copper(I)-HAH1 with a single domain within the present three-domain construct, an experiment based on chemical labeling with a fluorophore and proteolysis, as applied to the Wilson protein (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), was performed (Fig. 5). Cysteines become labeled by the fluorophore only when they are not engaged in any bond, i.e. when they are reduced and not bound to the metal. Therefore, the detection of the modification by the chemical label, or absence thereof, is indicative of the copper(I)-binding state (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The experiment shows that copper(I)-HAH1 does transfer the metal to MNK456, as HAH1 is (partly) labeled by the fluorophore (separate experiments, not shown, demonstrate that copper(I)-HAH1 does not react with the chemical label). In the presence of excess copper(I)-HAH1 (Fig. 5, rightmost lane), one of the bands from the MNK456 digest disappears, demonstrating preferential protection from the cysteine-directed probe caused by copper(I) transfer (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the disappearing band is about 8,000 Da, indicating that it contains a single domain. As discussed previously for the Wilson protein (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), this experiment shows that copper(I)-HAH1 selects an individual domain in the present three-domain construct as the initial interaction site. The results of NMR experiments (Fig. 4) are fully consistent with this picture and clearly suggest domain 4 as the preferential interaction site. To assess independently the identity of the domain constituting the preferential site for HAH1 docking, we separately produced MNK56 and MNK4 and repeated the chemical labeling experiments (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 clearly shows that copper(I)-HAH1 can transfer its metal cargo to MNK4 but not to MNK56. Transfer to MNK4 is demonstrated by the disappearance of the MNK4 band and the appearance of a lower molecular weight band due to apoHAH1 (Fig. 6, compare the fourth and third lanes). Instead, MNK56 reacts with the fluorophore both in absence and in presence of copper(I)-HAH1 (Fig. 6, first two lanes), demonstrating that it is unable to uptake the metal ion from the chaperone.FIGURE 5Interaction of MNK456 with copper(I)-HAH1 revealed through chemical labeling of free (i.e. not bound to the metal) cysteines with a fluorescent probe. From left to right: first lane, apoMNK456; second lane, apoMNK456 treated with trypsin; third to fifth lanes, apoMNK456 incubated with increasing concentration of copper(I)-HAH1 (MNK456:HAH1 ratios of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1, respectively). The disappearing band from an MNK456 fragment and the band corresponding to apoHAH1 are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Interaction of MNK56 and MNK4 with copper(I)-HAH1 revealed through chemical labeling.

The bands of MNK56, MNK4, and apoHAH1 (formed upon copper(I) transfer) are indicated by arrows.

Instead, in domains 5 and 6 copper(I)-HAH1 induces faster tumbling (tumbling correlation times reduced respectively by 1.4 ± 2.4 and 1.0 ± 1.9 ns). In addition, the presence of HAH1 causes conformational exchange in the linker I region, so that signals from residues in this region are broadened beyond detection. The present data are consistent with a mechanism for copper(I) transfer to MNK456 from HAH1, where the first entry point for the metal ion into the ATPase is provided by domain 4. This is presumably because of MNK4 having a better electrostatic and/or steric complementarity to the physiological partner. Shielding of domains 5 and 6 by domain 4 in MNK456 is unlikely to play a role in tuning the interaction, as the two-domain construct MNK56 does not interact with HAH1 (Fig. 6). Domain 4 has a surface electrostatic potential relatively similar to that of the two metal-binding domains of Ccc2, the yeast homolog of ATP7A, which form a relatively stable adduct with their partner (22.Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41365-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23.Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Bonvin A.M. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 669-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is also relevant that the pI of domain 4 in ATP7A, as well as in ATP7B, is the most similar to that of both domains of yeast Ccc2 (4.0–4.5). Other ATP7A domains, in which the surface is somewhat dissimilar from Ccc2, do not form such an adduct and feature a slow kinetic of interaction with HAH1 (15.Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A role for domain 4 as the preferential interaction site for HAH1 in ATP7B has been proposed recently (14.van Dongen E.M. Klomp L.W. Merkx M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), possibly together with domain 2, whereas earlier work identified only domain 2 (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Notably, domain 2 has a pI slightly higher than 8.0 in ATP7A and ATP7B, thus quite different from domain 4, but the electrostatic surface at the putative interaction site is still compatible with that of HAH1 (13.Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The present data show that copper(I) is anyway distributed over the various domains. It is not possible to ascertain whether transfer to domains other than the fourth happens by way of direct interaction with domain 4 or HAH1 or through the release of free copper(I) in solution. The latter mechanism appears quite unlikely to be physiologically relevant. A second noteworthy conclusion from the present work is that the dynamics of the multidomain MNK456 construct is quite elaborate, depending significantly on the presence of copper(I) and HAH1. This can be the result both of a modulation of interdomain contacts and of the variation of dynamics in the linker I region. There is also some unexpected modulation in the dynamic processes involving the interaction between domains 5 and 6, permitted by the relatively short linker II. It can be suggested that the dependence of domain dynamics on copper(I) and HAH1 (which might be associated also to changes of the time-averaged protein conformation) constitutes a molecular mechanism to signal (internally to the other domains and/or externally to other biomolecules) the status of copper(I) loading of the cytoplasmic tail. Indeed, the present data provide direct experimental support for previous proposals that ATP7A multiple domains could modulate protein relocalization and/or the affinity for copper(I) of the metal binding sites in the trans-membrane region through copper(I)-dependent variations in the conformation and/or dynamics of the cytoplasmic tail (11.Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 2789: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In summary, it is proposed that when interacting with the MNK456 triple domain construct, copper(I)-HAH1 preferentially donates its cargo to domain 4. The present work thus reinforces the view that interaction of ATP7A or ATP7B with its partner metallochaperone does not involve all of the domains equally, with some domains actually interacting more readily than others. This preferential interaction is presumably under kinetic control. Thermodynamically all domains have a similar affinity for copper(I) (25.Wernimont A.K. Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The metal donated by HAH1 is indeed found to be distributed over all domains in MNK456. It might be supposed that in vivo this (re)distribution happens via interdomain contacts. Loading the cytoplasmic tail of ATP7A with copper(I) and the interaction with the partner induce a significant change in ATP7A domain dynamics. This change (or the associated variation of the time-averaged protein conformation) may be relevant to activate copper(I) translocation across the membrane and/or ATP7A relocalization from the trans-Golgi to the cytoplasmic membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2038022612,"Caspase-2 is an initiating caspase required for stress-induced apoptosis in various human cancer cells. Recent studies suggest that it can mediate the death function of tumor suppressor p53 and is activated by a multimeric protein complex, PIDDosome. However, it is not clear how caspase-2 exerts its apoptotic function in cells and whether its enzymatic activity is required for the apoptotic function. In this study, we used both in vitro mitochondrial cytochrome c release assays and cell culture apoptosis analyses to investigate the mechanism by which caspase-2 induces apoptosis. We show that active caspase-2, but neither a catalytically mutated caspase-2 nor active caspase-2 with its inhibitor, can cause cytochrome c release. Caspase-2 failed to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria with Bid–/– background, and the release could be restored by addition of the wild-type Bid protein, but not by Bid with the caspase-2 cleavage site mutated. Caspase-2 was not able to induce cytochrome c release from Bax–/–Bak–/– mitochondria either. In cultured cells, gene deletion of Bax/Bak or Bid abrogated apoptosis induced by overexpression of caspase-2. Collectively, these results indicate that proteolytic activation of Bid and the subsequent induction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through Bax/Bak is essential for apoptosis triggered by caspase-2.

Apoptotic cell death, a cellular suicidal process conserved from nematodes to humans, functions to maintain cell homeostasis and eliminate unwanted and damaged cells in organisms (1.Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12717) Google Scholar, 2.Horvitz H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1701s-1706sPubMed Google Scholar). It is essential for multiple biological events, and its deregulation in humans can lead to diseases such as cancer, immune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases (3.Rinkenberger J.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4.Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar, 5.Nijhawan D. Honarpour N. Wang X. Annu. Rev.

Biochemically, apoptosis is executed by a family of proteases called caspases (7.Fesik S.W. Shi Y. Science. 2001; 294: 1477-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6131) Google Scholar). Caspases can be categorized into two groups, namely upstream or initiating caspases, which are activated by autocatalysis upon sensing death signals, and downstream or executioner caspases, which are activated proteolytically by upstream caspases.In mammalian cells two important caspase activation pathways, the death receptor pathway and the cytochrome c-mediated pathway, have been discovered. The death receptor pathway is induced by tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor family members (9.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 10.Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Upon activation by these agonists, the corresponding receptors trigger formation of a multimeric protein complex, the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DISC recruits and activates the upstream caspase, caspase-8 or caspase-10, which in turn activates the downstream caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. In the cytochrome c pathway (11.Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12.Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is the central event. When cytochrome c release is induced by various apoptotic stimuli, a protein complex called the apoptosome is formed to recruit and activate the upstream caspase, caspase-9, which subsequently activates caspase-3 and caspase-7 and results in apoptosis. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is tightly regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins (13.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 14.Harris M.H. Thompson C.B.

Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). In this family there are anti-apoptotic members (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1), Bcl-2 homologous (BH) 2The abbreviations used are: BH motif, Bcl-2 homologous motif; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; CHO, molecular formula for aldehyde; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RNAi, RNA interference.2The abbreviations used are: BH motif, Bcl-2 homologous motif; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; CHO, molecular formula for aldehyde; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RNAi, RNA interference. 3 motif-only pro-apoptotic members (e.g. Bid, Bad, Bim, etc.), and multi-BH motif pro-apoptotic members (Bax and Bak). Activation of Bax and/or Bak is essential for cytochrome c release. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members function to inhibit their activation, whereas the BH3-only proteins function to either neutralize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or directly activate Bax/Bak.Caspase-8/10 and caspase-9 are not the only initiating caspases. Based on protein sequence, caspase-2 is also a putative initiating caspase (7.Fesik S.W. Shi Y. Science. 2001; 294: 1477-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6131) Google Scholar). In fact, caspase-2 was the first cloned human apoptotic caspase (18.Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). However, because targeted deletion of the caspase-2 gene in mice did not cause any apparent phenotype (19.Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), extensive studies of the enzyme had not been pursued previously. Studies of caspase-2 have also been hampered by a lack of specific enzymological and pharmacological tools. Unfortunately, most commercially available and widely used peptide-based caspase-2 inhibitors and substrates (e.g. those based on the VDVAD or LDESD peptide sequence) can also inhibit or be cleaved by caspase-3. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret experiments in which these inhibitors or substrates were used in cultured cells or a crude cell lysate.More recently, a series of excellent studies have begun to reveal the intriguing mechanism for caspase-2 activation and the prominent role of caspase-2 in apoptosis triggered by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Evidence supports a critical role of caspase-2 in genotoxin-induced apoptosis in multiple, but not all, tested human cancer cell lines (20.Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Caspase-2 might act by mediating the function of tumor suppressor p53, which activates transcription of PIDD (21.Lin Y. Ma W. Benchimol S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Up-regulated PIDD, alone with other protein factors such as RAIDD, can form a multiprotein complex named the PIDDosme to recruit and activate caspase-2 (22.Tinel A. Tschopp J. Science. 2004; 304: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This mechanism, similar to those for activation of caspase-9 and caspase-8/10, indicates that induced protein multimerization is a common theme for activation of initiating caspases.Another important question is how activated caspase-2 causes apoptosis. Biochemical studies have shown that Bid, a BH3 motif-only protein, can be cleaved by caspase-2 (23.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3764) Google Scholar, 24.Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Therefore, proteolytic activation of Bid and the subsequent induction of the cytochrome c pathway present one conceivable mechanism for caspase-2 to trigger apoptosis (24.Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, this scenario has not been validated in cells. Further, it was proposed recently that caspase-2 can also induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release in a Bid-independent manner (24.Guo Y.

These assumptions were made based on an in vitro cytochrome c release assay using isolated mitochondria with an immunologically non-detectable level of Bid (24.Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A.

Additionally, it is formally possible that caspase-2 might also be able to trigger apoptosis independently of any mitochondrial event. In this current study, we investigated how caspase-2 triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release in vitro and how it induces apoptosis in cultured cells. We found that proteolytic activation of Bid is essential for cytochrome c release and the subsequent apoptosis induced by caspase-2 and that this whole process is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Anti-cytochrome c (catalog number 556433) and anti-human caspase-2 (catalog number 611022) antibodies were from BD Pharmingen. Anti-tubulin antibody (catalog number CP06) was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-Bid antibody was a gift from Dr. Xiaodong Wang (27.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Caspase-2 peptide substrate Ac-LDESD-AMC (catalog number 218818) and caspase-2 inhibitor Ac-VDVAD-CHO (catalog number 218729) were from Calbiochem.Plasmids—Human caspase-2 cDNA (MGC-2181) was from the American Type Culture Collection. From caspase-2 cDNA, a DNA fragment encoding for truncated caspase-2 (residues 153–435) lacking the pro-domain was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET28a (Novagen) for bacteria expression, and a DNA fragment encoding for the full-length caspase-2 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector for mammalian cell expression. pET28b-caspase-8, pET15b-Bid, pCDNA3.1-Bax, and pET15b-Bcl-XL were gifts from Dr. Xiaodong Wang. pCDNA3.1-Bid was generated from pET15b-Bid by PCR amplification and subcloning. A catalytically inactive mutant (C303S) and two auto-processing mutants (D316G and D316G/D330G) of human caspase-2, and non-cleavable human Bid mutant (D60A) were made by site-directed mutagenesis.

Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Subsequently, the expression of recombinant proteins was induced by incubating with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–5 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and subject to standard nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. All purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h at 4°C. Aliquots were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.Cell Culture—SV40-transformed wild-type, Bax–/–Bak–/–, and Bid–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were gifts from Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer (16.Lindsten T.

HeLa cells and MEFs were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Mitochondria Preparation—HeLa cells or MEFs were trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cell pellets were suspended in 5× volume of buffer B (buffer A supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences) and 250 mm sucrose). After incubation on ice for 15 min, cells were broken by passage 20 times through 22-gauge needles. The cell lysates were subject to centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting mitochondrial pellets were re-suspended in Buffer B.In Vitro Cytochrome c Release Assay—In a final volume of 25 μl buffer B, 5 μl of mitochondria (3 mg of protein/ml) from either HeLa or MEF cells was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with caspase-2 and other components as indicated in individual experiments. After incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatants were collected, boiled with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis to detect released cytochrome c. All experiments were performed at least three times.Caspase-2 Activity Assay—In the presence or absence of 400 nm caspase-2 inhibitor Ac-VDVAD-CHO the indicated amount of recombinant wild-type or mutant caspase-2 was incubated with 20 μm caspase-2 substrate (LDESD-AMC) in a total volume of 25 μl of buffer B. The generation of fluorescent signal (relative fluorescent units) indicative of caspase-2 activity was measured by an automated spectrophotometer at 30 °C. The initial rate (relative fluorescent units/min) with S.D. was calculated from three independent experiments.Apoptosis Assay—Mammalian cell culture transfection was performed using a polyethylenimine reagent (Sigma). MEFs were seeded in 10-cm plates the previous day. When reaching ∼70% confluence, the MEFs were transiently transfected with 200 ng of pmaxGFP (Amaxa) and other plasmids as indicated in individual experiments (10 μg of vector plasmid pCDNA3, wild-type, or C303S caspase-2 plasmid; 50 ng of Bax or Bid). The cells were harvested and stained with annexin V-Alexa 647 (catalog number A23204 from Invitrogen) 9–12 h after transfection. The quantification of apoptosis was performed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) followed by analysis using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The apoptosis percentage was scored by determining the ratio of annexin-V positive cells within the GFP positive populations. The results were obtained from three independent experiments with S.D.Generation of Stable Cell Lines—HeLa cells were transfected with the pSUPERIOR-Bid plasmid and selected with 0.2 μg/ml puromycin. Most cell lines, derived from puromycin-resistant colonies, stably express a low level of Bid as compared with parental cells. Two of them (Bid RNA interference (RNAi) cell lines iBid-A and iBid-B) were randomly chosen for the in vitro cytochrome c release assay. HeLa cells stably transfected with pSUPERIOR-LacZ were generated in parallel as the controls.RESULTSRequirement of the Enzymatic Activity of Caspase-2 for Cytochrome c Release—It has been proposed that the enzymatic activity of caspase-2 is not required for its function to release mitochondrial cytochrome c in vitro; rather, the autocatalytic processing of caspase-2 is required for this function (25.Robertson J.D.

Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49575-49578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we expressed and purified a series of recombinant caspase-2 proteins (all with the prodomain deleted) including the wild-type protein, a catalytically inactive C303S mutant (designated CS in Figs. 1 and 4), an auto-cleavage site D316G mutant (designated DG in Fig. 1), and a mutant with both Asp-316 and the second auto-cleavage site, Asp-330, mutated to Gly (D316G/D330G; designated D2G2 in Fig. 1). The purified wild-type and D316G mutant caspase-2 were proteolytically processed with distinctive patterns, whereas the C303S and D316G/D330G mutants were not processed (Fig. 1A). We measured the enzymatic activity of these recombinant proteins using a fluorogenic peptide substrate for caspase-2, LDESD-AMC. As shown in Fig. 1B, wild-type caspase-2 possesses strong catalytic activity that can be inhibited by a low concentration of caspase-2 peptide inhibitor (Ac-VDVAD-CHO; 400 nm); the D316G mutant is also active, though its activity is severalfold weaker than that of the wild-type enzyme. Neither the C303S mutant or the D316G/D330G double mutant are functional. Subsequently, we performed an in vitro mitochondrial cytochrome c release assay by using these recombinant proteins and mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells. Consistent with previous reports, wild-type recombinant caspase-2 resulted in robust cytochrome c release from mitochondria to supernatant, whereas mutation of its catalytic site (C303S mutation) abrogated its ability to release cytochrome c (24.Guo Y.

Kropotov A. Vakifahmetoglu H. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the D316G mutant, which has modest catalytic activity compared with wild-type caspase-2, also induced clear cytochrome c release when a higher amount of enzyme was added (Fig. 1C). The D316G/D330G mutant, catalytically inactive under this condition, failed to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 1C). Further, we used caspase-2 peptide inhibitor in combination with the wild-type caspase-2, which is fully processed (Fig. 1A). Under this condition, caspase-2 enzymatic activity was completely inhibited (Fig. 1B), and its cytochrome c releasing function was also blocked (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the enzymatic activity of caspase-2 is required for its function to release cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria, and the autocatalytic processing alone is not sufficient for this function. Because the D316G mutant can also cause cytochrome c release (Fig. 1C), whereas the proteolytic processing pattern of this mutant is clearly different from that of wild-type caspase-2 (Fig. 1A), we suggest that autocatalytic processing of caspase-2 per se does not play any specific, caspase activity-independent role in inducing mitochondrial cytochrome c release.FIGURE 4Bid and Bax/Bak are required for apoptosis induced by caspase-2 in cultured cells. Wild-type (WT), Bax–/–Bak–/–, and Bid–/– MEFs were transfected with, where indicated, vector DNA, wild-type (WT), or catalytically inactive (CS, C303S) caspase-2 (Casp2), Bax, and Bid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GFP was co-transfected in all samples in order to score transfected population. A, immunoblotting against caspase-2 in transfected cells (using an antibody that recognizes transfected human caspase-2 but not endogenous mouse caspase-2) was performed. Tubulin was immunoblotted as the loading control. B, after transfection, apoptosis was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The GFP and annexin V double positive cells were detected by flow cytometry and scored as transfected apoptotic cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation by the Bcl-2 Family Proteins—The Bcl-2 family proteins are the master regulators of mitochondrial apoptotic events (13.Gross A.

Therefore, we tested in vitro whether caspase-2-induced cytochrome c release is also regulated by these proteins. Indeed, addition of recombinant Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, prevented cytochrome c release caused by caspase-2 (Fig. 2A). Because activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members Bax and/or Bak is essential for mitochondrial protein release during apoptosis, we then examined whether they also form the “requisite gateway” for caspase-2-triggered cytochrome c release (17.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar).

Whereas caspase-2 activity caused cytochrome c release from mitochondria isolated from wild-type MEFs in a Bcl-XL-regulated manner (Fig. 2B), deletion of Bax and Bak genes abrogated caspase-2-induced cytochrome c release, and this loss of function could not be restored by the addition of an excess amount of recombinant Bid, a BH3 motif-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (Fig. 2B). These experiments indicate that caspase-2-triggered cytochrome c release is subject to regulation by Bcl-2 family members and is mediated by the activation of Bax and/or Bak.FIGURE 2The function of caspase-2 to release cytochrome c in vitro can be inhibited by Bcl-XL and requires Bax and/or Bak. A, inhibition by Bcl-XL. In the cytochrome c release assay, 100 ng of recombinant caspase-2 (Casp2) and/or Bcl-XL were added as indicated. Mit, HeLa, mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells. B, requirement of Bax/Bak. The cytochrome c release assay was performed using mitochondria isolated from MEFs with wild-type (Mit, WT) or Bax–/–Bak–/– (Mit, Bax–/–Bak–/–) background as indicated. Recombinant proteins (100 ng of caspase-2 (Casp2), 100 ng of Bcl-XL, or 60 ng of Bid) and 400 nm caspase-2 inhibitor Ac-DAVAD-CHO (C2 Inh) were added as indicated.

A common mechanism for activating Bax/Bak is through the action of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family members. Interestingly, it has been reported that caspase-2 can cleave Bid, a BH3-only protein (23.Li H.

However, an alternative mechanism appears to exist, because Bid is mainly a cytosolic protein whereas recombinant, purified caspase-2 can directly release cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria (24.Guo Y.

All erm genes examined thus far encode N6-monomethyltransferases or N6,N6-dimethyltransferases that show absolute specificity for nucleotide A2058 in 23 S rRNA. Monomethylation at A2058 confers resistance to a subset of the macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLSB) group of antibiotics and no resistance to the latest macrolide derivatives, the ketolides.

Treatment for tuberculosis often requires extended courses with several antibiotics, and with resistant strains becoming more prevalent (2Dye C. Williams B.G. Espinal M.A. Raviglione M.C. Science. 2002; 295: 2042-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), drug therapy is not always successful.

Verde S.C. Portugal C. David H.L. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the recently discovered resistance determinant, erm(37) (formerly ermMT), also contributes to the lack of macrolide susceptibility in MTC species (7Buriánková K.

The erm(37) determinant is a truncated homologue of the erm genes found in a diverse range of pathogenic and drug-producing bacteria (8Roberts M.C. Sutcliffe J. Courvalin P. Jensen L.B. Rood J. Seppala H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the erm family of genes all encode methyltransferases that specifically methylate the N6 position of nucleotide A2058 in 23 S rRNA (Escherichia coli numbering) but differ as to whether they monomethylate or dimethylate this nucleotide (9Skinner R.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Erm monomethyltransferases are found predominantly in drug-producing actinomycetes species and confer the MLSB type I phenotype with high resistance to lincosamides, low to moderate resistance to macrolide and streptogramin B antibiotics (10Weisblum B.

Erm dimethyltransferases confer the MLSB type II phenotype with high resistance to all macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics (8Roberts M.C. Sutcliffe J. Courvalin P. Jensen L.B.

Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Type II MLSB resistance with dimethylation of the rRNA is the more common mechanism in bacterial pathogens. The erm(37) gene is, however, atypical as it confers resistance that falls between the type I and type II categories. Expression of the M. tuberculosis erm(37) gene in the non-tuberculous mycobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis, confers a pattern similar to type I resistance (7Buriánková K. Doucet-Populaire F. Dorson O. Gondran A. Ghnassia J.-C. Weiser J. Pernodet J.-L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas authentic MTC hosts are resistant to the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin (3Falzari K. Zhu Z. Pan D. Liu H. Hongmanee P. Franzblau S.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 4Rastogi N. Goh K.S. Berchel M. Bryskier A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2848-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) which is more indicative of type II resistance. In this study, we first established that erm(37) is indeed responsible for telithromycin resistance in MTC strains. This was achieved using an attenuated MTC strain, BCG-Pasteur, utilized in production of the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine; the BCG-Pasteur strain has lost the RD2 chromosome region containing erm(37) (13Behr M.A. Wilson M.A. Gill W.P. Salamon H. Schoolnik G.K. Rane S. Small P.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1520-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and is susceptible to telithromycin (4Rastogi N. Goh K.S. Berchel M. Bryskier A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2848-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Complementation of BCG-Pasteur with recombinant erm(37) restores telithromycin resistance to the level observed in virulent MTC strains and in a BCG strain that still has an intact RD2 region (BCG-Moreau). Introduction of the dimethyltransferase gene erm(E) conferred BCG-Pasteur with even higher telithromycin resistance, whereas the monomethyltransferase erm(O) conferred no telithromycin resistance. Paradoxically (but consistent with a previous report (7Buriánková K. Doucet-Populaire F. Dorson O. Gondran A. Ghnassia J.-C. Weiser J. Pernodet J.-L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)), expression of recombinant erm(37) in M. smegmatis conferred the same phenotype as erm(O), with no significant resistance to telithromycin. A molecular explanation is needed to understand the disparate erm(37) phenotypes in the different mycobacterial strains. We employed matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) tandem mass spectrometry to define precisely the locations and number of methyl groups added by Erm(37) to the rRNAs in its authentic MTC host as well as to the rRNA of recombinant M. smegmatis strains. In its MTC host, Erm(37) initially monomethylates nucleotide A2058 but then proceeds to modify one or both of the neighboring nucleotides to add up to three methyl groups (at A2057, A2058, and A2059, Fig. 1). This unique configuration of methyl groups explains the resistance exhibited by the MTC strains, which is distinct from both the type I and type II MLSB patterns. In M. smegmatis, Erm(37) monomethylates A2058 but adds extra methyl groups only sparingly at A2057 or A2059 and produces an overall methylation pattern that is consistent with the type I MLSB phenotype.

Kanamycin (Sigma) was added at 15 μg/ml to maintain the plasmids in the mycobacterial strains.

Short oligonucleotides were eluted with 10 mm triethylammonium acetate/6% acetonitrile (pH 7.0), larger ones with 10 mm triethylammonium acetate/25% acetonitrile. The oligonucleotides were analyzed using a Voyager STR MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in reflector time-of-flight mode detecting positive ions (15Andersen T.E. Porse B.T. Kirpekar F.

Primer Extension—A 5′-32P-labeled deoxynucleotide primer (5′-GTAGTGAAGG-TCCCGGGG) complementary to the C2063–C2080 region of Mycobacterium 23 S rRNA was extended with 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences) using a mixture of 1 mm dTTP, dCTP, 5 mm ddGTP, and 1.5 pmol rRNA as template.

Resistance and erm(37)—Microbiological studies on members of the M. tuberculosis complex (TABLE ONE) indicate that erm(37) plays an important role in resistance to MLSB antibiotics (7Buriánková K. Doucet-Populaire F. Dorson O. Gondran A. Ghnassia J.-C. Weiser J. Pernodet J.-L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as well as to the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin (TABLE TWO). M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. microti, M. bovis, and the BCG-Moreau strain all possess an active chromosomal copy of erm(37) and exhibit relatively high resistance to telithromycin. The BCG-Pasteur strain differs essentially only in its lack of the erm(37) determinant and its susceptibility to telithromycin. Complementation of BCG-Pasteur with a plasmid-encoded copy of erm(37) restores the telithromycin-resistant phenotype. Expression of the monomethyltransferase erm(O) confers no telithromycin resistance in BCG-Pasteur, whereas high resistance is conferred by the dimethyltransferase erm(E) (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOSusceptibilities of species from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex toward the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin All strains, with the exception of M. bovis BCG-Pasteur, possess the erm(37) gene.

The masses of rRNA oligonucleotides containing nucleotide A2058 were measured by MALDI mass spectrometry. Digestion of rRNA with the nucleotide-specific RNases A and T1 yields fragments of predictable and suitable sizes, although many fragments have similar or identical masses and often produce a spectrum that is difficult to interpret. Here, we obtained an unambiguous rRNA analysis by preselecting the mycobacterial 23 S sequence from G2035 to G2087 (Fig. 1). Digestion of this sequence gives rise to oligonucleotides containing A2058 (an RNase A octamer of m/z 2659.4 or an RNase T1 pentamer of m/z 1680.3) that form unique and clearly defined peaks in the mass spectra. erm(37) Expression—When the BCG-Pasteur and -Moreau strains were grown without erythromycin, the RNase T1 fragment AAAAGp formed a single peak at 1680.3 m/z (Fig. 2), showing that there had been no methylation at A2058. Growth of the BCG-Moreau strain with erythromycin results in loss of the m/z 1680.3 peak and the appearance of new peaks at m/z 1694.3, 1708.3, and 1722.3 (Fig. 2), corresponding to the addition of one, two, and three methyl groups. This methylation pattern was verified by RNase A digestion of the rRNAs, producing a fragment containing A2058 (GAAAAGACp) that runs at m/z 2659.4 and increases to m/z 2673.4, 2687.4, and 2701.4 when cells are incubated with erythromycin (data not shown). Methylation of the rRNA and the ability to grow in erythromycin were dependent on erm(37) expression. The BCG-Pasteur strain did not grow in the presence of erythromycin at 20 μg/ml. rRNA Target of Erm(37)—The sites of Erm(37) methylation in the rRNA were pinpointed by analyzing the 1694.3, 1708.3, and 1722.3 m/z fragments using MALDI quadrupole-TOF tandem mass spectrometry. In this approach, the individual RNA ions are selected and then fragmented to reveal the mass of each nucleotide (Fig. 3A). The 14-Da increase in the m/z of the 1694.3 ion was shown unambiguously to reside in nucleotide A2058 (Fig. 3B) and corresponds to the addition of a single methyl group here. The 1708.3 m/z ion with two methyl groups was analyzed in a similar manner (Fig. 3C) and was a mixture of products, which collectively were methylated at A2057, A2058, and A2059. This pattern is adequately explained by the presence of two products, one being methylated at A2057 and A2058 and the second being methylated at A2058 and A2059. In theory, a product with single methyl groups at A2057 and A2059 is also possible but is extremely unlikely as no intermediate methylated only at A2057 or A2059 was observed in the 1694.3 m/z ion. Another formal possibility, that one of the adenosines was dimethylated, was ruled out in parallel experiments using reverse transcriptase primer extension (Fig. 4). The largest AAAAGp ion at 1722.3 m/z was unambiguously identified by tandem mass spectrometry to be a unique product with one methyl group on each of the three adenosines at 2057, 2058, and 2059 (Fig. 3D). erm(37) Expression in M. smegmatis—The erm(37) gene from M. tuberculosis was inserted after a constitutive promoter in a plasmid and expressed in M. smegmatis (TABLE ONE). Similar constructions were made with erm(O) and erm(E), which encode well characterized A2058 mono- and dimethyltransferases, respectively. M. smegmatis possesses its own chromosome-encoded methyltransferase gene erm(38), expression of which requires induction by erythromycin or similar compounds (18Nash K.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Pfister P. Corti N. Hobbie S. Bruell C. Zarivach R. Yonath A. Böttger E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3803-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The erm(38) gene was held silent under the growth conditions used here, and this is evident from the lack of A2058 methylation in the control strain containing the empty plasmid (Fig. 5B). The rRNA from the M. smegmatis strain expressing erm(O) acquired a single methyl group (Fig. 5C), and further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (not shown) demonstrated unambiguously that A2058 was stoichiometrically monomethylated and that no methylation occurred at either of the neighboring nucleotides. The rRNA analyses from the strain expressing erm(E) were also unequivocal and revealed specific and stoichiometric dimethylation at A2058 (Fig. 5D). Expression of erm(37) in M. smegmatis gave rise to more complicated MALDI spectra (Fig. 5E) with signals corresponding to a small quantity of unmethylated rRNA (m/z 2659.4), a major product with one methyl group (m/z 2673.4), and a minor product with two methyl groups (m/z 2687.4). The monomethylated rRNA fragment was shown by tandem mass spectrometry to be methylated solely on A2058. Analysis of the peak with two methyl groups at m/z 2687.4 showed it to be identical to the corresponding peak from BCG-Moreau cells containing a mixture of rRNA with single methyl groups on A2057 and A2058 and rRNA with single methyl groups on A2058 and A2059. No ion at m/z 2687.4 (potentially with three methyl groups) could be detected following erm(37) expression in M. smegmatis. All data were corroborated by mass spectrometry analysis following RNase T1 digestion (not shown). Reverse transcriptase analyses of the rRNAs (Fig. 4) confirmed the lack of any N6,N6-dimethylation by Erm(37) or Erm(O) and showed that Erm(E) catalyzed N6,N6-dimethylation exclusively at A2058 in M. smegmatis 23S rRNA. The Erm(37) methyltransferase is highly conserved in the MTC members M. africanum, M. microti, M. bovis, and M. tuberculosis and is 100% identical in the latter two species (21Cole S.T. Brosch R.

Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 2967-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), in keeping with their extremely close phylogeny (24Frothingham R. Hills H.G. Wilson K.H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1994; 32: 1639-1643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two strains of MTC were used to deduce the function of erm(37). The two M. bovis BCG vaccine strains, Pasteur and Moreau, originate from an isogenic source but have diverged over the last few decades such that erm(37) has been lost in the Pasteur strain but retained in the Moreau strain. The Moreau strain, like the other MTC strains, is resistant to MLSB antibiotics (7Buriánková K. Doucet-Populaire F. Dorson O. Gondran A. Ghnassia J.-C. Weiser J. Pernodet J.-L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and to the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin (TABLE TWO). The Pasteur strain shows no such resistance; however, the MTC resistance phenotype is reestablished in the Pasteur strain when it is complemented with a plasmid-encoded copy of erm(37). The MLSB ketolide resistance conferred by Erm(37) is unusual, as it falls between the type I and type II patterns (4Rastogi N. Goh K.S. Berchel M. Bryskier A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2848-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Buriánková K. Doucet-Populaire F. Dorson O. Gondran A. Ghnassia J.-C. Weiser J. Pernodet J.-L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We show here that this phenotype is linked with the unique manner in which Erm(37) methylates the mycobacterial 23 S rRNA. Expression of the chromosome-coded erm(37) gene in MTC strains requires pre-incubation with an antibiotic such as erythromycin. Expression of erm(37) results in methylation of the 23 S rRNA, and this is seen as a series of shifts in the AAAAGp ion signal, corresponding to the addition of one, two, and three methyl groups (Fig. 2). The singly methylated AAAAGp ion was fragmented and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry revealing that the methyl group was attached exclusively to A2058. Thus, the first reaction carried out by Erm(37) is to monomethylate specifically at A2058. The methyltransferase then adds a second methyl group at A2057 or A2059 (the m/z 1708.3 ion, Fig. 3C) before proceeding to add a third methyl group (m/z 1722.3 ion) such that the rRNA becomes equipped with a single methyl group on each of the three nucleotides, A2057, A2058, and A2059. Despite its extended span of activity, Erm(37) acts as a monomethyltransferase at each of the nucleotides it modifies. In many bacteria that possess an erm gene, expression requires prior induction with low concentrations of erythromycin or a similar compound. Induction mechanisms are found in pathogenic and drug-producing bacteria (25Weisblum B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) as well as in the saprophyte M. smegmatis (20Madsen C.T. Jakobsen L. Douthwaite S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 3803-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and generally function via translational attenuation at a leader sequence upstream of the erm cistron. The MTC erm(37) gene has no such leader sequence. Instead, erm(37) expression appears to be transcriptionally controlled as part of a multidrug resistance regulon (26Morris R.P. Nguyen L. Gatfield J. Visconti K. Nguyen K. Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Liu Y. Heifets L. Pieters J. Schoolnik G. Thompson C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12200-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The regulon is activated by the protein WhiB7, which is expressed in response to several compounds including erythromycin. The intensity of the response increases with the concentration of these compounds (26Morris R.P. Nguyen L. Gatfield J. Visconti K. Nguyen K. Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Liu Y. Heifets L. Pieters J. Schoolnik G. Thompson C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12200-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The concentration of erythromycin used here to promote erm(37) expression results in a relatively minor proportion of trimethylated rRNA (Fig. 2). Our resistance data indicate that telithromycin also elicits WhiB7/Erm(37) expression. The higher concentrations of telithromycin used in the minimal inhibitory concentration experiments would be expected to stimulate Erm(37) production and consequently increase the proportion of trimethylated rRNA beyond that seen here with erythromycin. Multiple methylations are required at or adjacent to A2058 to confer telithromycin resistance; thus the relatively high level of resistance observed here (TABLE TWO) is consistent with a substantial proportion of the rRNA being trimethylated. The trimethylation pattern created by Erm(37) on mycobacterial rRNA has not been seen in any other Erm/host systems studied previously. Also unusual is the 2057–2611-bp closing helix 73 (Fig. 1), which is A-U in mycobacterial 23 S rRNA as opposed to G-C in the majority of bacteria, including other Gram-positive bacteria that harbor an erm gene (27Cannone J.J. Subramanian S. Schnare M.N. Collett J.R. D'Souza L.M. Du Y. Feng B. Lin N. Madabusi L.V. Muller K.M. Pande N. Shang Z. Yu N. Gutell R.R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 2-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). It could thus be envisaged that the structure of mycobacterial rRNA might reduce the stringency of Erm methyltransferases for their target and might be responsible for the atypical methylation pattern. We ruled out this idea after expressing erm(O) and erm(E) from plasmids in the BCG-Pasteur strain, where the genes produced phenotypes fully consistent with erm mono- and dimethyltransferases, respectively. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analyses of the methylation patterns produced by Erm(O) and Erm(E) in M. smegmatis rRNA confirmed that both enzymes completely retain their fidelity and mono- and dimethylate exclusively at nucleotide A2058 (Fig. 5). The current evidence indicates that the lax stringency of the M. tuberculosis Erm(37) methyltransferase is an intrinsic property of its own structure. This lax stringency is also evident, albeit to a lesser extent, when erm(37) is expressed in M. smegmatis. In M. smegmatis, the major Erm(37) product is monomethylated A2058 (Fig. 5) with minor amounts of methylation at A2057 or A2059; however, no product with three methyl groups was detected. The methylation pattern produced by Erm(37) in M. smegmatis thus fits well with the MLSB type I phenotype that has been reported (7Buriánková K. Doucet-Populaire F. Dorson O. Gondran A. Ghnassia J.-C. Weiser J. Pernodet J.-L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Some general inferences about the interaction of Erm methyltransferases with their rRNA substrate can be drawn. NMR studies on Erm(B) (formerly ErmAM) (28Yu L. Petros A.M. Schnuchel A. Zhong P.

The larger N-terminal domain contains the catalytic site adjacent to the binding site for the S-adenosylmethionine cofactor (30Schluckebier G. Zhong P. Stewart K.D. Kavanaugh T.J. Abad-Zapatero C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies on Erm(B) (31Farrow K.A. Lyras D. Polekhina G. Koutsis K. Parker M.W. Rood J.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Erm(C)′ (32Maravic G. Feder M. Pongor S. Flögel M. Bujnicki J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) fit well with the structures and indicate that the main substrate recognition motifs are within the positively charged cleft between the two domains (33Maravic G. Bujnicki J.M. Feder M. Pongor S. Flögel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4941-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Erm(37), Erm(E), and Erm(O) sequences can be modeled into the Erm(B)/Erm(C)′ structures and show the same distribution of surface charges; any significant differences lie within the C-terminal domain. As Erm(37) seems to possess all of the structures necessary for cofactor binding, catalytic activity, and RNA recognition, the portions missing from the truncated C-terminal domain of Erm(37) probably function to stabilize methyltransferases on the rRNA substrate. The configuration of methyl groups added by Erm(37) is unique and confers its MTC hosts with an atypical MLSB phenotype including resistance to the ketolide telithromycin. Although the semi-synthetic ketolide drugs are too recent an addition to the antimicrobial scene to be linked with selection for the unusual function of Erm(37), the ketolide binding site (34Berisio R.

https://openalex.org/W1975295243,"CovR (CsrR) is a response regulator of gene expression in Streptococcus pyogenes. It regulates ∼15% of the genome, including the genes encoding several streptococcal virulence factors, and acts primarily as a repressor rather than an activator of transcription. We showed that in vitro, CovR is sufficient to repress transcription from the sag promoter, which directs the expression of streptolysin S, a hemolysin that can damage the membranes of eukaryotic cells and subcellular organelles. Repression was stimulated 10-fold by phosphorylation of CovR with acetyl phosphate. In contrast to binding at the has and cov promoters, which direct the expression of genes involved in capsule biosynthesis and of CovR itself, binding of CovR to Psag was highly cooperative. CovR bound to two extended regions of Psag, an upstream region overlapping the -35 and -10 promoter elements and a downstream region overlapping the translation initiation signals of the sagA gene. Each of these regions contains only a single consensus CovR binding sequence, ATTARA, which at the has promoter defines individual sites to which CovR binds non-cooperatively. At Phas and Pcov the T residues in the sequence ATTARA are important for CovR binding. However, using uracil interference experiments we find that although the ATTARA sequence in the Psag upstream region contains thymine residues important for CovR binding, important thymine residues in the Psag downstream region are located outside this sequence. Furthermore, again in contrast to its behavior at the has and cov promoters where phosphorylation of CovR leads to a 2–3-fold increase in DNA binding affinity, binding of CovR to the sag promoter was stimulated 8–32-fold by phosphorylation. We suggest that these differences in CovR binding mean that individual promoters will be repressed at different intracellular levels of phosphorylated CovR, permitting differences in the response of members of the CovR regulon to environmental and internal metabolic signals.

Two component regulatory systems and the related phosphorelay systems allow bacteria to sense changes in their internal or external environment and to respond to these changes by alterations in gene expression (1Stock A.M.

In a typical two-component system, a sensor kinase (membrane bound in the case of those systems that sense the external environment) autophosphorylates in response to a signal. Usually a histidine residue in the sensor kinase receives a phosphoryl group from the low molecular weight donor ATP. This phosphoryl group is then transferred to an aspartate residue on a second protein, the response regulator. Phosphorylation of the response regulator alters the ability of the response regulator to interact with either DNA or with DNA and RNA polymerase to activate or repress transcription in response to the signal received by the sensor kinase. Some sensor kinases are bifunctional (4Alves R. Savageau M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They not only act as kinases but can modulate the activity of their cognate response regulator proteins by acting as phosphatases to remove the phosphoryl group from the response regulator.

Unlike the majority of response regulators, CovR acts primarily to repress transcription of genes under its regulation (7Graham M.R. Smoot L.M. Migliaccio C.A. Virtaneva K. Sturdevant D.E. Porcella S.F. Federle M.J. Adams G.J. Scott J.R. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13855-13860Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). It is encoded as part of an operon that includes CovS (CsrS) (5Levin J.C. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), a protein that shows homology to histidine kinases, and so CovS and CovR are thought to act as a two-component regulatory system in GAS. CovS has been shown to be involved in Mg2+-stimulated repression of the has operon (responsible for capsule synthesis) by CovR (9Gryllos I. Levin J.C. Wessels M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The CovR/S system is also responsible for mediating, at least in part, the general stress response of GAS to changes in temperature, pH, and osmolarity (10Dalton T.L. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Group A streptococci phosphorylated CovR GAS is a major human pathogen that causes a wide variety of diseases ranging from self-limiting pharyngitis and superficial skin infections to severe invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and systemic infections that can result in toxic shock syndrome (11Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). That a single strain of GAS is able to cause such a variety of infections suggests that the bacterium can adapt to many different environmental conditions within the human host. Based upon its global influence on gene expression and stress resistance, it seems probable that the activity of the CovR/S two-component regulatory system is central to these adaptations and thus is an important factor determining the course of different GAS infections. The interaction between CovR and some of the promoters that it represses has been examined (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Miller A.A. Engleberg N.C. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Bernish B. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4786-4793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CovR binds to the has, sag, speB, ska, and speMF/sda promoters, which direct the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of capsule, streptolysin S, pyrogenic exotoxin B, streptokinase, and DNase, respectively. CovR also binds to the promoter of its own gene, covR, and thus regulates its own transcription (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At all these promoters, CovR interacts with sequences within regions of DNA of 100 base pairs or more. Phosphorylation of CovR by incubation with acetyl phosphate results in moderate increases in affinity (2–3-fold) of CovR for DNA at the has and cov promoters (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in extensions of the promoter segments protected from nuclease digestion (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or attack by hydroxyl radicals (14Miller A.A. Engleberg N.C. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that phosphorylation causes CovR to form a higher molecular weight complex in solution (14Miller A.A. Engleberg N.C. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The interaction between CovR and the has promoter has been studied in some detail (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CovR binds to five separate sites. Uracil interference (16Pu W.T. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis have been used to demonstrate the requirement for the sequence ATTARA for CovR binding (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Binding of CovR to the has promoter region does not involve cooperative interactions between CovR molecules, because mutation at one site abolishes binding to that site without affecting binding to other sites in vitro (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, mutations that abolish binding to individual sites relieve repression and increase has gene expression in vivo, although the other unmutated sites can presumably still bind CovR (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the presence of multiple binding sites, all of which must be occupied to repress has gene expression, is a mechanism to ensure that repression of has expression only occurs at relatively high intracellular levels of CovR (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The interactions of CovR with the promoter of its own gene, Pcov, are similar to the interactions observed at Phas (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence of some cooperativity in the interactions between CovR molecules bound at different sites at Pcov because mutations that abolish binding at some sites also affect binding to other sites in vitro (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The affinities of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CovR for Pcov are similar to those observed at Phas (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have examined the interaction between CovR and another promoter whose activity it represses, Psag. We show that the interactions between CovR and the sag promoter are very different from those observed at Phas and Pcov. Binding of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CovR to Psag is highly cooperative. Furthermore, phosphorylation stimulates binding of CovR by 8–32-fold so that Psag is bound by phosphorylated CovR at much lower concentrations than Phas or Pcov. These results imply that CovR has more than one mode of DNA binding, which may allow greater differences in the expression of individual genes in the CovR regulon in response to environmental changes than previously suspected. Purification and Phosphorylation of CovR—CovR was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) (pLysS) (pEU7561) by chromatography on HiTrap Q HP, HiTrap SP HP, and Superdex 200 (columns from Amersham Biosciences) as described (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Bernish B. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4786-4793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), with one modification. Prior to chromatography on HiTrap SP HP, the partially purified CovR was passed through a HiTrap Heparin HP column. CovR does not bind to heparin in the buffer conditions used (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). This step removed a nuclease activity that occasionally contaminated the CovR preparations. To phosphorylate CovR, the protein was incubated for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 32 mm acetyl phosphate. Under these conditions, 100% of the CovR is phosphorylated and the half-life of CovR-P is ∼45 min. 4J. Gao, A. A. Gusa, J. R. Scott, and G. Churchward, unpublished results. In Vitro Transcription Assays—To construct the Psag template used in the in vitro transcription reactions, an 845-bp region including the sag promoter (from -669 to +176 with respect to the start of transcription) was amplified by PCR from the chromosome of the GAS strain JRS4 (17Scott J.R. Guenthner P.C. Malone L.M. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1641-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using primers PsagA Bam (ggcgcggatccTCAATACAAAGGTATCAAATC) and PsagA Xho (gggccgctcgagAGTAGCTAAAATATTTGAAG) (uppercase letters indicate chromosomal sequence, underlined letters indicate added BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pJRS462 to construct pEU7501. In vitro transcription reactions were performed as described previously (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) at 37 °C. The reaction buffer contained 33 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mg of bovine serum albumin, and ribonucleotides (500 μm final concentration of ATP, CTP, and GTP and 2 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, 400 Ci/mmol). Each 25-μl reaction contained 1.5 μg of DNA template and varying amounts of CovR. After a 15-min incubation, GAS RNA polymerase (0.05 μm final concentration) was added to each reaction and incubation was continued for 5 min. Unlabeled UTP (500 μm final concentration) was added for an additional 5-min incubation. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—A 210-bp fragment containing the downstream region (Fig. 1, labeled B) was amplified from the plasmid pEU7501 using as primers SagadsFW (ATAAGAACTAGATAG) and SagadsRV (TGAATTCTAGATCAC). PCR products were end-labeled, and gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The binding reactions contained 20 ng of DNA template in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Bound and unbound DNA were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphoImager. A rectangle sufficiently large to include the whole of a single DNA band in the image was copied over all the bands and also immediately below the bands to estimate the background. The pixel volume of each band was calculated by subtracting the background pixel volume that corresponded to an identical area of the gel in close proximity to each DNA band. Uracil Interference Experiments—Probe fragments were the 210-bp fragments used in gel mobility shift assays described above and a 243-bp fragment containing the upstream region (Fig. 1, labeled A), amplified from the plasmid pEU7501 using as primers SagausFW (GATGAAGTAAAGATATTAGCTAGGGTT) and SagausRV (AAGGCTAGCTCAATTGTACTG). A dUTP:TTP ratio of 1:20 was used in the amplification reaction. After incubation with 7.5 μm CovR in the same buffer as used in the gel mobility assays, separation of bound and free DNA, DNA cleavage, and electrophoresis were carried out as described (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Munson G.P. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2110-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNase I Protection Assay—Probe fragments were the 210-bp fragment used in gel mobility shift assays described above and a 403-bp fragment amplified from the plasmid pEU7501 using as primers SagausFW (GATGAAGTAAAGATATTAGCTAGGGTT) and SagadsRV. Protection assays were carried out as described (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the same buffer conditions as for the gel mobility assays with 100 ng of DNA probe/100-μl reaction. CovR Is Sufficient to Repress Transcription from the sag Promoter— CovR has previously been shown to bind to a long segment of DNA (∼150 bp) that overlaps the promoter and transcription initiation site of the sag operon. To determine whether binding of CovR to DNA directly inhibits transcription from the sag promoter, we carried out in vitro transcription reactions using purified GAS RNA polymerase (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in the presence of increasing concentrations of both untreated CovR and CovR that had been phosphorylated (CovR-P) by incubation with acetyl phosphate. Prior to addition of purified GAS RNA polymerase, CovR or CovR-P was incubated with linear plasmid DNA that included the sag promoter, untranslated leader, and 5′-end of the sagA gene as well as the promoter of the aphA-3 gene that is not regulated by CovR. The linear plasmid template was expected to produce two run-off transcripts, a 185-bp transcript from the sag promoter and a 510-bp transcript from the aphA-3 promoter. We anticipated that transcription from Psag would be inhibited by CovR whereas transcription from PaphA-3 would be unaffected. As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of CovR, transcripts of the expected sizes were the most abundant products of the in vitro transcription reactions. Increasing concentrations of both CovR and CovR-P added prior to RNA polymerase inhibited synthesis of the 185-bp sag transcript. Synthesis of the 510-bp aphA-3 transcript was unaffected except at the highest concentrations of CovR and CovR-P. The ratio of the sag-specific transcript to the aphA-3-specific transcript versus the concentration of CovR showed that both CovR and CovR-P inhibited synthesis of the sag transcript (Fig. 2). In both cases, 90% inhibition of transcription occurred over a narrow range of CovR concentration (4-fold for CovR compared with 2-fold for CovR-P). A comparison of the amount of protein required to cause 50% inhibition of transcription showed that 10-fold less CovR-P was required than CovR. Thus, although both CovR and CovR-P alone was found to repress transcription from Psag, CovR-P was more effective. CovR Binds Cooperatively to sag DNA—In preliminary nuclease protection experiments we found that in addition to the region of DNA overlapping the promoter and transcription initiation site of the sag operon (the upstream region, Fig. 1, labeled A), CovR also bound with similar affinity to a second, downstream segment of DNA that included much of the untranslated leader region of the sagA gene (the downstream region, Fig. 1, labeled B). Because this downstream protected segment of DNA was shorter (∼80 bp) than the upstream protected region overlapping the sag promoter (150 bp), we first examined binding of CovR to the downstream region using gel mobility shift assays. DNA-binding response regulator proteins related to CovR, such as PhoB, recognize and bind short sequences (∼10 bp) arrayed along the DNA (19Blanco A.G. Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Coll M. Structure. 2002; 10: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, the length of the DNA segment bound by CovR (80 bp) would predict binding of more than a single molecule of CovR. Using a 210-base pair DNA fragment containing this downstream region, we found that increasing concentrations of CovR gave rise to only a single radiolabeled species of reduced electrophoretic mobility under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3). The failure to observe multiple DNA-protein complexes suggested that binding of CovR to the downstream region was cooperative. The amount of unbound and bound DNA at different concentrations of CovR was determined and the binding of CovR was analyzed using a Hill plot. The data from one experiment is shown in Fig. 3. The combined results of four experiments gave a value of 4.4 ± 0.4 for the Hill coefficient, indicating a high degree of cooperativity in the binding of CovR to the downstream region. When only the data points around 50% binding are included in the calculation the value of the Hill coefficient is higher, 6.4 ± 0.4. These results imply that 4–6 molecules of CovR bind cooperatively to this region of DNA, consistent with the narrow range of concentrations required for inhibition of transcription (Fig. 2). We were unable to carry out a similar analysis of binding of CovR-P to this segment of DNA, because although a single slower migrating species appeared after incubation of the DNA probe with CovR-P, the majority of the bound DNA did not migrate into the gel. Thus, individual bound species of DNA could not be identified and accurately quantitated. However, binding of CovR-P to the downstream region occurred over the same narrow concentration range as for CovR, implying a similar degree of cooperativity of binding to that shown by CovR. Identification of Thymine Residues Important for Cov R Binding to sag DNA—We used uracil interference assays (16Pu W.T. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to identify thymine residues important for CovR binding using as a template the same 210-bp radiolabeled fragment containing the downstream region (Fig. 1, labeled B) that we used in the gel mobility shift assays described above. DNA fragments were prepared by PCR using different ratios of dUTP to TTP and then incubated with CovR. Bound and free DNA were separated by electrophoresis, and the resulting DNA preparations were cleaved at incorporated deoxyuridine residues. Enhancement of cleavage at a particular position in unbound DNA or diminution of cleavage at the same position in bound DNA indicates that incorporation of uracil at that position interferes with protein binding. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that incorporation of deoxyuridine in place of thymidine at four positions in the “top” strand (Fig. 4, panel 1) and two positions in the “bottom” strand (Fig. 4, panel 2) resulted in enhancement of cleavage in unbound DNA and/or diminution of cleavage at the same position in bound DNA. No enhancement of cleavage in unbound DNA or diminution of cleavage in bound DNA, indicative of a role for the base in CovR binding, was observed for any thymine residue within the ATTARA sequence. Control experiments (data not shown) showed that we could reproduce the reported results for Phas (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealing essential thymine residues at each ATTARA sequence within the has promoter region. In contrast to the results obtained with the downstream region, when we repeated the uracil interference experiments using a DNA fragment containing the upstream region (Fig. 1, labeled A), the only indication of altered cleavage patterns in bound and unbound DNA occurred within the single ATTARA binding site (Fig. 4, panels 3 and 4). Thus, we found no evidence for an array of essential thymine residues in either region of Psag as has been found in the has and cov promoters Those residues identified as being important for CovR binding in the upstream and downstream regions of Psag may participate in nucleation sites for CovR binding in each region. CovR-P Has a Higher Affinity than CovR for sag DNA—To compare directly the binding of CovR and CovR-P to sag DNA we carried out DNase I protection assays using as template the same 210-bp radiolabeled fragment containing the downstream region (Fig. 1, labeled B) as we used in the gel mobility shift and uracil interference assays. As shown in Fig. 5, both CovR and CovR-P bound and protected a similar region of the fragment, except at the highest concentrations of CovR-P. Binding by either species of CovR produced the same site of enhanced cleavage, unlike binding at Pcov, where only CovR-P produces enhancements of cleavage (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There was no evidence of discrete binding sites separated by unprotected DNA within the protected region or of binding sites with different affinities for the protein, both of which have been seen in other regions of DNA protected by CovR from nuclease cleavage. However, the most striking difference between the two species of CovR, compared with binding at other promoters, was that binding of CovR-P occurred at a 32-fold lower concentration of protein than did CovR. Partial protection of the DNA by CovR was observed at 12.5 μm, whereas CovR-P produced partial protection at 0.4 μm. This stimulation of binding of CovR by phosphorylation was much greater than the 2–3-fold stimulation observed previously with other DNA templates (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At high concentrations of CovR-P (<12.5 μm), the region of protection spread along almost the entire fragment. Such extension of the CovR footprint because of phosphorylation has been previously observed at Pcov (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Extension of the protected region at these higher concentrations was not seen with unphosphorylated CovR at either promoter, suggesting that interaction between CovR monomers is facilitated by phosphorylation. To determine the effect of phosphorylation on binding of CovR to the entire sag promoter fragment, we carried out a similar footprinting analysis to that shown in Fig. 5. We used a 403-bp radiolabeled fragment as probe that contained both the upstream promoter region of the sag operon (Fig. 1, labeled A) and the downstream untranslated leader region of the sagA gene (Fig. 1, labeled B). CovR binding to the upstream promoter region of this fragment is shown in Fig. 6. The binding of CovR and CovR-P to the promoter and upstream region was similar to that at the downstream region alone. Again, the most significant difference between CovR and CovR-P was the stimulation (∼16-fold) in binding caused by the phosphorylation of CovR. Also, at the highest concentration of CovR, the protected region extended from the promoter toward the downstream region. The Upstream Promoter Region and the Downstream Untranslated Leader Region of the sagA Gene May Interact to Facilitate CovR Binding—The results in Fig. 6 show that 0.4 μm CovR-P caused partial protection of the upstream region. This is the same concentration that caused partial protection of the downstream region (Fig. 5). However, the concentration of CovR that caused partial protection of the upstream region was 6.8 μm, 2-fold lower than that causing partial protection of the downstream region. These results suggest that when both regions are present on the same DNA fragment, as in the experiment shown in Fig. 6, the two regions might interact to facilitate CovR binding. To investigate this possibility further, we repeated the footprinting analysis of the 403-bp fragment used in Fig. 6 with the other strand labeled. As shown in Fig. 7, the pattern of binding of both CovR and CovR-P to the downstream region of this fragment, containing both upstream and downstream regions, was essentially indistinguishable from binding to the same region of the 210-bp fragment containing only the downstream region (Fig. 5). However, although partial protection of the downstream region by CovR-P occurred at 0.4 μm, partial protection by CovR occurred at 3.4 μm; a 4-fold lower concentration than that observed to cause partial protection of this region when it is the sole CovR binding region present on the DNA probe (Fig. 4). Thus, because the binding affinity of CovR (but not CovR-P) to Psag appears to be enhanced when both the upstream and downstream regions are present, the two regions may interact to facilitate CovR binding. The results presented here extend our understanding of the regulation of the sag operon in five ways. First, we have shown that binding of CovR is sufficient to repress transcription from the sag promoter in vitro. Second, repression is more effective if the CovR is phosphorylated by treatment with acetyl phosphate. Third, we have identified a previously uncharacterized region of the sagA gene downstream of the promoter which is bound by CovR. Fourth, we have demonstrated that in contrast to other CovR-regulated promoters binding of CovR near the sag promoter is highly cooperative. Fifth, also in contrast to other genes where binding of CovR has been characterized, phosphorylation of CovR causes a substantial change in its apparent DNA binding affinity in vitro. Interaction of CovR with the sag Promoter—The pattern of binding of CovR and CovR-P to the sag promoter region was significantly different from binding to the has and cov promoters (Fig. 1) (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At Psag, binding occurred to two segments of DNA. Within each region, binding was highly cooperative and protected a contiguous stretch of DNA from nuclease digestion. In contrast, at the has promoter, a number of discrete protected regions was observed, with intervening stretches of bases susceptible to nuclease cleavage (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutation of nucleotides shown to be essential for CovR binding by uracil interference assays abolished binding to individual sites in the has promoter, but mutations within one binding site did not affect binding to other sites, indicating that binding in vitro of CovR at Phas is not cooperative (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rather, there are a series of individual binding sites with similar affinities. At the cov promoter, there are also discrete binding sites for CovR, but here, mutations of nucleotides predicted to be essential for binding to some individual sites do affect binding to other sites, indicating that cooperative interactions occur between at least some of the CovR binding sites (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These differences in binding of CovR to three different promoters suggest that there are differences at the DNA sequence level that underlie these different patterns of recognition by CovR. DNA Sequence Recognition by CovR—It was originally suggested that TT/AATTTTTAAA/TAAAAC/A represents a binding site for CovR because all CovR-protected regions examined at that time, including the upstream region of the sag promoter, contain this sequence motif (14Miller A.A. Engleberg N.C. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A similar sequence is found in the CovR-protected region that we have identified located downstream of the sag promoter. However, uracil interference experiments using the has promoter subsequently identified the sequence ATTARA as being important for CovR binding (13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At Phas, this sequence occurs at irregularly spaced intervals, sometimes in inverted orientation, with these occurrences defining individual CovR binding sites revealed in nuclease protection assays (Fig. 1). At the cov promoter this sequence also occurs at irregularly spaced intervals, sometimes in inverted orientation, but related sequences ATTACA and ATTAAG are also found to bind CovR (Fig. 1) (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that thymine residues in these related sequences, as well as in the ATTARA sequences, are essential for Cov binding in vitro at the cov promoter (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, there are also regions of the cov promoter that bind CovR where ATTARA or the related sequences are not found. Each region of the sag operon that is bound by CovR contains a single ATTARA sequence (Fig. 2). The sequences ATTACA and ATTAGA are not found at Psag. However, despite the presence of only a single ATTARA CovR binding sequence, the regions of the sag promoter that are protected from nuclease cleavage by CovR are as long as the assemblages of sites at the has and cov promoters. The upstream region of Psag is 150-bp long and the downstream region is 80-bp long, so each region binds more than one molecule of CovR. Uracil interference and mutagenesis experiments carried out with the has and cov promoters have identified thymine nucleotides in the motif TTA, contained within ATTARA and related sequences, as essential for CovR binding (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The uracil interference experiments reported here show that the only discernible effects on CovR binding in the upstream region are because of the replacement of thymine residues in the ATTARA sequence. Presumably this sequence acts as a nucleation site for binding to this region. In contrast however, in the downstream region, replacement of thymine residues in the ATTARA sequence has no discernible effect on binding. Rather, replacement of thymine residues in the TT/AATTTTTAAA/TAAAAC/A sequence affects binding (Fig. 8). Thus, in the downstream region this sequence, rather than the ATTARA sequence, appears to act as a nucleation site for binding. Examination of the Psag sequences bound by CovR shows that in both protected regions nucleotides in the TTA motif occur with a periodicity of 10.9 base pairs along the DNA from the proposed nucleation sites (Fig. 8). Crystallographic analysis of PhoB, which is related to CovR, bound to its recognition sequence showed that monomers of PhoB make a limited number (two or three) of base-specific contacts with GT or TT dinucleotides occurring at a periodicity of 11 base pairs (19Blanco A.G. Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Coll M. Structure. 2002; 10: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that at Psag, CovR makes base-specific contacts with thymine residues spaced with the correct periodicity along the DNA. According to this proposal, the upstream region of Psag that overlaps the promoter could bind as many as 13 monomers of CovR and the downstream region could bind 6–8 molecules of CovR. This latter number is consistent with an upper estimate of the Hill coefficient for binding to the downstream region of 6.4. Effect of Phosphorylation on Binding of CovR to Psag—The second major difference in binding of CovR at the sag promoter, compared with binding to the has and cov promoters, is the effect of phosphorylation of CovR. At the sag promoter, phosphorylation causes an 8–32-fold increase in affinity of CovR for its binding sites. At the has and cov promoters, phosphorylation causes a 2–3-fold increase in affinity of CovR (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Federle M.J. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because greater than 90% of the protein is phosphorylated under the conditions used in our DNA binding experiments, 5J. Gao, unpublished results. we suggest that the reason for this difference in the effect of phosphorylation on CovR binding affinity lies in the nucleotide sequence of the protected regions of the three promoters. If phosphorylation promotes cooperative interactions between monomers of CovR then phosphorylation would be expected to stimulate binding of several monomers to a segment of DNA that contains essential nucleotides distributed along the DNA with the correct periodicity. The has and cov promoters do not contain extended distributions of the TTA motif with an 11-base periodicity as do the protected regions of the sag operon. Thus, we propose that CovR can interact with DNA in at least two different ways. The protein can bind to individual sites containing ATTARA and related sequences. The number of contacts with these sequences is sufficient to permit binding without a significant contribution from cooperative interactions between protein monomers, and thus binding to DNA containing aperiodic arrangements of these sequences such as those found at Phas may not be greatly stimulated by phosphorylation of CovR. The protein can also bind to stretches of DNA containing repeats of the TTA motif with regular periodicity. Here cooperative interactions between protein monomers contribute significantly to binding, and so binding to these regions of DNA is strongly stimulated by phosphorylation. At any given promoter, both forms of binding may occur. This appears to be the case at Pcov, because there is evidence for cooperative interactions between some of the CovR binding sites (12Gusa A.A. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by the observation that higher concentrations (6.8–12.5 μm) of non-phosphorylated CovR were required to bind to the sag promoter than to the has and cov promoters (2–4 μm), where cooperative interactions are presumed to be less important than at Psag. Based on the notion that CovR can interact with promoters in different ways that respond differently to phosphorylation, we imagine that the CovR system operates to regulate expression of a significant fraction of the GAS genome in response to environmental and internal metabolic signals. The wide range of affinities of phosphorylated CovR for the different promoters examined to date suggests that variations in the fraction of CovR that is phosphorylated in response to environmental signals provide a means for differential regulation of many individual genes within the CovR regulon. An examination of additional promoters will help establish the repertoire of interactions of CovR with DNA. We thank Brian Dalton, Huiping Ling, and Ginger Stringer for technical assistance and Samantha Roberts for help in performing some of the experiments."

It is not known how the host cells cope with the influx of these effectors. We report here that the Salmonella effector, SopA, interacts with host HsRMA1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase with a previously unknown function.

A sopA mutant escapes out of the Salmonella-containing vacuoles less frequently to the cytosol than wild type Salmonella in HeLa cells in a HsRMA1-dependent manner.

Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination involves a multienzyme cascade consisting of classes of enzymes known as E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin protein ligase) (20.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated proteins are either rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (21.Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or targeted to various specific cellular compartments (20.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev.

The ubiquitin ligases (E3) play pivotal roles in defining the specificity of proteins targeted for ubiquitination.HsRMA1 (RING finger protein with membrane anchor, also named RNF5) is a newly identified membrane-bound ubiquitin E3 ligase belonging to the novel RING finger protein family (23.Matsuda N. Nakano A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24.Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J.

Takahashi E. Horie M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 114-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HsRMA1 is well conserved in higher eukaryotes but not present in the yeast genome. It has been reported that Arabidopsis thaliana AtRMA1 is able to complement the yeast temperature-sensitive, secretion-deficient sec15 mutation (23.Matsuda N. Nakano A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One of the late-acting sec genes is sec15, which is involved in the vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (27.Salminen A. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28.TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Recently, HsRMA1 was reported to interact with paxillin to alter the localization of paxillin to regulate cell motility (29.Didier C. Broday L. Bhoumik A. Israeli S. Takahashi S. Nakayama K. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Henderson S. Sabe H. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5331-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The importance of ubiquitination in the secretory pathway and endocytosis has also been described (20.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that HsRMA1 might complement the sec15 mutation by regulating certain factors involved in vesicle trafficking.Previous studies have shown that Salmonella type III effector protein SopB is ubiquitinated in the host cells (30.Marcus S.L. Knodler L.A. Finlay B.B. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 534-546Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More recently, another type III effector protein, SopE, was shown to be rapidly degraded by a proteasome-mediated pathway (31.Kubori T. Galan J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 333-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the fate of the translocated bacterial proteins and how the host cells reorganizes and copes with the infusion of “foreign” proteins are still largely unknown. We report here that Salmonella type III secreted protein, SopA, is recognized, ubiquitinated, and degraded through the HsRMA1-mediated ubiquitination pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains—The wild type S. typhimurium strain SL1344 has been previously described (32.Hoiseth S.K. Stocker B.A. Nature. 1981; 291: 238-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). The sopA in-frame deletion mutant strain (ZP3) was constructed by introducing an in-frame deletion of SopA into the wild type Salmonella strain, SB300, retaining the first three and last two amino acids of SopA using a suicide vector (33.Dai S. Zhou D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5078-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34.Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used following standard procedures (35.Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The bait plasmid (pZP61) was constructed by fusing the entire coding sequence of SopA to the yeast Gal4 binding domain in pGBT9c (35.Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A human HeLa cell cDNA library, which was constructed by oligo(dT) priming in pGADGH (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), was kindly provided by Xosé Bustelo (SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). A total of 5 × 105 transformants were screened in the yeast indicator strain Y153 using the co-transformation protocol as described (Clontech Laboratories). Clones that grow on the Yeast Synthetic Drop-Out Media lacking histidine and exhibited positive β-galactosidase in the filter lift assay were chosen for further analysis.Construction of Plasmids and Transfection of Eukaryotic Cells—Plasmid pZP188 (sopA complementing plasmid) was constructed by cloning the entire coding region of SopA (2346 bp) into pBAD derivative, pSB1136 (36.Hardt W.D. Urlaub H. Galán J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2574-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), resulting in a SopA-M45 fusion. A plasmid expressing YFP-HsRMA1 was constructed by cloning the entire HsRMA1 coding sequence into the tagging vector pEYFP-C1. An E3 ligase-deficient mutant of HsRMA1 was constructed by mutating the cysteine residue to a serine residue (C42S) (24.Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To purify recombinant HsRMA1 and SopA proteins from Escherichia coli, HsRMA1 fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP-HsRMA12-164) was constructed by cloning the C-terminal deletion construct into expression vector pIADL16 (37.Lessard I.A.

SopA fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST-SopA56-782) was constructed by fusing the SopA coding sequence into pGEX-KG (38.Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with plasmids by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MG132 proteasome inhibitor (25 μm) (Sigma) was added 6 h before cell harvesting where appropriate. In co-transfection experiments plasmids encoding YFP-SopA together with pEYFP-C1 vector, YFP-HsRMA1, or YFP-HsRMA1 C42S were introduced into COS-1 or HeLa cells and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Sigma). To assess the effect of MG132 or HsRMA1, we optimized the minimum amount of plasmid to get detectable amounts of SopA in the presence and absence of MG132 in COS-1 cells.Fluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were infected with Salmonella strains as indicated. Infected cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Bacteria were identified with antibodies (Difco) against Salmonella O-antigen (39.Dai S. Sarmiere P.D. Wiggan O. Bamburg J.R. Zhou D. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Anti-LAMP2 antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). All images represent black and white projections of z-section slices obtained on a Zeiss AxioVert 200 m deconvolution microscope. Pseudo colors were added using Adobe Photoshop.Purification of Recombinant Proteins from E. coli—We purified recombinant HsRMA1 and SopA proteins from E. coli BL21(DE3)-expressing HsRMA1 fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP-HsRMA12-164) (37.Lessard I.A. Pratt S.D. McCafferty D.G. Bussiere D.E. Hutchins C. Wanner B.L. Katz L. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar) using amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. All purified proteins were dialyzed extensively and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mm dithiothreitol.In Vitro SopA Ubiquitination and Degradation Assay—In vitro ubiquitination experiments were carried out as described (24.Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 300 ng/μl ubiquitin (Sigma), 0.1 μm E1 (Boston Biochem, Boston, MA), 0.5 μm UbcH5a (Boston Biochem), 200 ng MBP-RMA1 or MBP-RMA1(C42S), and 500 ng of GST-SopA or GST were incubated at 35 °C for the indicated times and subjected to Western blotting with anti-GST or anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs). For examining SopA degradation, the 100-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 300 ng/μl ubiquitin (Sigma), 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison WI), 600 ng of GST-SopA in the absence or presence of 1 μg of MBP-HsRMA1 was incubated at 35 °C. At the indicated times, 20-μl samples were taken from each reaction mixture and analyzed by Western blotting.HsRMA1 siRNA—HsRma1 siRNA expression plasmids were constructed by using pSilencer 2.1 (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) together with a pair of 63-bp oligonucleotides, each containing a unique 19-bp HsRma1 sequence: 5′-GATCCAGCTGGGATCAGCAGAGAGTTCAAGAGACTCTCTGCTGATCCCAGCTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAAGCTGGGATCAGCAGAGAGTCTCTTGAACTCTCTGCTGATC CCAGCTG-3′. The sequence of HsRma1 was empirically selected and did not show significant homology with any gene with a BLAST search. The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into pSilencer 2.1 between the BamHI and HindIII sites. For negative control, a scrambled siRNA hairpin was placed into the same sites in pSilencer 2.1.Transmission Electron Microscopy—HeLa cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3 with wild type Salmonella for 6 h. Infected cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.25% NaCl. After washing with buffer followed by water, cells were fixed again with reduced osmium (1% OsO4 + 1.5% K3Fe(CN)6 in distilled water). Fixations were carried out in a Pella Model 3451 Scientific Microwave with variable wattage and a cold-spot attachment (Ted Pella, Inc. Redding, CA) at settings of 182 watts and 5 mm Hg vacuum using 40 s for each fixation step with 30 s rest (40.Giberson R.T. Austin R.L. Charlesworth J. Adamson G. Herrera G.A. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 2003; 27: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Samples were then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and infiltrated through a graded ethanol/resin series followed by 3 changes of 100% LX-112 epoxy resin with accelerator (LADD Research Industries, Burlington, VT). They were then allowed to polymerize for 48 h at 60 °C. Polymerized cells were thin sectioned horizontally to the plate surface. Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged at 80 kV using a Philips CM-10 Biotwin TEM (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR).RESULTSInteraction of Salmonella Type III Effector SopA with HsRMA1, an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase—S. typhimurium SopA has been shown to be translocated into the host cells and to play a key role in the induction of enteritis (17.Zhang S.

In a search for host cellular proteins that interact with SopA, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening (41.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) of a human HeLa cell cDNA library using a fusion of the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and full-length SopA (GAL4BD-SopA) as bait. Four independent clones were identified as encoding the full-length human RMA1 (HsRMA1), which specifically interacts with the GAL4BD-SopA chimeric protein (Fig. 1). This interaction was further confirmed by a GST pull-down assay (data not shown). To determine the region of SopA that is responsible for interacting with HsRMA1, a series of SopA deletions was constructed. We found that amino acids 56-470 were sufficient for mediating the SopA-HsRMA1 interaction (Fig. 1B).HsRMA1 Mediates the Ubiquitination of Salmonella SopA—HsRMA1 is a membrane-bound ubiquitin E3 ligase belonging to the RING finger protein family (23.Matsuda N.

The interaction of SopA with HsRMA1 suggested that SopA may serve as the substrate for host HsRMA1-mediated ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was conducted using purified recombinant MBP-HsRMA1 as the E3 and GST-SopA as the substrate (24.Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, prominent polyubiquitinated SopA was detected in the presence of MBP-HsRMA1. As a negative control, GST or GST-SopA307-782, which does not interact with HsRMA1, was used in place of GST-SopA in identical reactions, and no ubiquitination was observed, indicating that the HsRMA1-mediated ubiquitination is specific to SopA (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Salmonella SopA is a substrate for HsRMA1-mediated ubiquitination in vitro. A, combinations of ubiquitin (Ub), E1, ubcH5a, MBP-HsRMA1, GST-SopA56-782, GST or GST-SopA307-782 were incubated at 35 °C. Samples were taken at 0 and 2 h and processed by Western blot using anti-GST antibodies. B, the E3 ligase activity of HsRMA1 is required for mediating the ubiquitination of SopA. Reaction mixtures containing ubiquitin, E1, UbcH5a were incubated with either wild type HsRMA1 or HsRMA1(C42S), and the immunoblot was performed using an anti-MBP antibody (left panel). Reaction mixtures containing ubiquitin, E1, and UbcH5a were incubated with SopA alone, SopA with wild type HsRMA1, or with HsRMA1(C42S), and a Western blot was done using an anti-GST antibody (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The RING Finger Domain of HsRMA1 Is Required for the Ubiquitination of SopA—RING finger proteins feature a series of histidine and cysteine residues that are characteristically spaced (42.Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). A conserved cysteine in the RING finger domain is required for the in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity of HsRMA1 (24.Matsuda N. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Nakano A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1949-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that HsRMA1 functions as an E3 for SopA, we made the cysteine-to-serine point mutation at position 42 (C42S) in HsRMA1. We first verified that the wild type HsRMA1 exhibited prominent ubiquitination activity and that the mutated HsRMA1(C42S) had lost its ligase activity completely (Fig. 2B). We then examined the HsRMA1-mediated ubiquitination of SopA using purified MBP-HsRMA1(C42S) as the E3. In contrast to the wild type HsRMA1, MBP-HsRMA1(C42S) failed to induce the formation of poly-ubiquitinated SopA (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the RING finger domain of HsRMA1 is required for the polyubiquitination of SopA.HsRMA1 Accelerates the Degradation of SopA in Vitro and in Vivo—To determine whether ubiquitinated SopA is degraded by the proteasome, we examined the stability of SopA using an in vitro ubiquitination/degradation assay. Identical amounts of GST-SopA were added to each reaction containing rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence or absence of MBP-HsRMA1. The amount of GST-SopA was monitored by Western blot (Fig. 3A). There was a gradual degradation of GST-SopA in the reticulocyte lysate, probably due to endogenous HsRMA1 activity and/or other proteinases. GST-SopA degradation was accelerated, however, when MBP-HsRMA1 was included in the reaction, indicating that HsRMA1-mediated GST-SopA ubiquitination contributed to the degradation of GST-SopA in vitro.FIGURE 3HsRMA1-dependent degradation of SopA both in vitro and in vivo. A, HsRMA1 accelerates the degradation rate of SopA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The reaction mixture containing 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and GST-SopA was incubated with or without HsRMA1 for 1 or 2 h. The Western blot was performed using an anti-GST antibody. B, the amount of SopA is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing YFP-SopA56-782 or YFP-SopA307-782. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (25 mm) or Me2SO for 6 h. Cell lysates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and the Western blot was performed using anti-GFP antibody. C, expression of HsRMA1 down-regulates SopA in vivo. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing YFP-SopA56-782 or YFP-SopA307-782 together with a vector control, HsRMA1, or HsRMA1(C42S). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and a Western blot was performed using anti-GFP antibody. D, E, and F represent the quantification for panels A, B, and C, respectively, using ImageQuant software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the role of the HsRMA1-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in SopA degradation in vivo, the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on SopA protein levels after transient transfection of mammalian cells was examined. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing either YFP-SopA56-782 or the truncated YFP-SopA307-782, which does not interact with HsRMA1. After 24 h, MG132 or Me2SO (as a control) was added for 6 h, and the amount of YFP-SopA was determined by Western blot (Fig. 3B). Actin was also measured in the same blot as a negative control. The amount of YFP-SopA56-782 was dramatically lower in the absence of MG132 as compared with that with MG132. In contrast, there was no significant change of YFP-SopA307-782.To determine whether the amount of the SopA was affected by HsRMA1 E3 ligase activity in vivo, we performed a double-transfection experiment. Plasmids expressing either YFP-SopA56-782 or YFP-SopA307-782 were co-transfected with wild type HsRMA1 or the catalytically dead HsRMA1(C42S) mutant, and the amounts of YFP-SopA56-782 and YFP-SopA307-782 were evaluated by Western blotting. The level of YFP-SopA56-782 was markedly decreased when co-transfected with plasmid expressing the wild type HsRMA1 (Fig. 3C), but there was no change in the amount of YFP-SopA56-782 when the catalytically dead HsRMA1(C42S) mutant was used (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the amount of actin or YFP remained constant with and without HsRMA1 (Fig. 3C and data not shown). No significant change was observed when YFP-SopA307-782, which does not interact with HsRMA1, was used in the reaction (Fig. 3C).SopA Is Involved in Salmonella Escape into the Cytosol of HeLa Cells—It has been shown that the A. thaliana RMA1 (AtRMA1) was able to complement the yeast secretion-deficient sec15 mutation (23.Matsuda N. Nakano A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The sec15 gene is one of the late-acting sec genes involved in the vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (27.Salminen A. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28.TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The importance of ubiquitination in the secretory pathway and endocytosis is well documented (20.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

However, it is not clear how Salmonella escape into the cytosol or whether the escape plays a role in pathogenesis. To examine whether Salmonella escape into the cytosol under our experimental conditions, HeLa cells were infected with the wild type Salmonella or the sopA mutant strain for 6 h, and intracellular bacteria were examined for surrounding membranes by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 4A). Numerous bacteria were found within membrane-bound vacuoles, and some also appeared to be free in the cytosol in both the wild type and the sopA mutant-infected cells (Fig. 4A and data not shown).FIGURE 4The role of SopA in Salmonella trafficking and replication in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3 with wild type Salmonella, sopA null mutant, or sopA containing a complementing plasmid expressing full-length SopA.

https://openalex.org/W2132250329,"Sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter-1 (SMIT-1) is one of the transporters responsible for importing myo-inositol (MI) into the cells. MI is a precursor for a family of signal transduction molecules, phosphatidylinositol, and its derivatives that regulates many cellular functions. SMIT-1 null mice died soon after birth due to respiratory failure, but neonatal lethality was prevented by prenatal maternal MI supplement. Although the lung air sacs were closed, lung development was not significantly affected in the SMIT-1 null mice. The development of the peripheral nerves, including the brachial plexus, facial, vagus, and intercostal nerves, and the phrenic nerve that innervates the diaphragm was severely affected. All of these peripheral nerve abnormalities were corrected by prenatal MI supplement, indicating that MI is essential for the development of peripheral nerve and that neonatal lethality of the SMIT-1 knockout mice is most likely due to abnormal development of the nerves that control breathing. In the adult SMIT-1 deficient mice rescued by MI supplement, MI content in their brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, and sciatic nerve was greatly reduced. The sciatic nerve, in particular, was most dependent on SMIT-1 for the accumulation of MI, and nerve conduction velocity and protein kinase C activity in this tissue were significantly reduced by SMIT-1 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1988665513,"Bundle-forming pili (BFP) are essential for the full virulence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) because they are required for localized adherence to epithelial cells and auto-aggregation. We report the high resolution structure of bundlin, the monomer of BFP, solved by NMR. The structure reveals a new variation in the topology of type IVb pilins with significant differences in the composition and relative orientation of elements of secondary structure. In addition, the structural parameters of native BFP filaments were determined by electron microscopy after negative staining. The solution structure of bundlin was assembled according to these helical parameters to provide a plausible atomic resolution model for the BFP filament. We show that EPEC and Vibriocholerae type IVb pili display distinct differences in their monomer subunits consistent with data showing that bundlin and TcpA cannot complement each other, but assemble into filaments with similar helical organization."
https://openalex.org/W2073765055,"The human CD45 gene encodes five isoforms of a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase that differ in their extracellular domains as a result of alternative splicing of exons 4–6. Expression of the CD45 isoforms is tightly regulated in peripheral T cells such that resting cells predominantly express the larger CD45 isoforms, encoded by mRNAs containing two or three variable exons. In contrast, activated T cells express CD45 isoforms encoded by mRNAs lacking most or all of the variable exons. We have previously identified the sequences within CD45 variable exon 4 that control its level of inclusion into spliced mRNAs. Here we map the splicingregulatory sequences within CD45 variable exons 5 and 6. We show that, like exon 4, exons 5 and 6 each contain an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), which together determine the level of exon inclusion in naïve cells. We further demonstrate that the primary activation-responsive silencing motif in exons 5 and 6 is homologous to that in exon 4 and, as in exon 4, binds specifically to the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L.

Together these studies reveal common themes in the regulation of the CD45 variable exons and provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed physiological expression of CD45 isoforms. In order to attain proteomic and functional complexity, higher eukaryotes have developed numerous mechanisms to amplify the informational content of their relatively limited genomes. One such mechanism, alternative splicing, allows for the production of multiple unique mRNAs from a single gene through the differential inclusion of exons. Since the variant mRNAs produced by alternative splicing can each potentially encode for a functionally distinct protein, alternative splicing is recognized to be a ubiquitous and critical mechanism for regulating cellular function (1.Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2.Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The importance of regulated alternative splicing in humans is exemplified by the CD45 gene, which encodes a transmembrane proteintyrosine phosphatase (3.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). CD45 phosphatase activity is critical for intracellular signaling in T cells in response to antigen stimulation, as indicated by the severe immunodeficiency observed in CD45-deficient mice and humans (4.Kishihara K.

Morgan G. Beverley P.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Five isoforms of the CD45 protein are expressed in humans as a result of alternative inclusion of exons 4–6 (see Fig. 1A). In human T cells, the expression of the CD45 isoforms is tightly regulated throughout development and upon activation (3.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In particular, naive peripheral T cells express significant amounts of the larger isoforms of CD45, which have high phosphatase activity and maintain the T cell receptor in a state primed for antigen recognition (8.Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Subsequent to antigen stimulation, however, there is a marked shift in the processing of CD45 pre-mRNA, such that the variable exons are predominantly excluded from the final message, resulting in expression of the smaller CD45 isoforms (9.Akbar A.N. Terry L. Timms A. Beverley P.C.L. Janossy G. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2171-2178PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The smaller isoforms of CD45 are more prone to homodimerization than the larger isoforms (8.Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11.Dornan S. Sebestyen Z. Gamble J. Nagy P. Bodnar A. Alldridge L. Doe S. Holmes N. Goff L.K. Beverley P. Szollosi J. Alexander D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1912-1918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the dimeric state the intracellular phosphatase activity of CD45 is inhibited by steric constraints (8.Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, the shift to smaller CD45 isoforms upon activation of T cells reduces CD45 phosphatase activity and is thought to contribute to the attenuation of T cell signaling (8.Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12.Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Majeti R. Weiss A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Such a model for the importance of CD45 alternative splicing in maintaining T cell homeostasis is supported by studies that have correlated defects in CD45 splicing regulation with susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, and autoimmune hepatitis (13.Vogel A. Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Genes Immun. 2003; 4: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14.Schwinzer R. Witte T. Hundrieser J. Ehlers S. Momot T. Hunzelmann N. Krieg T. Schmidt R.E.

To fully understand and predict the differential expression of CD45 isoforms in T cells, we need a complete characterization of the determinants of CD45-regulated splicing. As for most examples of alternative splicing, the splice site sequences at the intron-exon boundaries surrounding the CD45 variable exons deviate significantly from the consensus recognition sites for the splicing machinery or “spliceosome” (16.Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Thus, auxiliary sequences (i.e. enhancers or silencers) within or flanking the variable exons are likely to play a critical role in determining the efficiency of spliceosome binding and the resulting exon inclusion. Despite a general appreciation of the role of enhancers and silencers in alternative splicing, our ability to predict the presence and activity of such regulatory elements remains limited (17.Fu X.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 736-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, experimental dissection of CD45 variable exons is required to identify the regulatory motifs that influence CD45 isoform expression. Previously, we have identified the regulatory sequences that control inclusion of CD45 variable exon 4, including a motif referred to as the activation-responsive sequence (ARS) consensus that is required for exon silencing upon T cell activation (18.Lynch K.W. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we have extended our understanding of the splicing-regulatory sequences controlling CD45 isoform expression by systematically mapping all of the exonic regulatory sequences that control inclusion of CD45 exons 5 and 6 in resting and activated T cells. Consistent with the physiologic distribution of CD45 isoforms, we find that exon 5 contains a strong enhancer (ESE) 3The abbreviations used are: ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; ESS, exonic splicing silencer; RT, reverse transcription; ARS, activation-responsive sequence; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FR, -fold repression; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PTB, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein.3The abbreviations used are: ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; ESS, exonic splicing silencer; RT, reverse transcription; ARS, activation-responsive sequence; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; FR, -fold repression; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PTB, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein. and a weak silencer (ESS), whereas exon 6 contains two strong ESSs and a weaker ESE. In addition, we show that, as with exon 4, exons 5 and 6 each contain a sequence sufficient to confer activation-induced exon repression, which binds hnRNP L and obligatorily contains the ARS consensus motif. Taken together, we conclude that CD45 isoform expression is determined by the combinatorial effect of the basal and inducible regulatory activities encoded within each of the three variable exons. Minigenes—Constructs CD9, SC5, SC6, and SC14 were described previously (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Constructs CD5 and CD6 contain a BglII-flanked region of ∼500 nucleotides of genomic sequence encompassing CD45 exons 5 and 6 that was removed from SC5 and SC6 and substituted for the exon 9 sequences in CD9. Constructs SC-E5 and SC-E6 were generated by inserting PCR-derived 120-nucleotide fragments internal to exons 5 and 6 into the Glo1 construct described previously (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B.

Block scanning mutations within SC5 and SC6 were done using PCR to swap blocks of 20 nucleotides within exon 5 to TCAGTATGACTCTCAGTATG or 15 nucleotides within exon 6 with TCAGTATGACTCTCA. Constructs shown in Figs. 4 and 5 to test single or double copies of individual regions of exons 5 and 6, were made by ligation of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the given sequence (shown in figures) into the MluI site of SC-glo. Constructs E5:R1–5, E5:R1–5(mARS), E6:R5–8, and E6:R5–8(mARS) were also made by insertion of the corresponding synthetic oligonucleotides into the MluI site of SC-glo. SC-glo is identical to the construct “glo” described previously (20.Rothrock C.R. House A.E. Lynch K.W.

UV Cross-linking—32P-Labeled RNA was generated by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [32P]CTP. Templates for in vitro transcription were generated by cloning doublestranded DNA oligonucleotides encoding E6R5–8 with or without mARS mutations or E5R1–5 with or without mARS mutations downstream of a T7 promoter in the vector pSPT7 (20.Rothrock C.R.

Generation of nuclear extract from JSL1 cells and UV cross-linking assays were done as described previously (20.Rothrock C.R. House A.E. Lynch K.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs, transfection, and analysis by RT-PCR and Western blot were done identically to that described recently by Rothrock et al. (20.Rothrock C.R. House A.E. Lynch K.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2792-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The relative expression of the five CD45 isoforms in human peripheral T cells results from the differential inclusion of each of the three variable exons within the CD45 gene. Variable exons 4 and 6 are only included in a fraction (roughly 40–60%) of mRNAs expressed in resting T cells, whereas exon 5 is expressed in almost all of these mRNAs (10.Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Upon antigen stimulation, inclusion of exons 4 and 6 is barely detectable, whereas approximately half of the mRNAs still include exon 5 (10.Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This pattern of CD45 expression (diagrammed in Fig. 1A) suggests differences in the relative strengths of either the splice sites or auxiliary regulatory sequences within or surrounding exons 4 and 6 versus exon 5. In addition, whereas the inclusion of exons 4 and 6 is clearly repressed upon T cell activation, it has been debated whether the splicing of exon 5 is inherently regulated or is a stochastic event influenced by the neighboring effects of the other two variable exons (3.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms controlling CD45 isoform expression, we have sought to identify and characterize the sequences that determine inclusion of CD45 variable exons 4–6. Previously, we have identified an ESS and ESE within CD45 exon 4 that together result in the partial inclusion phenotype of this exon in resting T cells (18.Lynch K.W. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24341-24347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The activity of the exon 4 ESS, but not ESE, is further enhanced upon T cell activation and is necessary and sufficient for the decreased inclusion of exon 4 in activated cells (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequence of the activation-inducible ESS within exon 4 with sequences in exons 5 and 6 indicated the presence of a conserved element we call the ARS motif. The ARS motif in CD45 exons 4–6 consists of the sequence MCYYGCAMGCA (“long repeat”) in tandem with a shorter copy (MCYYGCA), in which M represents cytosine or adenine and Y is any pyrimidine (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In all three CD45 variable exons, mutation of the GCA core of the ARS repeats abolishes activation-induced exon repression; however, only in exon 4 has the ARS motif been determined to be the sole activation-sensitive regulatory element (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To confirm the importance of the ARS consensus motif in exons 5 and 6 and determine whether these exons contain additional sequences that mediate their observed pattern of expression in T cells, we examined the splicing of exons 5 and 6 using chimeric minigenes expressed in T cell-derived JSL1 cells. We have previously shown that the JSL1 cell line recapitulates all aspects of CD45 alternative splicing (10.Lynch K.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); thus, these cells provide a useful background for identifying sequences that regulate exon splicing in resting and activated cells. We first sought to confirm whether or not the splicing of CD45 exons 5 and 6 was in fact regulated upon T cell activation and whether this regulation was inherent to the individual exons. When CD45 exon 5 and a few hundred nucleotides of flanking intron are fused directly between CD45 constitutive exons 3 and 7, we indeed observe a pattern of exon 5 expression consistent with that observed in the endogenous gene (Fig. 1B, CD5). RT-PCR analysis of minigene-derived mRNA reveals almost complete inclusion of exon 5 in resting cells but partial repression of this exon upon activation. For this minigene and all others in this study, we quantify the change in isoform expression upon treatment with PMA by calculating a -fold repression (FR) value. FR is equal to the change in the ratio of three-exon product to two-exon product between resting and activated conditions, such that an FR of >1 indicates the efficiency with which the inclusion of an exon is repressed upon treatment with PMA (see the legend to Fig. 1). Parallel analysis of exon 6 reveals partial skipping of exon 6 in resting cells and increased skipping in activated cells, whereas CD45 exon 9 (a constitutive exon used as a control) is almost completely included under both cell conditions (Fig. 1B, CD6 and CD9). Therefore, the splicing of CD5, CD6, and CD9 is consistent with the observed inclusion of exons 5, 6, and 9 in endogenously expressed CD45 mRNAs, demonstrating that exons 5 and 6 are regulated independently of each other. To further delineate the sequences most relevant to exon expression, we next engineered minigenes that contain the bulk of sequences internal to exons 5 or 6, cloned into an unregulated minigene derived from the human β-globin gene (Fig. 1C, SC-E5 and SC-E6 versus SC14). Importantly, the SC-E5 and SC-E6 constructs contain no intronic sequences from CD45; nor to they contain the intron/exon junction sequences from CD45 exons 5 and 6, yet the splicing patterns of the SC-E5 and SC-E6 minigenes are highly similar to that observed for CD5 and CD6, respectively. The central exon of SC-E5 is mostly included in mRNAs expressed in resting cells, whereas the central exon of SC-E6 is efficiently skipped under resting conditions. The relatively lower amount of three-exon product observed in SC-E6 versus CD6 can be attributed to the weak splice sites of the SC14 background. Of greater significance is the fact that mRNAs from both SC-E5 and SC-E6 show increased exon skipping upon PMA stimulation, whereas the control SC14 mRNA does not (Fig. 1C, – versus + PMA). Therefore, although we cannot completely rule out a potential role of intronic regulatory sequences, we conclude that the physiologic pattern of expression of exon 5 and 6 is primarily determined by sequences internal to these exons. To identify individual ESS or ESE sequences within CD45 exons 5 and 6, we next undertook a systematic mutagenesis of each of these exons (Figs. 2 and 3). We replaced regions of 15 (exon 6) or 20 (exon 5) nucleotides of exonic sequence with heterologous sequence previously shown to have no splicing-regulatory activity (21.Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For each exon, the substitutions, designated m1–m6 for exon 5 or m1–m9 for exon 6, were generated in the context of a minigene that contained all of exon 5 or exon 6 and a short stretch of flanking intron inserted between two constitutive exons of the β-globin gene (SC5 or SC6; Figs. 2A and 3A). SC5 and SC6 are identical to constructs studied previously (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and were used as a background for the mutagenesis instead of SC-E5 and SC-E6, since we can more readily detect both two-exon and three-exon products from SC5 and SC6, thus allowing more accurate comparison between wild type and the mutants.FIGURE 3CD45 exon 6 contains multiple sequences that influence its pattern of inclusion.

For C and D, bars marked by double asterisks were significantly different from the wild-type SC6 control (p < 0.001) as detailed in supplemental Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For exon 5, our mutagenesis scan reveals three primary regions of interest (Fig. 2). Mutation of region 3 results in an almost complete switch from three-exon to two-exon product in resting cells (m3; Fig. 2, B and C), although this mutation has no effect on the ability of PMA to induce further exon repression (m3; Fig. 2, B and D). Hence, the effect of the m3 mutation suggests that region 3 may function as a basal ESE (see Fig. 4). In contrast, mutation of region 2 has no consequence on exon inclusion in resting cells but renders the splicing entirely resistant to PMA stimulation (m2; Fig. 2, B–D). Importantly, region 2 contains both of the ARS motif repeats in exon 5 (see Fig. 5D). Thus, the effect shown here of substitution m2 is consistent with the splicing phenotype observed previously upon the introduction of point mutations within the ARS motif of exon 5 (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Substitution of region 1 also causes a slight reduction in the PMA-induced -fold repression of exon 5, most likely due to disruption of the sequence context immediately adjacent to the ARS motif. However, beyond m2 and m3, the only other mutation that significantly alters the splicing pattern of exon 5 is substitution of region 4 (m4). Exon 5 is included in all of the transcripts derived from the m4 minigene, implicating region 4 as a sequence that normally functions to partially repress exon inclusion (Fig. 2, B and C). Since inclusion of exon 5 is absolute in m4-derived mRNAs, we cannot meaningfully quantitate a -fold repression value for this minigene (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we cannot differentiate between a direct role of region 4 in activation-induced exon repression versus region 4 acting to keep the overall level of splicing sufficiently suboptimal to render it sensitive to activation-induced repression via region 2. CD45 exon 6 also contains multiple splicing-regulatory sequences as determined by scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 3). The largest and most significant effects on the basal level of exon 6 splicing are observed upon mutation of regions 1, 5, and 7 (m1, m5, and m7; Fig. 3, B and C). Virtually all of the mRNA derived from the m1 minigene exclude exon 6, whereas inclusion of exon 6 is the predominant pattern for minigenes m5 and m7. Interestingly, whereas both regions 5 and 7 contain homology to the ARS consensus, region 7 contains the longer ARS motif sequence and is the only sequence within exon 6 absolutely required for PMA-induced alternative splicing (FR = 1; Fig. 3D). Whereas we do observe a partial decrease in PMA sensitivity with the exon 6 minigene m1, this is most likely due to a limitation in how much more exon 6 can be repressed in this construct beyond that already occurring in resting cells. The scanning mutagenesis is indispensable for identifying sequences necessary for the splicing pattern of exons 5 and 6, but it does not confirm that particular sequences are bona fide ESE or ESS sequences sufficient to induce exon inclusion or silencing. The mutagenesis shown in Figs. 2 and 3 suggests that region 3 of exon 5 (E5:R3) and region 1 of exon 6 (E6:R1) may function as ESEs, since mutation of both of these regions decreases exon inclusion. Moreover, the sequence encompassed by E6:R1 is highly reminiscent of the well characterized purinerich ESE motif (see Fig. 4B). To test whether E6:R1 or E5:R3 could function as a bona fide ESEs, we inserted single or dimeric copies of these sequences within a version of the β-globin minigene that contains a restriction site to facilitate cloning (SC-glo). As shown in Fig. 4, we find that both E5:R3 (Fig. 4A) and E6:R1 (Fig. 4B) function in a dose-dependent manner to increase exon inclusion, confirming their identity as separable ESE-regulatory elements. Interestingly, E5:R3 is a particularly potent splicing enhancer despite having little, if any, sequence homology to previously characterized ESE motifs. The scanning mutagenesis in Figs. 2 and 3 also highlights sequences within exons 5 and 6 that are potential basal ESS candidates, since their integrity within exons 5 and 6 serves to repress inclusion of these exons in resting cells. Within exon 6, regions 5 and 7 (E6:R5 and E6:R7) are both predicted to function as ESSs, as is region 4 of exon 5 (E4:R5). Consistent with the scanning mutagenesis results, both E6:R5 and E6:R7 are sufficient to induce exon skipping in a dose-dependent manner when inserted into the SC-glo background (Fig. 5, A and B; p < 0.001 for difference between single and double copies; see supplemental Table I). However, the inherent silencing activity of E5:R4 is marginal, since no silencing is observed with a single copy of E5:R4, and only a modest increase in exon repression is observed in the presence of two copies of E5:R4 (Fig. 5C; p = 0.026 for E5:R4 × 2 versus E5:R4). Regions E6:R7 and E6:R5 contain the long (MCYYGCAMGCA) and short (MCYYGCA) components of the ARS motif respectively, whereas E5:R4 contains only an imperfect match to the short ARS motif (see underlines in Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the strength of basal exon repression may correlate with homology to the ARS consensus sequence. A role of the ARS consensus sequence in basal exon silencing is consistent with our previous observation that mutation of the GCA core of the ARS repeats in exons 4 and 6 not only leads to a loss of activation responsiveness but also results in a dramatic increase in basal exon inclusion (19.Rothrock C. Cannon B. Hahm B. Lynch K.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1317-1324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The one observation inconsistent with a role of the ARS motif in basal exon repression is the observation that substitution or mutation of the ARS-containing region 2 within exon 5 (E5:R2) does not significantly increase exon inclusion in resting cells (m2; see Fig. 2 and Ref. 19.Rothrock"
https://openalex.org/W2037819682,"α-Synuclein is known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. We previously identified synphilin-1 as an α-synuclein-interacting protein and more recently found that synphilin-1 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH-1 and SIAH-2. SIAH proteins ubiquitylate synphilin-1 and promote its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Inability of the proteasome to degrade synphilin-1 promotes the formation of ubiquitylated inclusion bodies. We now show that synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β within amino acids 550–659 and that this phosphorylation is significantly decreased by pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β and suppression of GSK3β expression by small interfering RNA duplex. Mutation analysis showed that Ser556 is a major GSK3β phosphorylation site in synphilin-1. GSK3β co-immunoprecipitated with synphilin-1, and protein 14-3-3, an activator of GSK3β activity, increased synphilin-1 phosphorylation. GSK3β decreased the in vitro and in vivo ubiquitylation of synphilin-1 as well as its degradation promoted by SIAH. Pharmacological inhibition and small interfering RNA suppression of GSK3β greatly increased ubiquitylation and inclusion body formation by SIAH. Additionally, synphilin-1 S556A mutant, which is less phosphorylated by GSK3β, formed more inclusion bodies than wild type synphilin-1. Inhibition of GSK3β in primary neuronal cultures decreased the levels of endogenous synphilin-1, indicating that synphilin-1 is a physiologic substrate of GSK3β. Using GFPu as a reporter to measure proteasome function in vivo, we found that synphilin-1 S556A is more efficient in inhibiting the proteasome than wild type synphilin-1, raising the possibility that the degree of synphilin-1 phosphorylation may regulate the proteasome function. Activation of GSK3β during endoplasmic reticulum stress and the specific phosphorylation of synphilin-1 by GSK3β place synphilin-1 as a possible mediator of endoplasmic reticulum stress and proteasomal dysfunction observed in Parkinson disease. α-Synuclein is known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.

Additional evidence that synphilin-1 may be involved in PD comes from identification of a missense mutation in its gene in two patients that share a rare haplotype (20Marx F.P. Holzmann C.

We have recently reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH-1 and SIAH-2 ubiquitylate and target synphilin-1 for degradation by the proteasome system (19Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The inability of the proteasome to degrade the synphilin-1-SIAH complex leads to a robust formation of ubiquitylated cytosolic inclusions containing synphilin-1, SIAH, and α-synuclein (19Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation is required for inclusion body formation, since a catalytically inactive mutant of SIAH-1 that binds to synphilin-1 fails to promote inclusions (19Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R.

Additionally, both SIAH and synphilin-1 are present in Lewy bodies of PD patients, implying a role in inclusion formation.In an attempt to better understand the role of synphilin-1 in PD and Lewy body formation, we now sought to investigate mechanisms that regulate synphilin-1 ubiquitylation and inclusion formation. We present data indicating that synphilin-1 is phosphorylated in vivo by GSK3β, which regulates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of synphilin-1 and inclusion body formation mediated by SIAH. Selective inhibition of GSK3β or mutation of a GSK3β phosphorylation site greatly increased synphilin-1 aggregation into cytosolic inclusions, suggesting a role of phosphorylation in modulating synphilin-1 aggregation. GSK3β inhibitor also enhanced the degradation of endogenous synphilin-1 in neurons, indicating that synphilin-1 is a physiologic substrate of GSK3β. We also present data indicating that inhibition of proteasome function by synphilin-1 is modulated by its phosphorylation status. Our results shed light on the mechanism regulating synphilin-1 ubiquitylation and aggregation, with implications for inclusion body formation and possibly cell death in PD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Ubiquitin aldehyde and purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme were purchased Boston from teine, 32 Biochem.

Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and detected by Western blot.In Vitro Kinase Assays—HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-synphilin-1 cDNAs. After 36 h of transfection, cells were lysed as in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HA-synphilin-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and washed in lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitated synphilin-1 was incubated with recombinant GSK3β (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP, 0.25 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were ended with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 8% gel. The amount of 32P-labeled-synphilin-1 was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Equal loading of immunoprecipitated HA-synphilin-1 was determined by Western blot or Coomassie Blue staining.In Vivo Phosphorylation Assays—After overnight starvation in serum- and phosphate-free medium, transfected HEK 293 cells were incubated for 3–6 h at 37 °C with serum-free/phosphate-free medium containing 200–400 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 30 μm MG132, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation of HA-synphilin-1 was carried out with anti-HA antibody for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Densitometric quantification of radiolabeled HA-synphilin-1 was carried out by PhosphorImager analysis. Equal loading of immunoprecipitated HA-synphilin-1 was determined by Western blot or Coomassie Blue staining.In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assays—Synphilin-1 was translated using TNT wheat germ in vitro translation kit from Promega using [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translated proteins were incubated in reaction medium containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 7.5 μg of ubiquitin, 1 μg of ubiquitin aldehyde, 100 ng of ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and 200 ng of UbcH5b. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 35S-Labeled synphilin-1 was determined by PhosphorImager analysis.For the in vitro ubiquitylation assays of prephosphorylated synphilin-1, HA-synphilin-1 was co-transfected with Myc-GSK3β into HEK 293 cells. After 36 h, cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 30 μm MG132, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation of HA-synphilin-1 was carried out with anti-HA antibody for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitated HA-synphilin-1 was incubated with the same ubiquitylation reaction medium used for the in vitro translated synphilin-1. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and ubiquitylated synphilin-1 was detected by Western blot. Very harsh lysis conditions were used in order to prevent co-immunoprecipitation of GSK3β with synphilin-1.In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assays—Transfected HEK 293 cells were incubated with 10 μm lactacystin for 12 h and then lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm lactacystin, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and ubiquitylated synphilin-1 was detected by Western blot.Pulse-Chase Experiments—Transfected HEK 293 cells were washed, incubated with methionine/cysteine-free medium for 1 h, pulsed with methionine/cysteine-free medium containing 200 ml/μCi [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h, and subsequently chased in normal medium for the times specified. Cells were harvested, and HA-synphilin-1 immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above for the in vivo ubiquitylation assays. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the amount of 35S-labeled synphilin-1 was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis.Immunocytochemistry Assays—Transfected HEK 293 cells were treated for 8 h with 10 μm lactacystin, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum. Cells were stained with anti-HA (Covance) and anti-Myc (Santa Cruz) as described (19Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). The percentage of cells containing cytosolic inclusions was counted by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups. Statistics of the number of inclusion-containing cells was analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test and by paired t test, when appropriate.Primary Cortical Neuronal Cultures—Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from cerebral cortex of E18 Sprague-Dawley rats as described (22Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 12-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine in neurobasal medium plus B27 for 2 weeks before use.RESULTSPhosphorylation by GSK3β—We found that synphilin-1 has 22 putative GSK3β phosphorylation sites according to the motif X(S/T)XXXS. Thus, we sought to investigate whether synphilin-1 is a target of GSK3β in vivo. Phosphorylation of full-length synphilin-1 in HEK 293 cells was significantly inhibited by two selective GSK3β inhibitors, SB415286 and kenpaullone (23Meijer L. Flajolet M. Greengard P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Lithium chloride, another GSK3β inhibitor, also inhibited the phosphorylation of full-length synphilin-1 (data not shown).In order to further verify the specificity of synphilin-1 phosphorylation by GSK3β, we carried out in vivo phosphorylation experiments using siRNA to suppress GSK3β expression. HEK 293 cells were transfected with full-length HA-synphilin-1 and siRNA to GSK3β or negative control siRNA. The siRNA to GSK3β, but not the control siRNA, was effective in decreasing the expression of GSK3β by at least 90% (Fig. 1B). We found that siRNA to GSK3 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of full-length synphilin-1 (Fig. 1B).To confirm that synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β, we carried out in vivo phosphorylation assays in which HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with full-length HA-synphilin-1 and increasing amounts of Myc-GSK3β. Accordingly, GSK3β increased synphilin-1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). In addition, the constitutively active GSK3β S9A mutant (24Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) phosphorylated synphilin-1 more efficiently than wild-type GSK3β (Fig. 1D). In vitro phosphorylation experiments with immunoprecipitated full-length synphilin-1 and recombinant GSK3β confirmed that synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by GSK3β, indicating that the GSK3β effect is direct (Fig. 1E).The ability of GSK3β to interact with synphilin-1 was also investigated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HEK 293 cells co-transfected with HA-synphilin-1 and Myc-GSK3β. When anti-HA was used to immunoprecipitate HA-synphilin-1, Myc-GSK3β was found associated with HA-synphilin-1 (Fig. 2). The interaction of GSK3β with synphilin-1 is specific, since the control Myc-FKBP12 did not co-immunoprecipitate with HA-synphilin-1 (Fig. 2). To map the GSK3β-binding domain of synphilin-1, we co-transfected different HA-tagged synphilin-1 fragments into HEK 293 cells with Myc-GSK3β and carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Different regions of synphilin-1 interacted with GSK3β, and a higher co-immunoprecipitation of GSK3β was observed with the synphilin-1 region containing amino acids 550–769 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2GSK3β co-immunoprecipitates with synphilin-1. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with HA-synphilin-1 (full-length or different fragments) and Myc-GSK3β or Myc-FKBP12 as control. HA-synphilin-1 was immunoprecipitated (IP HA) using an anti-HA antibody, and samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody to check for Myc-GSK3β co-immunoprecipitation (middle panel). The upper panel shows equal expression of Myc-GSK3β and Myc-FKBP12 in the HEK 293 cells determined by Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody. The lower panel shows the amount of immunoprecipitated HA-synphilin-1 (full-length or different fragments) by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GSK3β activity is strongly stimulated by 14-3-3 protein, which also interacts with α-synuclein and accumulates in Lewy bodies (25Yuan Z.

Protein 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitated with synphilin-1 from HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3A). Co-transfection of Myc-14-3-3 did not increase the amount of Myc-GSK3β that co-immunoprecipitated with HA-synphilin-1 (Fig. 3A). However, protein 14-3-3 significantly enhanced the in vivo phosphorylation of synphilin-1 by GSK3β, suggesting the formation of a ternary protein complex (14-3-3, synphilin-1, GSK3β) (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Protein 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitates with synphilin-1 and enhances synphilin-1 phosphorylation by GSK3β.

To investigate whether phosphorylation of synphilin-1 by GSK3β regulates ubiquitylation of synphilin-1, we carried out in vitro and in vivo ubiquitylation assays. Ubiquitylation of in vitro translated synphilin-1 promoted by SIAH-2 was significantly inhibited by the addition of GSK3β (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the addition of casein kinase II, previously shown to phosphorylate synphilin-1 (29Lee G Tanaka M. Park K. Lee S.S. Kim Y.M. Junn E. Lee S.H. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol.

The same results with GSK3β and casein kinase II were obtained when SIAH-1 was replaced for SIAH-2 (data not shown).FIGURE 4Effect of GSK3β in the ubiquitylation of synphilin-1 by SIAH.

Here we have studied the signaling pathways involved in progesterone effect on ENaC activity. We demonstrate that: (i) the truncation of the C termini of the αβγENaC subunits results in the loss of the progesterone effect on ENaC; (ii) the effect of progesterone was also suppressed by mutating conserved tyrosine residues in the Pro-X-X-Tyr (PY) motif of the C termini of the β and γ ENaC subunits (βY618A and γY628A); (iii) the down-regulation of ENaC activity by progesterone was also suppressed by co-expression ENaC subunits with a catalytically inactive mutant of Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin ligase that has been previously demonstrated to decrease ENaC cell-surface expression via a ubiquitin-dependent internalization/degradation mechanism; (iv) the effect of progesterone was significantly reduced by suppression of consensus sites (βT613A and γT623A) for ENaC phosphorylation by the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), a MAP kinase previously shown to facilitate the binding of Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases to ENaC; (v) the quantification of cell-surface-expressed ENaC subunits revealed that progesterone decreases ENaC open probability (whole cell Po, wcPo) and not its cell-surface expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the binding of active Nedd4-2 to ENaC is a crucial step in the mechanism of ENaC inhibition by progesterone.

ENaC activity is essential for maintaining extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure. The activity of this channel is controlled at two levels: the number of active channels on the cell surface (N) and the channel open probability (Po) (1.Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, quantitative estimates of N and Po values remain difficult, mainly because of the low cell-surface expression and high variability of the open probability of ENaC. Aldosterone, the principal hormone controlling ENaC activity, has been shown to have a major effect on N. One of the molecular mechanisms proposed for the regulation of ENaC cell-surface expression by aldosterone involves Nedd4-2 ubiquitin ligase and serum- and glucocorticoids-induced kinase isoform 1 (sgk1). In a model proposed by Debonneville et al. (2.Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) for the principal cell of the kidney collecting duct, binding of Nedd4-2 to the Pro-X-X-Tyr (PY) motif in the β and γ ENaC subunits results in ENaC ubiquitylation and intracellular degradation. Stimulation of sgk1 expression by aldosterone provokes sgk1-dependent Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, resulting in a decreased binding affinity of Nedd4-2 to ENaC and, finally, in an increased ENaC number at the cell surface. However, recent evidence indicates that increased sgk1 expression may also be involved in the regulation of ENaC Po. Diakov et al. (3.Diakov A. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38134-38142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have shown that sgk1 can directly phosphorylate the C terminus of the αENaC subunit, and that this phosphorylation significantly increases ENaC activity via an increase in channel Po. Alvarez de la Rosa et al. (4.Alvarez de la Rosa D. Paunescu T.G. Els W.J. Helman S.I. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that expression of a constitutively active mutant of sgk1 in A6 cells results in a significant increase of both N and Po. Using measurements of wcPo, a similar dual effect of sgk1 on ENaC N and Po was observed by Vuagniaux et al. (5.Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) in Xenopus oocyte expression system. We have also shown that a naturally occurring mutation of the PY motif (βR564stop), which causes an autosomal dominant form of salt-sensitive hypertension (Liddle syndrome), results in both an increase in N and predominant change in Po (6.Firsov D.

Collectively, these data indicate that sgk1- and/or Nedd4-2-dependent mechanisms may control ENaC activity by controlling both the N and Po.Another mechanism known to play an important role in the control of ENaC activity is the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. This signaling pathway is thought to have a dual effect on ENaC. The long term (hours/days) activation of this pathway leads to the down-regulation of ENaC activity via inhibition of the transcription rate of ENaC subunits (7.Shen J.P. Cotton C.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F57-F64Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8.Wang H.C. Zentner M.D. Deng H.T. Kim K.J. Wu R. Yang P.C. Ann D.K. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism responsible for this acute effect remains poorly understood. Shi et al. (9.Shi H. Asher C. Chigaev A. Yung Y. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have shown that ERK is capable of directly phosphorylating the β and γ ENaC subunits on residues Thr-613 and Thr-623, respectively. The phosphorylation of βT613 and γT623 increases the affinity of WW domains of Nedd4–1 ubiquitin ligase (a closely related homologue of Nedd4-2) for the C termini of the β and γ subunits. βT613A and γT623A mutations significantly increased the INa, but whether changes in N and/or Po were responsible for this increase was not determined (9.Shi H.

However, our data did not fit well with a Nedd4-2-dependent ENaC ubiquitylation/degradation mechanism, because quantification of ENaC expression at the cell surface revealed that the main effect of progesterone is a decrease of channel Po. The aim of the present study was to analyze the molecular mechanisms of the observed Po effect. Detailed analysis of the progesterone effect on ENaC activity demonstrated, contrary to our expectations, that the regulation of ENaC Po by progesterone is PY motif- and Nedd4-2-dependent. These results demonstrate a novel mode of action of Nedd4-2 in the regulation of channel function by Po.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of ENaC and Nedd4-2 in Xenopus oocytes—Complementary RNAs for rat αβγ ENaC subunits, human Nedd4-2, and mouse NaPi-IIa sodium phosphate co-transporter were synthesized in vitro using SP6 polymerase. The cRNAs were injected into Xenopus oocytes (10 ng of total cRNA/oocyte), and injected oocytes were kept in modified Barth solution (MBS) containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2). Electrophysiological measurements and cell surface biotinylation were performed 24 h after injection. Macroscopic amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) was defined as the difference between Na+ current obtained in the presence (5 μm) and in the absence of amiloride and was recorded, using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. The mean INa values in different oocyte batches ranged between 1 and 15 μA.Biotinylation of ENaC Subunits on the Cell Surface—Biotinylation was performed in 48-well plates, using 20 oocytes per experimental condition. All biotinylation steps were performed in a cold room, using ice-cold solutions. After incubation in ice-cold MBS solution for 30 min, the oocytes were washed three times with MBS. After the last wash, the MBS solution was removed and replaced by a biotinylation buffer containing 10 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce), pH 9.5. The incubation lasted 15 min with gentle agitation. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by washing the oocytes two times with a Quench buffer containing 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) added to the MBS solution. After the second wash, oocytes were incubated for 5 min in the Quench buffer with gentle agitation. Oocytes were then washed two times with the MBS solution and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Oocytes were lysed by repeated pipetting with Pasteur pipettes in a lysis buffer containing: 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl (20 μl/oocyte). The lysates were vortexed for 30 s, and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. Supernatants were transferred to the new 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) washed with lysis buffer. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with shaking, the tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 5000 rpm. Supernatant was removed, and beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads. All samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before loading on the 8% SDS-PAGE.Antibodies—The anti-αβγENaC antibodies were previously described. The anti-actin antibody was from Sigma.ENaC Phosphorylation Assay—For maximal loading of oocytes with [32P]orthophosphate (H3PO4), the oocytes were co-injected with FLAG-tagged αβγENaC and NaPiIIa sodium phosphate co-transporter cRNAs. 24 h after injection, 20 oocytes/experimental condition were transferred to the 2-ml Eppendorf tubes. MBS was removed and replaced by 100 μl/tube MBS solution complemented with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Hartmann). Oocytes were incubated for 3 h at 19 °C, washed three times with MBS, and lysed in the lysis buffer containing: 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,500 rpm. Supernatants were transferred to the 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were solubilized in a buffer containing: 0.5% digitonin, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate. Immunoprecipitation was performed in non-denaturing conditions with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), as described (6.Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Samples were run on 8–13% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of αβγENaC subunits was revealed by autoradiography.RESULTSThe Effect of Progesterone on ENaC Activity Is PY Motif- and Nedd4-2-dependent—As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of progesterone (15 μm) to ENaC-expressing oocytes leads to a significant down-regulation of amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa). The INa is inhibited rapidly; ∼50% of INa inhibition is reached within 30 min of progesterone treatment. The short-time required for INa inhibition indicated that ENaC activity and/or cell-surface expression, rather than cRNA stability or protein synthesis, are regulated by progesterone. This was confirmed by the stable expression of αβγENaC subunit proteins, over 4 h of treatment with progesterone (see below). To assess which parts of the ENaC subunits are involved in channel responsiveness to progesterone, we first expressed αβγENaC subunits with truncated C termini. For the α truncation we used a mutant in which all C-terminal amino acids were eliminated (αR618stop = αT). For the β and γ subunits truncation, we used the βR564stop (βT) and γW574stop (γT) mutants that cause Liddle disease (11.Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the truncation of αβγ C termini results in a complete loss of the progesterone effect on ENaC. Because the PY motifs in the C termini of β and γ subunits have been demonstrated as the important regulatory elements of ENaC activity, we next assessed the effect of progesterone on the βY618A and γY628A mutants. As shown in Fig. 2B, the mutation of the PY motifs in both β and γ subunits, either alone or together, resulted in the complete suppression of the progesterone effect on ENaC. This result clearly demonstrated that the progesterone effect on ENaC is dependent on PY motif of either β or γ (but not α) ENaC subunits. The PY motifs have been proposed to bind various WW-domain-containing proteins, including dystrophin, caveolins, ubiquitin ligases, and other proteins (12.Ilsley J.L. Sudol M. Winder S.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Also, Shimkets et al. (13.Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) have proposed that β and γ PY motifs are required for clathrin-dependent ENaC endocytosis. Because ENaC interaction with Nedd4-2 has been shown to be an important mechanism controlling ENaC activity, we next tested the effect of the catalytically inactive Nedd4-2C145S mutant (Nedd4-2CS mutant) on channel activity. As shown in Fig. 2C, co-expression of ENaC with the Nedd4-2CS mutant leads to a complete loss of the progesterone effect. As expected, PY mutations (Fig. 2B) or co-expression with the Nedd4-2CS mutant (Fig. 2C) both resulted in a significant increase in INa. Collectively, these experiments demonstrated that elimination of Nedd4-2 binding domains in ENaC subunits or suppression of endogenous ubiquitin ligase activity by expression of the Nedd4-2CS mutant lead to the abolishment of the progesterone effect on ENaC.FIGURE 2Progesterone down-regulates ENaC activity via PY motifs and Nedd4-2-dependent mechanism. A, expression of αβγENaC subunits with truncated C termini (αR618stopβR564stopγR574stop) resulted in the loss of the progesterone effect on INa. Oocytes were treated with 15 μm for 4 h.

B, expression of αβγENaC subunits with mutated PY motifs in β (βY618A) and γ (γY628A) subunits also results in the loss of the progesterone effect on INa. Oocytes were treated with 15 μm for 4 h.

Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For instance, Shi et al. (9.Shi H. Asher C. Chigaev A. Yung Y. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have shown that phosphorylation of βThr-613 and γThr-623 by ERK facilitates the interaction between ENaC and WW-domains of Nedd4–1 ubiquitin ligase, a closely related homolog of Nedd4-2. Because the effect of progesterone on ENaC depends on the activation of the ERK pathway (10.Nicod M. Michlig S. Flahaut M. Salinas M. Fowler-Jaeger N. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5109-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we also tested the effect of these two phosphorylation sites on progesterone inhibition of INa. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mutation of βThr-613 and/or γThr-623 to alanine results in a partial but significant reduction of the progesterone effect on INa. These mutations also resulted in a significant increase in basal INa: 8.8 ± 2.3-fold increase for αβT613AγT623A channel (p < 0.01, compared with αβγ channel); 2.7 ± 0.6-fold increase for αβT613Aγ channel (p < 0.05, compared with αβγ channel); and 2.5 ± 0.8-fold increase for αβT613AγT623A channel (p < 0.05, compared with αβγ channel). To check whether progesterone induces ERK-dependent ENaC phosphorylation, we attempted 32P-phosphorylation experiments in living oocytes. However, our first experiments revealed only low, almost undetectable levels of ENaC phosphorylation (data not shown). This was probably due to a low uptake of [32P]orthophosphate across the oocyte plasma membrane under standard conditions. To improve oocyte loading with [32P]orthophosphate, we co-injected ENaC subunits with NaPiIIa sodium phosphate co-transporter. As shown in Fig. 3B, co-injection with NaPiIIa allowed the detection of βENaC phosphorylation after co-immunoprecipitation of all three αβγ subunits in non-denaturing conditions. Statistical analysis of six independent experiments revealed a 30 ± 8% (p = 0.05) increase in βENaC phosphorylation under progesterone treatment. Mutation of Thr-613 to alanine significantly reduced the basal βENaC phosphorylation and abolished progesterone-dependent βENaC phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). The phosphorylation of α and γ ENaC subunits was not detectable, potentially due to the complex pattern of α and γ ENaC processing by endogenous proteases (see below). Collectively, these results demonstrate that elimination of extra-PY motif binding sites for Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases reduces the effect of progesterone on ENaC.FIGURE 3β-Tyr-613 and γ-Tyr-623 residues are involved in the progesterone effect on ENaC. A, expression of β-Tyr-613 (βT613A) or γ-Tyr-623 (γT623A) mutants results in a significant reduction of the inhibitory effect of progesterone on INa. Shown are mean ± S.E. of eleven independent experiments each performed with five oocytes per experimental condition. **, statistical significance of <0.001. B, progesterone increases phosphorylation of the βENaC subunit. Oocytes were co-injected with FLAG-tagged αβγENaC cRNAs and NaPiIIa cRNA. 24 h after injection, oocytes were loaded for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation was performed in non-denaturing conditions, using anti-FLAG antibody. C, progesterone-induced phosphorylation of βENaC is abolished in βY618A mutant. Oocytes were co-injected with NaPiIIa cRNA and αβγENaC or αβY618AγENaC FLAG-tagged cRNAs. 24 h after injection, oocytes were loaded for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation was performed in non-denaturing conditions, using anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Development of a New Assay for Quantification of Channel N—It has been proposed that the main effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC activity consists of the reduction of channel N. However, our previous experiments demonstrated that the main effect of progesterone is a decrease of channel wcPo (10.Nicod M. Michlig S. Flahaut M. Salinas M. Fowler-Jaeger N. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5109-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The effect of progesterone on wcPo was previously determined, using an assay based on the binding of an iodinated monoclonal antibody to a FLAG epitope introduced in the extracellular loops of αβγENaC subunits (6.Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To avoid some difficulty inherent to a binding assay, we have developed an independent procedure to quantitate N. This procedure is based on the biotinylation of cell-surface-expressed ENaC subunits (see “Experimental Procedures”). The biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads and electrophoresed through SDS-PAGE. In parallel, 10% of intracellular proteins recovered after precipitation of biotinylated proteins were loaded on the same gel. The proteins were blotted with anti-α, anti-β, and anti-γ ENaC antibodies. As a control for the biotinylation procedure, the same blots were re-probed with an anti-actin antibody. To validate this procedure, we quantified the cell-surface expression of the wild-type channel and the channel composed of the wild-type α and β subunits and the γ subunit with mutated PY motif (γY628A mutant). The use of the γ subunit rather than the β subunit mutant was chosen, because the epitope for the anti-β subunit antibody encompassed the PY motif. As shown in Fig. 4A, the anti-α antibody specifically recognizes several molecular species of the α subunit expressed at the cell surface: a band of ∼82 kDa corresponding to the glycosylated form of full-length αENaC protein, a band of ∼65 kDa and the double bands of ∼25 kDa. Because the epitope for this antibody is located in the N-terminal part of αENaC, the double bands of ∼25 kDa could correspond to the N-terminal products of furin-dependent αENaC cleavage described by Hughey et al. (15.Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48491-48494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The ∼65-kDa band represents an as-yet uncharacterized αENaC protein species, but could correspond to a species of ∼65 kDa observed in airway cells, using a similar protocol and the same antibody (16.Planes C. Blot-Chabaud M. Matthay M.A. Couette S. Uchida T. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47318-47324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17.Planes C. Leyvraz C.

The intensity of both the ∼82-kDa band and the ∼25-kDa double bands was significantly increased in the αβγY628A channel, whereas the intensity of the ∼65-kDa band remained unchanged. In the intracellular protein pool, the anti-α antibody specifically recognizes two αENaC species; one, which is identical to the ∼65-kDa band of the cell-surface-expressed α subunit and the second one, which is migrating at ∼78 kDa. A possible explanation for the difference between αENaC migration profile in the biotinylated and non-biotinylated protein pools consists of the presence in the intracellular pool of important amounts of yolk proteins migrating in a range of molecular masses of ∼80–100 kDa (see Ponceau red protein staining in Fig. 4D). This large amount of yolk proteins in oocytes could be a confounding factor for the migration of other intracellular proteins in this range of molecular masses, including the 82-kDa band of αENaC.FIGURE 4Cell surface biotinylation of ENaC subunits. A, cell-surface biotinylated proteins (left panel) and an intracellular protein pool (right panel) were probed with an anti-αENaC antibody. This antibody recognizes an N-terminal epitope in the αENaC subunit. B, cell-surface biotinylated proteins (left panel) and an intracellular protein pool (right panel) were probed with an anti-βENaC antibody. This antibody recognizes a C-terminal epitope in the βENaC subunit. C, cell-surface biotinylated proteins (left panel) as well as intracellular protein pool (right panel) were probed with an anti-γENaC antibody. This antibody recognizes a C-terminal epitope in γENaC subunit. D, Ponceau red staining of Western blot membrane reveals a major band of oocyte yolk proteins migrating in 80- to 100-kDa range of molecular masses. This band potentially interferes with the migration of αβγ subunits in the intracellular protein pool. E, probing of the same Western blot with an anti-actin antibody demonstrates that cell-surface biotinylated proteins are not contaminated by the intracellular proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in Fig. 4B, the anti-β antibody specifically recognizes two molecular species of βENaC expressed at the cell surface: a major band of ∼110 kDa that corresponds to the glycosylated form of full-length βENaC protein and an as-yet uncharacterized minor band of ∼75 kDa. The intensity of both ∼95-kDa and 75-kDa bands was significantly increased in αβγY628A channel. In the intracellular protein pool, the βENaC antibody recognizes two bands: one, which is identical to the minor ∼75-kDa band, and the second one, migrating at ∼100 kDa. As discussed above, the difference in migration profiles of cell surface and intracellular βENaC potentially comes from the interference between βENaC and yolk proteins migration. As shown in Fig. 4C, probing of biotinylated proteins with an anti-γENaC antibody reveals a ∼85-kDa band corresponding to the glycosylated form of full-length γENaC protein and the double bands of ∼63 kDa. These double bands could correspond to the furin-cleaved γENaC described by Hughey et al. (15.Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2121084043,"A low resolution model has been proposed for the exofacial conformation of the Glut1 glucose transporter in which eight transmembrane segments form an inner helical bundle stabilized by four outer helices. The role of transmembrane segment 4, predicted to be an inner helix in this structural model, was investigated by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in conjunction with the substituted cysteine accessibility method using the membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). A functional, cysteine-less, parental Glut1 molecule was used to produce 21 Glut1 point mutants by individually changing each residue along transmembrane helix 4 to a cysteine. The single cysteine mutants were then expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their expression levels, transport activities, and sensitivities to pCMBS were determined. In striking contrast to all of the other seven predicted inner helices, none of the 21 helix 4 single-cysteine mutants was demonstrably inhibited by pCMBS. However, cysteine substitution within helix 4 resulted in an unusually high number of severely transport-defective mutants. The low absolute transport activities of two of these mutants (G130C and G134C) were due to their extremely low levels of expression, presumably a result of structural instability and consequent degradation in oocytes, suggesting that these two residues play an important role in maintaining the native structure of Glut1. The other two transport-defective mutants (Y143C and E146C) exhibited low specific transport activities, implying that these two residues play an important role in the transport cycle. Based on these data, we conclude that the exoplasmic end of helix 4 lies outside the inner helical bundle in the exofacial configuration of Glut1.

Animal cells transport glucose across membranes via members of the Glut (SLC2a) family of glycoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The Glut family belongs to the major facilitator superfamily, which includes several thousand proteins, members of which are expressed in virtually every organism examined to date. These multispanning membrane proteins are involved in the transport of numerous small molecules across membranes (4Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glut1, best known as the glucose transporter of human erythrocytes, is among the most thoroughly studied of all membrane transport systems (5Mueckler M. Hresko R.C. Sato M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Glut1 was predicted to possess 12 transmembrane helices based on hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the sequence of a human cDNA clone (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). This prediction is supported by a number of experimental observations, most notably a comprehensive glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis study (7Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, several of the 12 proposed transmembrane helices were predicted to be amphipathic, which led to the hypothesis that these helices form the walls of an aqueous cavity that participates in the binding and subsequent translocation of glucose across the lipid bilayer (6Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl- and amide-containing amino acid side chains within these helices were predicted to form the sugar-binding site(s) of Glut1 via hydrogen bond formation with glucose hydroxyl groups (6Mueckler M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of Glut1 in the formation of an inner helical bundle that comprises a water-accessible cavity within the membrane. This model is also consistent with homology modeling of Glut1 based on the near atomic resolution structures recently reported for the lac permease (16Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (17Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), two bacterial members of the major facilitator superfamily. Homology modeling of Glut1 based on these structures suggests that helices 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 comprise an inner bundle of transmembrane helices that form a water-filled substrate-binding cavity near the center of the bilayer. Helices 3, 6, 9, and 12 are predicted to surround this inner helical bundle. Our recently reported analysis of helix 3 is consistent with it being an outer helix (18Mueckler M. Roach W. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46876-46881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was used in conjunction with a sulfhydryl-specific chemical reagent to examine the specific role of transmembrane segment 4 in the predicted structure of Glut1. In contrast to all of the other seven predicted inner helices, our results suggest that none of the 21 residues that comprise helix 4 is accessible to the external solvent. These data suggest that helix 4 lies outside of the inner helical bundle when Glut1 is its exofacial configuration and thus does not comprise a portion of the exofacial substrate-binding cavity.

Treatment with p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate—Stage 5 Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 ng of wild-type or mutant Glut1 mRNA. Two days after injection, groups of ∼20 oocytes were incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of pCMBS, 2The abbreviations used are:pCMBSp-chloromercuribenzenesulfonateC-lessGlut1 molecule in which all six native cysteine residues were changed to either glycine or serinesingle-Ca Glut1 mutant constructed using the C-less parent in which a single cysteine mutation was introduced in place of one the transmembrane residues in Barth's saline at 22 °C. The 100× concentrated reagent stock was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control oocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of vehicle alone. After a 15-min incubation period, the oocytes were washed 4× in Barth's saline and then used for the determination of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C). p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate Glut1 molecule in which all six native cysteine residues were changed to either glycine or serine a Glut1 mutant constructed using the C-less parent in which a single cysteine mutation was introduced in place of one the transmembrane residues Specific Activity Determinations—Membranes were prepared 3 days following injection of 50 ng of mutant RNA/oocyte. Western blot analysis of each of the mutant transporters was performed on ∼1 μg of total membrane protein, and the intensity of the Glut1 band was quantified by scanning densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging device SI. Analysis was performed using the ImageQuant NT program (version 4.0). [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (pmol/oocyte/30 min) of each mutant was concomitantly determined in each set of experiments. Specific activity is expressed as the 2-deoxyglucose uptake/ng of mutant Glut1 protein expressed/μg of total oocyte membrane protein, and the data were then normalized by assigning the uptake activity of the parental C-less protein a value of 1.0. Purified human erythrocyte membranes were loaded on the same gels as the oocyte membrane samples for use as quantitative standards. Statistical Analysis—Uptake data were analyzed for statistical significance using the two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. A Cysteine-less (C-less) human Glut1 molecule, in which all six native cysteine residues were changed to either serine or glycine residues, has been described previously (24Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). None of the native cysteine residues is required for function, as the transport activity of C-less Glut1 is very similar to that of the wild-type transporter when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (25Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C-less Glut1 was used to produce 21 mutant cDNAs in which each amino acid residue within predicted transmembrane helix 4 was individually changed to a cysteine residue (see TABLE ONE). The complete coding regions of all of the mutants were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation as well as the absence of spurious mutations.TABLE ONECysteine-scanning mutagenesis of helix 4Residue No.Amino acid changeCodon change127Phe → CysTTC → TGC128Ile → CysATC → TGC129Ile → CysATC → TGC130Gly → CysGGT → TGT131Val → CysGTG → TGC132Tyr → CysTAC → TGC133Ser → CysAGC → TGC134Gly → CysGGC → TGC135Leu → CysCTG → TGC136Thr → CysACC → TGC137Thr → CysACA → TGC138Gly → CysGGC → TGC139Phe → CysTTC → TGC140Val → CysGTG → TGC141Pro → CysCCC → TGC142Met → CysATG → TGC143Tyr → CysTAT → TGT144Val → CysGTG → TGC145Gly → CysGGT → TGC146Glu → CysGAA → TGC147Val → CysGTG → TGC148Ser → CysTCA → TGC Open table in a new tab Stage 5 X. laevis oocytes were injected with mRNAs encoding each of the 21 single C mutants. Verification that the mutants were expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane was determined by indirect immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 residues of Glut1 (Fig. 1a). 19 of the 21 single-C mutants were clearly expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane, but expression of G130C and G134C could not be detected. The expression level for each of the 21 mutants was then quantitated by Western blot analysis of purified oocyte membranes (Fig. 1b). As we have observed during our analyses of other Glut1 transmembrane helices by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, the expression levels of the different helix 4 single-C mutants varied widely, necessitating that transport data be normalized to the membrane content of mutant protein to directly compare the catalytic activities of the mutants to that of their C-less parent. Consistent with our microscopic observations, the expression of G130C and G134C could not be detected by immunoblot analysis. 19 of the 21 single-C mutants exhibited significant transport activity above the low endogenous oocyte background level, as determined by uptake of [3H]-2-deoxyglucose. The raw uptake data are shown in Fig. 2a, and the specific transport activities, normalized to the membrane content of each mutant and with the activity of C-less assigned a value of 1.0, are presented in Fig. 2b. 10 of the 21 mutants (S148C, V147C, V144C, V140C, F139C, G138C, T137C, T136C, Y132C, and I129C) exhibited specific transport activities that were modestly reduced (by ∼15-78%) compared with that of the parental C-less protein. Five single-C mutants (G145C, P141C, L135C, V131C, and F127C) exhibited slight elevations in specific transport activity, and three mutants (M142C, S133C, and I128C) did not exhibit a significant difference in activity relative to that of C-less Glut1. G130C and G134C did not exhibit transport activity significantly different from that of sham injected oocytes, consistent with the lack of detectable protein expression for these mutants. Y143C and E146C exhibited normalized transport activities that were reduced by 99 and 97%, respectively, compared with that of the C-less control. These latter two mutants, together with M96C within helix 3, are the most severely transport-defective Glut1 single-C mutants discovered thus far. To determine which, if any, of the helix 4 residues are accessible to the external aqueous milieu, transport activity was measured after incubation in the presence of the sulfhydryl-specific, membrane-impermeant reagent pCMBS (Fig. 3). The transport activities of G130C, G134C, Y143C, and E146C were too low to analyze by this method. We have previously shown that pCMBS can enter the glucose permeation pathway of Glut1 and has close access to the exofacial sugar-binding site (25Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the transport activities observed in the presence of pCMBS normalized for each single-C mutant to the activity measured in the absence of the reagent; i.e. a value of 1 indicates no effect of pCMBS, values >1 indicate stimulation by pCMBS, and values of <1 indicate inhibition by pCMBS. Surprisingly, unlike all of the other seven predicted inner helices, none of the 17 helix 4 residues that could be analyzed by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) exhibited sensitivity to pCMBS. The V165C mutant represents a positive control for reaction with pCMBS (11Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two surprising results were observed during the analysis of helix 4 by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and SCAM. First, the pCMBS inhibition experiments suggest that none of the helix 4 residues is accessible to the external aqueous solvent. This result is in striking contrast to the results obtained for the other seven predicted inner helices, which include helices 1 (9Heinze M. Monden I. Keller K.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), all of which possess at least four pCMBS-reactive residues that are exposed to the external aqueous milieu. Most of the pCMBS-reactive residues within these seven inner helices fall within the predicted exoplasmic half of each helix, consistent with a model in which the inner helices of Glut1 tilt in the plane of the membrane in such a way as to form a cavity containing the exoplasmic substrate-binding site near the center of the lipid bilayer, in analogy to the cytoplasmic substrate-binding sites identified in the lac permease (16Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (17Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The apparent lack of solvent accessibility of the helix 4 residues is particularly surprising in light of our previously reported results for helix 10 (14Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3498-3503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which contains at least four solvent-accessible residues in the exoplasmic conformation. Helix 4 and helix 10 are analogous helices in the pseudo-2-fold symmetrical structures of the Escherichia coli lac permease and glycerol-3-P transporters in their cytoplasmic orientations. These two helices are also predicted to be analogous structures in the Glut1 model recently proposed by Salas-Burgos et al. (26Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Of course, the possibility exists that one or more helix 4 residues are exposed to the external solvent in the exoplasmic conformation of Glut1, but that reaction with pCMBS at these sites does not discernibly alter transport activity. Negative data cannot be unambiguously interpreted when employing the substituted cysteine accessibility method used in this study. The complete absence of pCMBS sensitivity in the helix 4 residues appears to be inconsistent with our previous structural model, in which this helix is one of eight inner transmembrane helices that form the exoplasmic substrate-binding site. However, the current observations on helix 4 can be reconciled with existing data. First, our helical bundle model for the exoplasmic configuration of Glut1 is based on crystal structures for the cytoplasmic configurations of the lac permease and glycerol-3-P antiporter. Given the dramatic degree of twisting and turning that several of the transmembrane helices exhibit in the cytoplasmic configuration, it is possible that the cytoplasmic end of a helix may form part of the inner helical bundle and be exposed to solvent at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane but lie outside the inner bundle at the exoplasmic face of the membrane and be shielded from the external solvent by adjacent helices. In fact, helix 4 in the crystal structures of the two bacterial transporters does exhibit a dramatic turn near the center of the bilayer, especially in the lac permease. The fourth transmembrane helices in Glut1, the lac permease, and the glycerol-3-P antiporter all contain several glycine and proline residues that disrupt helical structure and introduce kinks in the chain. A dramatic tilt in helix 4 is also predicted by the recent energy minimalization model of Glut1 proposed by Salas-Burgo et al. (26Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We thus predict that in Glut1, and in perhaps all three transporters, helix 4 twists in such a manner that it comprises an outer helix in the exofacial configuration and is thus not in contact with the external solvent. The exoplasmic end of helix 4 may be shielded from the external solvent in the exofacial configuration by one or more of its adjacent helices, i.e. helices 1, 2, and 3. This hypothesis is supported by our recent cross-linking data, which showed that helices 4 and 8 are in close proximity at their cytoplasmic ends but are farther apart at their exoplasmic ends. Consistent with an important role for the conserved glycine residues in helix 4 is the observation that cysteine substitutions at Gly-130 and Gly-134 appear to cause severe disruptions in Glut1 structure, because the mutant proteins could not be detected in oocytes presumably due to rapid degradation of the improperly folded proteins. The second surprising observation in this study was that four cysteine substitutions within helix 4 caused severe (>99%) disruptions in the function of Glut1 (see Fig. 4). This is a greater number of severe disruptions than has been observed for any of the other eight Glut1 helices analyzed by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis thus far. In addition to the presumed structural perturbations observed for G130C and G134C mentioned above, cysteine substitutions at Tyr-143 and Glu-146 caused severe disruptions in normalized transport activity, such that only 1 and 3%, respectively, of parental C-less activity was preserved in the mutants. Given our prediction that the exoplasmic end of helix 4 is not in contact with solvent, it is unlikely that either of these residues participates directly in exofacial substrate binding. Also, if these two residues, which lie on the same face of helix 4, were in contact with lipid, it is highly unlikely that amino acid substitutions at these positions would dramatically alter transport activity. Also, it is unlikely from an energetic standpoint that Glu-146 would be in contact with lipid. Rather, Tyr-143 and Glu-146 probably directly interact with opposing side chains in an adjacent helix and are somehow involved in helical movements that bring about conformational changes in the transporter. The almost immeasurably low residual transport activities of Y143C and E146C suggest that these two mutants may be locked in a single conformation. If so, these mutations may prove to be useful in attempts to crystallize Glut1. An updated model for the exofacial binding site of Glut1 is shown in Fig. 5.FIGURE 5Two-dimensional model for the arrangement of the 12 transmembrane helices of Glut1 and the exofacial sugar-binding site. Proposed low resolution model of the exofacial glucose-binding site as viewed from the exoplasmic face of the membrane. For simplicity, all transmembrane segments are drawn as perfect helices perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. The model is consistent with numerous experimental observations (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 13Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10494-10499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for discussion). Glucose is not drawn to scale.

Overexpression did not modify the expression level of their protein partners ryanodine receptor, dihydropyridine receptor, and the other triadin. Caffeine-induced calcium release was also unaffected by triadin overexpression. Nevertheless, in the absence of extracellular calcium, depolarization-induced calcium release was almost abolished in Trisk 95 overexpressing myotubes (T95 myotubes), and not modified in Trisk 51 overexpressing myotubes (T51 myotubes). This was not because of a modification of dihydropyridine receptors, as depolarization in presence of external calcium still induced a calcium release, and the activation curve of dihydropyridine receptor was unchanged, in both T95 and T51 myotubes. The calcium release complex was also maintained in T95 myotubes as Trisk 95, ryanodine receptor, dihydropyridine receptor, and Trisk 51 were still co-localized. The effect of Trisk 95 overexpression on depolarization-induced calcium release was reversed by a simultaneous infection with an antisense Trisk 95 adenovirus, indicating the specificity of this effect. Thus, the level of Trisk 95 and not Trisk 51 is important on regulating the calcium release complex, and an excess of this protein can lead to an inhibition of the physiological function of the complex.

Dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), the L-type Ca2+ channels localized in the T-tubule membrane, serve as the voltage sensors for E-C coupling (1Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 2Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and activate ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the intracellular Ca2+ release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (3Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16636-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lai F.A. Meissner G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 269: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, entry of Ca2+ through DHPR is not required for E-C coupling (5Armstrong C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S5-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, a voltage-dependent conformational change in the II-III loop of the skeletal muscle DHPR α1 subunit (Cav1.1) activates the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, RyR1. Activation of RyR1 results in a release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum intracellular stores into the cytosol, which in turn activates the cellular contractile apparatus to initiate muscle contraction. In cardiac muscle, the entry of external calcium through DHPR is required to induce activation of RyR and release of internal Ca2+ via RyR, a mechanism known as calcium-induced calcium release. Calcium-induced calcium release is not the initial mechanism responsible of Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle, but it can contribute to the amplification of the signal, and both calcium-induced calcium release and conformational coupling are involved in skeletal muscle contraction, to different extents (6Brum G. Rios E. Stefani E. J. Physiol. 1988; 398: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Triadin is a transmembrane protein co-localized to the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane with RyR and was originally detected in rabbit skeletal muscle as a 95-kDa molecular mass protein (7Brandt N.R. Caswell A.H. Wen S.-R Talvenheimo J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Kim K.C. Caswell A.H. Talvenheimo J.A. Brandt N.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12637-12645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several isoforms of triadin are expressed in rat skeletal muscle, and we have previously cloned two of these isoforms (10Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), both expressed at equivalent amounts in rat skeletal muscle. One is the rat homolog of the 95-kDa triadin identified in rabbit skeletal muscle, named Trisk 95, and the second one, Trisk 51, is a truncated form of Trisk 95 (461 amino acids instead of 687 amino acids) almost identical for the major part of the protein but with a unique C-terminal end of 6 amino acids. In cardiac muscle, multiple isoforms of triadin have also been identified (11Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Hong C.S. Ji J.H. Kim J.P. Jung D.H. Kim D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 278: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the major if not only isoform expressed is CT1, a 32-kDa triadin isoform (13Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Trisk 95 is composed of a short N-terminal cytosolic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal domain located in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (9Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Jorgensen A.O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12637-12645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marty I. Robert M. Ronjat M. Bally I. Arlaud G. Villaz M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The intraluminal domain, composed of a high density of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues, interacts with RyR and calsequestrin (15Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Trisk 51 shares this same structure but has a smaller intraluminal domain.The function of triadins in skeletal muscle is not precisely established for the moment. In skeletal muscle, triadin has been shown to inhibit the calcium channel activity of purified RyR (18Ohkura M. Furukawa K. Fujimori H. Kuruma A. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Kuniyasu A. Nakayama H. Ohizumi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12987-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Groh S. Marty I. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Chapel A. Villaz M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12278-12283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These experiments were the first to identify a function of triadin in skeletal muscle, and they led to the conclusion that triadin could regulate RyR function via inhibition of the channel. At that time, the presence of Trisk 51 in skeletal muscle had not been observed. To obtain new information concerning the respective function of Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 in skeletal muscle E-C coupling, we induced adenovirus mediated Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 overexpression in primary culture of skeletal muscle, and we then studied the behavior of the calcium release complex in these triadin-modified cells. We investigated intracellular Ca2+ transients elicited by depolarization-induced calcium release (K+ depolarization) or by direct RyR calcium channel activation (caffeine or 4-chloro-m-cresol, 4-CmC). Here, we show that the depolarization-induced Ca2+ release was significantly decreased in the Trisk 95 overexpressing myotubes, and this effect was reversed by infection with an antisense virus. Trisk 51 overexpression has no effect, suggesting an isoform-specific action on E-C coupling. These results are discussed in terms of possible physiopathological consequences in some myopathies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Rabbit or guinea pig antibodies directed against the specific C-terminal end of Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 were described previously (10Marty I.

The sheep anti-α1 subunit of DHPR was from Upstate Biotechnology.Western Blot—The presence of RyR, α1 subunit of DHPR, Trisk 95, or Trisk 51 in different samples was assayed by Western blot (10Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), using a chemiluminescent reagent (Western lightning Chemiluminescence reagent plus, PerkinElmer Life Science). After electrophoretic separation on a 5-15% acrylamide gel, the proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon P (Millipore). The secondary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories).Cell Culture—Primary cultures of neonatal rat skeletal muscle were obtained as described previously (10Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on laminin-coated plates, in a proliferation medium composed of Ham's F-10 with glutamax-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2% Ultroser (BIOSEPRA), and 2% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 2-3 days, differentiation into myotubes was induced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen).Viruses and Infection—In this study, we used adenoviral-mediated gene transfer to modify Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 expression in primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle. The viruses were engineered and produced by the Gene Vector Production Network, at Genethon III (Evry, France). Four type 5 adenoviruses were used in this study, a control virus (AdV-DsRed) with the cDNA of the red fluorescent protein (DsRed), AdV-Trisk 95, an adenovirus with the full-length sequence of rat skeletal muscle Trisk 95 (10Marty I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), AdV-AS-Trisk 95, an adenovirus with the nucleotides 1765-2064 of Trisk 95 in antisense orientation, and AdV-Trisk 51, an adenovirus with the full-length sequence of rat skeletal muscle Trisk 51 (10Marty I.

All the transgenes were under the control of a CMV promoter.Cells were infected by overnight incubation with the chosen virus, at a multiplicity of infection 40, in proliferation medium, and then differentiation was induced by a change to differentiation medium. Control cells were infected with the control virus (AdV-DsRed). Trisk 95-overexpressing myotubes (T95-myotubes) consisted of cells infected with AdV-Trisk 95, and Trisk 51-overexpressing myotubes (T51-myotubes) with AdV-Trisk 51. For double infection, AdV-Trisk 95 (multiplicity of infection 40) and AdV-AS-Trisk 95 (multiplicity of infection 60) were simultaneously added to the cell culture. Calcium imaging studies were performed after 2-3 days of infection/differentiation. The infection of COS-7 cells was performed in the same way, except that the cells were kept in proliferation medium before and after infection (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin).Immunofluorescence Labeling—Myotubes (2-3 days differentiation) grown on plastic dishes coated with laminin were washed with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After two washes with PBS for 5 min, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min then saturated in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 2% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescent secondary antibodies, then washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with anti-fading medium (DakoCytomation fluorescent mounting medium, DakoCytomation). For double/triple labeling, the two/three primary antibodies (from different species) and later the two/three secondary antibodies were added at the same time. The secondary antibodies were either labeled with Alexa-488, Alexa-546 (both from Molecular Probes), or Cy5 (from Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories). The samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP2 operating system. The objectives used were Leica 40× oil immersion (NA 1.25) or Leica 100× oil immersion (NA 1.96). Fluorochromes were excited and collected sequentially (400 Hz line by line) by using the 488 nm line of an argon laser for Alexa-488, the 543 nm line of an helium-neon laser for Alexa-546, and the 633 nm line of an helium-neon laser for Cy5 excitation. Fluorescence emission was collected from 498 to 541 nm for Alexa-488, from 554 to 625 nm for Alexa-546, and from 640 nm to 730 nm for Cy5.Immunoprecipitation—Rat skeletal muscle microsomes were solubilized in presence of CHAPS, and immunoprecipitation was performed with the chosen antibody as described previously (20Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. Lai Y. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2270-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting.Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Changes in intracellular calcium were measured using the calcium-dependent fluorescent dye Fluo 4-AM (Molecular Probes). Myotubes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Fluo-4-AM 10 μm, in Krebs buffer (136 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Uptake of the dye was facilitated by the addition of 0.02% pluronic F-127 acid (Sigma). After loading, myotubes were washed for 1 h at 37 °C to allow de-esterification of the dye. Calcium imaging was performed in Krebs buffer. To obtain a calcium-free Krebs solution, CaCl2 was left out, while 1 mm EGTA and 50 μm lanthanum were added. In the depolarization solution, NaCl was replaced by KCl (140 mm final concentration). The other agonists, caffeine and 4-CmC, were prepared as stock solutions in Krebs buffer and used at final concentrations of 10 mm and 500 μm, respectively.Fluorescence was measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy, using a Leica TCS-SP2 operating system, in the xyt mode. Fluo-4 was excited by using the 488 nm wavelength, and its fluorescence was collected from 500 to 570 nm. The fluorescence images were collected every 1.6 s, for 2-4 min, and then analyzed frame by frame. Fluorescence curves are expressed as a function of time, as ΔF/F, where F represents the baseline fluorescence immediately prior to depolarization, and ΔF represents the fluorescence changes from baseline. Data are given as mean ± S.E., and n represents the number of myotubes in each condition.Patch Clamp—Whole-cell currents through voltage-gated calcium channels were recorded by means of the patch clamp technique (21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15091) Google Scholar). After removal of the culture medium, the cells were perfused with a medium containing triethylammonium-Cl 145 mm, CaCl2 2 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, HEPES 10 mm, pH 7.4 (TEAOH). Patch pipettes were pulled from thick wall borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter × 0.86 mm inner diameter, Clark Electromedical Instruments, UK). When filled with the following intracellular solution, CsCl 120 mm, EGTA 10 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, Na2-ATP 3 mm, HEPES 10 mm, pH 7.2 (CsOH), they had a resistance of ∼2-5 megohms. Electrical signals were stimulated and recorded by means of the pClamp software (version 6.0, Axon Instruments). Voltage-gated calcium channel currents were filtered at 1-2 kHz and sampled at 5-10 kHz on an Axoclamp 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Myotubes were stimulated at a frequency of 0.2 Hz from a holding potential of -60 mV. Electrophysiological recordings were done at room temperature. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., with n being the number of myotubes tested.RESULTSTrisk 95 and Trisk 51 Are Associated with RyR—We have previously shown that two triadin isoforms are expressed in rat skeletal muscle, Trisk 95, the 95-kDa isoform, and Trisk 51, the 51-kDa isoform (10Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine their association with RyR, immunoprecipitations were performed. These immunoprecipitations were done on solubilized rat skeletal muscle microsomes using antibodies specific for Trisk 51 (Fig. 1, lane 2) or Trisk 95 (lane 3), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot with anti-RyR antibodies. The presence of RyR was observed among the proteins immunoprecipitated by both antibodies, whereas it is absent from the proteins immunoprecipitated with non-immune serum (lane 4), as recently observed (22Vassilopoulos S. Thevenon D. Smida Rezgui S. Brocard J. Chapel A. Lacampagne A. Lunardi J. DeWaard M. Marty I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28601-28609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This indicates that both triadin isoforms are involved in the calcium release complex and are, directly or not, associated with RyR. Thus, both isoforms could regulate RyR function.Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 Overexpression Does Not Modify Expression of the Other Partners in the Complex—Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 overexpression was induced by adenoviral infection. Satellite cells were infected and induced to differentiate, and after 3 days of infection/differentiation myotubes were formed, and the cells were collected. The expression of both triadin isoforms in differentiated myotubes has been described previously (10Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The infection of satellite cells with AdV-T95 induced 15-fold Trisk 95 overexpression (Fig. 2A), whereas Trisk 51 expression was not significantly modified (Fig. 2B). In a similar way, the infection of satellites cells with AdV-T51 induced 40-fold overexpression of Trisk 51 (Fig. 2B), whereas Trisk 95 expression was not significantly modified (Fig. 2A). When overexpressed, both Trisk 95 and Trisk 51 appeared as large and diffused bands, similar to the ones observed in rat skeletal muscle (lane 1), whereas the bands in young myotubes are more precisely defined and sharp, as previously observed (10Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The expression level of RyR and DHPR was evaluated in control or in triadin overexpressing myotubes. Neither Trisk 95 overexpression nor Trisk 51 overexpression modified the expression level of RyR or DHPR (data not shown). Thus, Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 overexpression did not induce modifications in the expression level of the other proteins of the calcium release complex.FIGURE 2Western blot analysis of triadin isoforms in normal or triadins overexpressing myotubes. The expression level of the two triadin isoforms was analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against Trisk 95 (A) or Trisk 51 (B). A, lane 1, 5 μg of rat skeletal muscle microsomes. Thirty μg of control and T51 myotubes were loaded in lanes 2 and 4, and 5 μg of T95 myotubes were loaded in lane 3 (6 times less proteins in lane 3 than in lanes 2 or 4). The signal for Trisk 95 was 2.5-fold higher in T95 myotubes and corresponded to a 2.5 × 6 = 15-fold overexpression of Trisk 95 in T95 myotubes. B, lane 1, 5 μg of rat skeletal muscle microsomes. Thirty μg of control and T95 myotubes were loaded in lanes 2 and 3, and 3 μg of T51 myotubes were loaded in lane 4 (10 times less proteins in lane 4 than in lanes 2 or 3). The signal for Trisk 51 was 4-fold higher in T51 myotubes and corresponded to a 40-fold (4 × 10) overexpression of Trisk 51 in T51 myotubes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RyR Calcium Channel Function in Triadin-modified Cells—To determine whether RyR calcium channel function is preserved in T95-myotubes and in T51-myotubes, we performed Fluo-4 confocal microscopy calcium imaging. We measured the calcium release induced by RyR activators 10 mm caffeine (23Cognard C. Constantin B. Rivet-Bastide M. Raymond G. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or 500 μm 4-CmC (24Gschwend M.H. Rudel R. Brinkmeier H. Taylor S.R. Fohr K.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The addition of caffeine (Fig. 3) or 4-CmC on cultured myotubes induced a massive calcium release from the internal stores in all of the myotubes. Comparison of the intensity of calcium signals induced by caffeine (Fig. 3) showed no significant differences among control myotubes, T95-myotubes, or T51-myotubes. Caffeine induced an increase in the relative fluorescence of 2.07 ± 0.15 in control myotubes, whereas the increase in the relative fluorescence was of 1.92 ± 0.12 in T95-myotubes and 2.02 ± 0.19 in T51-myotubes, indicating a similar RyR functionality (non-significant difference, Student's t test). Thus, Trisk 95 or Trisk 51 overexpression did not modify the function of RyR as a calcium channel.FIGURE 3Caffeine-induced calcium release on normal or triadin overexpressing myotubes. The application of caffeine (10 mm) induces a massive calcium release in the myotubes. Left panel, fluorescence variation typical curves in control myotubes (no symbol) or in T95 overexpressing myotubes (black squares). The return to basal calcium level is not significantly different. Right panel, histograms of the fluorescence variation in control myotubes (2.07 ± 0.15), Trisk 95-overexpressing myotubes (1.92 ± 0.12), and Trisk 51-overexpressing myotubes (2.02 ± 0.19), expressed as mean ± S.E., with n being the number of myotubes tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Depolarization-induced Calcium Release in Triadin-modified Cells—Depolarization of the plasma membrane induces activation of the DHPR and results both in (i) activation of RyR and internal calcium release, and (ii) influx of external calcium via DHPR if external calcium is present (25Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 26Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Tanabe T. Nature. 1992; 360: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Depolarization was induced in the absence of external calcium (Fig. 4A) on control, T95-myotubes, or on T51-myotubes by changing to 140 mm KCl. It resulted, as expected (27Constantin B. Cognard C. Raymond G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Zhang X.H. Wu J. Shen M.X. Zhu P.H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Methods. 2004; 59: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration followed by a return to the basal level in control myotubes as well as in T51-myotubes. Nevertheless, in T95-myotubes, this effect was almost abolished, and depolarization induced only a minor calcium release (Fig. 4A). The relative increase in fluorescence was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001, Student's t test) from 1.54 ± 0.21 in control myotubes to 0.30 ± 0.06 in T95-myotubes. The fluorescence response was not different in T51-myotubes (1.60 ± 0.18) compared with control myotubes (1.54 ± 0.21).FIGURE 4Depolarization-induced calcium release in control or triadin overexpressing myotubes.A, KCl depolarization (140 mm) was induced in absence of external calcium. The left curves represent the fluorescence variation in control (no symbol) or Trisk 95 overexpressing myotubes (black squares). The histograms on the right present the mean ± S.E. of fluorescence variation in control myotubes (1.54 ± 0.21), in T95 myotubes (0.30 ± 0.06), or in T51 myotubes (1.6 ± 0.18), with n being the number of myotubes tested. The asterisk (*) indicates a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001, Student's t test). B, the same KCl depolarization was realized in presence of 2 mm external calcium. In this condition, the mean fluorescence variation was 2.08 ± 0.22 in control myotubes, 1.01 ± 0.10 in T95 myotubes, and 2.06 ± 0.18 in T51 myotubes. The asterisk (*) indicates a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001 Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the functionality of DHPR and to check that Trisk 95 overexpression had not led to an inhibition of DHPR, the same depolarization experiment was performed, but this time in the presence of external calcium (Fig. 4B). As expected, in control myotubes, as well as in T51-myotubes, the depolarization induced a larger calcium transient (2.08 ± 0.22 in presence of external calcium instead of 1.54 ± 0.21 in the absence of calcium for control myotubes, and 2.06 ± 0.18 in presence of calcium compared with 1.60 ± 0.18 in the absence of calcium for T51-myotubes). The same effect was observed in T95-myotubes, and depolarization induced a larger calcium transient than in the absence of extracellular calcium, but the ΔF/F remained significantly lower than in control myotubes (1.01 ± 0.10 in T95 myotubes and 2.08 ± 0.22 in control myotubes; p < 0.0001, Student's t test). These results suggest that (i) the DHPR still functions as a permeating Ca2+ channel in Trisk 95 overexpressing myotubes, (ii) the depolarization-induced calcium release was absent in these myotubes, and only the calcium induced calcium release component is observed. Thus, overexpression of Trisk 95 abolishes only the “skeletal-type” excitation-contraction coupling (the direct coupling between DHPR and RyR), and the calcium-induce"
https://openalex.org/W1976852176,"Induction of human sperm chemotaxis is an established phenomenon, though signaling systems physiologically involved have not been identified. Recently, it has been demonstrated that RANTES is present in the follicular fluid and that this molecule is a chemoactractant for human spermatozoa. However, the presence of beta-chemokine receptors on human spermatozoa has never been reported. By cytometric, Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrate the presence of CCR5 and CCR3 on ejaculated spermatozoa from healthy subjects. CCR5 was detected in the periacrosomal region of the sperm surface, whereas CCR3 was also present in the postacrosomal cap. Individual variability was observed on CCR5 and CCR3 positive sperm percentages. Presence of Delta32+/-) mutation was demonstrated in two subjects expressing CCR5 in half of the ejaculated spermatozoa. Our findings represent the missing information in favor of the possibility that beta-chemokines and their receptors are involved in sperm chemotaxis. Identification of molecular mechanisms of sperm chemotaxis may allow us to identify predictive parameters of sperm fertilizing ability in hypofertile or infertile subjects. Finally, both CCR5 and CCR3 expressed on the sperm cell surface may be involved in HIV-1 adhesion to spermatozoa, thus allowing these cells to perform as virion cellular carriers during sexual transmission of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2058952594,"Endothelial cells are highly sensitive to changes in the extracellular milieu. Sepsis results in activation of inflammatory and coagulation pathways. We hypothesized that sepsis-associated mediators may alter the response capacity (so-called ""set point"") of endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were preincubated in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), hypoxia, hyperthermia, and/or high glucose; treated with or without thrombin for 4 h; and then processed for RNase protection assays of selected activation markers. Priming with TNF-alpha and LPS significantly inhibited thrombin-mediated induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, tissue factor, and E-selectin, but not platelet-derived growth factor-A or CD44. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, thrombin-treated HUVEC demonstrated inducible binding of p65 NF-kappaB, an effect that was significantly blunted by pretreatment of cells with TNF-alpha and LPS. Consistent with these results, TNF-alpha and LPS attenuated the effect of thrombin on IkappaB phosphorylation, total cytoplasmic IkappaB, and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-kappaB. The inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on thrombin signaling persisted for up to 24 h following removal of the cytokine. Taken together, these data suggest that inflammatory mediators prime endothelial cells to modulate subsequent thrombin response."

Working with Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants affected in anterograde and/or retrograde endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi vesicular traffic and/or defective in one or both secretory pathway (Golgi) NDPases, we show that UDP-Glc: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase-mediated glucosylation is not dependent on the presence of NDPases or on ER-Golgi vesicular traffic and that GDP-Man-dependent N- and O-mannosylations are reduced but not abolished in the absence of NDPases in the secretory pathway. Further, the absence of the main Man-1-P transferase (a Golgi GMP-generating enzyme) does not modify the limited mannosylation observed in the absence of NDPases. Based on these results and on available additional information, we suggest that in the absence of NDPases, the already characterized nucleotide sugar transporters allow entrance of nucleotide sugars into the luminal compartments and that resulting nucleoside diphosphates exit to the cytosol by a still unknown mechanism.

Several secretory pathway NDPases have been described already. There are two enzymes displaying such enzymatic activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a GDPase/UDPase and an apyrase (denominated Gda1p and Ynd1p, respectively) (2Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijon C.

Apyrases differ from proper NDPases, since the former are able to degrade not only NDPs but also triphosphates. Both enzymatic activities localize to the Golgi, not a surprising finding, since no nucleotide sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases have been described in the S. cerevisiae endoplasmic reticulum (ER) so far. Irrespective of their cellular origin, all enzymes able to hydrolyze NDPs (NDPases proper and apyrases) share four highly similar sequences that are referred to as apyrase conserved regions. Analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome showed that Gda1p and Ynd1p were the only secretory pathway enzymes displaying those sequences (3Gao X-D Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol.

The presence of NDPase and nucleotide sugar-dependent glycosyltransferase activities in the mammalian cell ER and Golgi compartments and the exclusive presence of the former activity in the S. cerevisiae Golgi (i.e. in the only secretory pathway compartment in which glycosyltransferases and NDPases were known to occur in this yeast) supported the notion that the presence of glycosyltransferase-generated NDPs in a subcellular compartment necessarily implied the presence of an enzyme able to hydrolyze them in the same compartment. However, we have recently reported that the yeast S. pombe only displayed, the same as S. cerevisiae, two NDPase activities in the secretory pathway (a GDPase/UDPase and an apyrase) and that both localized to the Golgi (12D' Alessio C. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22379-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This finding was rather surprising, since the fission yeast, contrary to what happens in S. cerevisiae, displays a robust GT activity in the ER that produces UDP (9Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12D' Alessio C. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22379-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was suggested that perhaps ER-Golgi vesicular traffic could be involved in the conversion of UDP to UMP, thus providing antiporter metabolites for UDP-Glc entrance into the ER lumen. To study the entrance mechanism of nucleotide sugars into the yeast secretory pathway in the absence of NDPases, we have now switched to S. cerevisiae cells, since in them, contrary to what happens in S. pombe, mutants lacking both NDPase activities are viable (3Gao X-D Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12D' Alessio C. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22379-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and moreover, several S. cerevisiae conditional mutants affected in ER-Golgi and Golgi-ER vesicular traffic are available. Synthesis and processing of N-glycans in wild type S. cerevisiae cells involves transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from a dolichol-P-P derivative to protein in the ER followed by deglucosylation and demannosylation to generate protein-linked Man8GlcNAc2 (13Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Further elongation of the glycan occurs in the Golgi and involves the addition of Man from GDP-Man. O-Glycosylation is initiated in the ER upon transfer of Man residues from dolichol-P-Man (14Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Further transfer of Man units from GDP-Man has been assumed to occur exclusively in the Golgi. An additional processing reaction, also occurring in the Golgi, is the transfer of Man-1-P from GDP-Man to both N- and O-glycans. This last reaction generates GMP as a by-product (15Jigami Y. Odani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Results obtained show that entrance of UDP-Glc and GDP-Man into the yeast secretory pathway, probably mediated by the already characterized nucleotide sugar transporters, is not abolished in the absence of ER-Golgi vesicular traffic or of NDPases in the secretory pathway, although a lower extent of GDP-Man-dependent protein N- and O-mannosylation was detected under the last condition. This implies that there should be a transport mechanism allowing exit of NDPs from the secretory pathway. Materials—[14C]Glc (301 Ci/mol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NDPs, protease inhibitors, supplements for culture media, lysing enzyme, dithiothreitol, jack bean α-mannosidase, and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) were from Sigma.

Diploid cells were selected in SD solid medium at 37 °C. Stationary phase cultures were washed twice with 0.3% potassium acetate, and sporulation was induced for 3 days in a 1:1000 dilution of the washed cultures in 0.3% potassium acetate. Asci were digested in water with 1 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T for 5 min at room temperature. The dissection was performed in YPDA with a manual micromanipulator (Singer Instruments Co). Spores were germinated at 24 °C and replica-plated to different media to be analyzed for auxotrophic markers, Geneticin resistance, and temperature sensitivity at 37 °C. Ura- mutants were chosen in all cases, since they could be transformed with p416 (URA3)-gpt1+. ASG-19 was obtained by mating AS-15C with G2-12. Diploids were selected in SD+Ade+Lys+Ura+Trp at 37 °C, and spores were obtained as described above. AG-17, AYG-13, and AY-21 were obtained from the tetrad dissection of the sporulated diploids obtained from mating G2-12 with PRY225-3 that were selected in SD+Ade+Lys+Ura+Trp at 28 °C. Thirteen colonies had a rough phenotype that could be easily distinguished from wild type or single mutant strains. AYGS-1A was obtained from the tetrad dissection of sporulated diploids resulting from the cross between ASY2-14B and ASG-19 that were selected in SD+Lys at 24 °C. Rough colonies were checked after dissection by replica-plating them to the appropriate auxotrophic marker media. Strains Constructed via Random Spore Selection of Sporulated Diploids—To obtain AU-36, MLY101 was crossed with PRY225-3. Diploid cells were selected in SD+Ade+Lys and sporulated as described above. Sporulated cells were washed twice with water, resuspended in 5 ml of water, and incubated with agitation overnight at 28 °C with 0.6 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T in the presence of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 5 ml of 1.5% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min, vigorously shaken, and harvested. The spore suspension was resuspended in 400 μl of 0.75% Nonidet P-40, transferred to Eppendorff tubes, and vigorously shaken during 3 min with 300 mg of acid-washed glass beads. The spore suspension was removed, and beads were washed with water. The resulting spores were plated in SD+Ade+Lys+Ura medium and incubated at 24 °C. Colonies were tested for ploidy by mating them with mating type tester strains. AYGM-45 was obtained by random spore selection from the cross between AYG-13 and XHW13. The Mnn6p- phenotype was confirmed with the Alcian Blue test. To confirm the presence of plasmid pUT1 (ufe1-1) in mutant strains, DNA was extracted, and E. coli strain JA226 was transformed. A plasmidic DNA extraction of ampicillin-resistant colonies was sequenced with primers T3 and T7. Expression of S. pombe GT in S. cerevisiae Mutant Strains—Ura- mutants were chosen in all cases, since they could be transformed with the low copy number p416(URA3)-gpt1+shuttle vector, which was obtained as described before (16Castro O.A. Chen L.Y. Parodi A.J. Abeijon C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Electrocompetent yeast cells were prepared from cells harvested from exponential phase cultures grown in YPDA. Cells were then washed twice with 1 volume of cold water and twice with 1 volume of 10% glycerol. Cells were resuspended in 10% glycerol at a density of 5 × 109 cells/ml, and 50 μl was electroporated at 2.5 kV, 25 microfarads, and 200 ohms (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) with 400 ng of the GT-containing plasmid. Transformants were selected in appropriate SD selective medium lacking uracil at 28 °C or at 24 °C for ufe1-1 and sec12-4 thermosensitive strains. A DNA preparation of Ura prototrophs was tested for the presence of S. pombe gpt1+gene by PCR with primers GPD Promoter (Vector): 5′-CTTCTGCTCTCTCTGATTTG-3′ and 1ASH2 (GT antisense) 5′-TATATCTAAGACCTTCGA-3′). N-Glycan Labeling—For assessing Golgi N-glycan elongation, cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested, extensively washed with 1% yeast nitrogen base, resuspended in the same medium, and incubated (0.3 g in 1 ml) for 30 min at 28 °C (except where otherwise indicated) in the presence of 5 mm [14C]Glc (30.1 Ci/mol). After chasing cells with 50 mm Glc (final concentration), cells were incubated for 30 min more. Conditional mutant cells were incubated at 37 °C (restrictive temperature). Sec12 cells were preincubated at that temperature for 30 min, after which they were incubated with 5 mm [14C]Glc (30.1 Ci/mol) for 30 min followed by a 30-min chase with 50 mm Glc. Cells bearing the ufe1 mutation were first incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then for 60 min at the same temperature in the presence of 5 mm unlabeled Glc and finally with 5 mm [14C]Glc (30.1 Ci/mol) for 60 min followed by a 60-min chase with 50 mm Glc. Where indicated, DMJ plus KFN (2.5 mm final concentration each) were added at the beginning of preincubations. For assessing ER, N-glucosylation incubations lasted for 30 min and were not chased. Where indicated, 2.5 mm NMDNJ plus 5 mm dithiothreitol were added to incubations, the first reagent 30 min and the second one 5 min before the label. For further details on the labeling procedure and preparation of whole cell Endo H-sensitive N-glycans, see Ref. 9Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. O-Glycan Labeling—Cells, previously extensively washed with 1% yeast nitrogen base, were resuspended in the same medium (0.16 g in 1 ml) and incubated for 60 min at 28 °C (except where otherwise indicated) in the presence of 5 mm [14C]Glc (30.1 Ci/mol), chased with 50 mm Glc (final concentration), and incubated for 60 min more. Conditional mutant cells were incubated at 37 °C (restrictive temperature). Sec12 cells were preincubated at that temperature for 30 min and incubated with the label and chased as above. Cells bearing the ufe1 mutation were first incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then for 60 min at the same temperature in the presence of 5 mm unlabeled Glc and finally with the label for 60 min followed by a 60-min incubation with 50 mm Glc. Cells were then processed as above for obtaining N-glycans, but the denatured cell pellets obtained after organic solvent-water treatments were incubated with 0.4 ml of 0.1 n NaOH overnight at room temperature. Solutions were neutralized with 0.1 n HCl, and 0.3 ml of water was then added. The supernatants obtained upon the addition of 2 ml of methanol were dried, resuspended in water, and desalted with a mixed bead (H+/acetate) resin. Methods—Paper chromatographies were performed on Whatman 1 papers with solvents A (1-propanol/nitromethane/water (5:2:4)), B (1-butanol/pyridine/water (10:3:3)), and C (1-butanol/pyridine/water (4:3:4)). N-Glycans were analyzed also by partition chromatography using a Glyco-Pak N column (Waters); 14C-labeled glycans were dissolved in 200 μl of CH3CN:H2O (75:25, v/v) and applied to the column equilibrated with CH3CN, 1 mm NaH2PO4 in H2O (80:20, v/v). A linear gradient over 280 min was employed starting from the above mentioned initial condition and ending at CH3CN, 1 mm NaH2PO4 in H2O (45:55, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and dried in a SpeedVac. Radioactivity was quantified after solubilizing the eluted material in 200 μl of water. The sizes of the main peaks in HPLC runs were ascertained by rerunning them on paper chromatography with appropriate standards at both sides of the samples. Strong acid hydrolysis was performed in 1 n HCl for 4 h at 100°C. Acetolysis and jack bean α-mannosidase treatments were performed as described before (17Engel J.C. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10105-10110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays—S. cerevisiae microsomes were prepared as described previously (9Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NDPase activities were essentially assayed as described with slight modifications (18Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, between 10 and 25 μg of membrane proteins were incubated in a total volume of 100 μl in 0.2 m imidazol buffer pH 7.2, 0.1% digitonin, 10 mm CaCl2, and a 2 mm concentration of the corresponding NDP and incubated for 5-10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped upon the addition of 100 μl of 10% SDS and 100 μl of water. Liberated phosphate was assayed as described (19Ames B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Crossref Scopus (3013) Google Scholar), employing 15-min incubations at 45 °C. Phosphates present either in microsomes and reagents or liberated during incubations at 45 °C were estimated for each tube with blanks in which the SDS was added before the membrane fractions. Glucosidase II and GDP-Man- and α-methylmannoside-dependent activities were assayed as described before (12D' Alessio C. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22379-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Chappell T.G. Nasser Hajibagheri M.A. Ayscough K. Pierce M. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For the assay of the former enzyme either the labeled or unlabeled substrates indicated in Ref. 12D' Alessio C. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22379-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar were employed. Fractionation of S. cerevisiae microsomal membranes by sucrose gradient centrifugations was performed as previously described (12D' Alessio C. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22379-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of NDPs by Mutant Cell Microsomes—Alg5 mutant cells were used throughout all experiments, since one of the purposes of the present work was to probe in vivo UDP-Glc entrance into the ER by assaying GT-mediated glycoprotein glucosylation. Alg5 cells are defective in the dolichol-P-Glc synthetase and thence transfer to proteins Man9GlcNAc2 instead of the complete glycan (21Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In these mutants, therefore, monoglucosylated glycans can be formed only by GT-mediated activity. Alg5, alg5 gda1, alg5 ynd1, and alg5 gda1 ynd1 mutant cells were obtained as described above. As already described for gda1 ynd1 mutants, alg5 gda1 ynd1 cells were severely impaired in the germination of spores but much less affected in vegetative growth (3Gao X-D Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The doubling times of alg5, alg5 gda1, alg5 ynd1, and alg5 gda1 ynd1 cells in YPD + Ade medium at 28 °C were 113, 116, 113, and 345 min, respectively. Alg5 gda1 ynd1 cells looked under the light microscope as shown for gda1 ynd1 mutants in Fig. 4 of Ref. 3Gao X-D Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. Further, alg5 gda1 ynd1 cells were able to mate (see “Experimental Procedures”). UDPase and GDPase activities were assayed in microsomes derived from alg5, alg5 gda1, alg5 ynd1, and alg5 gda1 ynd1 mutant cells. As mentioned above, the GDA1 and YND1 genes code for the GDPase/UDPase and apyrase activities, respectively. Alg5 gda1 ynd1 mutant cells were totally devoid of UDPase and GDPase activities in the microsomal membranes (Fig. 1A). This result agrees with the analysis of S. cerevisiae genome that detected only two proteins of possible secretory pathway location (Gda1p and Ynd1p) bearing the so-called apyrase conserved regions (3Gao X-D Kaigorodov V. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21450-21456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There are two pieces of evidence indicating that alg5 gda1 ynd1 mutants still conserved distinct ER and Golgi compartments: (a) similar separations between glucosidase II (an ER marker) and a GDP-Man dependent mannosyltransferase (a Golgi marker) were observed on submitting alg5- and alg5 gda1 ynd1-derived microsomes to sucrose gradient centrifugations (Fig. 1B), and (b) as will be described below (Fig. 4F), the presence of both gda1 and ynd1 mutations did not affect the restriction to the ER-Golgi anterograde vesicular traffic imposed at 37 °C by the sec12 mutation.FIGURE 4N-mannosylation in mutants defective in NDPases. Cells were pulse-chased with [14C]Glc and Endo H-sensitive, whole cell N-glycans separated by HPLC. Cells used were as follows: alg5 (A), alg5 gda1 (B), alg5 ynd1 (C), alg5 gda1 ynd1 (D and E). In E, cells were incubated with DMJ plus KFN. In F, alg5 gda1 ynd1 sec12 cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C and further pulse-chased at the same temperature in the presence of DMJ plus KFN. Standards were as follows: M8, Man8GlcNAc; M9, Man9GlcNAc; M10, Man10GlcNAc. For further details, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of S. pombe GT in S. cerevisiae ER—S. cerevisiae alg5 mutant cells transfected with a low copy number expression vector coding for S. pombe GT were incubated for 30 min with 5 mm [14C]Glc in the presence of 2.5 mm NMDNJ, a glucosidase II inhibitor and 5 mm dithiothreitol. This reagent effectively prevents proper folding, and thus ER exit, of glycoproteins by interfering with disulfide bond formation (22Simons J.F. Ferro-Novick S. Rose M.D. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Secretion of disulfide-free proteins is not affected. The pattern of N-glycans obtained after submitting whole cell proteins to a drastic proteolytic degradation followed by Endo H treatment of resulting glycopeptides showed that the main peak thus liberated migrated as a Man8GlcNAc standard, but also material in the position expected for Glc1Man8GlcNAc was detected (Fig. 2A). Strong acid hydrolysis of the material shown in Fig. 2A followed by paper chromatography revealed the presence of labeled Glc and Man units (Fig. 3A). No material migrating as Glc1Man8GlcNAc and no labeled Glc residues appeared either when NMDNJ was omitted from the incubation or when the expression vector did not encode GT (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3, B and C). Patterns similar to those shown in Figs. 2A and 3A were obtained with alg5 sec12 as well as with alg5 ufe1 mutant cells at the restrictive temperature (Figs. 2, D and E, and 3, D and E). At this temperature, the sec12 mutation totally impairs the initial stages in the formation of COPII-coated vesicles, responsible for ER to Golgi vesicular traffic (23Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). On the other hand, at the restrictive temperature, the ufe1 mutati"

To examine its role in cholecystokinin processing, cholecystokinin levels were measured in dissected brain regions from prohormone convertase 2 knock-out mice. Cholecystokinin levels were lower in hippocampus, septum, thalamus, mesencephalon, and pons in knock-out mice than wild-type mice. In cerebral cortex, cortex-related structures and olfactory bulb, cholecystokinin levels were higher than wild type. Female mice were more affected by the loss of prohormone convertase 2 than male mice. The decrease in cholecystokinin levels in these brain regions shows that prohormone convertase 2 is important for cholecystokinin processing. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements were performed to examine the relationship between peptide levels and cholecystokinin and enzyme expression. They revealed that cholecystokinin and prohormone convertase 1 mRNA levels in cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb were actually lower in knock-out than wild type, whereas their expression in other brain regions of knock-out mouse brain was the same as wild type. Female mice frequently had higher expression of cholecystokinin and prohormone convertase 1, 2, and 5 mRNA than male mice. The loss of prohormone convertase 2 alters CCK processing in specific brain regions. This loss also appears to trigger compensatory mechanisms in cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb that produce elevated levels of cholecystokinin but do not involve increased expression of cholecystokinin, prohormone convertase 1 or 5 mRNA.

Cholecystokinin (CCK) 2The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; CA1-CA4, CA1-CA4 subfields of ammon's horn of the hippocampal formation; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PFC, prefrontal cortex; PC, prohormone convertase; TPCK, l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketone; QPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; VTA/SN, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra; RIA, radioimmunoassay. is one of the most abundant and widely distributed neuropeptides in mammalian brain (1.Beinfeld M.C. Meyer D.K. Eskay R.L. Jensen R.T. Brownstein M.J. Brain Res. 1981; 212: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Pre-pro-CCK has a molecular weight of 12,826, and the active CCK 8 sequence is flanked by a short C-terminal segment and a long N-terminal segment. During its post-translational processing, pro-CCK is tyrosine-sulfated and cleaved at multiple sites by endoproteases. C-terminal arginines are removed by a carboxypeptidase, and its C-terminal glycine is converted to an amide (2.Beinfeld M.C. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sequence of mouse pro-CCK and its cleavage sites are shown in Fig. 1. The cleavage of pro-CCK occurs exclusively at single or double basic residues. The best candidates for these enzymes are the prohormone convertases (PC). They are responsible for processing a wide variety of peptide hormones, growth factors, neuropeptides, and bacterial and viral virulence factors. Among them, the most likely candidates for CCK processing are PC1 (3.Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Gaspar I. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), PC2 (4.Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2997-3000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PC5 (5.Nakagawa T. Hosaka M. Torii S. Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem.

They are widely co-localized with CCK in specific neuronal populations in rat brain (13.Cain B. Connolly K. Blum A. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Beinfeld M.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14.Cain B.M. Connolly K. Blum A.C. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Beinfeld M.C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The most dramatic example of co-localization is the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1-CA4 subfield of hippocampus where all three enzymes are present in at least 80% of CCK neurons (13.Cain B. Connolly K. Blum A. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Beinfeld M.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PCs are also found in a number of endocrine and neuronal tumor cell lines, including those which naturally express CCK mRNA and are capable of cleaving pro-CCK into appropriate products that can be further acted on by carboxypeptidase and amidation enzymes to yield amidated CCK8 or CCK22 (15.Beinfeld M.C. Neuropeptides. 1992; 22: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Haun R.S. Beinfeld M.C. Roos B.A. Dixon J.E.

A number of studies support the hypothesis that PC1, PC2, and PC5 are all capable of appropriately cleaving pro-CCK (2.Beinfeld M.C. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mice lacking PC1 or PC2 (18.Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H.

In PC1 or PC2 knock-out mice, CCK levels were reduced in specific brain regions relative to wild-type mice (14.Cain B.M. Connolly K. Blum A.C. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Beinfeld M.C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20.Vishnuvardhan D. Connolly K. Cain B. Beinfeld M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The reduction in CCK levels varied in different brain regions and correlated well with their co-localization with CCK at the mRNA level. In no tissue was CCK undetectable; other enzymes appear to exist that produce some CCK. The current study was performed to better correlate the known distribution of CCK and PC2 with the levels of CCK in specific brain regions of PC2 knock-out and wild-type mice. Tissue was also harvested for RNA to perform quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) measurements of CCK, PC1, PC2, and PC5 mRNA abundance to better understand the compensatory changes that occur in the absence of PC2. Mice—Animal experiments were approved by the Tufts University Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Male and female PC2 knock-out (B6;129-Pcsk2tm1Dfs) and wild-type (B6129SF2/J) mice, ages 9–13 weeks at sacrifice, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Their genotype was confirmed using tail DNA, as previously described (18.Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouillé Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Mouse Sacrifice and Dissection—Mice were euthanized with 9:1 mixture of ketamine/xylazine (about 0.15 ml, intraperitoneal) and decapitated. The brains were removed quickly and the olfactory bulbs and hypothalamus were free hand-dissected. The cerebellum was removed and discarded, and the pons, medulla, and spinal cord were free hand-dissected. The remaining forebrain was sectioned on wet ice into 1-mm coronal slices using a mouse brain mold and razor blades. The brain regions to be analyzed were free hand-dissected from these slices. The hippocampal tissue for RIA was dissected from the anterior portion of this region, which has the highest density of CCK-positive cells (13.Cain B. Connolly K. Blum A. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Beinfeld M.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and included hippocampal subfields CA1-CA4 and dentate gyrus. For QPCR measurements, the whole hippocampus was removed. For RNA extractions, the mouse brains were rapidly dissected on wet ice under RNase-free conditions. They were free hand-dissected without being sectioned. All tissues were frozen immediately in Eppendorf tubes on dry ice and stored at -80 °C until extraction. Tissue Extraction for RIA—For RIA, tissues were sonicated in 0.1 n HCl, and an aliquot was removed for total protein determination by the BCA method (Pierce). CCK RIA—CCK was measured using an RIA as previously described (1.Beinfeld M.C. Meyer D.K. Eskay R.L. Jensen R.T. Brownstein M.J. Brain Res. 1981; 212: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The R5 antiserum cross-reacts equally well with sulfated CCK8, CCK12, CCK22, CCK33, and unsulfated gastrin 17. It has about a 10-fold lower cross-reactivity with nonsulfated CCK peptides. The difference in RIA data between groups was determined with an unpaired Student's t test (Prizm graphics), with significance set at p < .05. CCK-Gly RIA—CCK-Gly-like immunoreactive peptides were detected with an antiserum that detects gastrin 13-Gly and CCK8-Gly. These have very low (<0.1%) cross-reactivity with CCK8 Gly-Arg or CCK8 Gly-Arg-Arg and use 125I-gastrin13 Gly as its tracer and CCK8 Gly as its standard (22.Cain B.M. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M.C. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23.Beinfeld M.C. Perloff M.D. Venkatakrishnan K. Peptides. 1998; 19: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Trypsin and Carboxypeptidase Treatment—Both enzymes were purchased from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). Extracts were neutralized with one-fifth volume of 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and an equal volume of TPCK trypsin (2 mg/ml) was added. After 30 min at 20 °C, the samples were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. They were then treated with carboxypeptidase B (5.6 μg per microliter sample) for 30 min at 20 °C and for 10 min at 100 °C prior to the CCK-Gly RIA. RNA Extraction—Frozen tissues were homogenized with an Ultraturrax homogenizer in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Two hundred microliters of chloroform was added, the samples were shaken at room temperature for 15 s and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. To the aqueous supernatant, 0.35 ml of absolute ethanol was added, and the RNA was further purified with RNAeasy columns (Qiagen). The RNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The A280/260 ratio was between 2.00 and 2.12. Reverse Transcription and QPCR—First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA (previously treated for 10 min at room temperature with DNase) in a 20-μl reverse transcriptase reaction mixture using random decamers following the RETROscript manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). Real-time PCR reactions were performed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing one-twentieth volume of cDNA preparation, 1× SYBR Green mix (Applied Biosystems) with 5 pmol of each primer. Real-time quantifications were performed using GeneAmp 7300 sequence detection system, and the fluorescence threshold values were calculated using the GeneAmp 7300 software. The expression of CCK, PC1, PC2, and PC5 were compared with expression of 18 S mRNA. Mouse CCK primers were forward: 5′-GCA CTG CTA GCG CGA TAC ATC-3′ and reverse: 5′-CCA GGC TCT GCA GGT TCT TAA G-3′. Mouse PC1 primers were forward: 5′-AGT TGG AGG CAT AAG GCT G-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCC TTC TGG GCT AGT CTG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCC TTC TGG GCT AGT CTG-3′. Mouse PC2 primers were from SuperArray (Frederick, MD). The primers for 18 S were forward: 5′-CCC CTC GAT GCT CTT AGC TGA GTG T-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGT TGG AGC CAT AAG AAT GCT G-3′. Initial conditions for PCR were (in centigrade) 55 °C for 2 min, 95 °C 10 min and then cycling for 40 cycles between 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The cycle threshold (Ct) of CCK, PC1, PC2, and PC5 was subtracted from the Ct of 18 S giving the dCt. The value of the control dCt (wild type) was set to one, and the control dCt was subtracted from the experimental (knock-out) dCt yielding the ddCt. The difference in expression between control and experimental was calculated as 2-ddCt, as described (24.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124688) Google Scholar). HPLC—Extracts from male and female knock-out and wild-type mice were pooled separately, with twice the volume of knock-out hippocampus compared with wild type. The extracts were partially purified by absorption and elution from Millipore C18 Sep Pack cartridges (Waters, Bedford, MA). HPLC was carried out with a Waters Alliance HPLC system using a 4.6 × 250 Symmetry Shield RP 18 column. The column was eluted with a 60-min gradient of 22.5 to 31.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min. One-minute fractions were collected; 0.3 ml of each fraction was dried down in a Savant vacuum concentrator in RIA tubes for the CCK RIA. CCK8 sulfate was obtained from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Levels of amidated CCK were measured in 14 different brain regions from male and female wild-type and PC2 knock-out mice (TABLE ONE). CCK levels were significantly reduced in hippocampus and elevated in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporal cortex in both male and female knock-out mice relative to wild type. CCK levels of female knock-out mice were more likely to differ from female wild type than the male knock-outs differ from their wild types. This was apparent in the olfactory bulb, ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra (VTA/SN), and caudate putamen. In contrast, the male knock-outs were more strongly affected than the females in the septum and thalamus.TABLE ONECCK levels in brain regions of male and female wild-type and PC2 knock-out miceBrain regionMale wild typeMale knock-outFemale wild typeFemale knock-outng/mg proteinaData expressed as mean ± S.E.Olfactory bulb1.59 ± 0.29 (10)bThe number of samples/group is indicated in parentheses2.19 ± 0.30 (13)1.04 ± 0.17 (7)2.39 ± 0.37cp = <0.05 (12)Hypothalamus1.59 ± 0.14 (13)1.51 ± 0.12 (17)1.43 ± 0.26 (11)1.42 ± 0.22 (14)Prefrontal cortex0.95 ± 0.29 (12)2.14 ± 0.31cp = <0.05 (17)1.48 ± 0.22 (10)2.82 ± 0.27cp = <0.05 (16)Temporal cortex5.84 ± 0.95 (11)10.97 ± 1.98cp = <0.05 (12)5.89 ± 0.97 (10)11.78 ± 1.01cp = <0.05 (13)Caudate putamen1.05 ± 0.17 (11)1.56 ± 0.17 (17)0.91 ± 0.18 (10)2.03 ± 0.32cp = <0.05 (15)Basal forebrain0.91 ± 0.21 (10)1.76 ± 0.37 (12)1.15 ± 0.23 (8)1.60 ± 0.25 (13)Septum1.17 ± 0.16 (11)0.69 ± 0.11cp = <0.05 (13)0.89 ± 0.14 (8)0.69 ± 0.08 (15)Hippocampus0.51 ± 0.14 (11)0.21 ± 0.06cp = <0.05 (17)0.86 ± 0.27 (10)0.40 ± 0.08cp = <0.05 (15)Thalamus0.16 ± 0.04 (11)0.04 ± 0.01cp = <0.05 (14)0.08 ± 0.02 (8)0.08 ± 0.01 (13)Amygdala2.13 ± 0.24 (11)1.91 ± 0.21 (17)2.19 ± 0.43 (10)1.97 ± 0.27 (14)VTA/SN0.27 ± 0.11 (10)0.11 ± 0.02 (12)0.44 ± 0.12 (8)0.14 ± 0.03cp = <0.05 (13)Pons0.10 ± 0.02 (11)0.07 ± 0.01 (17)0.13 ± 0.02 (11)0.09 ± 0.01 (15)Medulla0.06 ± 0.01 (13)0.11 ± 0.04 (15)0.15 ± 0.05 (11)0.10 ± 0.03 (15)Spinal cord0.28 + 0.04 (11)0.22 + 0.04 (16)0.18 + 0.14 (10)0.16 + 0.03 (15)a Data expressed as mean ± S.E.b The number of samples/group is indicated in parenthesesc p = <0.05 Open table in a new tab When data from male and female knock-out mice were pooled and compared with pooled data from wild-type mice, additional significant changes were evident (TABLE TWO).

There was a 3-fold increase in these peptides in knock-out PFC, whereas the levels in the hippocampus were the same in knock-out and wild type (TABLE THREE). CCK-Gly levels were also measured in these extracts after they had been treated sequentially with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B to convert all CCK precursor forms into CCK-Gly. This treatment greatly increased the levels of CCK-Gly peptides in all samples. In the PFC, levels of CCK-Gly were higher in the knock-outs, whereas the levels in the hippocampus of those two groups were the same (TABLE THREE).TABLE THREECCK Gly levels in brain regions of wild-type and PC2 knock-out miceBrain regionWild typeKnock-outng/mg proteinaData expressed as mean ± S.E.Prefrontal cortex0.14 ± 0.04 (8)bThe number of samples/group is indicated in the parentheses0.45 ± 0.14cp = <0.05 (7)Hippocampus0.25 + 0.06 (8)0.23 + 0.08 (6)Prefrontal cortexdTreated with trypsin followed by carboxypeptidase B prior to CCK Gly RIA1.64 ± 0.69 (13)6.16 ± 1.1cp = <0.05 (11)HippocampusdTreated with trypsin followed by carboxypeptidase B prior to CCK Gly RIA3.82 + 1.50 (10)3.41 + 0.74 (12)a Data expressed as mean ± S.E.b The number of samples/group is indicated in the parenthesesc p = <0.05d Treated with trypsin followed by carboxypeptidase B prior to CCK Gly RIA Open table in a new tab To better understand how peptide levels are related to the mRNA expression levels for CCK, PC1, PC2, and PC5, QPCR was performed on RNA extracted from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons-medulla, spinal cord, and olfactory bulbs of mice of each sex and genotype. The results are presented in TABLES FOUR and FIVE. CCK mRNA levels were decreased in the cerebral cortex of knock-out mice relative to wild type, mRNA expression levels were not different from wild type in knock-out hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons-medulla, or spinal cord. PC1 mRNA levels were also decreased in male and female knock-out cerebral cortex and male knock-out olfactory bulb whereas they were unchanged in knock-out hippocampus, hypothalamus, or spinal cord. PC1 mRNA levels increased in male knock-out pons-medulla. PC5 mRNA levels were unchanged in male knock-out cerebral cortex, hippocampus, pons-medulla, spinal cord, and olfactory bulb relative to wild type. However, they were decreased in male knock-out hypothalamus.TABLE FOURComparison of CCK, PC1, and PC5 mRNA levels in wild-type and knock-out mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus,

tab The QPCR data were further analyzed to examine sex differences in the expression of CCK, PC1, PC2 (wild type only), and PC5 (TABLE FIVE). Of the 43 comparisons made, in 11 cases, females were higher than males; this was observed more often with CCK and PC5. These differences were equally distributed between wild type and knock-outs. In only one case (wild-type males), CCK was higher in males than females. The molecular forms of CCK in PFC and hippocampus extracts were separated by HPLC and measured with the CCK RIA. The major form detected co-eluted with synthetic CCK8 sulfate in both wild-type and knock-out tissue extracts from both tissues (Fig. 2). The identity of the peak eluting earlier than CCK8 in the PFC is not known. It does not elute with sulfated CCK12, CCK22, or CCK33. It is unlikely to be oxidized CCK8, which elutes much earlier on the column, near the void volume (25.Beinfeld M.C. Jensen R.T. Brownstein M.J. J. Liquid Chromatog. 1980; 3: 1367-1371Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It does appear to be somewhat more prominent in the knock-out sample. In the absence of PC2, CCK levels were reduced in hippocampus, VTA/SN, septum, thalamus, and pons. This is consistent with previous anatomical studies, as PC2 is highly co-localized with CCK in hippocampus, VTA/SN, and thalamus (13.Cain B. Connolly K. Blum A. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Beinfeld M.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The septum receives a major CCK projection from the hippocampus (26.Handelmann G. Beinfeld M.C. O'Donohue T.L. Nelson J.B. Brenneman D.E. Peptides. 1983; 4: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), so the level of CCK in the septum probably reflects the decreased level in the hippocampus. As described in previous publications (20.Vishnuvardhan D. Connolly K. Cain B. Beinfeld M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21.Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the loss of PC2 decreases CCK levels in specific brain regions. The lack of change of CCK levels in the hypothalamus, and the decrease in forebrain (minus cerebral cortex and hypothalamus) in the previous study (20.Vishnuvardhan D. Connolly K. Cain B. Beinfeld M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is consistent with the results of the current study. The decrease in CCK levels in whole mouse brain (21.Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in cerebral cortex (20.Vishnuvardhan D. Connolly K. Cain B. Beinfeld M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is puzzling in light of the current study. Indeed, differences in methods of euthanasia and tissue dissection were used. It is conceivable that CCK is elevated in only some brain regions (in particular PFC and temporal cortex) so that when other areas where CCK might be reduced are combined, CCK levels actually go down. The increase in glycine extended CCK peptides in PFC seen in the current study was also seen in whole brain in the previous study (21.Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Female knock-out mice were more affected by the loss of PC2 than male mice. With some exceptions, female mice of both genotypes had higher levels of CCK, PC1, PC2, and PC5 mRNA than males. These sex differences emphasize the importance of examining the effects of the loss of individual genes in both genders. The loss of PC2 did not change the major form of CCK produced by cerebral cortex or hippocampus. Whichever enzyme(s) process pro-CCK in the absence of PC2 seem to produce the same major product. It is clear that PC2 is important for production of CCK in some brain regions, most notably hippocampus, thalamus, septum, VTA/SN, and pons where the loss of PC2 results in lower levels of CCK. Based on the number of areas having increased and decreased CCK levels in PC2 knock-out mice as compared with the PC1 knock-out mice (14.Cain B.M. Connolly K. Blum A.C. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Beinfeld M.C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the loss of PC2 appears to have greater consequences for CCK processing. The loss of PC1 (14.Cain B.M. Connolly K. Blum A.C. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Beinfeld M.C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also reduced CCK levels in the hippocampus, suggesting that PC1 and PC2 may together be responsible for the majority of CCK processing in this structure. In all tissues examined in both knock-outs, there was never a complete loss of CCK, suggesting that redundancy exists in the enzymes that process pro-CCK. Neither PC1 nor PC5 were up-regulated by the loss of PC2, but existing levels of these enzymes may be adequate to ensure production of some CCK. Increased CCK levels in the olfactory bulb in PC2 knock-out raises an interesting question about the identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for CCK processing in this structure. In a previous anatomical study of rat brain (13.Cain B. Connolly K. Blum A. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Beinfeld M.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), PC2 was highly co-localized, PC1 was somewhat co-localized whereas PC5 showed little co-localization with CCK in the olfactory bulb. PC1 knock-out mice had the same levels of CCK as the wild-type mice in their olfactory bulbs (14.Cain B.M. Connolly K. Blum A.C. Vishnuvardhan D. Marchand J.E. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. Beinfeld M.C. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and PC2 knock-out mice had elevated CCK levels. These observations provide good evidence that none of these enzymes are responsible for the processing of CCK in this structure. Two other members of the PC family (PC7 and PACE4) are present in the olfactory bulb (12.Dong W. Marcinkiewicz M. Vieau D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Day R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1778-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and may be responsible for CCK processing there. The increase in CCK levels in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and structures receiving CCK innervations from the cerebral cortex is intriguing. Because CCK is increased in both PFC and temporal cortex, this appears to be a generalized cerebral cortical phenomenon. A previous study (21.Rehfeld J.F. Lindberg I. Friis-Hansen L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) found increased levels of glycine extended CCK in whole PC2 knock-out brains relative to control, whereas levels of amidated CCK decreased. The current study found CCK-Gly levels to be elevated in PFC but not in hippocampus whereas CCK levels increased in PFC and decreased in hippocampus. The regional heterogeneity of this phenotype points out the importance of closely examining individual brain regions. It is not known how the loss of PC2 produces elevated levels of CCK in the PFC and olfactory bulb. Total precursor levels are elevated in PFC, which provides the substrate for higher levels of amidated CCK. Higher levels of glycine extended CCK in the knock-outs before trypsin and carboxypeptidase treatment are consistent with increased enzymatic activity. The loss of PC2 may have stimulated the expression or activity of another enzyme that is able to process CCK and resulted in higher levels of CCK-Gly and CCK amide. The increase in CCK in the olfactory bulb is not caused by cerebral cortical innervation as CCK is present in local interneurons within the bulb. It is possible that the same mechanism that raises levels of CCK in the cortex is also operating in the bulb. It is possible that the decrease in expression of CCK and PC1 mRNA and the increased levels of amidated CCK are actually related. The CCK (28.Hansen T.V. Rehfeld J.F. Nielsen F.C. Mol.

Regul. Pept. 1996; 67: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and endocrine tumor cells (17.Yoon J.Y. Beinfeld M.C. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 973-977Google Scholar). It is possible that the loss of PC2 reduces the processing of another peptide or protein that normally stimulates cAMP. This reduction in cAMP could decrease expression of CCK and PC1 mRNA and decrease the release of CCK in the cerebral cortex. This could cause an accumulation of CCK in vesicles resulting in higher tissue levels of CCK. This mechanism may not be unique to CCK. Similar mechanisms may be responsible for increased levels of neuropeptides observed in some brain regions in PC2 knock-out mice (33.Miller R. Toneff T. Vishnuvardhan D. Beinfeld M. Hook V.Y. Neuropeptides. 2003; 37: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)."

Specific design requirements leading to high structural fidelity between extracellular domain nAChRs and full-length nAChRs, however, are not well understood. To study these requirements in heteromeric nAChRs, the extracellular domains of α4 and β2 subunits with or without the first transmembrane domain (M1) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and compared with α4β2 nAChRs based on ligand binding and subunit assembly properties. Ligand affinities of detergent-solubilized, extracellular domain α4β2 nAChRs formed from subunits with M1 were nearly identical to affinities of α4β2 nAChRs when measured with [3H]epibatidine, cytisine, nicotine, and acetylcholine. Velocity sedimentation suggested that these extracellular domain nAChRs predominantly formed pentamers. The yield of these extracellular domain nAChRs was about half the yield of α4β2 nAChRs. In contrast, [3H]epibatidine binding was not detected from the extracellular domain α4 and β2 subunits without M1, implying no detectable expression of extracellular domain nAChRs from these subunits. These results suggest that M1 domains on both α4 and β2 play an important role for efficient expression of extracellular domain α4β2 nAChRs that are high fidelity structural models of full-length α4β2 nAChRs.

They are members of the superfamily of nicotinoid receptors, which includes γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A and C, glycine, and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors. They contain five homologous subunits, with subunits designated α1-α10, β1-β4, δ, γ, and ϵ. Each subunit is an integral membrane protein with a large, ligand-binding N-terminal extracellular domain, four transmembrane domains (M1-M4), and a cytoplasmic loop between M3 and M4. The study of structure and dynamics of nAChRs has been motivated by their roles in normal and pathologic neurophysiology, including roles in addiction, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, myasthenia gravis, and congenital myasthenic syndromes (5Lindstrom J.

Continuing to move to structures of native nAChRs is needed for accurate knowledge of how these receptors function as ion channels and signal transducers, for understanding differences in pharmacological profiles and kinetics of different receptors, and for designing drugs to therapeutically target specific types of receptors for specific effects in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Structures of full-length nAChRs have been elusive because they are large, integral membrane proteins. One attractive strategy to make nAChRs more tractable for high resolution structural analysis is to produce water-soluble models from the extracellular domain without transmembrane domains. Compared with full-length nAChRs, water-soluble extracellular domain nAChRs are expected to crystallize more readily and, because of their smaller molecular mass, are expected to be better candidates for structural studies by NMR spectroscopy. This approach has shown promise for nAChRs. Models of extracellular domains of nAChRs have ranged from short amino acid sequences around the agonist-binding site (19Basus V.J. Song G. Hawrot E.

These models, however, have only partially reproduced ligand binding affinities and subunit assembly properties of full-length receptors, motivating a search for models that more fully reflect the properties of full-length receptors. Extracellular domain nAChRs are defined here as comprising truncated subunits containing N-terminal extracellular domain sequences and having ligand binding affinities or subunit assembly properties similar to full-length nAChRs. They have been expressed with several subunit combinations. Dimeric extracellular domain nAChRs were produced by extracellular domains of α1 and δ subunits that also contained M1 or another membrane tether, suggesting that membrane attachment of subunits might be important for forming these extracellular domain nAChRs (31Wang Z.-Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Wang Z.-Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Extracellular domains of α7 subunits linked to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety were transported to the surface of Xenopus oocytes and bound α-bungarotoxin (αBgt) and d-tubocurarine (33West A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25468-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), implying the formation of multimers. Water-soluble extracellular domain α7 nAChRs without any transmembrane domains bound αBgt, nicotine, and acetylcholine with affinities similar to α7 nAChRs and likely were pentamers (34Wells G.B. Anand R. Wang F. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 964-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Their yield, however, was substantially smaller than the yield of detergent-solubilized, extracellular domain α7 nAChRs that contained M1, suggesting that M1 was important for expressing these extracellular domain nAChRs. Milligram amounts of a water-soluble, extracellular domain chimera containing α7 and AChBP sequences were produced in yeast (26Avramopoulou V. Mamalaki A. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38287-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These extracellular domains formed oligomers that likely were pentamers. Water-soluble, pentameric, and extracellular domain muscle-type receptors without transmembrane domains have been demonstrated with electron microscopy (35Tierney M.L. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Different subunit combinations might more readily produce pentameric, water-soluble nAChRs than do extracellular domain α7 or muscle-type subunits. To extend the concept of extracellular domain nAChRs to other subunits and to investigate further the role of M1 in the formation of extracellular domain nAChRs, α4 and β2 subunits were studied because they produce heteromeric nAChRs and must form at least dimers to produce high affinity binding sites and because they offer potential for high level expression (36Wang D.X. Abood L.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Extracellular domain α4 and β2 subunits with M1 produced nAChRs in Xenopus oocytes with ligand affinities nearly identical with those of α4β2 nAChRs. The subunit stoichiometry of extracellular domain α4β2 nAChRs with M1 likely was pentameric. Without M1, however, no extracellular domain nAChRs were detected, suggesting that M1 plays an important role in the efficient expression of extracellular α4β2 nAChRs. Design of Subunit DNA Plasmids—The cDNAs for human α4 subunit (37Kuryatov A. Gerzanich V. Nelson M. Olale F. Lindstrom J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9035-9047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human β2 subunit (38Anand R. Lindstrom J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were cloned into pSP64 poly(A) (Promega). The DNA sequences for α4M1, β2M1, α4WS, and β2WS extracellular domain constructs (Fig. 1) were derived from the α4 or β2 sequences by PCR. The N-terminal primers for PCR were GCGC AAGCTT ATG GAG CTA GGG GGC CCC GGA for both α4-derived extracellular domain constructs and GCGC CTGCAG ATG GCC CGG CGC TGC GGC CCC for both β2-derived extracellular domain constructs. The C-terminal primers for PCR were GCGC ACGCGT CTC GGA GGG CAG GTA GAA GAC for α4M1, GCGC ACGCGT GTC GGA TGG CAG GTA GAA GAC for β2M1, GCGC ACGCGT CAG CCG CCG GAT GAC GAA GGC for α4WS, and GCGC ACGCGT CTT GCG GCG AAT GAT GAA GTC for β2WS. PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was performed with 10 ng of template DNA and 50 pmol of each primer for 30 cycles in 4% Me2SO with annealing at 60 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The α4M1 and α4WS products from PCR were cut with HindIII and MluI; the β2M1 and β2WS products were cut with PstI and MluI. These restricted PCR products were ligated into pSP64 poly(A) along with a double-stranded oligonucleotide cassette coding in-frame for two copies of the mAb 142 epitope QVTGEVIFQTPLIKNP (39Das M.K. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for β2M1 and β2WS. The DNA sequences of each epitope tag contained an MluI site before and a stop codon after the sequence coding the epitope tag. To reduce the length of subunit sequence that was derived from PCR, the α4 sequence upstream from its BstYI restriction site and the β2 sequence upstream from its BsiWI were replaced by DNA sequences that were taken from the full-length subunits. The last native residues in the constructs were Glu-270 (α4 numbering from Swiss-Prot (41Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Wu C.H. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B. Ferro S. Gasteiger E. Huang H. Lopez R. Magrane M.

The DNA sequences for α4M1NT and β2M1NT were prepared by replacing the MluI site at the 5′ end of the epitope tag coding sequence with an MluI site followed by a stop codon. The DNA sequences for α4WSNT and β2WSNT were prepared by replacing the native coding sequence distal to the BglII site near the 3′ end of α4WS and distal to the BsiWI near the 3′ end in β2WS with the identical coding sequence from synthetic oligonucleotides up to and including Leu-242 (α4WSNT) or Lys-233 (β2WSNT) followed by a stop codon. The correctness of products derived from PCR or from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus laevis were purchased from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI) and maintained in 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 18 °C. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas A & M University approved all animal procedures. Oocytes were prepared following standard procedures (42Matthews G.M. Higgins S.J. Protein Expression: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 29-59Google Scholar, 43Colman A. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1984: 271-302Google Scholar), using collagenase type I (Invitrogen) for enzymatic stripping of the follicular layer. cRNA was synthesized from linearized plasmid DNA using an SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). A 40-nl aliquot containing 20 ng of cRNA for each subunit being studied was injected into the cytoplasm of each oocyte. The oocytes then were incubated at 18 °C for 3-4 days in 50% Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. The membrane-bound fraction of subunit protein was extracted from oocyte membranes by homogenizing 25-50 oocytes by hand in ice-cold buffer A (in mm: 50 sodium phosphate, 50 NaCl, 5 EDTA, 5 EGTA, 5 benzamidine, 15 iodoacetamide, pH 7.5), centrifuging this mixture for 30 min at 14,500 × g and 4 °C, solubilizing the pellet in buffer B (buffer A with 2% w/v Triton X-100) during gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C, and again centrifuging for 30 min at 14,500 × g and 4 °C (44Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharm. 1994; 45: 212-220PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was defined as the detergent extract. The membrane fraction was used for immunoblotting and ligand binding assays of subunits with transmembrane domains. For α4WS, α4WSNT, β2WS, and β2WSNT, the secreted fraction from injected oocytes was defined as the L-15 medium incubating injected oocytes; the cytoplasmic fraction from injected oocytes was defined as the supernatant above the pellet after homogenizing oocytes in buffer A and centrifuging. Immunoblotting—Membrane fractions of α4M1, β2M1, α4WS, and β2WS were deglycosylated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs), a glycosylasparaginase, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane fractions were processed in parallel without PNGase F. After deglycosylation, the samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 90 s in 1% SDS and 15 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were run by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a GENIE® electrophoretic transfer device (Idea Scientific). The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% powdered milk in PBS buffer and 0.05% Tween® 20. Primary antibody (mAb 142 for α4M1 and α4WS; mAb 236 for β2M1 and β2WS) at 3 nm in blocking solution was incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C, followed by washing for several hours with PBS and 0.05% Tween. Goat anti-rat secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Pierce) was diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer, incubated with the membrane overnight at 4 °C, and then washed several hours with PBS and 0.05% Tween. Proteins on the membrane were detected on BioMax ML film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ligand Binding Assays—Immulon 4 HBX plastic microwells (Thermo Labsystems) for solid phase binding assays were coated with mAb 142 or mAb 236 for subunits with epitope tags (39Das M.K. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 40Anand R. Bason L. Saedi M.S. Gerzanich V. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9975-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); mAb 295, which binds the extracellular domain of β2 in its native conformation (45Lindstrom J. Clementi F. Fornasari D. Gotti C. Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors. Vol. 144. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 101-162Google Scholar, 46Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3395-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); or mAb 299 (Sigma), which binds the extracellular domain of α4 in its native or denatured conformation (45Lindstrom J. Clementi F. Fornasari D. Gotti C. Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors. Vol. 144. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 101-162Google Scholar, 47Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar). The wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, fraction V (EM Science), in PBS (in mm: 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.4 KH2PO4, 10 Na2HPO4). For membrane-bound fractions, a volume of detergent extract containing the equivalent of 0.1 to 0.5 injected oocytes was added to each mAb-coated microwell. The microwells were incubated overnight at 4 °C to allow binding of epitope-tagged subunits and then washed with ice-cold buffer B. To measure [3H]epibatidine affinity, the microwells were loaded with 200 μl of (±)-[3H]epibatidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity ranged from 30 to 56 Ci/mmol) in ice-cold buffer B. To measure competitive inhibition by cytisine, (-)-nicotine, and acetylcholine (Sigma), the microwells were loaded with either 1 or 3 nm [3H]epibatidine and varying concentrations of inhibitor in a total volume of 200 μl of ice-cold buffer B. These two fixed concentrations of [3H]epibatidine were chosen for the competitive inhibition assays, so depletion of free [3H]epibatidine was negligible. For measuring [3H]epibatidine affinity and for measuring competitive inhibition, the microwells were incubated overnight at 4 °C to allow ligand binding. The microwells then were quickly washed with ice-cold buffer B and were stripped with a solution of 5% SDS and 25 mm dithiothreitol in buffer B. The amount of [3H]epibatidine was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Each data point was the average of duplicate or triplicate measurements. Microwells measuring [3H]epibatidine binding from secreted fractions and cytoplasmic fractions of α4WS/β2WS or α4WSNT/β2WSNT contained 5-10 oocyte equivalents during incubation with those fractions. Processing of these microwells was similar to processing of microwells measuring membrane-bound fractions, except buffer A replaced buffer B. Nonspecific binding was measured from uninjected oocytes and was less than 5% of specific binding at 30 nm total [3H]epibatidine and was less than 1% of specific binding at concentrations below 1 nm total [3H]epibatidine. Models of [3H]Epibatidine Binding—Dissociation constants in the picomolar range have been reported for [3H]epibatidine binding to α4β2 nAChRs (48Eaton J.B. Peng J.H. Schroeder K.M. George A.A.

This high affinity raised the possibility of ligand depletion during binding assays. Ligand depletion means the free concentration of [3H]epibatidine differs significantly from the total concentration (52Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 63-176Google Scholar). To estimate dissociation constants for [3H]epibatidine, binding data were described with a one-site model and with cooperative and independent two-site models (Fig. 2). To allow for ligand depletion, the equations that described binding in the models were functions of the total concentration of [3H]epibatidine and did not assume free and total concentrations of [3H]epibatidine to be equal. Binding of [3H]epibatidine for the one-site model was based on the mass action Equation 1 derived from the one-site binding mechanism in Fig. 2A,Kd=R·ERE(Eq. 1) where R is the concentration of free ligand-binding sites (unbound receptor); E is the concentration of free [3H]epibatidine; RE is the concentration of bound [3H]epibatidine; and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Equation 2 describes the concentration of [3H]epibatidine-binding species RE for this model allowing for [3H]epibatidine depletion (52Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 63-176Google Scholar),RE=(Rt+Et+Kd)/2-((Rt+Et+Kd)2-4RtEt)/2(Eq. 2) where Rt and Et are the total concentrations of receptor-binding sites and of [3H]epibatidine, respectively. Equation 2 is derived from Equation 1 by substituting the conservation equations Rt = R + RE and Et = E + RE. A modified form of this equation would be needed if nonspecific binding were not negligible (53Swillens S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1197-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Equations 3 and 4 describe the concentration of [3H]epibatidine-binding species for the two-cooperative site model with [3H]epibatidine depletion (Fig. 2B),RE=Kd2co(Et-Z)/(Kd2co+Z)(Eq. 3) RE2=(1/2)Z(Et-Z)/(Kd2co+Z)(Eq. 4) where RE is the total concentration of receptor with one bound [3H]epibatidine molecule; RE2 is the concentration of receptor with two bound [3H]epibatidine molecules; and Z is the concentration of free [3H]epibatidine and is the positive root of Equation 5.Z3+(2Rtco+2Kd2co-Et)Z2+(Kd1coKd2co+2RtcoKd2co-2Kd2coEt)Z-Kd1coKd2coEt=0(Eq. 5) In Equation 5, Rtco is the total concentration of receptors (each receptor with two binding sites). Equations 6 and 7 describe the concentration of [3H]epibatidine-binding species for the two-independent sites model with [3H]epibatidine depletion (Fig. 2C),R(1)E=Rt(1)Z/(Kd1in+Z)(Eq. 6) R(2)E=Rt(2)Z/(Kd2in+Z)(Eq. 7) where Z is the concentration of free [3H]epibatidine and is the positive root of Equation 8,Z3+(Rt(1)+Kd1in-Et+Kd2in+Rt(2))Z2+(Kd1inKd2in-Kd1inEt-Kd2inEt+Kd1inRt(2)+Kd2inRt(1))Z-Kd1inKd2inEt=0(Eq. 8) Inhibition of [3H]epibatidine binding by cytisine, (-)-nicotine, and acetylcholine was described with a one-site competitive inhibition model (Fig. 2D). Total concentrations of [3H]epibatidine for inhibition experiments were 1 and 3 nm. These concentrations were large enough that depletion of [3H]epibatidine and inhibitors could be neglected. Equation 9 describes the concentration of the [3H]epibatidine-binding species for the one-site competitive inhibition model,RE=KiEtRt/(KiKd+KiEt+KdIt)(Eq. 9) Based on the theory of ligand binding with ligand depletion (54Wells J.W. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 289-395Google Scholar, 55Wang Z.X. Jiang R.F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Equations 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 were derived with the program Maple (Maplesoft, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) from the mass action equations for the two-site models and one-site competitive inhibition model, combined with the conservation equations for Rt, Rtco, Rt(1), Rt(2), Et, and It. Estimation of Dissociation Constants—Kd for the one-site binding model was estimated with two methods. First, Kd was calculated for each data set from the half-maximum concentration, K0.5, and total concentration of binding sites, Rt, as determined from least squares fitting of Equation 10 to the data set and from Equation 11,Bound[3H]epibatidine=Rt/(1+K0.5/Et)n)(Eq. 10) Kd=K0.5-(Rt/2)(Eq. 11) In Equation 10, n is the Hill coefficient. The best estimate of Kd with this method, which is based on the relationship between Kd and K0.5 in the one-site model (52Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Hulme E.C.
