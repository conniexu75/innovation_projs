Peroxidase, therefore, apparently is the only enzyme that polymerizes p-coumaryl alcohols to lignin in trees."

Neither chemical in three extracts of female moth abdomen tips could be detected by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. These compounds, alone or in combination, exhibited little or no biological activity in the laboratory or in the field. Hexalure, cis-7-hexadecenyl acetate, a synthetic attractant for pink bollworm males, could not be detected in female moth abdomen tip extracts. The pink bollworm sex pheromone was identified as a mixture of cis,cis and cis,trans isomers of 7,11-hexadecadienyl acetate."

These behaviors did not occur when the disk and heat stimuli were randomly presented. Approach and contact of conditioned stimuli may develop even though these behaviors are not (i) evoked by the reinforcing stimulus, (ii) necessary for reinforcer reception, or (iii) ever followed by the reinforcer."

The three known insect ecdysones-alpha-ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone-were also present but in much smaller quantities. The new hormone is the predominant molting hormone in the hornworm during this stage of embryonic development. These results takent in context with the current knowledge of the chemistry and biochemistry of the molting hormones during postembryonic development in the hornworm indicate quantitative and qualitative differences in the biosynthetic-mnetabolic pathways as well as in the ecdysones in different developmental stages of this insect."

The abundances of these ions relative to Si+ show agreement in most instances with abundances in chondrites. A notable exception is 45+, which, if it is Sc+, is 100 times more abundant than neutral scandium found in chondrites."

Measurement of fields up to 10 MG is reliable, but difficulties may be expected at higher fields. Megagauss fields have been applied successfully as high-pressure sources, in high-energy particle physics, and in solid-state investigations. Other uses remain to be exploited: plasma compression by megagauss fields has been relatively unsuccessful but shows promise; their use as particle accelerators has been studied only theoretically; and much work remains to be done, both experimentally and theoretically, in connection with applications of megagauss fields in solidstate physics. Note added in proof: Since this article was prepared, Grigor'ev et al. have carried out some experiments (48) in which they have compressed hydrogen up to a density of 1.95 grams per cubic centimeter with a calculated pressure of 8 x 10(6) atmospheres. They report five different pressure-density points and claim that their data can be explained by assuming that the transition to the metallic phase occurs at a pressure of 2.8 x 10(6) atmospheres, with a density change from 1.08 to 1.3 g/cm(3). Using the flux compression techniques described earlier in this article, Hawke et al. [see (30, 31)] have obtained a pressure-density point at 1.5 x 10(6) atmospheres and 1.0 g/cm(3), which is also not inconsistent with a predicted equation of state of metallic hydrogen (49). In view of the experimental uncertainties, none of the pressure-density data can yet be used conclusively to establish the transition's existence. Hawke and his co-workers are presently engaged in measurements of the electrical conductivity of the compressed hydrogen. Observation of a significant conductivity at the proposed transition pressure would be a more definitive test of a metallic transition. In addition, two lower pressure-density points have been obtained for deuterium by the Los Alamos group, by means of the flux compression methods described earlier in this article. One point agrees to within experimental error with a slight extrapolation of Stewart's data (50). The second point is at a pressure of 65+/- 3 x 10(3) atmospheres with a density of 0.71 +/- 0.10 g/cm(3). The data are tentative, and efforts are under way to obtain more data points at both higher and lower pressures."

https://openalex.org/W2036453835,"An x-ray diffractiotn study of thulium at room temperature and high pressure by means of a diamond-anvil press has shown that thulium transforms from a hexagonal close-packed structure to the samarium type, as other rareearth elements (gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, and holmium) do. Unlike the other rare-earth elements, thulium (hexagonal close-packed) has an axial ratio (c/a) that is independent of pressure within experimental error and the transition is reversible. The transition occurs with increasing pressure in the range of 60 to 116 kilobars. The lattice paralieters of the samarium-type phase of thulium at about 116 kilobars are a = 3.327 +/- 0.005 angstroms and c = 23.48 +/- 0.04 angstroms, and the volume change at the transition is estimated to be - 0.5 percent of the volume of the hexagonal close-packed phase at the transition."

Scanning electron microprobe and energy dispersive x-ray data indicate that the growth occurs as metallic iron stalks from about 0.015 to 0.15 micrometer in diameter, with bulbous tips consisting of a mixture of iron and sulfur and measuring from about 0.03 to 0.2 micrometer in diameter. The stalk length is two to ten times the bulb diameter."
https://openalex.org/W2018446720,"Summary and Conclusions Of interest in the present work is the resistance of the virus of poliomyelitis to the action of ether, as contrasted with that of rabies virus (12f;22). The infectivity of poliomyelitis cord tissue after ten days of contact with 1 per cent phenol is in keeping with the results of other workers (7, 23). These experiments demonstrate that a proper dose of formalized virus may produce, in the majority of monkeys, an active immunity sufficient to enable them to withstand intracerebral inoculation of one or more infective doses of virus, and that virus treated with formalin is a better antigen than is phenolized virus. This latter observation is in agreement with Andervonts9 (18b) results for herpes virus and with the work of Bedson and Maitland (17b) for the virus of foot-and-mouth disease. The best immunizing dose was found to be 5 cc. of a 10 per cent suspension of infective cord tissue having an m.c.p. dose of 0.0003 to 0.0006 cc. of a 5 per cent suspension. Of 3 animals which received 2.5-cc. amounts of formalized virus, only 1 had demonstrable tissue immunity. All 3 animals had neutralizing substances in their serums. Of 12 animals given 5-cc. amounts of formalized antigen, 2 failed to show any tissue immunity and 2 had a slight degree of immunity. Seven of the remaining 8 showed an immunity equal to or better than that developed by animals which received a similar amount of active virus, better than that of animals recovered from a mild attack of the disease and comparable with that developed by some of the convalescent monkeys showing residual paralysis. All but 1 animal showed neutralizing substances in their serums. Two of 11 animals inoculated with 10-cc. amounts of formalized virus failed to show a demonstrable tissue immunity. Only 2 of the remaining 9 showed resistance to direct intracerebral inoculation of virus comparable with that of the majority of animals which received 5 cc. of the same material. Humoral immunity was present in the serums of all but 2 animals. The were certain differences in the immunological response of animals to active and formalized virus:
 1.The degree of immunity in the case of active virus was proportioned to the size of the immunizing dose, the optimum response being obtained with 10-cc. amounts. On the other hand, using formalized virus, this was not definite, for 5-cc. seemed as good as 10-cc. amounts. 2.With active virus, the degree of humoral immunity was decidedly higher than that of tissue immunity, as demonstrated by a comparison between the number of infective doses of virus neutralized by the animal9s serum and the number the animal resisted by intracerebral inoculation. Therefore, as previously suggested (2), humoral immunity is more easily detected than is tissue immunity. With the use of inactivated virus, although the degree of tissue immunity of some equalled that obtained in those cases where active virus was the antigen, the neutralizing power of the serum was decidedly lower than with active virus. Moreover, occasionally, in animals immunized with formalized virus, the tissue resistance was greater than the content of neutralizing substance of the serum. In the case of active virus there is usually a correlation between the humoral and tissue immunity, which relationship was not evident in the case of formalized antigen. Normal cord tissue fails to induce the production of neutralizing substances for the virus of poliomyelitis (1). This tends to rule out the possibility that the higher neutralizing power produced with active virus may be due in part to a non-specific substance produced in the animal in response to the injection of normal cord tissue and which is rendered inert by formalin. 3.Two doses of active virus, when properly spaced gave decidedly better immunity than did a single dose (1). In the few experiments recorded here, using formalized antigen, the two doses did not seem superior to a single dose. This however, requires further confirmation."
