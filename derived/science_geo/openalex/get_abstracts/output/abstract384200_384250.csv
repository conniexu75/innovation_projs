https://openalex.org/W2133968430,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ∼22-nucleotide RNAs that mediate important gene-regulatory events by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct their repression. Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (≥84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output. MicroRNAs — the ubiquitous, short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression — are known to affect the levels of both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. But because protein production is dependent on the presence of mRNA, it has been difficult to establish the relative contributions of microRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage versus translational repression. David Bartel and colleagues have now disentangled the two mechanisms, and, contrary to expectation, find that microRNAs act mainly by destabilizing target mRNAs, rather than by inhibiting their translation. These results suggest that a reassessment of many previous conclusions is in order. MicroRNAs are known to affect the levels of both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. But as protein production is dependent on the presence of mRNA, it was not clear what the relative contributions of microRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage and translational repression were. These authors have parsed out the two mechanisms, and unexpectedly find that microRNAs function primarily by affecting mRNA levels rather than their translation. This suggests a reassessment of many previous conclusions is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W1968628080,"The cellular constituents forming the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in the bone marrow are unclear, with studies implicating osteoblasts, endothelial and perivascular cells. Here we demonstrate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), identified using nestin expression, constitute an essential HSC niche component. Nestin(+) MSCs contain all the bone-marrow colony-forming-unit fibroblastic activity and can be propagated as non-adherent 'mesenspheres' that can self-renew and expand in serial transplantations. Nestin(+) MSCs are spatially associated with HSCs and adrenergic nerve fibres, and highly express HSC maintenance genes. These genes, and others triggering osteoblastic differentiation, are selectively downregulated during enforced HSC mobilization or beta3 adrenoreceptor activation. Whereas parathormone administration doubles the number of bone marrow nestin(+) cells and favours their osteoblastic differentiation, in vivo nestin(+) cell depletion rapidly reduces HSC content in the bone marrow. Purified HSCs home near nestin(+) MSCs in the bone marrow of lethally irradiated mice, whereas in vivo nestin(+) cell depletion significantly reduces bone marrow homing of haematopoietic progenitors. These results uncover an unprecedented partnership between two distinct somatic stem-cell types and are indicative of a unique niche in the bone marrow made of heterotypic stem-cell pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2092124742,"Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory. This sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional statistical methods, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters, allowing the construction of a 'synthetic likelihood' that assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature of the fluctuations in Nicholson's classic blowfly experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1974225684,"Aurora B is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) required for correct spindle-kinetochore attachments during chromosome segregation and for cytokinesis. The chromatin factors that recruit the CPC to centromeres are unknown, however. Here we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3 (H3T3ph) by Haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and that the CPC subunit Survivin binds directly to H3T3ph. A nonbinding Survivin-D70A/D71A mutant does not support centromeric CPC concentration, and both Haspin depletion and Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminish centromere localization of the kinesin MCAK and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol. Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific antibody both compromise centromeric Aurora B functions but do not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, H3T3ph generated by Haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate selected targets of Aurora B during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2008962264,"Alternative splicing is a vast source of biological regulation and diversity that is misregulated in cancer and other diseases. To investigate global control of alternative splicing in human cells, we analyzed splicing of mRNAs encoding Bcl2 family apoptosis factors in a genome-wide siRNA screen. The screen identified many regulators of Bcl-x and Mcl1 splicing, notably an extensive network of cell-cycle factors linked to aurora kinase A. Drugs or siRNAs that induce mitotic arrest promote proapoptotic splicing of Bcl-x, Mcl1, and caspase-9 and alter splicing of other apoptotic transcripts. This response precedes mitotic arrest, indicating coordinated upregulation of prodeath splice variants that promotes apoptosis in arrested cells. These shifts correspond to posttranslational turnover of splicing regulator ASF/SF2, which directly binds and regulates these target mRNAs and globally regulates apoptosis. Broadly, our results reveal an alternative splicing network linking cell-cycle control to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2054857432,"The use of homologous recombination to modify genes in embryonic stem (ES) cells provides a powerful means to elucidate gene function and create disease models. Application of this technology to engineer genes in rats has not previously been possible because of the absence of germline-competent ES cells in this species. We have recently established authentic rat ES cells. Here we report the generation of gene knockout rats using the ES-cell-based gene targeting technology. We designed a targeting vector to disrupt the tumour suppressor gene p53 (also known as Tp53) in rat ES cells by means of homologous recombination. p53 gene-targeted rat ES cells can be routinely generated. Furthermore, the p53 gene-targeted mutation in the rat ES-cell genome can transmit through the germ line via ES-cell rat chimaeras to create p53 gene knockout rats. The rat is the most widely used animal model in biological research. The establishment of gene targeting technology in rat ES cells, in combination with advances in genomics and the vast amount of research data on physiology and pharmacology in this species, now provide a powerful new platform for the study of human disease."

It is also known that complex systems often have a scale-invariant structural organization, but hitherto none had been found in high-Tc copper oxides. Fratini et al. report that the ordering of oxygen interstitials in the La2O2+y spacer layers of La2CuO4+y high-Tc superconductors is characterized by a fractal distribution up to a maximum limiting size of 0.5 millimetres. Intriguingly, these fractal distributions of dopants appear to enhance superconductivity at high temperature. The oxygen interstitials in the layers separating the superconducting CuO2 planes undergo ordering phenomena in La2CuO4+y that enhance the transition temperature (Tc).

These authors report that the ordering of oxygen interstitials in the La2O2+y spacer layers of La2CuO4+y high-Tc superconductors is characterized by a fractal distribution up to a maximum limiting size of 400 µ. It is well known that the microstructures of the transition-metal oxides1,2,3, including the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors4,5,6,7, are complex. This is particularly so when there are oxygen interstitials or vacancies8, which influence the bulk properties. For example, the oxygen interstitials in the spacer layers separating the superconducting CuO2 planes undergo ordering phenomena in Sr2O1+yCuO2 (ref. 9), YBa2Cu3O6+y (ref. 10) and La2CuO4+y (refs 11–15) that induce enhancements in the transition temperatures with no changes in hole concentrations. It is also known that complex systems often have a scale-invariant structural organization16, but hitherto none had been found in high-Tc materials. Here we report that the ordering of oxygen interstitials in the La2O2+y spacer layers of La2CuO4+y high-Tc superconductors is characterized by a fractal distribution up to a maximum limiting size of 400 μm.

https://openalex.org/W1992823976,"SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase that has emerged as a therapeutic target for the development of activators to treat diseases of aging. SIRT1-activating compounds (STACs) have been developed that produce biological effects consistent with direct SIRT1 activation. At the molecular level, the mechanism by which STACs activate SIRT1 remains elusive. In the studies reported herein, the mechanism of SIRT1 activation is examined using representative compounds chosen from a collection of STACs. These studies reveal that activation of SIRT1 by STACs is strongly dependent on structural features of the peptide substrate. Significantly, and in contrast to studies reporting that peptides must bear a fluorophore for their deacetylation to be accelerated, we find that some STACs can accelerate the SIRT1-catalyzed deacetylation of specific unlabeled peptides composed only of natural amino acids. These results, together with others of this study, are at odds with a recent claim that complex formation between STACs and fluorophore-labeled peptides plays a role in the activation of SIRT1 (Pacholec, M., Chrunyk, B., Cunningham, D., Flynn, D., Griffith, D., Griffor, M., Loulakis, P., Pabst, B., Qiu, X., Stockman, B., Thanabal, V., Varghese, A., Ward, J., Withka, J., and Ahn, K.

(2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 8340–8351). Rather, the data suggest that STACs interact directly with SIRT1 and activate SIRT1-catalyzed deacetylation through an allosteric mechanism. The sirtuins are a family of enzymes that catalyze the NAD+-dependent deacetylation of ϵ-acetyl-Lys residues of proteins (1Sauve A.A. Celic I. Avalos J. Deng H. Boeke J.D. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15456-15463Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Sauve A.A. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9249-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Sauve A.A. Wolberger C. Schramm V.L. Boeke J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 435-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Interest in these enzymes stems from the roles they are thought to play in human disease. Of particular interest is SIRT1, which has been implicated in a number of age-related diseases and biological functions involving cell survival, apoptosis, stress resistance, fat storage, insulin production, and glucose and lipid homeostasis (4Haigis M.C. Sinclair D.A. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5: 253-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 5Baur J.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2010; 131: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Involvement in these diverse biologies is thought to occur through deacetylation of its many known in vivo protein substrates, including histones H1, H3, and H4, p53, p300, FOXOs 1, 3a, and 4, p65, HIVTat, PGC-1α, PCAF, MyoD, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, Ku70, and others (3Sauve A.A.

Biol. 2007; 72: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Studies in which SIRT1 protein and activity levels have been manipulated, through gene deletion or overexpression in mice, have validated the beneficial impact of increased SIRT1 activity in several models of disease including those involving metabolic stress (4Haigis M.C. Sinclair D.A. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5: 253-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar, 5Baur J.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2010; 131: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This has recently been observed in humans as well where reduced SIRT1 expression in insulin-sensitive tissues was associated with reduced energy expenditure (7Rutanen J. Yaluri N. Modi S.

Diabetes. 2010; 59: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, for many of the diseases in which SIRT1 is thought to play a role, therapeutic effects are predicted to follow from the administration of activators of the deacetylase activity of this enzyme. Over the past several years, SIRT1-activating compounds 3In this study, we use the term STAC to refer specifically to the SIRT1-activating compounds that have been developed at Sirtris. Because these are all analogs of the original lead compound we identified, it is reasonable to assume that they all activate SIRT1 by the same basic mechanism. Thus, at least in broad strokes, conclusions drawn from the study of the 24 STACs reported herein should apply to all STACs.

The synthesis of 3 will be published elsewhere. ITC experiments were performed using either a VP-ITC system or an iTC200 system (MicroCal) at 26 °C in a buffer composed of 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3. SIRT1(183–664) was purified and dialyzed against the buffer, centrifuged, and degassed before the experiment. The peptide and compounds were dissolved in the final dialysis buffer, and their pH values were adjusted to match that of the protein solution. In a typical binding experiment to characterize the STAC/TAMRA-peptide interaction performed on the VP-ITC system, 1 mm TAMRA-peptide was injected in 35 aliquots of 8 μl (except the first injection, which was 2 μl) into a 1.4699-ml sample cell containing 100 μm STAC. To characterize this interaction using the iTC200 system, 1 mm TAMRA-peptide was injected in 20 aliquots of 2 μl (except the first injection, which was 0.5 μl) into a 0.202-ml sample cell containing 100 μm STAC. For STACs with poor solubility, the concentrations were adjusted accordingly. To characterize the interaction of SRT1460 with the TAMRA-peptide, 5 mm TAMRA-peptide and 0.5 mm SRT1460 were used. To characterize the interaction of a STAC with SIRT1(183–664) on the VP-ITC system, 100 μm enzyme was injected in 35 aliquots of 8 μl (except the first injection, which was 2 μl) into a 1.4699-ml sample cell containing 10 μm STAC. In a typical binding experiment on the iTC200 system, 100 μm enzyme was injected in 20 aliquots of 2 μl (except the first injection, which was 0.5 μl) into a 0.202-ml sample cell containing 10 μm STAC. In all cases, data were corrected for the heat of dilution and fitted using a nonlinear least squares routine using a single-site binding model with Origin for ITC version 7.0383 (MicroCal) with the stoichiometry (n), the enthalpy of the reaction (ΔH), and the association constant (Ka) calculated. SIRT1(183–664) was dialyzed against a buffer composed 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3. 11 was dissolved in the final dialysis buffer, and its pH values were adjusted to match that of the protein solution. The fluorescence emission spectra of 11 in the absence or presence of different concentrations of enzyme was monitored on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 with excitation at 315 nm. The fluorescence intensity change at 450 nm was plotted against the concentration of SIRT1(183–664) and fitted using a standard binding equation. Our collection of ∼5,000 SIRT1 activators was screened using the BioTrove mass spectrometry system, as described previously (8Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J.

In this screen, [SIRT1]o = 5 nm, [desTAMRA-peptide]o = 1 μm = Km/33, and [NAD+]o = 30 μm = Km/10. Compounds were present at 10 μm, and the assays were conducted in a pH 7.4 buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% DMSO, and 0.025% BSA. Two methods were used in these studies. One, which was used for TAMRA-peptide, desTAMRA-peptide, des(biotin,TAMRA)-peptide, and p53 20-mer, used a previously described mass spectroscopic method for detection of peptide reaction products (8Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L. Boss O. Perni R.B. Vu C.B. Bemis J.E. Xie R. Disch J.S. Ng P.Y. Nunes J.J. Lynch A.V. Yang H. Galonek H. Israelian K. Choy W. Iffland A. Lavu S. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Olefsky J.M. Jirousek M.R. Elliott P.J. Westphal C.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The other, used with peptides of general structure Ac-Arg-His-Lys-LysAc-X, used a continuous, enzyme-coupled method reported previously (23Smith B.C. Hallows W.C. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 394: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), in which the SIRT1 product nicotinamide is first converted into nicotinic acid and ammonia by the action of PNC1, and the ammonia is then used by glutamate dehydrogenase to convert α-ketoglutarate into glutamate. This reaction occurs with oxidation of NADH to NAD+, which is accompanied by a change in absorbance at 340 nm (Δϵ340 = −6,200 m−1 cm−1). Kinetic experiments to characterize activators were run on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 25 spectrophotometer equipped with a water-jacketed, eight-cell changer maintained at 25 °C. In a typical kinetic experiment, all components of the reaction solution except SIRT1 were added to a 1-ml cuvette and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. Final concentrations of the coupling system components were: 1 μm PNC1, 0.23 mm NADH, 3.4 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 20 units/ml bovine glutamate dehydrogenase. This solution also contained peptide substrate, NAD+, and activator, at concentrations indicated under “Results.” The final DMSO concentration was kept constant at 1%, and the buffer used in these experiments was 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. While the system was reaching thermal equilibrium, the absorbance was monitored to provide an accurate estimate of the background rate, which was subtracted from the reaction rate after the addition of SIRT1. Activator titrations were plotted as relative velocity (RV, i.e. the ratio of vx, velocity in the presence of activator X, to vo, velocity in the absence of activator) versus [X]o, initial concentration of activator, and fit by nonlinear least squares to the mechanism-independent expression for enzyme activation of Equation 1 vxvo=1+RVmax−11+EC50[X]o(Eq. 1) where RVmax is the maximum relative velocity (i.e. vx/vo at infinite [X]o) and EC50 is the activator concentration at which vx/vo = (RVmax −1)/2. EC50 is a function of the kinetic mechanisms of both catalysis and activation and the concentrations of substrates. For activators whose insolubility and potency prohibited achieving high enough concentrations for accurate estimates of RVmax and EC50, activator potency can be expressed as EC1.5, which is the concentration of activator needed to achieve 1.5-fold activation. EC1.5 can be shown to equal EC1.5=EC502RVmax−3(Eq. 2) and thus is a reflection of activator efficacy, with a dependence on both RVmax and EC50. For a series of activators in which RVmax is roughly the same, the ratio EC1.5/EC50 will be similar for all members of the series, and thus, either EC1.5 or EC50 can be used as the measure of activator potency. The reciprocal of EC1.5 is a direct measure of activator efficacy and equals (EC1.5)−1=2(RVmax−1.5EC50)(Eq. 3) It can be seen that (EC1.5)−1 is analogous to Vmax/Km of standard steady-state enzyme kinetics. Table 1 summarizes steady-state kinetic parameters for the peptide substrates used in this study. These parameters were all determined using the PNC1/glutamate dehydrogenase-coupled assay described under “Experimental Procedures” and agree with data obtained using the mass spectrometry-based assay first described by Milne et al.

Our initial lead structures were identified in a high throughput screening campaign that used a fluorescence polarization assay, with TAMRA-peptide as substrate (8Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S.

This 20-mer is centered around Lys-382 of p53, a natural substrate for SIRT1. The modifications of the sequence of TAMRA-peptide relative to p53 were made specifically for purposes of the assay (8Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P. Smith J.J. Gagne D.J. Jin L.

Characterization of the initial screening hits and all subsequent studies were conducted using TAMRA-peptide and a mass spectrometry-based assay (8Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Schenk S. Carney D.P.

As the structure-activity relationship (SAR) around our lead compounds evolved, we tested many of the newer STACs for their ability to activate the deacetylation of desTAMRA-peptide and found that none were able to activate the deacetylation of this peptide (data not shown). These results are consistent with those recently reported by Pacholec et al. (22Pacholec M. Bleasdale J.E. Chrunyk B. Cunningham D. Flynn D. Garofalo R.S. Griffith D. Griffor M. Loulakis P. Pabst B.

In the course of our studies of SIRT1 activation, we found that some STACs bind to TAMRA-peptide to form activator-substrate complexes. These results confirm the observation that SRT1460 and SRT1720 can bind to TAMRA-labeled peptides (22Pacholec M. Bleasdale J.E. Chrunyk B. Cunningham D. Flynn D. Garofalo R.S. Griffith D. Griffor M.

The simplest activation mechanism involving activator-substrate complexes is shown in Fig. 2A, 5It should be noted that because SIRT1 is a two-substrate reaction, the mechanisms of Fig. 2 are both oversimplifications of any activation mechanism that may operate for this enzyme. Thus, EC50 and RVmax are apparent values, functions not only of intrinsic values for that activator but also functions of the concentrations of the two substrates, the kinetic mechanism of SIRT1, and the rate and equilibrium constants associated with that mechanism for a particular substrate. according to which activation is observed when X-S is turned over more rapidly than S, that is, when Km,x < Km or γ > 1 or both. Examination of this mechanism indicates that activation is driven by formation of the activator-substrate complex X-S, meaning that stable X-S complexes with lower Kd values should result in more potent activation. To explore the possibility that X-S might be of mechanistic significance, we determined Kd values for the binding of STACs to TAMRA-peptide for 20 compounds that range in potency from EC1.5 = 0.05 to ≥ 100 μm (see supplemental Fig. S1 for representative ITC titrations). These data are plotted in Fig. 3 and clearly demonstrate a lack of correlation between STAC efficacy and affinity of STACs for TAMRA-peptide. Significantly, there are compounds that activate SIRT1 but show no detectable binding to the TAMRA-peptide, such as 1, with EC1.5 = 0.05 μm, Kd ≥ 100 μm, or 9, with EC1.5 = 0.4 μm, Kd ≥ 1"

EpiSCs are incapable of contributing to chimerism, indicating that EpiSCs are less pluripotent and represent a later developmental pluripotency state compared with inner cell mass stage murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Using a chemical approach, we found that blockage of the TGFβ pathway or inhibition of histone demethylase LSD1 with small molecule inhibitors induced dramatic morphological changes in EpiSCs toward mESC phenotypes with simultaneous activation of inner cell mass-specific gene expression. However, full conversion of EpiSCs to the mESC-like state with chimerism competence could be readily generated only with the combination of LSD1, ALK5, MEK, FGFR, and GSK3 inhibitors.

They can self-renew indefinitely; have the ability to give rise to all cell types in vitro; and most importantly, contribute to an entire animal in vivo, including the germline, when placed back into blastocysts. More recently, a different type of pluripotent cells was derived from post-implantation stage epiblasts, termed EpiSCs (1Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B.

Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Although EpiSCs can self-renew over a long-term period and appear to be pluripotent in vitro as well as in vivo in teratoma assays, in contrast to mESCs, they are incapable of incorporating into the ICM and contributing to chimerism, confirming that EpiSCs are from and represent an advanced/later developmental stage of pluripotency compared with ICM-derived ESCs and suggesting that they cannot be “reprogrammed” back into ICM stage pluripotent cells even in the in vivo environment. Although derived using blastocysts, conventional hESCs seem to correspond very closely to the EpiSCs with respect to many characteristics, including some gene expression, colony morphology (i.e. flat colony), and the signaling responses in self-renewal and differentiation. EpiSCs/hESCs are also functionally and mechanistically distinct from mESCs (which have more compact and domed colony morphology) in many other ways. For example, whereas mESCs self-renew under LIF and BMP condition or under inhibition of MEK and/or FGFR (3Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar), EpiSCs/hESCs appear to be dependent on MAPK, FGF, and TGFβ/activin/Nodal pathway activity for self-renewal and differentiate rapidly when treated with MEK, FGFR, and/or ALK4/5/7 inhibitors (1Brons I.G.

Differentiation. 2007; 75: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, in response to BMP treatment under defined differentiation conditions, mESCs differentiate toward mesoderm lineages, whereas EpiSCs/hESCs generate trophoblasts or primitive endoderm cells (1Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L.

These observations strongly support the notion that EpiSCs/hESCs and mESCs represent two distinct pluripotency states: the mESC-like state representing the ICM of pre-implantation blastocysts and the EpiSC/hESC-like state representing the post-implantation epiblasts. This also raised the questions of whether the epiblast state (including conventional hESCs) can be converted back to the ICM state, and more fundamentally and significantly, how this would be achieved in an efficient manner by chemically defined conditions without any genetic manipulations. Because of the distinct difference in their ability to contribute to chimerism from mESCs or mEpiSCs (which would offer a definitive confirmation of the functional conversion of EpiSCs to mESCs), the murine system represents an ideal platform to study the intriguing process and provides a basis for generating perhaps a new type of ICM/mESC-like human pluripotent cell from conventional hESCs. embryonic stem cell inner cell mass epiblast stem cell murine ESC human ESC leukemia inhibitory factor bone morphogenic protein fibroblast growth factor receptor quantitative polymerase chain reaction. See the supplemental data for detailed “Experimental Procedures.” EpiSCs express master pluripotency genes, including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 has been shown to induce reprogramming of murine somatic cells to become germline-competent pluripotent cells. In addition, it has been shown that germline stem cells, which express fewer pluripotency genes (e.g. lack of Nanog expression), can convert to mESC-like cells in culture (7Kanatsu-Shinohara M.

Furthermore, a non-pluripotent cell type (designated FAB-SC) was recently derived from blastocytes and was shown to generate pluripotent mESC-like cells simply under LIF and BMP condition (9Chou Y.F.

Moreover, recent studies suggested that subpopulations of cells within mESC colonies exhibit dynamic expression of several key transcription factors (e.g. Nanog, Rex1, and Stella), which makes them continuously fluctuate between different states (e.g. between ESC- and epiblast-like phenotypes) (10Singh A.M.

Development. 2008; 135: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These studies raised the possibility that EpiSCs existing in a less “stable” pluripotency state than ICM-derived mESCs may have the ability to transition back to a mESC state “spontaneously” under culture fluctuation in vitro. To test this hypothesis, EpiSCs were trypsinized to single cells, and ∼500 cells were plated under mESC self-renewal conditions based on the notion that “converted” mESC-like cells within EpiSC colonies would be captured/selected and expanded under conditions that promote self-renewal of mESCs but induce differentiation of EpiSCs. We found that EpiSCs differentiated (e.g. cells spread/migrated out of colonies) in the first passage, and no colony could be identified over several passages when the cells were cultured under the conventional mESC growth condition with feeder cells and supplemented with LIF (Fig. 1A, panel A3). Given that the spontaneous conversion from EpiSCs to mESCs might be very inefficient, a stronger and more stringent differential self-renewal-promoting and differentiation-inducing condition might be required to select/capture and expand those “rare” converted mESC-like cells from EpiSCs (e.g. achieving cleaner phenotypic distinction and minimizing the overgrowth of differentiated EpiSCs). On the basis of the differential signaling responses (self-renewal versus differentiation) between mESCs and EpiSCs in the context of FGF and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as the observation that inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling promotes reprogramming of cells toward a more primitive state (13Shi Y.

Under these 2PD/LIF conditions, which promote robust clonal growth of mESCs and inhibit growth of differentiated cells, we observed accelerated differentiation of EpiSCs and decreased growth of the overall cell culture. Most of cells died when they were kept in culture in the 2PD/LIF medium, and no mESC-like colony was identified over serial passages. Similarly, the addition of CHIR99021 (3 μm) to the 2PD/LIF conditions for improved mESC growth/survival did not promote or capture the conversion of EpiSCs to the mESC-like state (Fig. 1A, panel A4). These results suggest that the EpiSCs represent a stable pluripotency state that does not readily convert to the mESC-like state spontaneously under conditions promoting mESC self-renewal. Concurrent and consistent with our studies, it has been recently shown that conversion of EpiSCs to the mESC-like state could be achieved only by overexpression of Klf4 or Nanog in conjunction with the use of chemical inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 (16Guo G.

Given those challenges, it is critical to identify and devise a pharmacological approach for reprogramming EpiSCs toward the mESC-like state, which may directly provide mechanistic insights into this process and ultimately facilitate converting hESCs to the mESC-like state. TGFβ/activin/Nodal activity is dynamically regulated temporally and spatially during mouse embryogenesis and is required during implantation to control the fate of early progenitor cells in epiblasts (18Mesnard D. Guzman-Ayala M. Constam D.B. Development. 2006; 133: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The derivation of EpiSCs requiring FGF and TGFβ/activin/Nodal pathway activities suggests that TGFβ/activin/Nodal provides an anti-differentiation signal for EpiSCs (1Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L. Pedersen R.A. Vallier L.

Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that E-cadherin is expressed in embryos from the one-cell stage and that down-regulation of E-cadherin by signaling facilitates the implantation of blastocysts (19Li Q. Wang J. Armant D.R. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46447-46455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGFβ/activin/Nodal activities also promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition by down-regulating E-cadherin during gastrulation (20Gadue P. Huber T.L. Paddison P.J. Keller G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16806-16811Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 21Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E.

On the basis of these studies, we hypothesized that inhibition of TGFβ/activin/Nodal signaling might promote the process of mesenchymal-epithelial transition and consequently the conversion of EpiSCs to the mESC-like state. A-83-01 is a selective ALK4/5/7 inhibitor that has no cross-inhibitory effect on BMP receptors (23Tojo M. Hamashima Y. Hanyu A. Kajimoto T. Saitoh M. Miyazono K. Node M. Imamura T. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous reports, blocking TGFβ/activin/Nodal signaling with 0.5 μm A-83-01 induced rapid differentiation of EpiSCs under EpiSC culture condition supplemented with basic FGF. In dramatic contrast, under mESC culture conditions supplemented with LIF, A-83-01 induced the overall population of EpiSCs to form more compact and domed colonies that resembled mESC colony morphology and expressed ALP (a pluripotency marker highly expressed in mESCs but not in EpiSCs) (Fig. 1C). Another widely used specific ALK4/5/7 inhibitor, SB431542, had a similar effect on EpiSCs (data not shown). When the A-83-01-treated colonies were exposed to 2PD/LIF condition for selection, >50% of the colonies could self-renew and maintain ALP activity, suggesting that the cells acquired some mESC-like properties. These domed colonies were passaged as a whole cell population and further expanded in mESC growth medium supplemented with inhibitors of ALK5, MEK, FGFR, and GSK3. The stable clones were picked up at day ∼22 (termed the mAMFGi condition). These cells could self-renew for a long-term period under the mAMFGi condition; had an indistinguishable mESC colony morphology (Fig. 1D); expressed pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Nanog, and SSEA1; and regained the ICM marker Rex1 (data not shown). However, when these cells were labeled with a constitutively active GFP by lentiviruses and aggregated with morulas, we did not obtain chimeric animals after the resulting embryos were transplanted into mice (supplemental Fig. S1A). These results indicate that inhibition of TGFβ signaling in conjunction with inhibition of MEK, FGFR, and GSK3 has strong reprogramming activity and can promote partial conversion of EpiSCs to the mESC-like state. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, have been established to play important roles in gene regulation. It has been demonstrated that Stella is an important gene in mESC germ line competence and is transcriptionally silent in EpiSCs and epiblast-like cells within mESCs. Moreover, histone modification regulates Stella expression in mESCs (2Tesar P.J. Chenoweth J.G. Brook F.A. Davies T.J. Evans E.P. Mack D.L. Gardner R.L. McKay R.D. Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar, 11Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a derepression of the silenced gene loci responsible for in vivo pluripotency may promote EpiSCs to overcome the epigenetic restriction/threshold toward the mESC-like state. Consequently, we chose the small molecule Parnate, which has been shown to increase global H3K4 methylation by inhibiting the histone demethylase LSD1, which specifically demethylates mono- and dimethylated histone H3K4 (24Lee M.G. Wynder C. Schmidt D.M. McCafferty D.G. Shiekhattar R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Remarkably, after 4 days of 2 μm Parnate treatment, up to 70–80% of the EpiSCs formed small and compact colonies under the mESC growth condition. When the Parnate-treated cells were then selected with 2PD/LIF, ∼20% of the cells survived the selection as domed and ALP-positive colonies. Those colonies were passaged as a whole cell population and further expanded with inhibitors of MEK, FGFR, and GSK3 (termed the mMFGi condition) or under the mAMFGi condition. Both conditions resulted in stable cell cultures, which were morphologically indistinguishable from mESCs (Fig. 1, E and F). We next examined GFP-labeled Parnate/mMFGi and Parnate/mAMFGi cells in vivo by morula aggregation and transplantation of the resulting embryos. Remarkably, we obtained seven (of nine pups born) adult chimeras from Parnate/mAMFGi cells as determined by coat color and PCR genotyping for the presence of GFP integration in multiple adult tissues (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Consistently, widespread GFP-positive cells were observed in multiple tissues (i.e. three germ layers, including gonad) of E13.5 embryos from transplantation of the Parnate/mAMFGi cell-aggregated morulas (supplemental Fig. S1, A and C). To examine the germline contribution from Parnate/mAMFGi cells, the GFP/SSEA1 double-positive cells from the gonad were isolated by FACS and confirmed to express the germline markers Blimp1 and Stella by real-time PCR (supplemental Fig. S1D). These data suggest that Parnate/mAMFGi cells converted from EpiSCs regain in vivo pluripotency. In contrast, GFP-positive cells were found only in the yolk sacs of E13.5 embryos recovered from transplantation of Parnate/mMFGi cell-aggregated morulas (supplemental Fig. S1A). The Parnate/mAMFGi cells were therefore further characterized. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the converted Parnate/mAMFGi cells were much more similar to mESCs (Pearson correlation value, 0.87), whereas the original EpiSCs were more distant from mESCs (Pearson correlation value, 0.74) (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous reports. Immunocytochemistry confirmed homogeneous expression of pluripotency-associated markers in long-term expanded Parnate/mAMFGi cells, including Oct4, Nanog, SSEA1, and STELLA (Fig. 2B and supplemental Figs. S2A and S3). In addition, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated restoration of gene expression of specific ICM and germline competence markers (which are expressed in mESCs but absent in EpiSCs) in Parnate/mAMFGi cells, including Dax1, Esrrb, Fbxo15, Fgf4, Pecam1, Rex1, Stella, and Stra8 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, transcripts of genes associated with the epiblast and early germ layers, such as Fgf5 and Brachyury (T), were decreased or undetectable in Parnate/mAMFGi cells (Fig. 2, C and H). To further analyze specific epigenetic changes associated with the conversion, we examined the promoter DNA methylation of Stella and Fgf4, the expression of which is closely associated with ICM properties (11Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 25Imamura M. Miura K. Iwabuchi K. Ichisaka T. Nakagawa M. Lee J. Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Shinohara T. Yamanaka S. BMC Dev. Biol. 2006; 6: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), using bisulfite genomic sequencing. This revealed that the promoter regions of Stella and Fgf4 were largely unmethylated in Parnate/mAMFGi cells and mESCs but were hypermethylated in EpiSCs (Fig. 2D). To further examine the epigenetic state of Stella, which is restricted to the mESC-like state, we performed a ChIP-qPCR analysis of its promoter region in EpiSCs, mESCs, and converted Parnate/mAMFGi cells. We found that the H3K4 and H3K27 methylation pattern of Stella in Parnate/mAMFGi cells is similar to that observed in mESCs but is distinct from that in EpiSCs, confirming that the epigenetic status of Stella in the converted Parnate/mAMFGi cells was switched to the mESC-like status (Fig. 2E). Parnate/mAMFGi cells were also examined for their in vitro functional properties. They were found to have similar growth rate as mESCs (Fig. 2F). When Parnate/mAMFGi cells were differentiated through embryoid bodies in suspension, they were able to effectively generate cell derivatives in the three primary germ layers as shown by immunocytochemistry, including characteristic neuronal cells (βIII-tubulin- and MAP2ab-positive), beating cardiomyocytes (cardiac troponin- and MHC-positive), and endoderm cells (Sox17- or albumin-positive) (Fig. 2G and supplemental Video S1). Because mESCs and EpiSCs have different responses to signaling inputs (e.g. growth factors) in self-renewal and differentiation, conditions that were developed and work effectively for mESC differentiation may often be inefficient in inducing corresponding differentiation of EpiSCs. One of the advantages of converting EpiSCs to the mESC-like state is that differentiation conditions may be more readily translated from mESC work to EpiSC work. Differential response to BMP4 treatment represents a functional assay to distinguish between mESCs and EpiSCs. Consistent with previous studies (26Winnier G. Blessing M. Labosky P.A. Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 27Czyz J. Wobus A. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Development. 1989; 105: 733-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that Parnate/mAMFGi cells were induced to express the mesoderm-specific marker gene Brachyury (T) when treated with BMP4 as mESCs but, under the same conditions, could not give rise to trophectoderm (no induction of the trophoblast marker Cdx2) or primitive endoderm (Gata6) cells as EpiSCs, suggesting a similar in vitro differentiation potential/response of Parnate/mAMFGi cells to mESCs (Fig. 2H). To further demonstrate this, we compared the directed cardiac differentiation of EpiSCs, mESCs, and converted Parnate/mAMFGi cells under monolayer chemically defined conditions. In this stepwise differentiation process, in which BMP activity plays an essential role in the early steps of mesoderm specification, we found that Parnate/mAMFGi cells differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes as efficiently as mESCs but that differentiation of EpiSCs under the same conditions hardly produced cells that expressed appropriate cardiac markers or had the characteristic beating phenotype (Fig. 2I), confirming again that Parnate/mAMFGi cells are functionally similar to mESCs. Moreover, a single-cell survival assay also demonstrated that Parnate/mAMFGi cells clonally expanded as Oct4-positive colonies as efficiently as mESCs under feeder-free and N2/B27 chemically defined conditions, whereas EpiSCs survived poorly from single cells under the same conditions (supplemental Fig. S2B). These data further demonstrate that EpiSCs can be functionally converted to the mESC-like state by pharmacological manipulation that targets epigenetic modifications and differential signaling pathways required by mESCs or EpiSCs. Concurrent with our studies, EpiSC cells have been recently reported to convert to the mESC-like state by overexpression of reprogramming genes (i.e. Klf4) in conjunction with chemical compounds (16Guo G. Yang J. Nichols J. Hall J.S. Eyres I. Mansfield W. Smith A. Development. 2009; 136: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 29Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W.

In this study, we devised a chemically defined treatment to convert stable EpiSCs to a mESC-like developmentally earlier pluripotency state without any genetic manipulation. Despite studies providing evidence that epiblast-like cells exist and transition back and forth within colonies of conventional mESCs (11Hayashi K. Lopes S.M. Tang F. Surani M.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), mESCs and EpiSCs share a substantial set of pluripotency transcription factors (including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog), and mESCs are more stable in culture, in this study, we found that EpiSCs differentiated rapidly under the conventional mESC culture conditions and that no spontaneously converted mESCs could be readily identified and isolated over serial passages at the population or clonal level. Remarkably, we found that blockage of the TGFβ pathway or inhibition of the H3K4 demethylase LSD1 with small molecule inhibitors induced dramatic morphological changes in EpiSCs toward mESC-like phenotypes with activation of some ICM-specific gene expression. However, full conversion of EpiSCs to the mESC-like state with competence to chimeric contribution could only be readily generated with a combination of inhibitors of LSD1, ALK5, MEK, FGFR, and GSK3. These observations underscore a powerful and direct induction of reprogramming from the developmentally later stage EpiSCs to the ICM stage mESCs by a synergy of signaling and direct epigenetic modulations. They also highlight a significant role for TGFβ pathway inhibition in promoting reprogramming and sustaining pluripotency, further supporting our recent studies in generating chimerism-competent rat pluripotent cells (30Li W. Wei W. Zhu S. Zhu J. Shi Y. Lin T. Hao E. Hayek A. Deng H. Ding S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Collectively, our studies provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that pluripotency-restricted EpiSCs can be readily converted to the mESC-like state in the absence of any genetic manipulation by precise pharmacological control of signaling pathways that distinguish the two pluripotency states and an epigenetic target simultaneously and offer a convenient experimental system to further study the mechanism. Such method and concept may also provide an avenue for generating a new type of mESC-like human pluripotent cell.

IntroductionMalaria is currently one of the world's most severe endemic diseases, and, despite the advent of combination therapy and the introduction of longer acting pharmaceuticals, the need for new targets and relevant anti-malarial agents remains acute.

Pyrimidines are required for the biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and phospholipids. Unlike the human host, P. falciparum lacks the ability to salvage pyrimidine bases and thus is entirely dependent on de novo biosynthesis (1Subbayya I.N. Ray S.S. Balaram P. Balaram H. Indian J. Med.

DHODH catalyzes the oxidation of l-dihydroorotate to orotate via a coupled redox reaction with a bound flavin cofactor (3Caroline D.F. J.

DHODH is ubiquitous to most organisms and exists in two forms. The cytosolic Type 1 enzyme is present in Gram-positive bacteria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and utilizes fumarate or NAD+ as an electron acceptor (4Taylor M.L. Taylor W.H. Eames D.F. Taylor C.D. J.

Cell Biochem. 1997; 174: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic enzyme, including the plasmodial form, is localized to the inner mitochondrial space and uses coenzyme Q (16Eakin R.T. Mitchell H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 134: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Kennedy J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 157: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Miller R.W. Curry J.R.

The crucial nature of the reaction catalyzed by PfDHODH is reflected in the fact that, during the intra-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum development, the sole function of mitochondrial electron transport appears to be regeneration of coenzyme Q as a cofactor for DHODH (20Painter H.J. Morrisey J.M. Mather M.W. Vaidya A.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).Significant differences between the plasmodial and human enzymes are suggested by previous studies with A77 1726, the active metabolite of the immunomodulatory drug leflunomide. Differences in the sequence and alignment of residues in the region of the inhibitor-binding site have been demonstrated for the parasite and human enzymes complexed with A77 1726 and orotate (21Liu S.

These results support the likelihood of finding inhibitors specific for PfDHODH, and combined with the essential nature of this enzyme in the parasite, establish it as a potentially viable and relevant anti-malarial chemotherapeutic target. In fact, small molecule inhibitors of PfDHODH have previously been described, which demonstrate in vitro activity against cultured strains of P. falciparum (25Patel V. Booker M. Kramer M. Ross L.

The enzyme assays were expanded to include DHODH from P. berghei and P. vivax, and parasite viability assays were performed not only on P. falciparum but also on P. knowlesi as an initial step toward discovering compounds with potential pan-species activity. The correlation between inhibitory potency against the enzyme and toxicity toward the parasite was assessed. In vitro and in vivo drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties were evaluated, and compound efficacy was assessed in the P. berghei and P. falciparum NOD-scid mouse models.DISCUSSIONMalaria is one of the world's most devastating endemic diseases, particularly in developing countries, and there is an acute need for new therapeutic approaches because of rapidly increasing resistance to current pharmaceutics. DHODH is a critical enzyme for survival of the parasite, and it represents a potential target for an anti-malarial therapy, as indicated by several reports in the literature. The importance of the target is underscored by the fact that multiple unique chemical series are currently undergoing lead optimization programs. Phillips et al. described a promising series of triazolopyrimidine compounds with inhibitory activity against the enzyme and potency against the parasite both in vitro and in animal models (26Phillips M.A. Gujjar R.

Booker M. Kramer M. Ross L. Celatka C.A. Kennedy L.M. Dvorin J.D. Duraisingh M.T. Sliz P. Wirth D.F. Clardy J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35078-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the most promising of which is the N-alkyl-5-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide series described in the current report. Data presented here demonstrate that these compounds are highly potent DHODH inhibitors, possess comparable activity in a parasite viability assay, exhibit favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics properties, and are efficacious in animal models of the disease. In particular, sterile cure was achieved in the P. berghei ANKA strain mouse model with the compound Genz-667348, which to the best of our knowledge is the first evidence of this effect with a plasmodial DHODH inhibitor.Potency against both the enzyme and the parasite was highly correlated throughout this compound class. Previous studies on the original indole screen hit (Genz-582463) and some closely related analogs using a transgenic strain of P. falciparum expressing DHODH from S. cerevisiae confirmed inhibition of this enzyme as the primary mode of action (25Patel V. Booker M. Kramer M. Ross L. Celatka C.A. Kennedy L.M. Dvorin J.D. Duraisingh M.T. Sliz P. Wirth D.F. Clardy J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35078-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and this finding is currently being confirmed for several later benzimidazole analogs, including those described herein. The interaction between one of the most potent analogs, Genz-667348, and PfDHODH was elucidated by crystallography. The x-ray structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex reveals extensive contacts, consistent with the observed potent binding of the series. Conformational flexibility allows Genz-667348 to access an alternative hydrophobic pocket from the triazolopyrimidines (e.g. DSM1), enabling the enzyme to bind two alternative chemical scaffolds with high potency. The structural flexibility enhances the value of PfDHODH as a drug target by expanding the chemical space that can be evaluated for the discovery of suitable inhibitors with the potential to lead to drugs.The species selectivity of this series was evaluated and showed that these compounds also inhibited DHODH from P. berghei and P. vivax, important in the first instance for validation of the animal model and in the second instance for the potential development of a candidate with pan-parasite activity. In addition, whereas activity against the parasite enzymes translated into toxicity against their respective organisms, there was no effect on the human enzyme. The structural basis for this species selectivity is evident from the co-crystal structure of PfDHODH with Genz-667348. The requirement for an accelerated de novo synthesis of pyrimidines in certain rapidly dividing human cells such as activated lymphocytes (51Fairbanks L.D. Bofill M. Ruckemann K. Simmonds H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29682-29689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) makes it desirable to identify compounds specific for the parasite DHODH, and the opportunity to achieve an adequate therapeutic window appears to be excellent.The compounds in this series differed in their in vitro drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics properties, most notably with regard to cytochrome P450 inhibition. Because of rapidly evolving resistance, anti-malarials are unlikely to be administered as monotherapy, with the result that drug-drug interactions are an important consideration. Cytochromes 2C9 and 2D6 were the most likely isozymes to be affected by the compounds described herein, and a number of substrates and inducers across several compound classes have been described for both (52Hersh E.V. Moore P.A. J. Am. Dent. Assoc. 2004; 135: 298-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, neither cytochrome P450 plays a significant role in the disposition of anti-malarials (53Giao P.T. de Vries P.J. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2001; 40: 343-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), so issues would primarily concern other co-therapies. Nevertheless, a number of analogs in this compound series exhibited an absence of activity against these enzymes, and the ultimate goal would be the selection of a candidate with little to no cytochrome P450 inhibition.The DHODH inhibitors in this report exhibited variability with regard to metabolic stability predicted from studies with microsomes and hepatocytes. The earliest compound in this series to undergo in vivo testing, Genz-667348, was chosen primarily on the basis of good activity against both the enzyme and the parasite along with the prediction of reasonable stability. Although potent, this compound produced significant inhibition of CYP2D6 as well as the cardiac hERG channel, rendering it somewhat less desirable as a development candidate. Later analogs, Genz-668857 and -669178, were selected on the basis of equivalent activity, and more favorable cytochrome P450 and hERG inhibition properties when compared with Genz-667348. Exposure studies monitoring plasma levels of compound for 24 h after twice daily dosing demonstrated that each compound maintained plasma levels above the IC90 for the entire study period, and pharmacokinetic studies indicated that each compound was readily taken up into plasma and maintained a reasonable residence time. Tolerability was excellent at all doses tested (up to 200 mg/kg/day), and the compounds were carried forward into efficacy studies.Genz-667348, -668857, and -669178 underwent testing in the murine P. berghei N-clone model and demonstrated similar potencies, with ED50 values of 13–21 mg/kg/day. In this model, chloroquine and artemisinin are curative at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively (data not shown). Genz-667348 was further studied in the murine P. berghei ANKA strain model, and sterile cure was achieved following 4 days of twice daily dosing for a total dose of 100 mg/kg/day. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of sterile cure in a murine model in response to treatment with an inhibitor of DHODH. It is interesting that sterile cure was achieved when the infecting parasite was the ANKA strain of P. berghei but not the N-clone, although it is conceivable that higher concentrations or longer treatment would have yielded cure in the latter model as well. Genz-667348 did demonstrate a 3- to 4-fold greater in vitro potency against the ANKA strain as compared with the N-clone, and this difference may be substantial enough to account for the selective cure. Alternatively, the difference in the susceptibility of the parasites may lie in differences between the original source of these isolates or in the laboratory history of these lines. The N-clone has been derived from the K173 strain that has been kept in the laboratory by mechanical passage for prolonged periods (54Saul A. Prescott N. Smith F. Cheng Q. Walliker D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas the lines of the ANKA strain are derived from the original ANKA isolate (55Janse C.J. Ramesar J. Waters A.P. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The causes of the different response to DHODH inhibitors in the two lines are yet unknown, but plans are in place to incorporate the ANKA strain model into the assay cascade.The efficacy of the compounds described in this report is particularly encouraging in light of the fact that any inhibitor of DHODH developed for use in humans would most probably represent one portion of a combination therapy. Because the approach being utilized for these compounds is inhibition of an enzyme crucial for the viability of the parasite, the development of resistance, potentially via mutation of the enzyme, is a possibility. For this reason resistance selection studies are underway on the lead compounds from this series. Nevertheless, evidence of sterile cure in the mouse with a compound from this series used as a monotherapy suggests that DHODH inhibition should be a valuable addition to anti-malarial strategies.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the N-alkyl-5-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide series offers a potential scaffold for the development of anti-malarial agents. These compounds derive from an iterative medicinal chemistry program, which originated with a high throughput screen of 215,000 diverse compounds contained within the Genzyme library, and they represent novel structures not previously described for this application. Further refinement of the structure-activity relationship within this series is underway, with Genz-668857 and -669178 undergoing further testing to determine if they represent suitable candidates for preclinical development. In addition, the search for closely related compounds representing distinct new scaffolds with anti-DHODH activity is currently ongoing. IntroductionMalaria is currently one of the world's most severe endemic diseases, and, despite the advent of combination therapy and the introduction of longer acting pharmaceuticals, the need for new targets and relevant anti-malarial agents remains acute.

Pyrimidines are required for the biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and phospholipids. Unlike the human host, P. falciparum lacks the ability to salvage pyrimidine bases and thus is entirely dependent on de novo biosynthesis (1Subbayya I.N. Ray S.S. Balaram P. Balaram H. Indian J. Med.

Cell Biochem. 1997; 174: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic enzyme, including the plasmodial form, is localized to the inner mitochondrial space and uses coenzyme Q (16Eakin R.T. Mitchell H.K. Arch. Biochem.

The crucial nature of the reaction catalyzed by PfDHODH is reflected in the fact that, during the intra-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum development, the sole function of mitochondrial electron transport appears to be regeneration of coenzyme Q as a cofactor for DHODH (20Painter H.J. Morrisey J.M. Mather M.W. Vaidya A.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).Significant differences between the plasmodial and human enzymes are suggested by previous studies with A77 1726, the active metabolite of the immunomodulatory drug leflunomide. Differences in the sequence and alignment of residues in the region of the inhibitor-binding site have been demonstrated for the parasite and human enzymes complexed with A77 1726 and orotate (21Liu S.

These results support the likelihood of finding inhibitors specific for PfDHODH, and combined with the essential nature of this enzyme in the parasite, establish it as a potentially viable and relevant anti-malarial chemotherapeutic target.

The enzyme assays were expanded to include DHODH from P. berghei and P. vivax, and parasite viability assays were performed not only on P. falciparum but also on P. knowlesi as an initial step toward discovering compounds with potential pan-species activity.

https://openalex.org/W1967759358,"Constitutive activation of NFκB in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is associated with tumor recurrence and development of anti-estrogen resistance. Furthermore, a gene expression signature containing common targets for ER and NFκB has been identified and found to be associated with the more aggressive luminal B intrinsic subtype of ER-positive breast tumors. Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which ER and NFκB cooperate to up-regulate expression of one important gene from this signature, ABCG2, which encodes a transporter protein associated with the development of drug-resistant breast cancer. We and others have confirmed that this gene is regulated primarily by estrogen in an ER- and estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent manner. We found that whereas proinflammatory cytokines have little effect on this gene in the absence of 17β-estradiol, they can potentiate ER activity in an NFκB-dependent manner. ER allows the NFκB family member p65 to access a latent NFκB response element located near the ERE in the gene promoter. NFκB recruitment to the gene is, in turn, required to stabilize ER occupancy at the functional ERE. The result of this cooperative binding of ER and p65 at adjacent response elements leads to a major increase in both ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression. These findings indicate that estrogen and inflammatory factors can modify each other's activity through modulation of transcription factor accessibility and/or occupancy at adjacent response elements. This novel transcriptional mechanism could have important implications in breast cancer, where both inflammation and estrogen can promote cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2003744288,"Under normal conditions, expression of bacterial DNA damage-repair genes is repressed by the binding of LexA protein to 'SOS boxes' in their promoters. The presence of DNA damage activates the RecA strand-exchange protein, which promotes autocleavage of LexA such that its repression is relieved and repair proteins are expressed. Zhang et al. have now solved several structures of LexA dimer bound to SOS-box DNA, and find that the orientation of the DNA-binding wings can account for the strict inter-site spacing. Normally, expression of bacterial DNA damage repair genes is repressed by the binding of LexA protein to SOS ‘boxes’ in their operators. DNA damage activates the RecA protein, which promotes autocleavage of LexA such that its repression is relieved and repair proteins are expressed. These authors solve several structures of LexA dimer bound to SOS box DNA, and find that the orientation of the DNA-binding wings can account for the strict intersite spacing. The eubacterial SOS system is a paradigm of cellular DNA damage and repair, and its activation can contribute to antibiotic resistance1,2,3. Under normal conditions, LexA represses the transcription of many DNA repair proteins by binding to SOS ‘boxes’ in their operators. Under genotoxic stress, accumulating complexes of RecA, ATP and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) activate LexA for autocleavage. To address how LexA recognizes its binding sites, we determined three crystal structures of Escherichia coli LexA in complex with SOS boxes. Here we report the structure of these LexA–DNA complexes. The DNA-binding domains of the LexA dimer interact with the DNA in the classical fashion of a winged helix–turn–helix motif. However, the wings of these two DNA-binding domains bind to the same minor groove of the DNA. These wing–wing contacts may explain why the spacing between the two half-sites of E. coli SOS boxes is invariant."

Due to its role in drug resistance, its expression has been correlated with a protection role against protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation in stem cells under hypoxic conditions. We show here that zinc mesoporphyrin, a validated fluorescent heme analog, is transported by ABCG2. We also show that the ABCG2 large extracellular loop ECL3 constitutes a porphyrin-binding domain, which strongly interacts with heme, hemin, PPIX, ZnPPIX, CoPPIX, and much less efficiently with pheophorbide a, but not with vitamin B12. Kd values are in the range 0.5–3.5 μm, with heme displaying the highest affinity. Nonporphyrin substrates of ABCG2, such as mitoxantrone, doxo/daunorubicin, and riboflavin, do not bind to ECL3. Single-point mutations H583A and C603A inside ECL3 prevent the binding of hemin but hardly affect that of iron-free PPIX. The extracellular location of ECL3 downstream from the transport sites suggests that, after membrane translocation, hemin is transferred to ECL3, which is strategically positioned to release the bound porphyrin to extracellular partners.

In mammals, heme (ferrous PPIX; see structure in supplemental Fig. S1) and hemin (ferric PPIX) play a central role in cell metabolism. Heme is the prosthetic group of several hemoproteins involved in oxygen sensing, cell respiration and metabolism, and cell growth (for a review, see Ref. 15Tsiftsoglou A.S. Tsamadou A.I.

Poorly soluble, heme and hemin require extracellular and intracellular carriers, such as albumin and hemopexin, which bind hemin with a Kd of 10−8 and 10−12 m, respectively (20Muller-Eberhard U.

Several reports have pointed out the role of ABCG2 in porphyrin detoxification, initiated by a study of Jonker and colleagues who described in Bcrp1−/− knock-out mice a marked sensitivity to the dietary chlorophyll-catabolite pheophorbide a and an accumulation of PPIX, the heme precursor in erythrocytes and plasma, leading to acute photosensitivity (23Jonker J.W. Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. Van Der Valk M.A. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Plosch T. Kuipers F. Elferink R.P. Rosing H. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15649-15654Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). ABCG2 is a hematopoietic stem cell marker (24Zhou S. Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat.

Harkey M.A. Torok-Storb B. Blood. 2002; 99: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Levels of porphyrins are normally regulated by metabolic control mechanisms of their biosynthesis; however, ABCG2 was found to prevent PPIX accumulation in erythroid progenitor K562 cells submitted to hypoxic conditions of growth (26Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T. Bailey-Dell K. Zhou S. Mercer K.E. Sarkadi B. Sorrentino B.P. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol.

Stewart C.F. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These data point toward a role of BCRP in porphyrin homeostasis and protection; however, the molecular mechanism by which porphyrins are transported and handled for controlling their toxicity remains unknown. In addition, although ABCG2 is recognized to export PPIX (26Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T. Bailey-Dell K. Zhou S. Mercer K.E. Sarkadi B. Sorrentino B.P. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24218-24225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), its capacity to export either hemin or heme has not yet been demonstrated. ABCG2 consists of a cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain fused to a transmembrane (TM) domain of six α-helices, giving an inverted domain organization by comparison to most other human ABC transporters (4Sarkadi B. Ozvegy-Laczka C. Német K. Váradi A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The minimal functional unit of ABCG2 is a homodimer (28Bhatia A. Schäfer H.J.

ABCG2 displays several topological and structural specificities, such as the presence of a large external loop, ECL3, located between TM5 and TM6. Approximately 70–80 residues long, ECL3 is large enough to constitute a full domain, although no specific role has been assigned to it. It contains three cysteine residues reported to be involved in both intermolecular (Cys603-Cys603) and intramolecular (Cys592-Cys608) disulfide bridges (31Özvegy C. Litman T. Szakács G. Nagy Z.

Schuetz J.D. Bunting K.D. Colapietro A.M. Sampath J. Morris J.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G.C. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Sorrentino B.P. Nat.

In the present report, we hypothesized that ABCG2 should transport hemin out of the cell, which could be particularly critical in the early stages of hematopoiesis when it is overexpressed, and hemin plays a role in differentiation. We found that ABCG2 transports zinc mesoporphyrin (ZnMP), a validated fluorescent heme analog (36Worthington M.T. Cohn S.M. Miller S.K. Luo R.Q. Berg C.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

Cell. 2004; 118: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We also hypothesized that hemin, once exported by ABCG2, should be transferred to an extracellular protein through interaction with an accessible domain of ABCG2 such as ECL3, which could transitorily interact with hemin after membrane translocation. We expressed the ECL3 domain in Escherichia coli and purified it in a folded state, as checked by biophysical methods. It was especially found to be able to interact with the 5D3 mAb only when it was oxidized. ECL3 displayed a high affinity for some, but not all, porphyrins, especially for heme and hemin, whereas it does not bind any of the known nonporphyrin substrates and inhibitors of ABCG2. We also found that hemin, when bound onto ECL3, can be rapidly transferred to human serum albumin (HSA). The pET15b plasmid was from Novagen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. Luria Bertani broth, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and ampicillin were from Euromedex. Foscholine 12 (FC12) was from Anatrace. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) and gel filtration resins and materials for chromatography were from GE Healthcare. An Amicon ultracentrifuge filter device was from Millipore. 5D3-phycoerythrin was purchased from Clinisciences. Other products were from Sigma. Heme was prepared by incubating 0.2 mm hemin with 10 mm dithionite for 1 h at room temperature; the nearly immediate reduction was visible by eye. K562 cells, either expressing or not human ABCG2, were kindly provided by Drs. Sheng Zhou and Albert Sorentino and used as described in Ref. 27Zhou S. Zong Y. Ney P.A. Nair G. Stewart C.F. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. K562 cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 200 × g and washed with fresh DMEM. After centrifugation, cells were suspended in 5 ml of DMEM and seeded at 200 μl/well in a 96-well plate. The medium was removed by centrifugation, and 100 μl of ZnMP (10 μm final) was added with or without 100 μl of Ko143 (1 μm final). Accumulation of ZnMP was allowed for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and centrifuged and then incubated for 1 h with or without Ko143. They were maintained on ice until analysis by flow cytometry. ZnMP accumulation was quantified with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), excitation at 488 nm and emission at 575 nm. Experiments were performed as previously described by Krishnamurthy et al. (26Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T. Bailey-Dell K. Zhou S. Mercer K.E. Sarkadi B. Sorrentino B.P. Schuetz J.D. J.

Stewart C.F. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 2005; 105: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed as described, and 50 μg of proteins were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the presence of 0–2 ng/μl 5D3 antibody and 500 nm hemin-agarose. After incubation, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation, and unbound material was withdrawn. Pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), suspended in 20 μl of SDS sample loading buffer (38Montigny C. Penin F. Lethias C. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Bound and unbound materials were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and ABCG2 was then revealed with the BXP21 monoclonal antibody (1/500, Millipore). The bcrp1 gene encoding ABCG2, referenced as Q9UNQ0 at the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, was used for constructs. The E. coli protein expression plasmid for producing ECL3, as displayed in Fig. 2, was constructed from alanine 562 to histidine 630 of the ABCG2 sequence by PCR using the plasmid pFastBac Dual-NinaA-BCRP (39Trometer C. Falson P. Mus-Veteau I. Heterologous Expression of Membrane Proteins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2010: 105-117Google Scholar), with the couple of forward and reverse primers Pfor and Prev displayed in Table 1. Pfor included a NdeI restriction site and encoded a tobacco etch virus (TEV) site (40Kapust R.B. Tözsér J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar); Prev included a BamHI restriction site. The PCR product was digested by NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pET15b plasmid. The resulting plasmid pET15b-H6ThTe-ECL3 expressed the ECL3 (A562-H630) domain fused at its N terminus to a His6 tag through a thrombin site and a TEV site: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRG/SHMNLYFQ/GA562-ABCG2-H630, where both cleavage sites are underlined, the cleavage position is indicated by “/,” and the ECL3 sequence is indicated in bold and italic characters. The single-point mutations H598A, C603A, and Y608A were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the corresponding primers displayed in Table 1.TABLE 1Primer sequences for generating the H6ThTeECL3 fusion protein and to introduce single mutations as detailed in the textPrimer5′–3′ SequenceRes. sitesPforAAAAAAAAAACATATGAATCTTTATTTTCAGGGGGCATCTTGGCTGTCATGGCNdeIPrevGGGGCTTGTGGAAGAATCACTAAGGATCCAATABamHIH583AforGGATTTACGGCTTTGCAGGCCAATGAATTTTTGGGACAAAACTTCTGCH583ArevGCAGAAGTTTTGTCCCAAAAATTCATTGGCCTGCAAAGCCGTAAATCCC603AforGCAACAGGAAACAATCCTGCCAACTATGCAACATGTACTGGCGAAC603ArevTTCGCCAGTACATGTTGCATAGTTGGCAGGATTGTTTCCTGTTGCY605AforGCAACAGGAAACAATCCTTGTAACGCCGCAACATGTACTGGCY605ArevGCCAGTACATGTTGCGGCGTTACAAGGATTGTTTCCTGTTGC Open table in a new tab The plasmid used for expressing full-length ABCG2 in insect cells was described previously (39Trometer C. Falson P. Mus-Veteau I. Heterologous Expression of Membrane Proteins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2010: 105-117Google Scholar); here, we extended from 6 to 10 the length of the N-terminal histidine tag and added a thrombin cleavage site. The resulting sequence H10Th-ABCG2 was MAHHHHHHHHHHLPRGSGGMDSPPPSGLVPRGS-S4-ABCG2-S655. The BL21(DE3) E. coli bacteria strain was transformed with the expression plasmid pET15b-H6ThTe-ECL3 including wild-type or mutated sequences. A single colony of freshly transformed cells was grown overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of Luria Bertani broth containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and then diluted into 2 liters of the same medium. The culture was incubated at 37 °C and shaken at 220 rpm until reaching an A600 nm of 0.6. Protein expression was then induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and continued for 3 h under the same conditions. TEV was expressed with the pRK793 plasmid, kindly given by Dr. David S. Vaugh (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). After expression of either wild-type or mutated ECL3, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in 20 ml of 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl. Cells were disrupted by using a French press, and 2 m NaCl was added to the medium, which was shaken for 20 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, at 4 °C, resulting in supernatant S1 and pellet P1 (see Fig. 2B). The pellet was suspended in 5 ml of 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 29 mm FC12 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature under mild shaking. The solution was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, generating supernatant S2 (see Fig. 2B) which was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel Hi-trap chelating HP column previously equilibrated with 10 ml of 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, and 14.2 mm FC12. The resin was washed in two steps with 10 ml and 4 ml of the same buffer, lowering the FC12 concentration to 2.8 mm during the second step. The protein was eluted in 5 ml of the latter buffer with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m imidazole. The pool of protein was concentrated with an Amicon ultracentrifuge filter device, cutoff 3,000 Da, and loaded onto a Superdex-200 gel filtration 10/300 column, equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2.8 mm FC12. Fractions of about 5–20 μg of protein were checked for homogeneity on a 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE, after half-dilution in a 2× SDS sample buffer (38Montigny C. Penin F. Lethias C. Falson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and incubation for 20 min at room temperature before electrophoresis. Fractions of interest were pooled and incubated overnight at 4 °C to allow thiol oxidation to occur. Protein concentration was determined by measuring A280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 29,520 liters·mol−1·cm−1. Bovine thrombin was added at a ratio of 10 units/mg of protein for removing the His6 tag and incubated for 5 h at room temperature. The efficacy of cleavage was checked by Tricine SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2B). The His6 tag peptide was removed by a Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm FC12. Thrombin was removed on a 1-ml p-aminobenzamidine-agarose resin equilibrated with the same buffer. ABCG2 was expressed in Hi5 cells as described in Ref. 39Trometer C. Falson P. Mus-Veteau I. Heterologous Expression of Membrane Proteins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2010: 105-117Google Scholar. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was suspended (7 ml/liter of culture) in PBS and centrifuged again. Cells were then suspended (25 ml/liter of culture) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 200 μm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors, and incubated for 1 h. Cells were disrupted by using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was suspended (500 μl/liter of culture), in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 100 μm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentration was about 40 mg/ml, estimated by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (41Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18622) Google Scholar). Membrane suspension was thawed, diluted to 10 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl, 15% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, and incubated for 1 h before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was suspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 40 mm dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 0.2 mm DTT, 20 mm imidazole, protease inhibitors, then incubated for 2 h and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied to HiTrap chelating HP 1-ml column loaded with Ni2+ and equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 10 mm dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 20 mm imidazole, protease inhibitors. The resin was washed with 16 bed volumes with the same buffer, and ABCG2 was eluted in the same buffer with a 0.02–1 m imidazole gradient. The protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator device 50-kDa cutoff. The His10 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage as described above. A saturated solution of hemin was prepared by solubilizing about 10 mg in 100 μl of fresh 0.1 m KOH, followed by a dilution in 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 3 min, and hemin concentration was determined at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient of 58,400 liters·mol−1·cm−1 (42Li S.D. Su Y.D. Li M. Zou C.G. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2006; 38: 63-69Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For assays, samples of 10 μm protein were subjected to UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy at room temperature on a DU 640 (Beckman) spectrophotometer, using 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2.8 mm FC12 buffer as blank. Spectra were recorded between 240 and 700 nm using a 1-cm path length cuvette, in a hemin concentration range of 0–50 μm. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the buffer spectrum from that of the protein·hemin complex. Spectra were normalized at 280 nm. Fifty microliters of Ni-NTA magnetic beads were equilibrated with 3 × 1 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% FC12 and then incubated with 200 μg of H6ECL3/100 μl (20 nmol) for 30 min 4 °C and mild agitation. The beads were washed three times with 600 μl of the same buffer, and the amount of unbound protein was quantified by the BCA method. H6ECL3 beads were loaded on a BioSprint 15 robot (Qiagen) to carry out the binding of hemin by incubating beads in 500 μl of 50 μm hemin in the same buffer for 20 min at room temperature. The incubation was followed by three washing steps with 500 μl of the same buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted in 50 μl of the same buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 300 mm imidazole. The amount of eluted protein and hemin were quantified by the BCA method and by absorbance, respectively. Bound and unbound materials were analyzed on a 16% SDS-PAGE and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Far-UV CD of purified ECL3 was performed on a Chirascan (Applied Photophysics). Spectra were recorded at room temperature using a 1-mm path length cuvette from 260 to 185 nm, with a step size of 1 nm. Spectra were recorded in the 190–250-nm wavelength range with a 0.2-nm increment, a bandwidth of 0.5 nm, and a 1-s integration time. Spectra were processed, corrected for baseline, and smoothed by Chirascan software on the basis of the Savitzky-Golay algorithm.

All measurements were recorded in 500-μl quartz cuvettes (Hellma) of 0.5-cm path length. Data were corrected for buffer and the contribution to fluorescence and inner-filter effects of tested ligands by collecting the same spectra with N-acetyltryptophan (NATA). ECL3 (3 μm) in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 2.8 mm FC12, 20% glycerol, or ABCG2 (0.1 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 10 mm dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 1.6 mm CHAPS, was excited at 295 nm, and the fluorescence emission was scanned from 310 to 370 nm. The concentration-dependent quenching studies for the different ligands (0–15 μm) were performed at least three times. Peak areas of corrected fluorescence spectra were fitted with the SigmaPlot software (version 11; Systat Software). Percentages of fluorescence quenching were calculated as a ratio of protein to NATA. Data were fitted assuming one binding site with different possible equations, as indicated, f=Bmax∗abs(x)/(Kd+abs⁡(x))(Eq. 1) f=Fmin+((Fmax−Fmin)∗((E+x+Kd)−SQRT⁡((E+x+Kd)∧2−4∗E∗x)))/(2∗E)(Eq. 2) (47Falson P.

https://openalex.org/W1964681576,"Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is a dual lipid-protein phosphatase that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate to phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and thereby inhibits PI3K-Akt-dependent cell proliferation, migration, and tumor vascularization. We have uncovered a previously unrecognized role for PTEN in regulating Ca(2+) entry through transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6) that does not require PTEN phosphatase activity. We show that PTEN tail-domain residues 394-403 permit PTEN to associate with TRPC6. The inflammatory mediator thrombin promotes this association. Deletion of PTEN residues 394-403 prevents TRPC6 cell surface expression and Ca(2+) entry. However, PTEN mutant, C124S, which lacks phosphatase activity, did not alter TRPC6 activity. Thrombin failed to increase endothelial monolayer permeability in the endothelial cells, transducing the Δ394-403 PTEN mutant. Paradoxically, we also show that thrombin failed to induce endothelial cell migration and tube formation in cells transducing the Δ394-403 PTEN mutant. Our results demonstrate that PTEN, through residues 394-403, serves as a scaffold for TRPC6, enabling cell surface expression of the channel. Ca(2+) entry through TRPC6 induces an increase in endothelial permeability and directly promotes angiogenesis. Thus, PTEN is indicated to play a role beyond suppressing PI3K signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2003818209,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a major health problem worldwide, and patients have a particularly poor 5-year survival rate. Thus, identification of the molecular targets in OSCC and subsequent innovative therapies are greatly needed. Prolonged exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and pathogenic agents are known risk factors and have suggested that chronic inflammation may represent a potential common denominator in the development of OSCC. Microarray analysis of gene expression in OSCC cell lines with high basal NF-κB activity and OSCC patient samples identified dysregulation of many genes involved in inflammation, wound healing, angiogenesis, and growth regulation. In particular IL-8, CCL5, STAT1, and VEGF gene expression was up-regulated in OSCC. Moreover, IL-8 protein levels were significantly higher in OSCC cell lines as compared with normal human oral keratinocytes. Targeting IL-8 expression by siRNA significantly reduced the survival of OSCC cells, indicating that it plays an important role in OSCC development and/or progression. Inhibiting the inflammatory pathway by aspirin and the proteasome/NF-κB pathway by bortezomib resulted in marked reduction in cell viability in OSCC lines. Taken together our studies indicate a strong link between inflammation and OSCC development and reveal IL-8 as a potential mediator. Treatment based on prevention of general inflammation and/or the NF-κB pathway shows promise in OSCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2004393345,"Botryococcus braunii, B race is a unique green microalga that produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons known as botryococcenes that can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines. The simplest botryococcene (C(30)) is metabolized by methylation to give intermediates of C(31), C(32), C(33), and C(34), with C(34) being the predominant botryococcene in some strains. In the present work we have used Raman spectroscopy to characterize the structure of botryococcenes in an attempt to identify and localize botryococcenes within B. braunii cells. The spectral region from 1600-1700 cm(-1) showed ν(C=C) stretching bands specific for botryococcenes. Distinct botryococcene Raman bands at 1640 and 1647 cm(-1) were assigned to the stretching of the C=C bond in the botryococcene branch and the exomethylene C=C bonds produced by the methylations, respectively. A Raman band at 1670 cm(-1) was assigned to the backbone C=C bond stretching. Density function theory calculations were used to determine the Raman spectra of all botryococcenes to compare computed theoretical values with those observed. The analysis showed that the ν(C=C) stretching bands at 1647 and 1670 cm(-1) are actually composed of several closely spaced bands arising from the six individual C=C bonds in the molecule. We also used confocal Raman microspectroscopy to map the presence and location of methylated botryococcenes within a colony of B. braunii cells based on the methylation-specific 1647 cm(-1) botryococcene Raman shift."

The investigation was also done in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats. In SC human hepatocytes, both absolute protein and mRNA levels of MRP2/ABCC2 were significantly down-regulated by TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β. In contrast to mRNA decrease, which was observed for BSEP/ABCB11, the protein amount was significantly increased by IL-6 or IL-1β. A discrepancy between the change in BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA and protein levels was encountered in SC human hepatocytes treated with proinflammatory cytokines. In SC rat hepatocytes, Mrp2/Abcc2 mRNA was down-regulated by TNF-α and IL-6, whereas the protein level was decreased by all three cytokines. Down-regulations of both Bsep/Abcb11 mRNA and protein levels were found in SC rat hepatocytes exposed to TNF-α or IL-1β. Administration of LPS triggered the release of the proinflammatory cytokines and caused the decrease of Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 protein in liver at 24 h post-treatment; however, the Mrp2 and Bsep protein levels rebounded at 48 h post-LPS treatment. In total, our results indicate that proinflammatory cytokines regulate the expression of MRP2/Mrp2 and BSEP/Bsep and for the first time demonstrate the differential effects on BSEP/Bsep expression between SC human and rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, the agreement between transporter regulation in vitro in SC rat hepatocytes and in vivo in LPS-treated rats during the acute response phase demonstrates the utility of in vitro SC hepatocyte models for predicting in vivo effects.

Drug transporters facilitate the passage of many drugs across cellular barriers during the process of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. The hepatobiliary excretion of drugs and drug metabolites is one of the primary elimination routes for endogenous and exogenous compounds from blood circulation (1Arias I.M.

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 have been shown to regulate the expression of hepatic transporters during inflammation in rodents (5Donner M.G.

Down-regulation of hepatic bile salt influx transporters such as the sodium-dependent taurocholate transporter (NTCP/SLC10A1) by inflammation has been characterized in both rodents and primary human hepatocytes (9Green R.M.

Dispos. 2008; 36: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The decreased expression of hepatic transporters could affect the hepatobiliary secretion of various physiological substances, which further indicates that alteration of transporter expression might play an important role in the pathogenesis of cholestasis (11Zollner G. Fickert P. Zenz R. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Kenner L. Ferenci P. Stauber R.E. Krejs G.J. Denk H. Zatloukal K. Trauner M.

However, these previous investigations focus mainly on the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on hepatobiliary transporter expression either in vivo in rodents or in vitro using hepatoma cells or primary cultured hepatocytes. Primary cultured human hepatocytes have been reported to be capable of predicting clinically relevant regulation of CYP enzymes to some extent (14Zhang X. Schmitt C. Grange S. Terao K. Miya K. Kivitz A. Marino M. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 85: S59Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because of the recent accessibility of human hepatocytes, there has been a growing interest in the use of primary human hepatocytes for investigating regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes and hepatobiliary transporters in an effort to predict in vivo effects (15Gómez-Lechón M.J. Donato M.T. Castell J.V. Jover R. Curr. Drug. Metab. 2004; 5: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Vee M.L. Lecureur V. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2009; 37: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Treatment of human hepatocytes with cytokines has also demonstrated alterations in the expression of various hepatic transporters including MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 (10Le Vee M. Gripon P. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Le Vee M. Lecureur V. Moreau A. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2009; 37: 2228-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the cellular polarity that allows uptake and efflux in vivo is disrupted rapidly when cells are isolated from the intact organ (18Roelofsen H. Bakker C.T. Schoemaker B. Heijn M. Jansen P.L. Elferink R.P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1649-1657PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bow D.A. Perry J.L. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Brouwer K.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of the major critiques for the primary cultured hepatocyte model is that the disruption of cellular polarity might affect the cellular responses to the stimulants. Indeed, discrepancies in efflux transporter regulation due to inflammation have been reported between human hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell lines and between human and rodent hepatocytes and undoubtedly complicate in vitro to in vivo extrapolation. In the present study the sandwich cultured (SC) human and rat hepatocytes were used to investigate the transporter regulation and to further establish the in vitro models for in vivo prediction. HPLC grade acetonitrile, water, and methanol were purchased from Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon, MI) and EMD Chemicals, Inc. (Gibbstown, NJ), respectively. Hanks' balanced salt solution was purchased from Invitrogen. ProteoExtract Native Membrane Protein Extraction kit was purchased from Calbiochem. The protein quantification BCA kit and the in-solution digestion kit were purchased from Pierce. Trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). MatrigelTM (phenol red free) and collagen I-coated 24-well plates were obtained from BD Biosciences. The hepatocyte plating medium (InVitroGROTM CP medium), culture medium (InVitroGROTM HI medium), and TorpedoTM antibiotic mix were purchased from Celsis IVT Technologies (Baltimore, MD). The completed plating media or culture media were prepared by mixing 1 ml of TorpedoTM antibiotic mix with 45 ml of InVitroGROTM CP medium or InVitroGROTM HI medium, respectively. Recombinant IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were purchased from R&D System (Minneapolis, MN). The Milliplex rat cytokine immunoassay kit was obtained from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA). The RNeasy kit and RNase free DNase kit were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). SYBR supermix was obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City). Freshly isolated rat and human hepatocytes were purchased from CellzDirect (Pittsboro, NC). Hepatocyte sandwich culture was conducted as previously described (20Li N. Bi Y.A. Duignan D.B. Lai Y. Mol. Pharm. 2009; 6: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, upon arrival fresh hepatocytes were centrifuged at 500 rpm at 4 °C for 4 min. The cell pellet was resuspended with 5 ml of completed plating media to assess cell viability by trypan blue exclusion. The hepatocytes were further diluted to 0.7 million cells/ml with completed plating media and dispensed into 24-well BioCoat plates (0.5 ml/well) and allowed to attach for 2–4 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95/5% air/CO2. Unattached hepatocytes were removed, and the media were replaced with fresh completed plating medium. On day 2 the hepatocytes were washed once with warmed completed culture media and then overlaid with MatrigelTM at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in ice-cold completed culture media. On day 3 or 4, the hepatocytes were cultured with completed culture medium containing TNF-α (100 ng/ml), IL-1β (1 ng/ml), or IL-6 (100 ng/ml) for a 48- or 24-h incubation, respectively. Cytokine concentrations were chosen according to the preliminary dose dependence results (supplemental Figs. S1–S3) and literature reports (10Le Vee M. Gripon P. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Vee M.L. Lecureur V. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2009; 37: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). From the preliminary experiments, general dose dependence effects of all three cytokines on MRP2/ABCC2 protein expression in SC human hepatocytes were confirmed, whereas only IL-6 showed the dose-dependent effects on BSEP/ABCB11 expression (supplemental Fig. S1 and S2). In HepG2 cell models, the dose-dependent effects of TNF-α on MRP2/ABCC2 protein expression were detected (supplemental Fig. S3). Considering the physiological relevance (21Lee G. Piquette-Miller M. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 2152-2163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a lower concentration of IL-1 was selected. The culture media with or without cytokines was refreshed every 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from SC hepatocytes or rat liver tissues using the RNeasy kit. The obtained RNA was treated with RNase free DNase to remove the genomic DNA and quantified using a nano-UV spectrometer (NanoDrop Technology, Wilmington, DE). The first-strand cDNA was prepared from 200–500 ng of RNA using the Superscript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Negative controls were prepared without reverse transcriptase. All quantitative PCR reactions were prepared using SYBR PCR supermix with the synthesized first-strand cDNA and specific primer pairs (Table 1) and performed using an ABI-PRISM 7500 Fast Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions were 10 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Quantification of relative gene expression was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt approach to calculate the -fold change normalized to housekeeping gene (GAPDH).TABLE 1Primer pairs for quantitative RT-PCR of transporters and internal standard Open table in a new tab At 24 and 48 h post-treatment of proinflammatory cytokines, SC hepatocytes were harvested and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The membrane protein of hepatocytes or rat liver tissue was extracted as described previously (22Li N. Nemirovskiy O.V. Zhang Y. Yuan H. Mo J. Ji C. Zhang B. Brayman T.G. Lepsy C. Heath T.G. Lai Y. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 380: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of extracted membrane fractions were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The samples were then subjected to overnight tryptic digestion in the presence of stable isotope labeled internal standard followed by LC-MS/MS quantitative analysis as described previously (22Li N. Nemirovskiy O.V. Zhang Y. Yuan H. Mo J. Ji C. Zhang B. Brayman T.G. Lepsy C. Heath T.G. Lai Y. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 380: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Li N. Palandra J. Nemirovskiy O.V. Lai Y. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 fmol of stable isotope-labeled peptide serving as internal standard was added into 30 μg of membrane fraction protein. The protein mixture was then reduced with 10 mm DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate digestion buffer and digested by trypsin (22Li N. Nemirovskiy O.V. Zhang Y. Yuan H. Mo J. Ji C. Zhang B. Brayman T.G. Lepsy C. Heath T.G. Lai Y. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 380: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At the end of digestion, samples were acidified with equal amounts of 0.2% formic acid in H2O (MRP2/Mrp2) or 1:1 acetonitrile/H2O (BSEP/Bsep), then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min before LC-MS/MS analysis. The synthetic peptides corresponding to MRP2/Mrp2 and BSEP/Bsep tryptic fragments (Celtek Bioscience, Nashville, TN) and the corresponding stable isotope-labeled peptides (Sigma) were synthesized for LC-MS/MS protein quantification. Data were processed by integrating the appropriate peak areas generated from the reconstructed ion chromatograms for the analyte peptides and the stable isotope-labeled internal standard peptides by Analyst 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 275–340 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, DE) and acclimated to their surroundings for approximately 1 week with food and water provided ad libitum. A minimum of 1 day before the study, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (to effect) and then implanted with BASi vascular catheters (Bioanalytical Services, Inc., West Lafayette, IN) in the carotid artery and jugular vein. Animals were intravenously-dosed with LPS (1 mg/kg, Sigma) formulated in 0.9% normal saline (Baxter) via the jugular vein catheter. At the designated time points (24 or 48 h post LPS-treatment), the rats were euthanized with 30 mg/kg pentobarbitol (Sleepaway) injection intraperitoneally. The rats then were flushed with 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS) via carotid artery catheters to remove the blood. The livers were then removed and kept at −80 °C until analysis. To determine the plasma level of proinflammatory cytokines, the blood samples were collected from a subset group of LPS-treated rats (n = 2) at 4 h post-treatment. This animal study was approved by the St. Louis Pfizer Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The animal care and use program is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International. Proinflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA according to the protocols suggested by the vendor. Briefly, plasma was diluted 10-fold using serum matrix provided in the kit. The diluted plasma or standards (50 μl) were added into the appropriate wells. Antibody-immobilized beads (25 μl) were added into each well. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the liquid in the plate was gently removed by vacuum. The plate was washed 2 times with 200 μl washing buffer, and 25 μl of detection antibody was added. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, streptavidin-phycoerythrin, provided in the kit, was added to the plate. The plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then washed 4 times with washing buffer. The substrate solution was added (100 μl/well), and the plate was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. The chromogenic reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl/well of stop solution. The optical densities were read on a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 450 nm. Transporter protein quantification was conducted on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) coupled to a Shimadzu LC (SLC-10A) system (WoolDale, IL) with a HTS PAL Leap autosampler (Carrboro, NC). For MRP2/Mrp2, a Vydac EVERESTTM C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 5 μm in particle size 300 Å in pore size) was used. For BSEP/Bsep, an Agilent Eclipse XDB C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm in particle size, 80 Å in pore size) was used. A linear gradient elution program was conducted to achieve chromatographic separation with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). MRP2/Mrp2 gradient conditions were 5 to 35% B over a period of 30 min, and BSEP/Bsep gradient conditions were 5 to 25% B over a period of 20 min. A sample volume of 20 μl was injected onto the LC column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The parent-to-product transitions for the proteotypic peptide represent the doubly charged parent ion to the single charged product y ions for each transporter (Fig. 1). The instrument settings of the API4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer were: ion spray voltage, 4 kV; temperature, 400 °C. Declustering potential, collision energy, entrance potential, and collision cell exit potential were set as reported previously (22Li N. Nemirovskiy O.V. Zhang Y. Yuan H. Mo J. Ji C. Zhang B.

Chem. 2009; 81: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Data are representative of a minimum of two in vitro experiments performed on different days. The in vivo experiments were preformed as n = 3 (n = 2 for subset group). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. The differences were determined by ANOVA after post hoc analysis using Graphpad Prism Version 5.01 for windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A p value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Quantitative mRNA detection (quantitative real time-PCR) has been a very popular and powerful tool in gene expression analysis studies (24Hilgendorf C. Ahlin G. Seithel A. Artursson P. Ungell A.L.

Approaching in front, we examined the mRNA level of MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 in SC human and rat hepatocytes exposed to cytokines for 24 and 48 h. As shown in Fig. 2, mRNA expression of both MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 in SC human hepatocytes was significantly down-regulated by exposure to TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. To determine whether the changes in mRNA level induced by cytokine treatments also occur at the protein level, LC-MS/MS-mediated absolute quantitative methods were utilized to measure MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 protein amounts in the inflammatory cytokine treated hepatocytes. Consistent with the changes in mRNA levels, TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β significantly decreased the absolute amount of MRP2/ABCC2 protein at 24 and 48 h post-treatment (Fig. 3A). However, in contrast to the down-regulation of mRNA, BSEP/ABCB11 protein was increased by IL-1β or IL-6 treatment, whereas no effect was detected with TNF-α treatment (Fig. 3B), indicating a discrepancy exists between BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA and protein levels in SC human hepatocytes exposed to cytokines.FIGURE 3Changes of MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 protein expression in SC human hepatocytes exposed to TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β.

TNF-α and IL-6 significantly down-regulated Mrp2/Abcc2 mRNA expression at 24 and 48 h; however, the effect of IL-1β on Mrp2/Abcc2 mRNA expression was not detected (Fig. 4A). TNF-α and IL-1β significantly decreased Bsep/Abcb11 mRNA levels at both 24 and 48 h in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). At 24 h post-IL-6 treatment, a statistically significant increase of Bsep/Abcb11 mRNA was detected. However, no significant changes were found at 48 h. In line with mRNA changes, Mrp2/Abcc2 protein was significantly down-regulated by TNF-α, IL-1β, or IL-6, both at 24 and 48 h post-treatment (Fig. 5A). Bsep/Abcb11 protein was decreased by TNF-α at 24 and 48 h or by IL-1β at 48 h (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, in contrast to the findings with human SC hepatocytes, the up-regulation of Bsep/Abcb11 protein by IL-6 was not detected in SC rat hepatocytes (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Changes of Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 protein expression in SC rat hepatocytes exposed to TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β.

Liver tissues were collected at 24 and 48 h post-LPS injection. LPS challenge significantly increased the plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, as determined by ELISA (Fig. 6). Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 mRNA was slightly decreased at 24 h post LPS treatment; however, no statistical significance was detected as compared with the control group (Fig. 7, A and B). The Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 proteins were significantly decreased in liver at 24 h (Fig. 8, A and B). Both Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 mRNA expression in rat liver were significantly increased at 48 h post-LPS treatments (Fig. 7, A and B). In agreement with mRNA changes, Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 proteins also increased significantly at 48 h post LPS treatment (Fig. 8, A and B). During the ARP (24 h post LPS treatment), the suppression of Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 protein in vitro in SC rat hepatocytes exposed to proinflammatory cytokines was reproduced in vivo in LPS-treated rats.FIGURE 7Changes of Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 mRNA expression in LPS-treated rats.

Although data obtained from in vivo administration of cytokines in rodents yields valuable information on gene regulation, in vitro models used for analyzing the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on human hepatic drug transporters are essential due to the limited knowledge of interspecies differences with respect to responses to cytokines. Primary human hepatocytes represent the gold standard of in vitro models for analyzing drug metabolism and transport mechanisms. However, it remains largely unknown whether in vitro/in vivo correlation of transporter regulation by proinflammatory cytokines could be established in primary cultured hepatocytes due to the lack of the proper three-dimensional distribution of transporter proteins. Recently, the use of SC hepatocytes has become a valuable tool, allowing repolarization of hepatocytes and development of intact bile canaliculi, thereby providing the proper three-dimensional orientation and localization of efflux transporters like MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 (26Ghibellini G. Bridges A.S. Generaux C.N. Brouwer K.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Bi Y.A. Kazolias D. Duignan D.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The restoration of transporter orientation in in vitro hepatocyte cultured models is desired for investigating the regulation of hepatic transporters and vectorial transport activities (41Li N. Singh P. Mandrell K.M. Lai Y. Mol. Pharm. 2010; 7: 630-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous report characterized the time-dependent changes of hepatobiliary transporter expression in SC hepatocytes (20Li N. Bi Y.A. Duignan D.B. Lai Y. Mol. Pharm. 2009; 6: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The primary purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 on the expression of MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 in SC rat and human hepatocytes. Second, we investigated the in vitro/in vivo correlation between SC rat hepatocytes and LPS-treated rats, which in turn is fundamental to build confidence for in vitro to in vivo predictions of human hepatic transporter regulation using the SC human hepatocyte model. The gene expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes and drug transporters is regulated during inflammatory processes (29Renton K.W. Pharmacol Ther. 2001; 92: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which affects absorption, disposition, metabolism, and elimination of many drugs (30Renton K.W. Curr. Drug. Metab. 2004; 5: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of gene regulation mediated by proinflammatory cytokines are proposed to involve both pre-translational and post-translational processes, resulting in changes of the corresponding mRNA and protein levels and enzyme/transporter activities (30Renton K.W. Curr. Drug. Metab. 2004; 5: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Morgan E.T. Li-Masters T. Cheng P.Y. Toxicology. 2002; 181–182: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Suppression of mRNA and protein levels of pregnane X receptor and other nuclear receptors including farnesoid X activated receptor and constitutive androstane receptor have been reported in LPS-treated mice or proinflammatory cytokine-treated human hepatocytes (32Teng S. Piquette-Miller M. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 34Pascussi J.M. Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Fabre J.M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that these nuclear receptors are involved in enzyme/transporter gene regulation. In fact, mRNA expression of hepatic efflux transporters is found to be highly repressed in endotoxin-induced inflammation rodent models (35Morgan E.T. Goralski K.B. Piquette-Miller M. Renton K.W. Robertson G.R. Chaluvadi M.R. Charles K.A. Clarke S.J. Kacevska M. Liddle C. Richardson T.A. Sharma R. Sinal C.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In SC human hepatocytes, both MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA expression were reduced by the exposure to three proinflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, IL-1β or IL-6. In SC rat hepatocytes, a decrease in Mrp2/Abcc2 mRNA was observed in hepatocytes exposed to TNF-α and IL-6, whereas BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA expression was decreased by TNF-α or IL-1β exposure. The results regarding mRNA suppression are consistent with previous results related to suppressive effects on transporter mRNA expression found in primary cultured human hepatocytes (7Hartmann G. Cheung A.K. Piquette-Miller M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 36Evseenko D.A. Paxton J.W. Keelan J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the BSEP/ABCB11 protein in human SC hepatocytes exposed to IL-6 or IL-1β was significantly increased (Fig. 3). In addition, we also observed a poor correlation between the modifications of mRNA and protein levels in hepatocytes exposed to proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines might be involved in the decrease of BSEP/ABCB11 transcription with an increase of BSEP/ABCB11 translation, indicating that both pre- and post-transcriptional regulation might be involved in the process of regulation. In this regard, quantitative real time-PCR and absolute quantification of transporter proteins have been promising tools in the investigation of both pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. In agreement with findings obtained using in vitro SC rat hepatocytes, a significant decrease of Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 protein was detected in the rat at 24 h post LPS treatment. Interestingly, Mrp2/Abcc2 and Bsep/Abcb11 protein levels rebounded at 48 h, suggesting that the down-regulation of transporter proteins in LPS-treated rats was found during ARP, which usually lasts 24 h and encompasses initial tissue injury resulting in cytokine release and activation of signaling cascades. In fact, the proinflammatory cytokines decrease sharply after peaking at 2 h (37Turnbull A.V. Rivier C.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dynamic phase of proinflammatory cytokines in plasma might explain the difference between in vitro and in vivo observations at 48 h post-treatment. It is known that the end of ARP usually shows the restoration of homeostasis; however, failure of the ARP to subside can develop into the chronic inflammatory phase (38Petrovic V. Teng S. Piquette-Miller M. Mol. Interv. 2007; 7: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this regard additional investigations are needed to elucidate the regulation of hepatic transporters during chronic inflammation. In the present study we observed differences in BSEP/ABCB11 protein regulation between SC human and rat hepatocytes in response to cytokine treatments. Proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to activate signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) in primary human hepatocytes (10Le Vee M. Gripon P. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). IL-1β or IL-6 are thought to be involved in the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (39Fardel O. Le Vée M. Expert. Opin. Drug. Metab. Toxicol. 2009; 5: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The discrepancies in the responses of BSEP/Bsep between SC rat and human hepatocytes might be attributed to differences in the signaling pathways between the two species. For examples, MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA levels are not affected in LPS-treated human liver slices, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms play a more prominent role in LPS-induced regulation of human MRP2/ABCC2 and BSEP/ABCB11 as compared with the rat transporter proteins (40Elferink M.G. Olinga P. Draaisma A.L. Merema M.T. Faber K.N. Slooff M.J. Meijer D.K. Groothuis G.M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G1008-G1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, mRNA levels in trophoblast cultures are not always found to closely correlate with transporter protein expression (28Evseenko D.A. Paxton J.W. Keelan J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Regul Integr Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R1357-R1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Collectively, caution must be exercised when utilizing only rodent models to predict clinical events, which in turn demonstrate the importance of developing human in vitro hepatocyte models for in vivo prediction. In the in vitro SC hepatocyte models, proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were found to reduce the absolute amount of MRP2/Mrp2 protein in both human and rat hepatocytes. However, we noticed a difference when comparing the cytokine-mediated transporter expression changes in SC human hepatocytes in this study to primary cultured human hepatocyte studies reported in the literature. In our study all three cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) suppressed both mRNA and protein expression of MRP2/ABCC2 post 24- and 48- h treatment. However, in two other studies using primary cultured human hepatocytes, IL-6 decreased both mRNA and protein expression of MRP2/ABCC2, whereas TNF-α did not change either mRNA or protein expression of MRP2/ABCC2 (10Le Vee M. Gripon P. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Vee M.L. Lecureur V. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab.

Dispos. 2009; 37: 2228-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the studies using non-SC human hepatocytes (10Le Vee M. Gripon P. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Vee M.L. Lecureur V. Stieger B. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2009; 37: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), TNF-α and IL-1β decreased BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA expression, IL-1β also decreased BSEP/ABCB11 protein expression, and the effect of TNF-α on BSEP/ABCB11 protein expression was not assessed. In contrast, IL-6 did not alter BSEP/ABCB11 mRNA expression. The discrepancies between primary cultured human hepatocytes and SC human hepatocytes manifested in this study might merit further investigation to illustrate which in vitro culture condition best represents the in vivo transporter expression changes. In summary, using a combination of real-time PCR and LC-MS/MS-mediated absolute protein quantification, we have shown that proinflammatory cytokines significantly affect the expression of hepatobiliary transporters in SC hepatocytes and LPS-treated rats. The noteworthy findings include opposing changes in mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that both pre- and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms exist. The agreement of transporter regulation in vitro in SC rat hepatocytes and in vivo in LPS-treated rats during the ARP emphasizes the potential utility of the SC hepatocyte model for in vivo prediction. Furthermore, the difference in BSEP/Bsep regulation between SC rat and human hepatocytes might reflect differences in the response of species-dependent signing pathways. Additional investigations are needed to further elucidate the in vitro-in vivo correlation and the complicated regulation during chronic inflammation. We thank Drs. James Polli, Larissa M.

Phosphorylation of an aspartate residue in the receiver domain, usually via phosphotransfer from a cognate histidine kinase, stabilizes the active conformation. Many of the available structures of inactive OmpR/PhoB family proteins exhibit extensive interfaces between the N-terminal receiver and C-terminal DNA-binding domains. These interfaces invariably involve the α4-β5-α5 face of the receiver domain, the locus of the largest differences between inactive and active conformations and the surface that mediates dimerization of receiver domains in the active state.

Analysis of phosphotransfer from small molecule phosphodonors has revealed large differences in autophosphorylation rates among OmpR/PhoB RRs.

Such differences are not observed between autophosphorylation rates of full-length and isolated receiver domains of a RR that lacks interdomain interfaces, and they are not observed in histidine kinase-mediated phosphotransfer. These findings suggest that domain interfaces restrict receiver domain conformational dynamics, stabilizing an inactive conformation that is catalytically incompetent for phosphotransfer from small molecule phosphodonors. Inhibition of phosphotransfer by domain interfaces provides an explanation for the observation that some RRs cannot be phosphorylated by small molecule phosphodonors in vitro and provides a potential mechanism for insulating some RRs from small molecule-mediated phosphorylation in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2009355006,"A large set of chemokines is highly up-regulated in human chondrocytes in response to IL-1β (Sandell, L. J., Xing, X., Franz, C., Davies, S., Chang, L. W., and Patra, D. (2008) Osteoarthr. Cartil. 16, 1560–1571). To investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, deletion constructs of selected chemokine gene promoters, the human CCL3 (MIP-1α) and CCL4 (MIP-1β), were transfected into human chondrocytes with or without IL-1β. The results show that an IL-1β-responsive element is located between bp −300 and −140 of the CCL3 promoter and between bp −222 and −100 of the CCL4 promoter. Because both of these elements contain CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) motifs, the function of C/EBPβ was examined. IL-1β stimulated the expression of C/EBPβ, and the direct binding of C/EBPβ to the C/EBPβ motif was confirmed by EMSA and ChIP analyses. The −300 bp CCL3 promoter and −222 bp CCL4 promoter were strongly up-regulated by co-transfection with the C/EBPβ expression vector. Mutation of the C/EBPβ motif and reduction of C/EBPβ expression by siRNA decreased the up-regulation. Additionally, another cytokine-related transcription factor, NF-κB, was also shown to be involved in the up-regulation of chemokines in response to IL-1β, and the binding site was identified. The regulation of C/EBPβ and NF-κB was confirmed by the inhibition by C/EBPβ and NF-κB and by transfection with C/EBPβ and NF-κB expression vectors in the presence or absence of IL-1β. Taken together, our results suggest that C/EBPβ and NF-κB are both involved in the IL-1β-responsive up-regulation of chemokine genes in human chondrocytes. Time course experiments indicated that C/EBPβ gradually and steadily induces chemokine up-regulation, whereas NF-κB activity was highest at the early stage of chemokine up-regulation.

IntroductionChemokines are associated with several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neuroinflammation, cancer, and HIV-associated diseases (1Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). As mediators of cell recruitment, chemokines are known to be important in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), 2The abbreviations used are: OAosteoarthritisC/EBPβCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinIKK-NBDcell-permeable NEMO binding domainLAPliver-enriched transcriptional activator proteinsLIPliver-enriched inhibitory proteinIPimmunoprecipitation. inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and transplant rejection (1Gerard C.

Dis. 2004; 63: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Chemokines are a specific class of cytokines that classically mediate chemoattraction (chemotaxis) between cells. However, the production and function of chemokines in organs and tissues have recently been recognized, and knock-out of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR2 suggests a role in development and cell senescence (3Ma Q.

Chemokines have similar protein structures, being 8–10 kDa, with two major subclasses having conserved cysteine residues either adjacent (CC) or separated by one amino acid (CXC) (2Haringman J.J.

We have previously shown that C/EBPβ is associated with IL-1β-induced and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced down-regulation of matrix genes in chondrocytes and the repression of cartilage gene expression in non-cartilaginous tissues (22Okazaki K.

Biochem. 2006; 97: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the roles of C/EBPβ and NF-κB in the up-regulation of two chemokine genes, CCL3 (MIP-1α; macrophage inflammatory protein 1α) and CCL4 (MIP-1β), in human chondrocytes in response to IL-1β.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate a critical role for C/EBPβ in the increased expression of chemokine genes in response to IL-1β in human chondrocytes. We studied in detail the regulation of two representative chemokines that are known to be increased in osteoarthritis and many other inflammatory conditions, CCL3 and CCL4. We also show the cooperative regulation of these genes by both C/EBPβ and NF-κB that is both time- and function-dependent. We conclude from these data that C/EBPβ is involved in constitutive regulation of chemokine genes and is also responsive to IL-1β. From this work on chemokine gene stimulation and our previous work on extracellular matrix gene suppression by C/EBPβ, we hypothesize that C/EBPβ is one of the most important regulators of gene activity in chondrocytes in response to IL-1β. In fact, C/EBPβ may be one of the pivotal regulators of chondrocyte function in that we have shown that C/EBPβ is responsible for the suppression of cartilage matrix genes in non-cartilaginous tissues (25Okazaki K. Yu H. Davies S.R. Imamura T. Sandell L.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and Kawaguchi and co-workers (44Hirata M. Kugimiya F. Fukai A. Ohba S. Kawamura N. Ogasawara T. Kawasaki Y. Saito T. Yano F. Ikeda T. Nakamura K. Chung U.I. Kawaguchi H. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have shown that C/EBPβ is critical for chondrocyte hypertrophy, where it increases type X collagen and MMP-13 (matrix metalloproteinase 13), suppresses type II collagen synthesis, and activates p57kip2. This group also showed that removal of C/EBPβ protects against osteoarthritis.In addition to C/EBPβ, we demonstrate a complementary role for the classic proinflammatory mediator, NF-κB. Like C/EBPβ, NF-κB activity is increased by IL-1β; however, in contrast to C/EBPβ, the increase in NF-κB activity is transient. Fig. 13 demonstrates the timing and functional activity of each transcription factor. Considering the time course of expression of CCL3 and the gradual increase of C/EBPβ binding to DNA, we suggest that C/EBPβ is involved in the up-regulation of chemokine genes over time, especially for the regulation of chemokine genes like CCL3, which are induced more slowly and where the mRNA was gradually and steadily increased, not reaching peak expression even in the 24-h observation period. In contrast, NF-κB appears to be involved in the up-regulation of chemokines in the early stage, with involvement gradually decreasing in the late stage. In CCL4, which was up-regulated by 4 h but then quickly decreased during the remaining time period, NF-κB is probably more important than C/EBPβ. In addition, the level of gene expression is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in eukaryotic cells, including fibroblasts and chondrocytes (14Hao S. Baltimore D. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 45Fukui N. Ikeda Y. Ohnuki T. Hikita A. Tanaka S. Yamane S. Suzuki R. Sandell L.J. Ochi T. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2009; 10: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), the expression of genes like CCL4 is also highly regulated by mRNA stability.We showed that the IL-1β-responsive elements of CCL3 and CCL4 promoters have C/EBPβ binding sites, and co-transfection with C/EBPβ could enhance the promoter activity. Within the IL-1β-responsive elements of these genes were also NF-κB-binding sites. Of note is that the increase in gene expression due to C/EBPβ was greater than that induced by the same concentration of IKK2. Because the NF-κB inhibitor, IKK-NBD, inhibited only about 30% of the CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA expression, C/EBPβ could be the more important regulator of the expression of chemokine genes in this cell type.Co-regulation by NF-κB and C/EBPβ was recently shown in several genes in different cells (4Acosta J.C.

They also showed that C/EBPβ regulated the IL-8 basal transcriptional activity but not NF-κB, which is consistent with our data on the IL-1β effect in chondrocytes. Gil and colleagues (4Acosta J.C. O'Loghlen A. Banito A. Guijarro M.V. Augert A. Raguz S. Fumagalli M. Da Costa M. Brown C. Popov N. Takatsu Y. Melamed J. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Bernard D. Hernando E. Gil J.

They demonstrated a function of NF-κB and C/EBPβ in controlling the secretory program associated with cell senescence, although they did not investigate the mechanism.Studies have shown that the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-κB is involved in regulation of some lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated chemokines in human monocytic cells (17Lakshmanan U.

However, we show in chondrocytes that, of the NF-κB subunits, c-Rel mRNA was increased more than p65 with IL-1β stimulation, and the computational analysis in chemokine genes CCL3 and CCL4 showed that c-Rel binding sites were predicted in the IL-1β-responsive elements. Ohashi and colleagues (49Lu Y.C. Kim I. Lye E. Shen F. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Gerondakis S. Akira S. Gaffen S.L. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P.S. J.

In multiple myeloma, AML-1A (acute myeloid leukemia 1A) and AML-1B (also known as Runx1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1)) are principle regulators of CCL3 (26Choi S.J. Oba T. Callander N.S. Jelinek D.F. Roodman G.D. Blood. 2003; 101: 3778-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although C/EBPβ was later found to be important (50Pal R. Janz M. Galson D.L. Gries M. Li S.

In our experiments, Runx1 transfection did not increase gene expression. 3Z. Zhang and L. J. Sandell, unpublished results. C/EBPβ is thought to be responsible for regulating growth, proliferation, and antiapoptotic responses by regulating the expression of other key transcription factors. In an early publication, Grove and Plumb (20Grove M. Plumb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5276-5289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that C/EBP, NF-κB, and cEts family members were important in the LPS-induced stimulation of CCL3.Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β are increased in synovial fluid in joint diseases, such as OA and rheumatoid arthritis, and can induce cartilage damage and bone resorption. Chemokines function in the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, immature dendritic cells, B cells, and activated T cells (51Borzì R.M. Mazzetti I. Cattini L. Uguccioni M. Baggiolini M. Facchini A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, chemokines also have functions at the individual tissue level as it has been reported that the CXC family of chemokines are important in the regulation of angiogenesis, and CCL2, CCL3, and CCR2 stimulate osteoclastogenesis (52Binder N.B.

In summary, the data presented here show that chondrocytes react in a cell-specific manner to IL-1β, utilizing C/EBPβ and NF-κB in a combinatorial regulation of chemokine gene expression. The activity of C/EBPβ is augmented by a transient increase in activity of NF-κB, and both transcription factors act independently on the chemokine genes, CCL3 and CCL4. These studies provide the foundation for the control of chemokine gene expression in chronic joint disease. IntroductionChemokines are associated with several diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neuroinflammation, cancer, and HIV-associated diseases (1Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). As mediators of cell recruitment, chemokines are known to be important in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA), 2The abbreviations used are: OAosteoarthritisC/EBPβCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinIKK-NBDcell-permeable NEMO binding domainLAPliver-enriched transcriptional activator proteinsLIPliver-enriched inhibitory proteinIPimmunoprecipitation. inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and transplant rejection (1Gerard C.

Dis. 2004; 63: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Chemokines are a specific class of cytokines that classically mediate chemoattraction (chemotaxis) between cells. However, the production and function of chemokines in organs and tissues have recently been recognized, and knock-out of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR2 suggests a role in development and cell senescence (3Ma Q. Jones D. Borghesani P.R. Segal R.A. Nagasawa T. Kishimoto T. Bronson R.T. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9448-9453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 4Acosta J.C.

Oba Y. Roodman G.D. Blood. 2001; 97: 3349-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). There exist over 50 chemokine ligands and 20 G protein-coupled receptors (1Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Chemokines have similar protein structures, being 8–10 kDa, with two major subclasses having conserved cysteine residues either adjacent (CC) or separated by one amino acid (CXC) (2Haringman J.J. Ludikhuize J. Tak P.P. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2004; 63: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).IL-1β is an important cytokine in rheumatoid and osteoarthritic joint diseases. Generally, IL-1β is viewed as a catabolic factor for cartilage, inducing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix and reducing synthesis of the primary cartilage components type II collagen (COL2A1) and aggrecan (6Sandell L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2160074603,"We sought to identify an essential component of the TEAD4/VGLL4 transcription factor complex that controls vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in muscle. A yeast 2-hybrid screen was used to clone a novel component of the TEAD4 complex from a human heart cDNA library. We identified interferon response factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) and confirmed its presence in the TEAD4/VGLL4 complex in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian 2-hybrid assays. Coexpression of IRF2BP2 with TEAD4/VGLL4 or TEAD1 alone potently activated, whereas knockdown of IRF2BP2 reduced, VEGFA expression in C(2)C(12) muscle cells. Thus, IRF2BP2 is required to activate VEGFA expression. In mouse embryos, IRF2BP2 was ubiquitously expressed but became progressively enriched in the fetal heart, skeletal muscles, and lung. Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of IRF2BP2 mRNA in adult human heart and skeletal muscles, but immunoblot analysis showed low levels of IRF2BP2 protein in skeletal muscle, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of IRF2BP2 expression. IRF2BP2 protein levels are markedly increased by ischemia in skeletal and cardiac muscle compared to normoxic controls. IRF2BP2 is a novel ischemia-induced coactivator of VEGFA expression that may contribute to revascularization of ischemic cardiac and skeletal muscles."

Kindlins interact with the membrane-distal NxxY motif, which is distinct from the talin-binding site within the membrane-proximal NxxY motif. The Tyr residues in both motifs can be phosphorylated, and it has been suggested that this modification of the membrane-proximal NxxY motif negatively regulates interaction with the talin head domain. However, the influence of Tyr phosphorylation of the membrane-distal NxxY motif on kindlin binding is unknown. Using mutational analyses and phosphorylated peptides, we show that phosphorylation of the membrane-distal NITY759 motif in the β3 CT disrupts kindlin-2 recognition. Phosphorylation of this membrane-distal Tyr also disables the ability of kindlin-2 to coactivate the integrin. In direct binding studies, peptides corresponding to the non-phosphorylated β3 CT interacted well with kindlin-2, whereas the Tyr759-phosphorylated peptide failed to bind kindlin-2 with measurable affinity. These observations indicate that transitions between the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated states of the integrin β3 CT determine reactivity with kindlin-2 and govern the role of kindlin-2 in regulating integrin activation.

Silkworm lethality was not rescued by antibiotic treatment, and heat-killed bacteria were also lethal. Heat-killed bacteria of mutant P. gingivalis strains lacking virulence factors also killed silkworms. Silkworms died after injection of peptidoglycans purified from P. gingivalis (pPG), and pPG toxicity was blocked by treatment with mutanolysin, a peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme. pPG induced silkworm hemolymph melanization at the same dose as that required to kill the animal. pPG injection increased caspase activity in silkworm tissues. pPG-induced silkworm death was delayed by injecting melanization-inhibiting reagents (a serine protease inhibitor and 1-phenyl-2-thiourea), antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine, glutathione, and catalase), and a caspase inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO). Thus, pPG induces excessive activation of the innate immune response, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death in the host tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2037078698,"Background Bacterial non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) have attracted considerable attention due to their ubiquitous nature and contribution to numerous cellular processes including survival, adaptation and pathogenesis. Existing computational approaches for identifying bacterial sRNAs demonstrate varying levels of success and there remains considerable room for improvement. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have proposed a transcriptional signal-based computational method to identify intergenic sRNA transcriptional units (TUs) in completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Our sRNAscanner tool uses position weight matrices derived from experimentally defined E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA promoter and rho-independent terminator signals to identify intergenic sRNA TUs through sliding window based genome scans. Analysis of genomes representative of twelve species suggested that sRNAscanner demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to sRNAPredict2, the best performing bioinformatics tool available presently. However, each algorithm yielded substantial numbers of known and uncharacterized hits that were unique to one or the other tool only. sRNAscanner identified 118 novel putative intergenic sRNA genes in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, none of which were flagged by sRNAPredict2. Candidate sRNA locations were compared with available deep sequencing libraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated RNA purified from a second Typhimurium strain (Sittka et al. (2008) PLoS Genetics 4: e1000163). Sixteen potential novel sRNAs computationally predicted and detected in deep sequencing libraries were selected for experimental validation by Northern analysis using total RNA isolated from bacteria grown under eleven different growth conditions. RNA bands of expected sizes were detected in Northern blots for six of the examined candidates. Furthermore, the 5′-ends of these six Northern-supported sRNA candidates were successfully mapped using 5′-RACE analysis. Conclusions/Significance We have developed, computationally examined and experimentally validated the sRNAscanner algorithm. Data derived from this study has successfully identified six novel S. Typhimurium sRNA genes. In addition, the computational specificity analysis we have undertaken suggests that ∼40% of sRNAscanner hits with high cumulative sum of scores represent genuine, undiscovered sRNA genes. Collectively, these data strongly support the utility of sRNAscanner and offer a glimpse of its potential to reveal large numbers of sRNA genes that have to date defied identification. sRNAscanner is available from: http://bicmku.in:8081/sRNAscanner or http://cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in/sRNAscanner/."

Among many families of PRRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) have been described as central elements in triggering innate immune responses (1Franchi L. Eigenbrod T. Muñoz-Planillo R. Nuñez G. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 2Medzhitov R. Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar).TLRs and NLRs have been shown to activate distinct biochemical pathways, resulting in diverse mechanisms of resistance to pathogens. These mechanisms may act independently or may cooperate to the resolution of infections. TLRs primarily activate transcriptional factors such as NF-κB and IFN-responsive factors (IRF) (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6573) Google Scholar, 4Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar), culminating in the production of effector molecules such as inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The contribution of these pathways to resistance to infection is manifold: recruitment of other inflammatory cells, production of cytotoxic and cytostatic molecules, and activation of adaptive immune response. NLRs, on the other hand, although also capable of activating NF-κB, have a peculiar ability of initiating an inflammatory response through caspase-1 activation via the assembly of a multiprotein complex called inflammasome (5Inohara N. Ogura Y. Fontalba A. Gutierrez O. Pons F. Crespo J. Fukase K. Inamura S. Kusumoto S. Hashimoto M. Foster S.J. Moran A.P. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nuñez G. J. Biol.

Besides the well known role of caspase-1 on IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion, this protease has also been described to induce macrophages death by a process known as pyroptosis (6Inohara Chamaillard McDonald C. Nuñez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Importantly, pyroptosis has been ascribed as a mechanism of host immune response against certain pathogens, such as Salmonella, Legionella, Pseudomonas, and Shigella, although it is still not clear how pyroptosis effectively contributes for pathogen clearance (7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).The recognition of PAMPs by TLRs and NLRs occur independently. However, there are cases where a certain PAMP can be recognized by both TLRs and NLRs. Flagellin, the monomeric subunit of flagella present in several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria is a good example of this redundancy. Extracellular flagellin is recognized by transmembrane TLR5 (8Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A.

It was recently demonstrated that both Nlrc4 and Naip5 are required for signaling in response to the 35-amino acid of a peptide located on the C-terminal D0 domains of Legionella pneumophila and Salmonella typhimurium flagellins and that this region of flagellin is distinct from the D1 domain sensed by TLR5 (11Lightfield K.L.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Importantly, TLR5 engagement by flagellin leads to NF-κB activation, whereas the recognition of flagellin by Naip5 and Nlrc4 induces the assembly of inflammasomes with the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1 (7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Regardless the particularities between intracellular and extracellular receptor pathways, the relative contribution of TLR5 and Naip5/Nlrc4 inflammasomes to host resistance to infection is still not clear. Here, by using a purified flagellin, we defined an additional anti-pathogen effector mechanism operating through Naip5 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes that was previously associated with TLR pathway (14Brightbill H.D.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Interestingly, distinct from extracellular flagellin, iNOS activation by intracellular flagellin is completely abrogated in the absence of caspase-1 but not with neutralization of IL-1β and/or IL-18. Importantly, this effect is preserved in Myd88-deficient macrophage, ruling out the participation of TLR5. Together, our data indicated that by using distinct pathways, TLR and NLR systems can operate with a certain level of redundancy, which might improve the host resistance against infections.DISCUSSIONFlagellin is one of the rare protein structures sensed by the innate immune system and can activate both TLR and NLR receptors.

Interestingly, TLR5 seems to broadly recognize flagellated bacteria, whereas sensing of Nlrc4 and Naip5 depends on specialized transport systems present in virulent bacteria, such as the type III secretion systems of Salmonella (10Franchi L.

These secretion systems allow the delivery of bacterial products directly into the host cell cytoplasm. In experimental models, Nlrc4- and Naip5-induced caspase-1 activation can be achieved by delivering purified flagellin into the host cell cytosol by means of cationic liposomes or by transducing cells with appropriated gene-expression systems (10Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozören N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Núñez G. Nat.

Consistent with this view, TLR5 stimulation primarily leads to the activation of microbicidal effector mechanisms that are supposedly effective in controlling less aggressive, non-pathogenic bacterial infection. In contrast, a more dramatic effector mechanism consisting of a Nlrc4/Naip5-caspase-1-induce inflammatory cell death is observed only in infections with virulent bacteria (7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Therefore, the existence of different PRRs capable of sensing the same agonist or different agonists present on the same pathogen is obviously beneficial to the host. The combined action of distinct, non-redundant, specialized responses should lead to a synergistic, more robust immunity against potential pathogens. Extracellular and intracellular recognition of flagellin induces such distinct macrophage responses. High levels of IL-6 were observed only with FLA-BS, whereas IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis were detected only with FLA-BSDot (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). However, as the expression of PRRs is not ubiquitous and, therefore, not all host cells are equally prepared to properly recognize and handle potential pathogens, it should be interesting for the host immunity to have different PRR family sharing at least some microbicidal mechanisms.iNOS activation by TLRs can be considered one of the major effector mechanism for controlling intracellular pathogens (29Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). TLRs are able to recruit NF-κB and IRF transcription factors, both necessary to induce iNOS expression and activation (30Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J.

Carneiro L.A. Magalhaes J.G. Girardin S.E. Semin. Immunopathol. 2007; 29: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of a large repertoire of genes, including iNOS (33Tötemeyer S. Sheppard M. Lloyd A. Roper D. Dowson C. Underhill D. Murray P. Maskell D. Bryant C. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4804-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nlrps, Naip5, and Nlrc4 inflammasomes, on the other hand, mediate caspase-1 activation and the consequent IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and/or a programmed cell death called pyroptosis (1Franchi L.

Nlrc4 can bind directly to pro-caspase-1 via a CARD-CARD homotypic interaction, but the molecular partner(s) of Naip5 remains to be solved. Interesting, Naip5 do not participate in every function of the Nlrc4-inflammasome. Nlrc4 has been shown to be crucial in host defense for a number of pathogens such as Salmonella, Legionella, Pseudomonas, and Shigella, and its genetic defect cannot be substituted by a functional Naip5 (9–12, 17, 35–37). On the other hand, Naip5 is indispensable for the resistance to L. pneumophila infection (13Zamboni D.S. Kobayashi K.S. Kohlsdorf T. Ogura Y. Long E.M. Vance R.E. Kuida K. Mariathasan S. Dixit V.M. Flavell R.A. Dietrich W.F. Roy C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FLA-BSDot-induced iNOS expression was significantly reduced in Nlrc4-deficient macrophages and completely abolished in the absence of a functional Naip5 (Fig. 3). By using highly sensitive techniques such as real-time RT-PCR, we were able to detect a slight transcriptional induction of iNOS in the mice harboring a partially mutant A/J Naip5 allele and still significantly less when compared with Nlrc4-deficient macrophages. The partial functionality of Naip5 from A/J mice (11Lightfield K.L. Persson J. Brubaker S.W. Witte C.E. von Moltke J. Dunipace E.A. Henry T. Sun Y.H. Cado D. Dietrich W.F. Monack D.M. Tsolis R.M. Vance R.E. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) could account for the observed flagellin-dependent iNOS mRNA induction, an effect that possibly would not be observed in Naip5−/− mice. Another possible explanation for these results is that Naip5 plays an additional Nlrc4-independent role in the post-transcriptional regulation of iNOS.Importantly, we show here for the first time that, distinct from free flagellin, the activation of iNOS by cytosolic flagellin via Nlrc4/Naip5 is dependent on caspase-1 (Fig. 4). The genetic or pharmacological inactivation of caspase-1 resulted in the abrogation of iNOS protein and mRNA expression in response to FLA-BSDot. Caspase-1 promotes the release of IL-1β and IL-18, which in turn can activate iNOS (25Dinarello C.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). In fact, it was recently shown that IFN-γ- and TNF-α-induced iNOS activation in astrocytes and cerebral endothelial cells is dependent on caspase-1-mediated IL-1β secretion (38Jüttler E. Bonmann E. Spranger M. Kolb-Bachofen V. Suschek C.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 34: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, our data show that neutralization of IL-1β and/or IL-18 with specific antibodies resulted in a rather increased iNOS expression by FLA-BSDot, ruling out the requirement for these cytokines in flagellin-mediated iNOS up-regulation (Fig. 5). These observations are reinforced by the fact that myd88−/− macrophages are able to express iNOS in response to cytosolic flagellin (Fig. 6) besides their deficiency in both IL-1 and IL-18 receptor, signaling pathways. Also, the observed up-regulation of iNOS cannot be attributed to unspecific macrophage activation as anti-IL-1β- and anti-IL-18-neutralizing antibodies were not able to activate iNOS in the absence of flagellin (Fig. 5C). Moreover, anti-IL-1β and anti-IL-18 have no effect on IL-6 produced in response to FLA-BSDot, showing their particular involvement on iNOS modulation (supplemental Fig. 3). These data indicate that IL-1β and IL-18 are not required for iNOS activation in response to FLA-BSDot but do not discard their participation in some aspects of iNOS regulation.Because the iNOS promoter contains binding sites for NF-κB and IRF-1 (30Kamijo R.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), additional investigation is required to elucidate whether the up-regulation of iNOS by caspase-1 involves the activation of either or both transcription factors. Recently, it was demonstrated that IRF-1 and IRF-8 transcription factors seem to be regulated during Naip5 and Nlrc4-mediated sensing of L. pneumophila (39Fortier A. Doiron K. Saleh M. Grinstein S. Gros P. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 4794-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, these authors observed that, in the absence of flagellin, there is a defective activation of IL-12p40 and iNOS, the IRF-1 and IRF-8 transcriptional targets. Despite the clear evidences of Nlrc4 and Naip5-mediated caspase-1 and IRF-1/IRF-8 activation, it is not clear whether these events are correlated.Additionally, although Nlrc4 can directly interact and activate caspase-1 via its N-terminal CARD domain (40Poyet J.L.

Tschopp J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), the activation of caspase-1 by Naip5 possibly requires interaction with other proteins since Naip5 possesses a BIR domains, which for other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family members are known to interact with different proteins (42Mace P.D. Shirley S. Day C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2010; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Regardless of the possible interaction between Naip5 and Nlrc4 (13Zamboni D.S. Kobayashi K.S.

Immunol. 2008; 9: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), opening the possibility of interactions among Naip5 and other unknown proteins. Because multiple complexes containing more than one NLR member can be found within the same cell (34Ting J.P. Willingham S.B. Bergstralh D.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 43Bergsbaken T. Fink S.L. Cookson B.T. Nature Reviews. 2009; 7: 99-109Google Scholar), the sensing of cytosolic flagellin could lead to multiprotein complexes formation including Nlrc4, Naip5, caspase-1, IRF-1, IRF-8, or alternatively, to other NLR members and proteins involved in the activation of iNOS.Although there are still missing pieces in the Nlrc4 and Naip5 inflammasome complexes, their role in macrophage clearance of bacterial pathogens is clear. Defects on Nlrc4 or caspase-1 render macrophages susceptible to infections such as S. typhimurium (10Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozören N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N.

Because the same defects also lead to resistance to caspase-1-mediated cell death, pyroptosis seems to be the major effector mechanism to control these pathogens. However, the requirement of macrophage death during an infection and the relevance of pyroptosis in vivo are still matters of debate (7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this regard, a Naip5/Nlrc4-caspase-1-dependent caspase-7 activation and phagosome maturation responsible for the inhibition of bacteria replication (44Akhter A. Gavrilin M.A. Frantz L. Washington S. Ditty C. Limoli D. Day C. Sarkar A. Newland C. Butchar J. Marsh C.B. Wewers M.D. Tridandapani S. Kanneganti T.D. Amer A.O. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000361Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was recently described.Here, we are describing a novel pathway for iNOS activation orchestrated by the Naip5 and Nlrc4 and operated through caspase-1, adding a new effector mechanism mediated by inflammasomes. Importantly, this pathway cooperate with TLR-induced NO production for the control of L. pneumophila since pharmacological inhibition of iNOS renders higher susceptibility of both WT C57BL/6 and myd88−/− macrophages to flagellated L. pneumophila but not to flagellin-mutant bacteria (supplemental Fig. 4). The role of iNOS to the resistance against L. pneumophila was previously demonstrated (45Summersgill J.T. Powell L.A. Buster B.L. Miller R.D. Ramirez J.A. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 52: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 46Skerrett S.J. Martin T.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3236-3243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, iNOS seem not to be involved in the control of L. pneumophila by macrophages from Naip5-deficient A/J mice (47Gebran S.J. Yamamoto Y. Newton C. Klein T.W. Friedman H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), corroborating our data showing that the TLR-independent iNOS activation is observed only in the presence of functional flagellin. It remains to be determined how caspase-1-mediated cellular events, such as pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion, caspase-7, and iNOS activation cooperate to the control of infections.

Among many families of PRRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) have been described as central elements in triggering innate immune responses (1Franchi L. Eigenbrod T. Muñoz-Planillo R. Nuñez G. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 2Medzhitov R. Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar).TLRs and NLRs have been shown to activate distinct biochemical pathways, resulting in diverse mechanisms of resistance to pathogens. These mechanisms may act independently or may cooperate to the resolution of infections. TLRs primarily activate transcriptional factors such as NF-κB and IFN-responsive factors (IRF) (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6573) Google Scholar, 4Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar), culminating in the production of effector molecules such as inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The contribution of these pathways to resistance to infection is manifold: recruitment of other inflammatory cells, production of cytotoxic and cytostatic molecules, and activation of adaptive immune response. NLRs, on the other hand, although also capable of activating NF-κB, have a peculiar ability of initiating an inflammatory response through caspase-1 activation via the assembly of a multiprotein complex called inflammasome (5Inohara N.

Besides the well known role of caspase-1 on IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and secretion, this protease has also been described to induce macrophages death by a process known as pyroptosis (6Inohara Chamaillard McDonald C. Nuñez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Importantly, pyroptosis has been ascribed as a mechanism of host immune response against certain pathogens, such as Salmonella, Legionella, Pseudomonas, and Shigella, although it is still not clear how pyroptosis effectively contributes for pathogen clearance (7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).The recognition of PAMPs by TLRs and NLRs occur independently. However, there are cases where a certain PAMP can be recognized by both TLRs and NLRs. Flagellin, the monomeric subunit of flagella present in several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria is a good example of this redundancy. Extracellular flagellin is recognized by transmembrane TLR5 (8Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar), whereas cytosolic sensing of flagellin requires Naip5 (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein 5) and Nlrc4 (NLR family CARD (caspase activation recruitment domain) domain-containing 4), also called Ipaf (ICE-(IL-1-converting enzyme) protease activating factor), both members of the NLR family (9Amer A.

It was recently demonstrated that both Nlrc4 and Naip5 are required for signaling in response to the 35-amino acid of a peptide located on the C-terminal D0 domains of Legionella pneumophila and Salmonella typhimurium flagellins and that this region of flagellin is distinct from the D1 domain sensed by TLR5 (11Lightfield K.L. Persson J. Brubaker S.W. Witte C.E. von Moltke J. Dunipace E.A. Henry T. Sun Y.H. Cado D. Dietrich W.F. Monack D.M. Tsolis R.M. Vance R.E. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Importantly, TLR5 engagement by flagellin leads to NF-κB activation, whereas the recognition of flagellin by Naip5 and Nlrc4 induces the assembly of inflammasomes with the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-1 (7Bortoluci K.R. Medzhitov R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Regardless the particularities between intracellular and extracellular receptor pathways, the relative contribution of TLR5 and Naip5/Nlrc4 inflammasomes to host resistance to infection is still not clear. Here, by using a purified flagellin, we defined an additional anti-pathogen effector mechanism operating through Naip5 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes that was previously associated with TLR pathway (14Brightbill H.D.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 66-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Interestingly, distinct from extracellular flagellin, iNOS activation by intracellular flagellin is completely abrogated in the absence of caspase-1 but not with neutralization of IL-1β and/or IL-18. Importantly, this effect is preserved in Myd88-deficient macrophage, ruling out the participation of TLR5. Together, our data indicated that by using distinct pathways, TLR and NLR systems can operate with a certain level of redundancy, which might improve the host resistance against infections."
https://openalex.org/W1968392286,"H-Ras is a binary switch that is activated by multiple co-factors and triggers several key cellular pathways one of which is MAPK. The specificity and magnitude of downstream activation is achieved by the spatio-temporal organization of the active H-Ras in the plasma membrane. Upon activation, the GTP bound H-Ras binds to Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and becomes transiently immobilized in short-lived nanoclusters on the plasma membrane from which the signal is propagated to Raf. In the current study we show that stabilizing the H-Ras-Gal-1 interaction, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), leads to prolonged immobilization of H-Ras.GTP in the plasma membrane which was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and increased signal out-put to the MAPK module. EM measurements of Raf recruitment to the H-Ras.GTP nanoclusters demonstrated that the enhanced signaling observed in the BiFC stabilized H-Ras.GTP nanocluster was attributed to increased H-Ras immobilization rather than to an increase in Raf recruitment. Taken together these data demonstrate that the magnitude of the signal output from a GTP-bound H-Ras nanocluster is proportional to its stability."

However, costs and unresponsiveness to therapy in a sizeable proportion of patients limit their use, making it imperative to identify new targets for drug development programs. Here we investigated the melanocortin-receptor type 3 (MC(3)) pathway. Gene-deficient mice were subjected to a model of serum-transfer-induced arthritis and joints analyzed for gene expression (cytokines, MCs) and morphology. Pharmacological analyses were also conducted in this model. Osteoclastogenesis was studied from bone marrow cells. Mc(3)(-/-) mice displayed an exacerbated inflammatory arthritis, associated with prominent bone erosion and higher articular expression of Rankl. Osteoclastogenesis studied from Mc(3)(-/-) bone marrow cells revealed a higher degree of responsiveness to Rankl, linked to prolonged NF-κB activation compared to wild types. Up-regulation of a discrete set of inflammatory genes, including Il-1β, Il-6, and Nos2, was measured in Mc(3)(-/-) mice, and a marked up-regulation of joint Mc(3) accompanied arthritis resolution in wild-type mice. Administration of an MC(3) agonist, D[Trp8]-γ-MSH, attenuated disease incidence and severity in wild-type but not Mc(3)(-/-) mice. Overall, these findings identify MC(3)-mediated signaling as a beneficial pathway in experimental arthritis; hence this receptor is a novel target for the development of therapeutics for arthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2132633508,"Naturally occurring phytoferritin is a heteropolymer consisting of two different H-type subunits, H-1 and H-2. Prior to this study, however, the function of the two subunits in oxidative deposition of iron in ferritin was unknown. The data show that, upon aerobic addition of 48–200 Fe2+/shell to apoferritin, iron oxidation occurs only at the diiron ferroxidase center of recombinant H1 (rH-1). In addition to the diiron ferroxidase mechanism, such oxidation is catalyzed by the extension peptide (a specific domain found in phytoferritin) of rH-2, because the H-1 subunit is able to remove Fe3+ from the center to the inner cavity better than the H-2 subunit. These findings support the idea that the H-1 and H-2 subunits play different roles in iron mineralization in protein. Interestingly, at medium iron loading (200 irons/shell), wild-type (WT) soybean seed ferritin (SSF) exhibits a stronger activity in catalyzing iron oxidation (1.10 ± 0.13 μm iron/subunit/s) than rH-1 (0.59 ± 0.07 μm iron/subunit/s) and rH-2 (0.48 ± 0.04 μm iron/subunit/s), demonstrating that a synergistic interaction exists between the H-1 and H-2 subunits in SSF during iron mineralization. Such synergistic interaction becomes considerably stronger at high iron loading (400 irons/shell) as indicated by the observation that the iron oxidation activity of WT SSF is ∼10 times larger than those of rH-1 and rH-2.

In addition to the diiron ferroxidase mechanism, such oxidation is catalyzed by the extension peptide (a specific domain found in phytoferritin) of rH-2, because the H-1 subunit is able to remove Fe3+ from the center to the inner cavity better than the H-2 subunit. These findings support the idea that the H-1 and H-2 subunits play different roles in iron mineralization in protein. Interestingly, at medium iron loading (200 irons/shell), wild-type (WT) soybean seed ferritin (SSF) exhibits a stronger activity in catalyzing iron oxidation (1.10 ± 0.13 μm iron/subunit/s) than rH-1 (0.59 ± 0.07 μm iron/subunit/s) and rH-2 (0.48 ± 0.04 μm iron/subunit/s), demonstrating that a synergistic interaction exists between the H-1 and H-2 subunits in SSF during iron mineralization. Such synergistic interaction becomes considerably stronger at high iron loading (400 irons/shell) as indicated by the observation that the iron oxidation activity of WT SSF is ∼10 times larger than those of rH-1 and rH-2. This helps elucidate the widespread occurrence of heteropolymeric ferritins in plants. Iron and oxygen chemistry, in a variety of non-heme diiron proteins, has drawn considerable attention because of their various roles in reversible O2 binding for respiration in hemerythrin, oxidation and desaturation of organic substrates in methane monooxygenase, R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, stearoyl-acyl carrier protein Δ-9 desaturase, as well as the detoxification and concentration of iron in Dps and ferritin (1Harrison P.M.

Diiron centers have similar structural motifs containing a combination of carboxylate and histidine ligands that either bind or bridge the two metal ions of the dinuclear active site. Although the dinuclear centers of the protein are very similar in structure, each of the proteins fulfills a different biological function that appears to be mediated by the nature of the first and second coordination sphere of the diiron center. Ferritins are a special class of diiron proteins that play a role in both iron housekeeping and iron detoxification. They are widely distributed in animals, plants, and bacteria (but not in yeast) and are typically composed of 24 similar or identical subunits assembled into a shell-like structure. In vertebrates, ferritins consist of two types of subunits, H and L, respectively. The two types have about 55% identity in amino acid sequence. The ratio of the two kinds of subunits in the native protein varies according to the nature and the function of the tissue (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar, 2Le Brun N.E. Crow A. Murphy M.E. Mauk A.G. Moore G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The H-type subunit of vertebrate ferritins contains a dinuclear iron “ferroxidase site” at which the rapid oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by dioxygen occurs; subsequent hydrolysis of the Fe3+ and its migration away from the ferroxidase site leads to formation of the Fe3+ mineral core. Unlike the H-subunit, the L-subunit lacks a ferroxidase center but has a greater negative charge; in the assembled ferritin, the negative charge presents itself on the interior surface as clusters of acidic residues (Glu and Asp) that comprise the mineral nucleation site (6Crichton R.R. Herbas A. Chavez-Alba O. Roland F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 567-574Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Ferritins from lower vertebrates, such as bullfrogs and fish, contain a third subunit type, named the M(H′) chain, which harbors the residues forming both the ferroxidase center and the nucleation site (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar, 7Dickey L.F. Sreedharan S. Theil E.C. Didsbury J.R. Wang Y.H. Kaufman R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7901-7907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, two different types of ferritins are found in bacteria, often within the same cell. These are the bacterioferritins and the bacterial ferritins, which are chemically, structurally, and functionally different. All subunits from these two ferritins are of the H chain type; they are not particularly similar to eukaryotic H-chain ferritins in terms of overall sequence similarity (∼20% identity), but conserved within them are some of the key residues that constitute the catalytic ferroxidase center (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar, 2Le Brun N.E. Crow A. Murphy M.E. Mauk A.G. Moore G.R. Biochim. Biophys.

First, only the H-type subunit has been identified in phytoferritin thus far, and it shares ∼40% sequence identity with the animal H-subunit. Second, the H-type subunit in mature phytoferritin contains a specific extension peptide (EP) 4The abbreviations used are: EPextension peptideEP-1extension peptide of 26.5-kDa subunit of soybean seed ferritinEP-2extension peptide of 28.0-kDa subunit of soybean seed ferritinrH-2recombinant soybean seed H-2 chain ferritinrH-1recombinant soybean seed H-1 chain ferritinrH-3recombinant soybean seed H-3 chain ferritinrH-1H-2recombinant H-1 and H-2 soybean seed ferritinPSFpea seed ferritinSSFsoybean seed ferritinapoSSFapo-soybean seed ferritinDLSdynamic light scattering. at its N-terminal sequence (8Masuda T.

Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of soybean seed ferritin (SSF), each EP domain is composed of ∼30 amino acid residues. The crystal structure of recombinant SSF shows that the EP is located on the exterior surface of protein and stabilizes the entire oligomeric conformation of phytoferritin by its interaction with a neighboring subunit on the shell surface (12Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Mikami B. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4049-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent studies of our group reveal the role of the EP during iron oxidative deposition in phytoferritin as the second binding and ferroxidase center that contributes to mineralization of the iron core at high iron loading of ferritin (>48 irons/shell) (13Li C. Fu X. Qi X. Hu X. Chasteen N.D. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16743-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the EP exhibits a significant serine protease-like activity (14Fu X. Deng J. Yang H. Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Zhao G. Biochem. J. 2010; 427: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is responsible for protein autodegradation during seed germination (14Fu X. Deng J. Yang H. Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T.

Associated with the degradation is faster iron release from ferritin to meet the requirements of seedling growth (14Fu X. Deng J. Yang H. Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Zhao G. Biochem. J. 2010; 427: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Third, naturally occurring phytoferritin is usually composed of two different H-type subunits. For example, ferritin from soybean and pea seeds consists of H-1 and H-2 subunits sharing ∼80% amino acid sequence identity (8Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19575-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Zhao G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochimie. 2009; 91: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This specific feature of phytoferritin raises the inevitable question of what functions the two subunits serve in phytoferritin. Addressing this question is integral to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of phytoferritin. extension peptide extension peptide of 26.5-kDa subunit of soybean seed ferritin extension peptide of 28.0-kDa subunit of soybean seed ferritin recombinant soybean seed H-2 chain ferritin recombinant soybean seed H-1 chain ferritin recombinant soybean seed H-3 chain ferritin recombinant H-1 and H-2 soybean seed ferritin pea seed ferritin soybean seed ferritin apo-soybean seed ferritin dynamic light scattering. The present study is the first to investigate the roles of the H-1 and H-2 subunits in SSF for oxidative deposition of iron in protein. At low iron loading of apoferritin (≤48 irons/protein shell, 2 irons/subunit), no protein association occurs with both recombinant soybean seed H-1 (rH-1) and H-2 (rH-2) ferritins, indicating that iron oxidation occurs only through the diiron ferroxidase mechanism (13Li C. Fu X. Qi X. Hu X. Chasteen N.D. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16743-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Once the binding capacity of the 24 ferroxidase centers (48 irons/shell) is exceeded, the oxidative addition of Fe2+ to the aporH-2 to form Fe3+ causes protein aggregation, whereas such protein association is not observed in its analog, rH-1, until the amount of added iron is increased to 300 Fe2+/protein shell. This finding suggests that the H-1 subunit has considerably higher regeneration activity (indicative of the ability to turn Fe3+ over from the diiron ferroxidase centers to the inner cavity) compared with H-2. Indeed, regeneration activity measurements show that rH-1 removes Fe3+ from the ferroxidase center to the inner cavity much faster than rH-2. However, rH-2 is able to transfer iron from the outer surface to inside the protein better than rH-1. Thus, the two subunits exhibit different mechanisms to cope with iron oxidative deposition in protein at high iron flux into ferritin: the diiron ferroxidation mechanism for rH-1 versus the EP oxidation mechanism for rH-2. Moreover, a combination of H-1 and H-2 subunits in WT SSF results in stronger catalytic activity in iron mineralization than that of each of the two recombinant proteins because of a synergistic interaction between the two subunits. SSF was purified as recently described (8Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19575-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Li C. Fu X. Qi X.

Shikata M. Utsumi S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 56: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for rH-2 was constructed by inserting the H-2 cDNA into the NcoI/BamHI site of pET21d using a PCR-based method. The constructs were then introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The positive transformants of each construct were grown at 37 °C on LB medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter carbenicillin, and protein expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the cell density reached an A600 of 0.6 (18Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Ezure T. Suzuki T. Kobayashi S. Shikata M. Utsumi S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 56: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both rH-1 and rH-2 were purified using the same methods described above for native SSF. Apoferritin was prepared as previously described (19Bauminger E.R. Harrison P.M. Hechel D. Nowik I. Treffry A.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The concentrations of all types of ferritin were determined according to the Lowry method with BSA as a standard sample. Recombinant heteropolymer rH-1H-2 was constructed by mixing dissociated H-1 and H-2 subunits in a 1:1 ratio and reassembled by slowly raising the pH to 7 according to a reported method (21Chiaraluce R.

The preparations of EP-deleted rH-1, rH-2, and WT SSF were carried out as described recently (13Li C. Fu X. Qi X. Hu X. Chasteen N.D. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16743-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Fu X. Deng J. Yang H. Masuda T. Goto F. Yoshihara T. Zhao G. Biochem.

Purified holophytoferritin (3.0 mg) was added to 0.24 ml of Alcalase 2.4 L (Novozymes, Denmark) and incubated at 60 °C for 5 min, followed by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 2 mm to stop the proteolysis reaction. The resultant solution was diluted 500-fold with distilled water and then ultrafiltered to its initial concentration using an YM-100 membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Finally, SDS-PAGE was performed to examine the purity of the protein under reducing conditions using 15% minislab gels. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of each subunit treated with the enzyme were also determined. The molecular weights of all ferritin samples were estimated by PAGE using a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel run at 30 V for 15 h at 4 °C and with Tris-HCl (25 mm, pH 8.3) as running buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 15% minislab gels according to a reported method (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The amino acid sequence of the N terminus was determined on a protein sequencer (Procise® 491, Applied Biosystems) using automated Edman degradation. After SDS-PAGE, the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The two subunits were eluted from the membrane, and the sequence of the 10 amino acids at the N terminus was determined for each subunit. EP-1 with sequence ASTVPLTGVIFEPFEEVKKSELAVPT (corresponding to the EP from the H-1 subunit) and EP-2 with sequence ASNAPAPLAGVIFEPFQELKKDYLAVPI (corresponding to the EP from the H-2 subunit) were purchased from Scilight Biotechnology (Beijing, China). Purity was more than 95% as indicated by HPLC and mass spectroscopy. A solution of FeCl3 (70 mm) was freshly prepared in pH 2.0 double-distilled H2O. Reaction between the EP and Fe3+ was carried out as follows. 2 μl of FeCl3 was added to 100 μl of EP-1 (140 μm) in 5 mm Mops at pH 7.0, and the resultant solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the solution was mixed with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) prior to MALDI-TOF-MS analyses. All mass spectra of MALDI-TOF-MS were obtained on a Bruker Ultraflex III TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) in positive ion mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV with a nitrogen laser set at 337 nm (14Fu X.

Biochimie. 2009; 91: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow light scattering measurement experiments were performed with a Hi-Tech SFA-20 M apparatus in conjunction with a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian). Both excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 680 nm, and the time-dependent change in scattering light was set to a 90° angle, perpendicular to the beam, and recorded as previously reported (13Li C. Fu X. Qi X. Hu X. Chasteen N.D. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16743-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All quoted concentrations are final concentrations after mixing the two reagents. All iron solutions were freshly prepared with pH 2.0 water. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Viscotek model 802 dynamic light scattering instrument (Viscotek Europe Ltd.) as described recently (13Li C. Fu X. Qi X. Hu X. Chasteen N.D. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16743-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hydrodynamic radius (RH) was calculated with the regularization histogram method using the spheres model, from which an apparent molecular mass was estimated according to a standard curve calibrated from known globular proteins. OmniSIZE 2.0 software was used to calculate the size distribution of aggregated protein from the addition of iron. Unless stated otherwise, all samples were allowed to stand for 1 h prior to DLS measurements to ensure that the association reactions were complete. The fluorescence-quenching kinetic experiments were performed with a pneumatic drive Hi-Tech SFA-20 M stopped-flow accessory interfaced to a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian) as described previously (24Cavallo S. Mei G. Stefanini S. Rosato N. Finazzi-Agrò A. Chiancone E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The dead time of the stopped-flow fluorimeter apparatus was determined to be 9.2 ± 0.4 ms using the N-acetyltryptophanamide and N-bromosuccinimide test reaction (25Peterman B.F. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The dead times consider both the mixing time and software delay of the instrument. The ratio of protein to iron is 1:48, and protein concentration is 0.5 μm. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in 0.15 m NaCl and 100 mm Mops at pH 7.0. Path lengths for excitation and emission were 1.0 and 0.2 cm at wavelengths of 280 and 325 nm, respectively. A slit width of 5 nm for both excitation and emission was used. The fast kinetics experiments were conducted by measuring absorbance at 300 nm using the Hi-Tech SFA-20 M stopped-flow accessory on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian) at 25 °C. Equal 140-μl volumes of a weakly acidic FeSO4 solution (0.192–1.6 mm) and buffered apoferritin solution (4.0 μm) were mixed at 25 °C in the thermostatted sample compartment containing a 280-μl quartz stopped-flow cuvette with 1-cm optical path length. All quoted concentrations were final concentrations after mixing the two reagents. Fe2+ oxidation was monitored at 300 nm. Data were acquired every 12.5 ms (the shortest acquisition time possible with the Cary 50). The spectrophotometer was operated in single beam mode and zeroed prior to each kinetic run with a cuvette containing apoferritin in buffer. The initial rates of iron oxidation measured as μ-oxo complex formation were obtained from the linear A1 term of a third order polynomial curve fitted to the experimental data as reported previously (13Li C.

All statistical analyses were performed using the software Statistical Program for Social Sciences Analysis System (SPSS Inc.). An analysis of variance and Tukey's test were carried out with a confidence level of 95% (p ≤ 0.05). Each value represents the average of at least three independent measurements. Laser light scattering is a widely applied technique for studying biomolecules in a solution because it can provide information about the size and conformation of proteins and their aggregation state as well as their ability to crystallize (13Li C.

To shed light on the role of the H-1 and H-2 subunits in SSF for iron oxidative deposition in phytoferritin, we first conducted dynamic and stopped-flow light scattering experiments with H-1 soybean seed ferritin (rH-1) and its analog, rH-2. The stopped-flow experiments were performed with either Fe2+ or Fe3+, rapidly mixed with the aporH-2 and rH-1 under aerobic conditions, respectively (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Light scattering changed minimally within the 50-s time frame of the experiment when ≤48 iron/shell were mixed with the rH-2 apoproteins (as also found using H2O in place of the iron solution). In contrast, the light scattering intensity increased markedly because of protein aggregation when the aporH-2 was rapidly mixed aerobically with a series of Fe2+ solutions to give ratios from 96 to 200 Fe2+/shell (Fig. 1A), and the rise in the initial rate, ν0, is first order with respect to iron concentration (Table 1). These results suggest that protein-protein association is driven by binding of the additional iron on the exterior surface of the protein shell because the 24 dinuclear ferroxidase centers of rH-2 have a maximal binding capacity of 48 iron ions and are located in the interior of the protein (13Li C.

A rapid increase in intensity (ν0 = 12.31 ± 0.34 ΔY/s) is observed when Fe3+ is directly added to aporH-2 (96 Fe3+/shell), whereas light scattering intensity slowly increases under the same conditions (ν0 = 1.65 ± 0.07 ΔY/s) when Fe2+ is mixed aerobically with aporH-2 to produce Fe3+. The protein association reaction induced by Fe3+ is completed within ∼0.5 s, whereas the reaction requires ∼20 s to complete when Fe2+ is used instead of Fe3+. By contrast, the anaerobic addition of Fe2+ causes no change in scattering light intensity (data not shown). Thus, Fe3+ facilitates protein-protein association, not Fe2+. A similar observation was obtained with PSF (13Li C. Fu X. Qi X. Hu X. Chasteen N.D. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16743-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein association facilitated by iron was also investigated by DLS under the same conditions used in the stopped-flow light scattering experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2163845525,"Podosomes are recently rediscovered highly dynamic actin-rich structural and functional modules that form close contact with the surrounding substrate. They play a role in the control of migration, tissue invasion, and matrix remodeling of highly motile cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. In osteoclasts, the compaction of podosomes induces the formation of a tight adhesive contact, the sealing zone, which defines a subosteoclastic environment specialized for bone resorption. Integrins and the Rho family small GTPases are key regulators of podosome rearrangements. However, it remains to be determined how the activation of integrins and Rho family GTPases is regulated during osteoclast podosome rearrangements. Here, we demonstrate a crucial role for the FERM domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), FARP2, in osteoclast podosome rearrangements and resorbing activity. We determine by live cell imaging and biochemical assays that FARP2 is required for localized activation of GTP-bound Rac1 into podosome-ring like structures. In addition, FARP2 is relevant to integrin β3 activity during osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, FARP2 deficiency results in reduced formation of multinucleated osteoclasts and resorption pits compared to wild-type osteoclasts (controls). Collectively, our findings reveal an integral role of FARP2 for regulation of Rac1 and integrin β3 throughout podosome rearrangement in osteoclastogenesis."

To ensure that only properly folded polypeptides and correctly assembled protein complexes enter the secretory pathway to reach their final destinations, eukaryotic cells have evolved a conserved quality control mechanism. This quality control program selectively retains polypeptides that fail to reach native conformation and export them from the ER into the cytosol for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. This process was termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) or retrotranslocation (1Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The p97 ATPase complex, which comprises of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) ATPase p97 and the dimeric adaptor complex Ufd1-Npl4, then use a dual recognition mode to recognize both polypeptide chain and the attached polyubiquitin conjugates, leading to the extraction of the polypeptide from the ER membrane (7Ye Y.

The retrotranslocation pathway can be hijacked by viruses to facilitate viral evasion of host immune defense. The murine γ-herpesvirus 68 encodes a type III membrane protein named mK3, which down-regulates newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chain (HC) by co-opting the ERAD mechanism (12Wang X. Ye Y. Lencer W. Hansen T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8636-8644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two HCMV-encoded proteins, US2 and US11, can each target MHC class I HC to the ERAD pathway for degradation. In US11- or US2-expressing cells, MHC class I HC, a type I transmembrane protein carrying a single glycan, is rapidly moved back into the cytosol. Once emerging into the cytosol, HC molecules are modified with polyubiquitin chains, whereas the N-glycan is cleaved off. The polyubiquitinated polypeptide chain is subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome (13Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

The elimination of the antigen presenting MHC HC molecules from the ER membrane apparently allows viruses to escape detection by the host immune system. Both US11 and US2 directly bind MHC class I HC to initiate the retrotranslocation process, and both pathways involve ubiquitin, the 26 S proteasome, and a translocating chain-associated membrane protein-1 (15Kikkert M.

Nonetheless, these two processes each posses its own unique features, indicating that these two viral proteins may use different retrotranslocation routes to dislocate MHC class I HC from the ER membrane. For example, on the ER lumen side, although the Hsp70 family protein BiP has been implicated in both pathways (20Hegde N.R. Chevalier M.S. Wisner T.W. Denton M.C. Shire K. Frappier L. Johnson D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20910-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the ER chaperone protein-disulfide isomerase is required only for US2-mediated retrotranslocation (21Lee, S. O., Cho, K., Cho, S., Kim, I., Oh, C., Ahn, K., (XXXX) EMBO J. 29, 363–375Google Scholar). The difference between the two pathways is most drastic when the membrane components involved are compared (Fig. 1). In the ER membrane, US11 and US2 proteins engage almost completely different sets of membrane proteins to accomplish the dislocation reaction. US2 targets MHC HC to a protein complex comprised of the signal peptide peptidase and an ER-membrane bound ubiquitin ligase termed TRC8 for subsequent export into the cytoplasm (22Loureiro J.

Instead, it targets HC to a large protein complex containing Derlin-1, VIMP, UbxD8, SEL1L, and AUP1 for retrotranslocation (24Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12325-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). On the cytosolic side, previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex in US11-mediatd retrotranslocation (7Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 28Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). However, few studies have examined the cytosolic requirement for US2-induced retrotranslocation. In particular, it is unclear whether or not the p97 ATPase participates in this process, and if so, how it can cooperate with such distinct membrane retrotranslocation complexes. In this report, we established an in vitro permeabilized cell assay that recapitulates important features of the dislocation reaction in intact US2-expressing cells (referred thereafter as US2 cells). Using this system, we demonstrate that the retrotranslocation of HC induced by US2 expression requires ubiquitin and the p97 ATPase. Surprisingly, the canonical adaptor complex Ufd1-Npl4 implicated in retrotranslocation of most ERAD substrates studied to date is dispensable for US2-induced retrotranslocation. We propose that adaptor switch may allow the p97 ATPase to cooperate with distinct retrotranslocation machineries in the ER membrane to serve different substrates. The pLNCX2-US2 plasmid was constructed in two steps. First, a DNA fragment comprised of the coding sequence for the signaling sequence (SS) of the prolactin gene and the FLAG tag (MDSKGSSQKGSRLLLLLVVSNLLLCQGVVSTPVDYKDDDDK) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the BglII and NotI sites of the pLNCX2 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to make pLNCX2-SS-FLAG. The US2 coding sequence was then amplified by PCR and cloned in the NotI and SalI sites of the pLNCX2-SS-FLAG. The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA targeting VCP/p97 (L-008727-00-0050) and the control siRNA (D-001810-10-20) were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA). The anti-Ufd1 siRNA were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The targeting sequence is 5′-CCAACUCAGCCGACUUAAC. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. DeoxyBigCHAP was purchase from Dojindo (Rockville, MD). MHC HC and p97 antibodies were described previously (24Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A.

The construct expressing GST-tagged p97 and the anti-Ufd1 antibody were generously provided by Dr. Hemmo Meyer (University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany). 293T was purchased from ATCC and maintained according to the standard protocol. Transfection was done with the Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Immunoblotting was performed according to standard protocol. Fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies were used for detection. The fluorescent blots were imaged using a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. Protein bands were quantified using the Odyssey 2.1. Astrocytoma or 293T cells stably expressing FLAG-US2 were generated using the pLNCX2-based retroviral system as described previously (29Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Biol.

The resulting tissue (∼300 g) was thoroughly rinsed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Homogenization buffer (∼300 ml) containing extra protease inhibitors was added. The tissue was homogenized in a Polytron blender followed by further homogenization using a Potter homogenizer rotating at ∼1000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 9000 × g in a Beckman JA-10 rotor for 15 min. The supernatant was filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth, re-centrifuged, and filtered through cheesecloth a second time. The supernatant was then centrifuged in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 45,000 × g for 3 h. The cytosol supernatant was saved carefully. The protein concentration of the cytosol was 20–30 mg/ml, as measured with the use of the Micro BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). GST-Ube2B C88S and GST-p97 proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (30Li W. Tu D. Li L. Wollert T. Ghirlando R. Brunger A.T. Ye Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Purified proteins were further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 and Superose 6 columns, respectively, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm potassium chloride, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm magnesium chloride. Cow liver cytosol was purified as described previously (16Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To deplete Ufd1-Npl4 from cytosol, GST-p97 protein was immobilized on glutathione beads. The beads were washed once with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm sodium chloride. 40 mg of cow liver cytosol was subjected to two rounds of depletion, each with glutathione beads containing 125 μg of GST-p97 protein. The beads were removed by centrifugation. To deplete ubiquitin from cow liver cytosol, cow liver cytosol (40 mg) was incubated with 3 mg of GST-Ubc2m in the presence of GST-Uba1 (1 μg) and an ATP regenerating system (16Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To monitor the depletion efficiency, fluorescein-labeled ubiquitin (0.25 μg) was included and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Ubiquitin aldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. GST-Ubc2m·ubiquitin complex was then removed by glutathione beads. The depletion efficiency was monitored by comparing the fluorescence intensity prior to and after the depletion reaction. Pulse-chase and permeabilization experiments were adapted from a previously described protocol (28Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A.

Where indicated, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm) was present in the starvation and pulse labeling medium. To permeabilize the plasma membrane, cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.9 mm CaCl2 and then incubated at 3 × 107 cells/ml in PB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 115 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing 0.028% digitonin (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NH) and a protease inhibitor mixture comprised of leupeptin (10 μg/ml), chymestatin (5 μg/ml), elastatinal (3 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 5 min. For some experiments, an ATP regenerating system (ARS) containing 1 mm ATP, 7.8 mg/ml of phosphocretine (Sigma), and 0.5 mg/ml of creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science) was added to permeabilized US2 cells together with bovine ubiquitin (10 μm) and permeabilized cells were then incubated at 37 °C to initiate retrotranslocation. Alternatively, permeabilized US2 cells were first subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min to remove the supernatant cytosol fraction. The membrane pellet was washed twice with PB buffer containing 270 mm NaCl. The salt-treated membrane pellet was resuspended in cow liver cytosol containing 10 μm bovine ubiquitin and ARS. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37 °C. Samples taken at different time points were either analyzed directly by immunoprecipitation in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (11Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), or first fractionated into a supernatant and a pellet fraction. These fractions were extracted by the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HC antibody. US2-expressing U373-MG astrocytoma cells were starved in a Met/Cys-free medium containing 20 μm MG132 for 1 h and incubated in medium containing [35S]Met/Cys for 30 min in the presence of MG132. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed using DeoxyBigCHAP (1% DeoxyBigCHAP, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate and protease inhibitors) or Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (11Wang Q.

Cells were subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min and cell extract was pre-cleared using Staph A washed with the corresponding lysis buffer. Cell extract was then divided into 3 parts; 10% subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HC antibody, 45% subjected to immunoprecipitation with a control antibody, and 45% subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p97 antibody. 75% of the precipitated material from control and anti-p97 immunoprecipitations were resuspended in 2% SDS, 5 mm DTT and heated at 90 °C for 5 min. The eluted material was diluted with the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with an anti-HC antibody. To study the mechanism of US2-mediated retrotranslocation, we set up a permeabilized cell system. A similar assay was previously established to dissect the mechanism of US11-dependent retrotranslocation of MHC class I HC (31Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To this end, astrocytoma cells stably expressing US2 protein were labeled with [35S]methionine and permeabilized with a buffer containing a low concentration of the detergent digitonin. Digitonin-permeabilized cells were incubated with an ATP regenerating system to initiate retrotranslocation (Fig. 2a, scheme A). Samples taken at different time points were either analyzed directly by solubilization in a Nonidet P-40-containing extraction buffer followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HC antibody or first fractionated into pellet (containing the ER membrane) and supernatant (containing the cytosol) fractions before immunoprecipitation analysis. Incubation of permeabilized US2 cells with an ARS decreased the level of MHC class I HC due to retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation (Fig. 2b, lane 1 versus 2). When US2 cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 1 h prior to pulse labeling, the degradation of HC was inhibited, leading to the accumulation of a fraction of retrotranslocated MHC class I HC during the labeling process, which had the N-glycan cleaved off by a cytosolic N-glycanase (Fig. 2b, lane 5) (33Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The majority of retrotranslocated HC also had the polyubiquitin chains removed, which was likely due to deubiquitination by cellular deubiquitinating enzymes, as reported for US11-mediated retrotranslocation and other ERAD substrates (11Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J.

Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). After incubation, we observed that the amount of dislocated HC product was increased with a concurrent reduction in glycosylated retrotranslocation precursor (Fig. 2b, lane 5 versus 6). Fractionation experiments showed that the majority of deglycosylated HC was indeed present in the cytosol fraction, whereas the glycosylated form was mostly associated with the membrane (Fig. 2b, lane 8 versus 7), consistent with previous studies using intact US2 cells. Thus, our in vitro assay recapitulates a key feature of the in vivo reaction that is the release of HC into the cytosol in a deglycosylated form upon inhibition of the proteasome. We next tested whether the dislocation of HC in permeabilized US2 cells requires any cytosolic proteins. We introduced a centrifugation step following the permeabilization of cells, which removed cytosolic factors (31Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The resulting membrane pellets were washed with a buffer containing 115 mm salt before being incubated with either buffer or cow liver cytosol (CLC) (Fig. 2a, scheme B). Interestingly, retrotranslocation of HC occurred even in the absence of cytosol. The addition of cytosol did not improve the dislocation efficiency (Fig. 2c, top panel). However, when membranes from permeabilized US2 cells were treated with a buffer containing 385 mm salt, the dislocation reaction became dependent on the addition of cytosol (Fig. 2c, bottom panel). These results suggest that US2-dependent dislocation likely involves a factor that is present both in the cytosol and on the ER membrane. This is in contrast to the dislocation reaction in US11 cells, which requires few cytosolic proteins (36Flierman D. Coleman C.S. Pickart C.M. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11589-11594Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most of the factors involved in US11-induced retrotranslocation are exclusively associated with the ER membrane either as anchored or peripheral proteins. These observations further consolidate the notion that the two viral proteins induce MHC class I HC degradation via distinct mechanisms. As expected, the dislocation of MHC class I HC in permeabilized US2 cells also required ATP as its omission completely blocked the appearance of the deglycosylated HC (Fig. 2d, lane 2 versus 4). We tested whether retrotranslocation of MHC class I HC in permeabilized US2 cells requires ubiquitin. We used a previously established method to deplete ubiquitin from cytosol (16Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This method used a GST-tagged mutant ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ube2B C88S, which has the catalytic cysteine converted to serine. As a result, it forms an ester bond with free ubiquitin molecules and the E2-ubiquitin complex is much more stable than wild type E2-Ub thioester complex. The GST-tagged E2-Ub complex could then be removed using glutathione beads (see “Materials and Methods”). This approach allowed us to reproducibly deplete >90% of ubiquitin from the cytosol, as indicated by efficient removal of a fluorescence labeled ubiquitin tracer (Fig. 3a). Consistent with previous results, cytosol depleted of ubiquitin did not support US11-dependent dislocation (Fig. 3b, lane 2 versus 4) and addition of purified bovine ubiquitin to ubiquitin-depleted CLC restored the dislocation activity, as a fraction of glycosylated HC was converted to dislocated deglycosylated species (Fig. 3b, lane 6). When the membranes from permeabilized US2 cells were incubated with either mock-depleted or ubiquitin-depleted CLC, dislocation of MHC class I HC was observed in the presence of control CLC, but not with ubiquitin-depleted CLC (Fig. 3c, lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 4). Like US11 cells, re-introducing ubiquitin to ubiquitin-depleted cytosol restored the dislocation activity, causing the accumulation of deglycosylated HC in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 3c, lane 8). Together, these observations suggest that dislocation of MHC class I HC in permeabilized US2 cells also involves ubiquitination in agreement with previous studies in intact cells, which showed that polyubiquitinated MHC class I HC is present in US2 cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor (17Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34804-34811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and that removal of potential ubiquitin conjugation sites in MHC class I HC abolished its dislocation (18Hassink G.C. Barel M.T. Van Voorden S.B. Kikkert M. Wiertz E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30063-30071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous studies show that polyubiquitin acts as a recognition signal to engage a p97 ATPase complex (8Flierman D. Ye Y. Dai M. Chau V. Rapoport T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34774-34782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which utilizes the energy generated by ATP hydrolysis to dislocate polypeptides from the ER membrane (28Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether US2-induced retrotranslocation involves p97. Because a significant fraction of p97 is tightly associated with the ER membrane, which is resistant to high salt treatment (28Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), we used a protein termed SVIP to inhibit the p97 function. SVIP is a small polypeptide containing a p97 interaction motif. Overexpression of SVIP inhibits p97-dependent protein degradation at the ER membrane (37Ballar P. Zhong Y. Nagahama M. Tagaya M. Shen Y. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33908-33914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Addition of SVIP protein to permeabilized US11 cells inhibits US11-dependent retrotranslocation (Fig. 4a). In a parallel experiment, we also treated permeabilized US2 cells with the same dose of SVIP. However, we found that SVIP only had a marginal effect on US2-mediated retrotranslocation, leading to a small but reproducible reduction in the level of dislocated deglycosylated HC and a corresponding increase in the membrane-associated glycosylated HC precursors (Fig. 4b). To further examine the role of p97 in US2-mediated dislocation, we incubated permeabilized US2 cells with a p97 mutant lacking the second ATPase domain (ΔD2). This mutant was shown to block retrotranslocation of MHC class I HC in US11 cells (7Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, addition of this mutant to permeabilized US2 cells had no significant impact on HC dislocation under the same condition (Fig. 4d). Together, these results suggest that US2-induced retrotranslocation either does not require p97 or employs a p97 complex that is different from the one used in US11 cells, so it cannot be efficiently inhibited by these inhibitory proteins. To gain more insights on the role of p97 in US2-mediated retrotranslocation, we examined the potential interaction of p97 with MHC class I HC undergoing retrotranslocation in US2 cells. Because the retrotranslocation and degradation of MHC class I HC in US2 cells occurs rapidly (t½ < 5 min), the interaction between p97 and the substrate HC, if existing, must be transient in nature. To capture this transient complex, we treated cells with a proteasome inhibitor for 1 h before labeling cells with [35S]methionine. Cell extracts were prepared using either the mild detergent DeoxyBigCHAP or a stronger detergent (Nonidet P-40). p97 was immunoprecipitated from cell extract (Fig. 5, bottom panel) and the associated proteins were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with an anti-MHC HC antibody (Fig. 5, upper panels). The result showed that a fraction of MHC class I HC molecules associated with p97 only when DeoxyBigCHAP was used to prepare cell extract, consistent with our hypothesis that the p97-MHC class I HC interaction is unstable. Interestingly, unlike US11 cells in which p97 associated with both the glycosylated retrotranslocation precursor and the dislocated deglycosylated MHC molecules (38Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), p97 preferentially associated with deglycosylated MHC class I HC in US2 cells (Fig. 5). This observation indicates that p97 is still involved in US2-mediated retrotranslocation, but it appears to operate by a mechanism distinct from that used in US11 cells. We then tested whether the retrotranslocation of MHC class I HC in US2 cells requires the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor complex. Ufd1 and Npl4 are present in cells solely as a dimeric complex (39Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and depletion of one subunit always causes the simultaneous loss of the other, as reported in several studies (40Hetzer M. Meyer H.H. Walther T.C. Bilbao-Cortes D. Warren G. Mattaj I.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 41Ramadan K. Bruderer R. Spiga F.M. Popp O. Baur T. Gotta M. Meyer H.H. Nature. 2007; 450: 1258-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Ufd1-Npl4 complex is mostly in the cytosol, but a fraction of the complex is also associated with the ER membrane. However, the interaction of the Ufd1-Npl4 complex with the membrane can be disrupted by salt (350 mm) (Fig. 6a). Because our in vitro assay includes a washing step with a buffer containing ∼400 mm salt, the only source of Ufd1-Npl4 in the in vitro retrotranslocation reactions is the cytosol. We therefore depleted the Ufd1-Npl4 complex from the cytosol using recombinant GST-p97. Consistent with previous studies, this approach efficiently removed the cofactor complex from the cytosol, as confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-Ufd1 antibody (Fig. 6b). We first tested the effect of Ufd1 depletion on US11-mediated dislocation. When US11 cells were permeabilized and washed with salt, retrotranslocation of HC was partially inhibited, as indicated by the reduced level of deglycosylated HC during the chase period (Fig. 6c, lanes 5 and 6 versus 2 and 3). This was at least in part due to the removal of the Ufd1 complex from the membrane as depletion of Ufd1 from CLC further impaired HC retrotranslocation (Fig. 6c, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, when US2-induced dislocation assay was performed using either the cofactor-depleted cytosol or a mock depleted cytosol, we observed no difference in their ability to support the retrotranslocation of HC (Fig. 6d). Thus, we conclude that unlike US11 cells, US2-mediated retrotranslocation likely does not require Ufd1-Npl4. We finally confirmed our findings using intact 293T cells stably expressing US2. We knocked down both p97 and Ufd1 using a siRNA approach. The depletion of these proteins from cells could be verified by immunoblotting (Fig. 7a). The depletion of either p97 or Ufd1 significantly impaired the ERAD pathway, as indicated by the increased stability of the classical ERAD substrate TCRα (Fig. 7a, lanes 1–3). Interestingly, in US2-expressing 293T cells, depletion of p97 stabilized endogenous MHC class I HC, whereas knockdown of Ufd1 had no effect on the degradation of MHC class I HC (Fig. 7a, lanes 4-6, and b). These results confirm that US2-induced retrotranslocation proceeds via a p97-dependent but Ufd1-independent mechanism. The HCMV protein US2 hijacks the ERAD pathway to dispose of newly synthesized MHC class I HC. It has been shown previously that in US2-expressing cells, MHC class I HC molecules undergo polyubiquitination and are dislocated into the cytosol prior to proteasomal degradation (13Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Removal of ubiquitination sites on MHC class I HC inhibits its retrotranslocation and degradation (18Hassink G.C. Barel M.T. Van Voorden S.B. Kikkert M. Wiertz E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30063-30071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanism of US2-induced retrotranslocation of MHC class I HC, we establish an in vitro permeabilized cell assay that recapitulates key features of this reaction. In our in vitro assay, ubiquitin depletion completely abolishes US2-induced retrotranslocation, consistent with a previous report that US2-mediated retrotranslocation requires ubiquitination. In addition, the dislocation reaction requires ATP. We show that in addition to ubiquitin, US2-dependent retrotranslocation also involves the p97 ATPase. At first glance, this appears to resemble US11-induced retrotranslocation. However, a thorough comparison of the two reactions indicates that the two HCMV proteins use distinct retrotranslocation complexes to down-regulate MHC class I HC. For ubiquitination, the US2 protein uses the TRC8 ubiquitin ligase to conjugate polyubiquitin chains on one or more lysine residues in HC and removal of ubiquitin acceptors in HC inhibits its retrotranslocation (23Stagg H.R. Thomas M. van den Boomen D. Wiertz E.J. Drabkin H.A. Gemmill R.M. Lehner P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By contrast, TRC8 is not involved in US11-induced retrotranslocation and lysine residues in HC molecules are dispensable for retrotranslocation (18Hassink G.C. Barel M.T. Van Voorden S.B. Kikkert M. Wiertz E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30063-30071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Stagg H.R. Thomas M. van den Boomen D. Wiertz E.J. Drabkin H.A. Gemmill R.M. Lehner P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because MHC class I HC is polyubiquitinated in US11 cells and blocking this modification by either depletion of ubiquitin from the cytosol or inactivation of the ubiquitin activating enzyme abolishes US11-dependent retrotranslocation (15Kikkert M. Hassink G. Barel M. Hirsch C. van der Wal F.J. Wiertz E. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we assumed that ubiquitin chains may be conjugated to one or more non-lysine residues in HC, as demonstrated recently (42Wang X. Herr R.A. Chua W.J. Lybarger L. Wiertz E.J. Hansen T.H. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For the dislocation reaction, although both reactions appear to use the p97 ATPase, the mode of p97 action in these reactions is different. In US11-expressing cells, p97 interacts with both glycosylated retrotranslocation precursor as well as deglycosylated retrotranslocated product (38Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In US2 cells, p97 primarily interacts with the deglycosylated species. This distinction suggests that US2 and US11 may employ different p97 complexes to dislocate MHC class I HC, a notion further supported by our finding that US2-mediated retrotranslocation does not require the cofactor complex Ufd1-Npl4. This model would explain why several p97 inhibitory proteins efficiently inhibit the dislocation of HC in permeabilized US11 cells but not in US2 cells. Perhaps, different p97 complexes may have differential accessibility to these inhibitory proteins. The use of different p97 complexes by the two HCMV protein-induced retrotranslocation processes might be due to the different mechanisms by which these viral proteins recognize and target HC molecules for retrotranslocation. US11 uses its transmembrane domain to recognize both MHC class I HC and Derlin-1. The latter is a multispanning membrane protein implicated in retrotranslocation of some misfolded ER proteins (24Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 25Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 43Lilley B.N. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By serving as an adaptor that links MHC class I HC to Derlin-1, US11 targets HC to a retrotranslocation complex comprising Derlin-1, one or more membrane-bound ubiquitin ligases, and the AAA ATPase p97 (38Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 44Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, Derlin family members are dispensable for US2-mediated retrotranslocation. Instead, US2 uses its ER luminal domain to interact with HC and its cytosolic tail to bind the signal peptide peptidase (22Loureiro J. Lilley B.N. Spooner E. Noriega V. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Signal peptide peptidase is in complex with the TRC8 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which appears to mediate the transfer of MHC class I HC across the ER membrane in US2 cells (23Stagg H.R. Thomas M. van den Boomen D. Wiertz E.J. Drabkin H.A. Gemmill R.M. Lehner P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Whether or not TRC8 also mediates retrotranslocation of misfolded ER proteins is currently unknown. Nonetheless, it becomes apparent that distinct retrotranslocation complexes exist in the ER membrane in both yeast and higher eukaryotes, which serve different cohorts of ERAD substrates. Because almost all retrotranslocation mechanisms studied to date use the p97 ATPase for substrate dislocation, the difference in the membrane machinery underscore the importance of tailoring p97 complex by affiliating it with different co-factors, which would allow the same enzyme to cooperate with different membrane-bound retrotranslocation complexes. In agreement with this idea, a recent study shows that the p97 adaptor UbxD8, a Ubx-domain-containing protein is only involved in retrotranslocation of HC molecules in US11 cells but not in US2 cells (27Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12325-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).

Apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved cell death mechanism crucial for both tissue homeostasis and the continuous removal of superfluous or damaged cells from the bodies of all metazoans. Unbalanced apoptotic signaling results in developmental defects and contributes to multiple diseases, including autoimmune and neurological disorders as well as cancer (1Cotter T.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Due to the central role of apoptotic signaling for human health and its grave consequence on cell fate (life/death), apoptotic signaling networks have become a major focus for cellular and molecular systems biological research (2Huber H.J.

The execution of apoptotic cell death is expedited by sequential activation of apoptotic initiator and effector caspases, proteases that reside in cells as inactive zymogens. Activation is thought to be enhanced by positive feedback loops between initiator and effector caspases (3Inoue S. Browne G. Melino G. Cohen G.M.

Initiator caspases such as caspase-8 and -9 require binding to multiprotein platforms for their activation, resulting in autoproteolysis into small and large subunits that take up the mature heterotetrameric caspase conformation (4Logue S.E.

Procaspase-8 is activated at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). 2The abbreviations used are: DISCdeath-inducing signaling complexXIAPx-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinBARbifunctional apoptosis regulatorc-FLIPcellular FLICE-inhibitory protein. This multiprotein complex is formed at the plasma membrane in response to external ligands that bind to death receptors on the cell surface, and both dimerization and proteolytic processing of procaspase-8 are required to form a caspase-8 dimer capable of initiating apoptosis (6Hughes M.A. Harper N.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Of these, caspase-3 directly or indirectly induces the majority of the morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, such as cytoskeletal collapse, loss of phospholipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane, and apoptotic plasma membrane blebbing. Caspase-3 also activates effector caspase-6, which cleaves procaspase-8 and thereby is believed to close a positive feedback loop between caspase-8, -3, and -6 (3Inoue S. Browne G. Melino G. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Likewise, caspase-3 initiates another positive feedback by cleaving the x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) binding motif off the small caspase-9 subunit (9Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S.

In so-called type I cells, the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop is thought to be a major pathway for activating effector caspases in response to death ligands, whereas type II cells depend on the mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis execution (10Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar), suggesting potent inhibition of the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop in the latter scenario. Furthermore, mild non-lethal caspase-8 and -3 activities have been demonstrated to be a physiological prerequisite in various scenarios of cellular proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 11Maelfait J. Beyaert R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 76: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 12Lamkanfi M. Festjens N. Declercq W. Vanden Berghe T. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), rather than leading to cell death by feedback amplification. Sufficient inhibitory mechanisms also must be in place to avoid unwanted cell death in response to mild, temporary or spontaneous, accidental activation of small amounts of caspases, as might occur during transient stress conditions. Here we constructed and analyzed computational biochemical models to quantitatively compare the potential of known anti-apoptotic molecular mechanisms in suppressing feedback amplification via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop. This was performed initially for a scenario representing the physiological cellular context of type II HeLa cervical cancer cells and was subsequently expanded to a global analysis spanning the entire phase space to cover the biological variability that can be expected within cell populations and between different cell types. All models were implemented as ordinary differential equations based on mass action kinetics. Process diagrams according to the systems biology graphical notation are provided as supplemental Fig. 4. For model parameterization, the kinetics for the dimerization/dissociation balance between processed caspase-8 monomers and active caspase-8 dimers were derived from experimental data published by Pop et al. (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The authors force-dimerized caspase-8 species with the help of Hoffmeister salts to obtain starting material for experiments on dissociation kinetics. Although force dimerization is not a physiological scenario, these experiments allowed them to determine the rate constants for the dimerization/dissociation processes as required for this study. The equilibrium binding constant Kd for caspase-8 was determined as 3.3 μm. The decrease of caspase-8 activity due to the dissociation of active dimers into monomers was determined as 27 min. 3C. Pop and G. Salvesen, personal communication. This half-time can also be appreciated from Fig. 5B in Ref 13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar. Based on the equation for the relation between the half-life and the rate constant for a first order reaction, a koff of 0.0257 min−1 was calculated koff =ln⁡(2)/t1/2(Eq. 1) With the ratio of koff to kon being the equilibrium binding constant Kd, kon was calculated as 7788 m−1 min−1 using kon=koff/Kd(Eq. 2) Concentrations for procaspase-8 and -6 in HeLa cervical cancer cells were determined by comparative quantitative Western blotting using whole cell extracts of HeLa and SKW6.4 cells. Other concentrations and reaction constants were taken from literature published previously. Detailed tables for the model parameterization and associated reference publications are listed in the supplemental tables. For the numerical solution of the respective reaction networks, we used MATLAB-based scripts employing the ODE15s solver for ordinary differential equations, which implemented a backward differentiation formula for numerical integration. Scripts used in this study are available as supplemental Datasets S1 and S2. The distinct model variants described in the main body of this report were perturbed with the concentration equivalent of one processed active caspase-8, -3, or -6 heterodimer bearing two catalytic sites to represent a scenario of residual spontaneous, or accidental caspase activation. Methodologically, the ordinary differential equations modeling approach omitted stochastic effects and concentration discretization representing low numbers of reactants. Stochastic modeling would have required a more complex mathematical formalism and a multitude of repeats for each modeled condition to determine a mean response time but would not have affected the qualitative ranking of the potency of caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation, XIAP, and bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BAR). The global sensitivity analysis covered a range of 12 different concentrations from 0.5 nm to 2 μm for each of the procaspases as well as for XIAP and BAR and was performed for input perturbations via caspase-8, -3, and -6. In total, 136,512 different simulations were performed to screen the whole range of biological variability that can be expected between different cells and cell types. To decrease the duration of the computations, the MATLAB script was programmed to allow splitting and distributing the simulations across multiple computers. Results were stored as MATLAB data files and were analyzed subsequently for the time required for caspase-3 to cleave defined amounts of substrate as an indicator for cellular apoptotic responsiveness. The attenuation of caspase amplification via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop is a matter of controversial discussion. Although inhibitors or inhibitory processes affecting caspase-8 or -3 activation have been characterized in great detail in isolation, information on their relative potency in attenuating the amplification of caspase activities in the presence of the entire caspase-8, -3, -6 loop is lacking. To obtain this information, we chose a mathematical approach of modeling reactions networks that was based on the published biochemical knowledge on the individual reactants. We first devised a core model consisting solely of procaspase-8, -3, and -6 (Fig. 1A, model variant 1). In this core model, no inhibitory processes were present, and cleavage of procaspases directly yielded active caspases. This core model was then expanded to separately compare and rank three known inhibitory mechanisms of the type I loop. (i) BAR, a protein that was proposed to inhibit caspase-8 activation (14Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z. Fuess S. Kitada S. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2597-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), was introduced in the first model variant (Fig. 1B, model variant 2). BAR binds to procaspase-8, and only the fraction of procaspase-8 that is not bound to BAR is available for activation. Due to potential polyubiquitylation by the BAR RING domain, an enhanced degradation of the procaspase-8 fraction that is bound to BAR was taken into account as well. Although this function has not yet been conclusively shown experimentally, it ensured that the inhibitory potential of BAR was not underestimated in this study. (ii) In the second adaptation (Fig. 1C, model variant 3), the XIAP was implemented as an inhibitor of caspase-3. Active caspase-3 can cleave XIAP into two fragments, of which the NH2-terminal cleavage product (BIR12) maintains the capability to inhibit caspase-3 (15Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of full-length XIAP was taken into account in the model as well and was implemented to result in enhanced degradation of inactivated caspase-3. (iii) Direct cleavage of procaspase-8 monomers by other caspases, i.e. processing of procaspase-8 outside of the DISC, requires the subsequent dimerization of the processed caspase-8 monomers (comprised of small and large subunits) to form an active heterotetramer. Taking into account the caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation balance therefore could present a potent inhibitory mechanism that avoids spontaneous amplification of caspase activities via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop. The kinetic characteristics determining the dimerized and dissociated fractions of caspase-8 were recently characterized (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and were implemented in a third extension of the core model (Fig. 1D, model variant 4; see also “Experimental Procedures”). It is important to note that all four model variants need to be considered as biologically incomplete because they contain either none or only one inhibitory process. However, the comparison of the potencies of the distinct inhibitory processes within the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop can only be achieved by investigating them separately. It is furthermore noteworthy that a comparison of the inhibitory potential of BAR versus XIAP versus caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation within the context of the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop cannot be performed experimentally. Caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation is an intrinsic feature of the loop and cannot be removed to examine the inhibitory power of BAR or XIAP in isolation. Therefore, the analysis of the relative inhibitory potency represents an experimentally inaccessible research question that however can be addressed by a systems modeling approach. For simulations, the above network topologies were coded by sets of ordinary differential equations and allowed to calculate and visualize the changes in all protein fractions over time. The binding constants and catalytic rates for protein interactions and enzyme activities (kon, koff, kcat) were taken from previously published biochemical studies and characterizations as listed and cited in supplemental Tables 3–6. The dissociation constant of the active caspase-8 dimer was deducted from experiments published previously (13Pop C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4398-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All these parameters characterize the biochemical behavior of their respective reactants and are valid across different cell types. Different cell types and cell lines, however, can show significant variability in the expression of individual proteins. Initially, the protein quantities in the core model and its variants were therefore adjusted to values representing HeLa cervical cancer cells (supplemental Table 7). HeLa cells by now have become a key experimental reference system for systems biological studies of apoptotic cell death (16Rehm M. Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Albeck J.G. Burke J.M. Aldridge B.B. Zhang M. Lauffenburger D.A. Sorger P.K. Mol.

Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Lauber K. Berg C. Schwenzer R. Wajant H. Jänicke R.U. Porter A.G. Belka C. Gregor M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wesselborg S.

Type II cells require mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the release of cytochrome c and Smac into the cytosol to efficiently activate effector caspases and undergo apoptosis execution. Amplification via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop upon mild, submaximal stimulation therefore should be strongly inhibited in type II HeLa cells. The potency of the inhibitors in the distinct model variants therefore could be tested against this biological a priori knowledge. The protein concentrations in HeLa cells were experimentally measured by us previously (caspase-3, XIAP) (16Rehm M. Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), were determined experimentally de novo for this study by comparative quantitative Western blotting (caspase-8 and -6), or were taken from a previously published systems model for HeLa cells (BAR) (22Eissing T. Conzelmann H. Gilles E.D. Allgöwer F. Bullinger E. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36892-36897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We evaluated the potential of BAR, XIAP, or caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation to avoid unwanted apoptosis execution in the distinct model variants upon mild stimulation of the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop at type II HeLa cell conditions. To this end, we investigated the temporal profiles of the different protein species in these scenarios and calculated the cleavage kinetics of caspase-3 substrates. Determining the onset and extent of substrate cleavage by caspase-3 served to rank the inhibitory mechanisms according to their efficiency in blocking signal amplification and apoptosis execution (Fig. 2). Stimulating the core model via caspase-8 resulted in an early, concomitant, and rapid amplification of all caspase species, provoking swift and complete substrate cleavage within 15 min (Fig. 2A). The model variant including BAR indicated that active caspases accumulated similar to those in the core model (Fig. 2B). Approximately 100% of BAR remained bound to procaspase-8 (Fig. 2B, middle panel). This can be explained by procaspase-8 being present in relative abundance when compared with BAR in HeLa cells (see supplemental Table 7). Caspase-8 therefore can be activated without the pool of BAR-procaspase-8 being noticeably affected. Like in the core model, appreciable substrate cleavage started at ∼15 min and reached completion after about 30 min (Fig. 2B). In the presence of XIAP, significant amounts of active caspases are only accumulating ∼90 min after network stimulation, and the presence of XIAP prevented caspase-3 from exceeding values above 45% (Fig. 2C). The accumulation of free, active caspase-3 coincided with the time upon which full-length XIAP was consumed and the fractions of XIAP or the BIR12 fragment peaked in their interaction with caspase-3 (Fig. 2C). Onset of substrate cleavage was detectable at about 60 min and was completed at ∼90 min (Fig. 2C). The perturbation of the model variant including caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation was performed in two distinct modes, representing opposite ends of the caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation balance. The input consisted of either (i) fully mature processed dimerized caspase-8 (Fig. 2D) or (ii) processed caspase-8 monomers, which first had to dimerize to become active (Fig. 2E). Upon perturbation with dimeric caspase-8, the fractions of caspase-3 and -6 started to increase after ∼2–3 h, whereas the amounts of dimeric caspase-8 remained very low at all times (Fig. 2D). The latter could be attributed to caspase-8 remaining largely in its monomeric form (Fig. 2D). Substrate cleavage by caspase-3 displayed an initial ramp that indicated low activity (30–120 min) followed by faster substrate cleavage at a time coinciding with increased caspase-3 activation and reached completion after 3 h (Fig. 2D). In stark contrast, no noteworthy amounts of active caspase species were calculated when initiating this model variant by processed caspase-8 monomers (Fig. 2E), indicating that the requirement for monomer association strongly impairs signal amplification. Correspondingly, no significant substrate cleavage was detected during the first 6 simulated hours (Fig. 2E). Extended simulations covering 24 h provided equivalent results (supplemental Fig. 1). Perturbation of the distinct model variants via inputs of caspase-3 or caspase-6 suggested the same ranking; XIAP was more potent than BAR in delaying substrate cleavage, whereas caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation effectively abolished signal amplification (Fig. 3, A and B). We also repeated all simulations for conditions resembling type I SKW6.4 cells (parameters listed in supplemental Table 8). For protein compositions as found in a type I signaling system, the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop would be expected to more rapidly amplify caspase activities. Indeed, the model variants for SKW6.4 conditions showed a higher responsiveness toward stimulation because substrate cleavage occurred at earlier times when compared with type II HeLa cell conditions (supplemental Fig. 2). Qualitatively, the potency ranking yielded results corresponding to the HeLa cell scenario, with caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation being more potent than XIAP or BAR in attenuating signal amplification (supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop could most effectively be attenuated by the requirement of processed caspase-8 monomers to dimerize into an active caspase-8, irrespective of the chosen input perturbation. The human body comprises more than 200 different cell types, with diversities in cellular proteomes being central to bringing about distinct cell functionalities. Furthermore, protein profiles may change with progression through cell cycle phases or during adaptation to altered environmental conditions and were also shown to differ between individual cells within clonal cell populations due to noise in protein turnover (23Sigal A. Milo R. Cohen A. Geva-Zatorsky N. Klein Y. Liron Y. Rosenfeld N. Danon T. Perzov N. Alon U. Nature. 2006; 444: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 24Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.S. Science. 2002; 297: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3740) Google Scholar). Analyzing a single cellular context therefore is not sufficient to evaluate the relative power of the molecular mechanisms that inhibit the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop. We therefore conducted a global sensitivity analysis for all model variants, which encompassed 136,512 simulations. These simulations screened concentration combinations from the sub- to superphysiological range (0.5 nm to 2 μm) to reflect the biological variability that can reasonably be expected between cells and distinct cell types (Fig. 4A). Simulations covered 24 h and were analyzed for the time required for caspase-3 to cleave 20 or 80% substrate to determine the “time of death” for each individual run. These substrate cleavage thresholds were based on previously published data, which indicated that HeLa cells cleaving less than 20% substrate subsequently did not show morphological features of apoptosis, whereas cells cleaving 80% substrate always underwent efficient apoptosis execution (16Rehm M. Huber H.J. Dussmann H. Prehn J.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4338-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We initially performed the global sensitivity analysis using dimerized active caspase-8 as the input. For all model variants, we plotted the respective simulation collectives against time and removed individual runs once they reached either 20 or 80% substrate cleavage. This allowed us to generate survival plots that displayed the percentage of simulations that had not undergone apoptosis execution against time (Fig. 4B). As expected, for the core model, essentially no survivors could be identified (Fig. 4, B and C). The BAR-extended variant yielded low percentages of survivors (5 or 8% for thresholds of 20 or 80% substrate cleavage, respectively), whereas the XIAP-extended variant performed far better with 33 and 48% survivors (Fig. 4, B and C). Using an active caspase-8 dimer as the input to the model variant entailing caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation, the survival plots indicated a performance similar to the XIAP-extended model for the 20% threshold (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas XIAP remained more potent in attenuating signal amplification when investigating the 80% threshold of substrate cleavage (Fig. 4, B and C). Triggering with monomers of caspase-8 instead yielded by far the best survival rates (85% for 20 and 80% thresholds) when compared with all other scenarios (Fig. 4, B and C). Qualitatively comparable results were obtained when analyzing the distinct collectives for their death kinetics (supplemental Fig. 3A). We next repeated these simulations using active caspase-3 or -6 as inputs. In these collectives, the model variant including caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation again exceeded the inhibitory power of BAR or XIAP model variants (Fig. 5, A and B and supplemental Fig. 3, B and C). When comparing the results from different input stimuli (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), the inhibitory potential of caspase-8 dimerization/dissociation was weakest when the signaling network was initiated by dimeric active caspase-8. Taken together, our data show that the dimerization/dissociation of caspase-8 generally is the most potent molecular mechanism in blocking the amplification of caspase activities via the caspase-8, -3, -6 loop. When comparing the amount of simulation runs that resulted in intermediate substrate cleavage (between 2"

Here, we investigated the role of MTA1 in the regulation of expression and function of MyD88, a proximal component of NF-κB signaling. We discovered that MTA1 targets MyD88 and that MyD88 is a NF-κB-responsive gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We found that MTA1 is required for MyD88-dependent stimulation of NF-κB signaling and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, MIP2, and TNF-α as MTA1 depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of NF-κB target genes. In addition, LPS-mediated stimulation of MyD88 transcription was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of MTA1, RNA polymerase II, and p65RelA complex to the NF-κB consensus sites in the MyD88 promoter. Interestingly, the recruitment of both MTA1 and MyD88 expression is effectively blocked by NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide. Selective knockdown of MyD88 by a dominant negative mutant of MyD88 or selective siRNA also impairs the ability of LPS to stimulate the NF-κB target genes. These findings reveal an inherent coregulatory role of MTA1 upon the expression of MyD88 and suggest that MTA1 regulation of MyD88 may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which MTA1 stimulates LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in stimulated macrophages."

Kato M. Nature. 1987; 325: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The mGluRs belong to family C of the large superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Family C GPCRs (also referred to as family 3 GPCRs, the nomenclature that will be utilized here) also include the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), GABAB receptors, taste receptors, and putative pheromone receptors (2Kaupmann K.

All members of the family 3 GPCRs share similar domain architecture, including venus flytrap-like extracellular domains (ECD), heptahelical transmembrane domains, and intracellular C-terminal C-tails. The mGluRs fall into three groups and eight subtypes. Group I comprises mGluR1 and mGluR5 (3Nakanishi S.

Upon activation by its agonists, the intracellular domains of the group I mGluRs associate with the G protein Gq/11 to activate phospholipase C, which subsequently converts phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), thereby releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as activating protein kinase C (PKC) and other downstream effectors (5Conn P.J.

In addition, mGluR1α responds to 5 mm [Ca2+]o in Purkinje cells prepared from global mGluR1α knock-out mice in which the receptor has been specifically knocked into Purkinje cells, whereas the Purkinje cells from the mGluR1α global knock-out mice themselves cannot sense [Ca2+]o (9Tabata T. Kano M. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Tabata T. Aiba A. Kano M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the basis of these studies, [Ca2+]o is postulated to mediate postsynaptic efficacy through it action on mGluR1 (11Hardingham N.R. Bannister N.J. Read J.C. Fox K.D. Hardingham G.E. Jack J.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6337-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, Glu triggers [Ca2+]i oscillations in a manner that is modulated by [Ca2+]o (12Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), as R, 5-3, 5-Dihydroxylphenylglycine, an agonist of group I mGluRs, generated inward currents that were enhanced by [Ca2+]o (10Tabata T. Aiba A. Kano M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nash et al. (13Nash M.S. Saunders R. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) concluded that mGluR1α is not a calcium-sensing receptor because its response to the agonist l-quisqualate is not sensitive to [Ca2+]o. However, the effect of [Ca2+]o on the EC50 for quisqualate was not examined. Any putative Ca2+-binding sites capable of regulating mGluR signaling remain “invisible” in six crystal structures of the ECD of mGluR1α determined to date (14Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3759-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One Gd3+ ion binds to mGluR1 between the helices of lobe 2 (LB2) at the dimer interface of the ECD, far from the Glu-binding site (14Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Abe H. Tateyama M. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Removing the Gd3+-binding residue, E238Q, eliminated sensitivity to Gd3+ but not sensitivity to [Ca2+]o and Glu (17Abe H. Tateyama M. Kubo Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O. Kubo Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Two Gd3+ ions visible in the crystal structure were ignored by these authors, although one of them is located near the critical hinge region coordinated by Asp-322, Asp-324, and Asp-493 (14Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This observation also suggests strongly that a Ca2+ ion could bind to this region of the protein. The invisibility of Ca2+-binding sites in the x-ray structures of the mGluRs represents a major challenge shared among other Ca2+-modulated proteins functioning at high Ca2+ concentrations, like those in the extracellular fluids, due to their low Ca2+-binding affinities (Kd, ∼0.1–1.5 mm) and irregular binding geometries (19Kirberger M. Wang X. Deng H. Yang W. Chen G. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 1169-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the role of Ca2+ as an extracellular signal acting via family 3 GPCRs beyond CaSR is severely hampered by the lack of adequate information about the location and properties of the Ca2+-binding sites of this class of proteins. We report herein the identification of a novel Ca2+-binding site adjacent to the Glu-binding site in the hinge region of the ECD of mGluR1α (14Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), which was found by using our recently developed the MUG (multiple geometries) algorithm (20Yang W. Wilkins A.L. Ye Y. Liu Z.R. Li S.Y. Urbauer J.L. Hellinga H.W. Kearney A. van der Merwe P.A. Yang J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Deng H. Chen G. Yang W. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2006; 64: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Wang X. Kirberger M. Qiu F. Chen G. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2009; 75: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MUG is a graphic geometry-based Ca2+-binding site prediction software. It extracts oxygen clusters from Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and assumes a Ca2+ center for each cluster. The clusters then are verified by setting parameters for geometric filters that define the range of distance between oxygen atoms and Ca2+. The clusters satisfying the parameter setting were considered candidates for Ca2+-binding pockets. The putative Ca2+-binding pockets of lower quality were further modified by allowing rotation of the side chains of predicted liganding residues. To investigate a single Ca2+-binding site present within a short stretch of amino acids, normally less than 30 residues, we engineered the short loop into a scaffold protein, CD2. Intact CD2 does not bind Ca2+ and is tolerant of site-directed mutagenesis without undergoing changes in its overall structure. Then the metal-binding capabilities of the key predicted Ca2+-binding residues were further characterized using luminescence energy transfer (LRET) and site-directed mutagenesis (23Huang Y. Zhou Y. Castiblanco A. Yang W. Brown E.M. Yang J.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24Huang Y. Zhou Y. Yang W. Butters R. Lee H.W. Li S. Castiblanco A. Brown E.M. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19000-19010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Finally, we investigated the intracellular Ca2+ responses resulting from the binding of [Ca2+]o, [Gd3+]o, or Glu individually or of both [Ca2+]o and Glu together by expressing wild type and mGluR1α variants with predicted ligand residues mutated. Our studies suggest that Asp-318, Asp-322, and Glu-325 at the predicted site are involved in Ca2+ binding and that mutation at Asp-318 and Glu-325 also abolishes responsiveness of the receptor to [Gd3+]o. The ligands for Glu binding, in contrast, although also including Asp-318, are otherwise distinct (14Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4314-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Notably, the carboxylate group of the side chain of Glu also contributes to the binding site for Ca2+. We propose a dual activation mechanism whereby the simultaneous binding of Glu and Ca2+, at their separate but partially overlapping binding sites, potentiates one another's actions to yield maximal activation of mGluR1α. The three-dimensional coordinates of the crystal structures of the ECD of mGluR1α were obtained from the PDB (PDB entry codes: 1EWT, 1EWK (15Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and 1ISR (14Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar)). Hydrogen atoms were added using the Sybyl7.2 package (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The identification of putative Ca2+-binding sites in the ECD of mGluR1α was performed using MUG, a graph theory-based algorithm (21Deng H. Chen G. Yang W. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2006; 64: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) developed by our laboratory. The Ca–O distance in the software was set to 1.6–3.1 Å with a set average cutoff of 2.4 Å (26Falke J.J. Drake S.K. Hazard A.L. Peersen O.B. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 219-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 27Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the O–O distance was set to 6.0 Å (21Deng H. Chen G. Yang W. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2006; 64: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Side chain atoms were rotated to accommodate Ca2+-induced local conformational changes (48Wong X. Zhao K. Kirberger M. Wong H. Chen G. Yang J. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, electrostatic surface potential maps were constructed using Delphi (28Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar), and GRASP (29Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar) was then used to render and modify the image. The linear, putative Ca2+-binding site was added into the scaffold protein CD2 between Ser-52 and Gly-53 with triple Gly linkers at both ends, and the combined grafting model was generated by Modeler 9v4 (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10551) Google Scholar). The predicted linear Ca2+-binding site, termed mGluR1-1, resides between Gly-316 and Gly-337 (GSDGWADRDEVIEGYEVEANGG). This sequence, grafted into CD2 between Ser-52 and Gly-53 in the plasmid pGEX-2T-CD2 (31Ye Y. Lee H.W. Yang W. Shealy S.J. Wilkins A.L. Liu Z.R. Torshin I. Harrison R. Wohlhueter R. Yang J.J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was named CD2.D1. The engineered protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified using GS4B resin as described (32Ye Y. Lee H.W. Yang W. Shealy S. Yang J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3743-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). In Trp-sensitized Tb3+-LRET experiments, emission spectra from 500 to 580 nm were recorded with excitation set at 282 nm; slit widths were set at 8 nm for excitation and 12 nm for emission. A glass filter with a cutoff of 320 nm was utilized to circumvent secondary Rayleigh scattering. Tb3+ titration and metal competition assays were performed as described previously (24Huang Y. Zhou Y. Yang W. Butters R. Lee H.W. Li S. Castiblanco A. Brown E.M. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19000-19010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 500 mm K+, 10 μm La3+, 10 μm Gd3+, 1 mm Mg2+, and 1 mm Ca2+, respectively, was used to selectively compete with Tb3+. Each experiment was carried out independently in triplicate. PcDNA-mGluR1α (donated by Dr. Randy Hall's laboratory) contained a FLAG tag at the N terminus of the receptor, and mCherry was genetically fused to the C terminus with a linker, GGNSGG. After 2 days of transient expression of mGluR1α and its mutants (D318I, D322I, E325I, and N335I) in HEK293 cells grown on polylysine-coated dishes, cells were incubated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1/1000 anti-FLAG and 1/100 fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and fixed using 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After being washed three times with 1× TBS, the receptors on the cell surface were then labeled with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then collected in 1× PBS, and the intensity of green and red fluorescence was measured using LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). The ratios of green and red fluorescence from mGluR1α and the mutated receptors were normalized to the amount of receptors expressing on the cell surface relative to total receptors (total cellular expression of receptor). Data were collected from three dishes. Measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed as described (24Huang Y. Zhou Y. Yang W. Butters R. Lee H.W. Li S. Castiblanco A. Brown E.M. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19000-19010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, wild type mGluR1α and its mutants (D318I, D322I, D324I, E325I, and E328I) were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells and cultured for 2 additional days. The cells on the coverslips were subsequently loaded using 4 μm Fura-2 AM in 2 ml of physiological saline buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.55 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The coverslips were mounted in a bathing chamber on the stage of a fluorescence microscope. Fura-2 emission signals from single cells excited at 340 or 380 nm were collected utilizing a Leica DM6000 fluorescence microscope in real time as the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ was increased in a stepwise manner. The ratio of emitted fluorescence at 510 nm resulting from excitation at 340 or 380 nm was further analyzed to obtain the intracellular Ca2+ response as a function of changes in [Ca2+]o. Then, the sensitivity of mGluR1α and its mutants (D322I, D324I, E325I, and E328I) to extracellular glutamate was measured by increasing the extracellular glutamate concentration in the presence of 1.8 mm Ca2+. The glutamate concentrations at which the intracellular Ca2+ responses of mGluR1α and its mutants were first observed and, subsequently, saturated were determined. Moreover, to further characterize the influence of [Ca2+]o to Glu-induced [Ca2+]i release through wild type mGluR1α, an additional 5 or 10 mm Ca2+ was added to the perfusate. [Ca2+]i was measured as described above during changes in [Ca2+]o and/or Glu. Changes in [Ca2+]i in response to the addition of Gd3+ were determined as just described. Specifically, cells were incubated in incubation buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) for up to 1.5 h, and Gd3+ (made up in 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KOH, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) was added at the concentrations described under “Results.” The [Ca2+]i responses of mGluR1α after the introduction of mutations in the Glu-binding site were measured similarly. At each agonist concentration, all of the transfected cells in the microscopic field from three independent experiments were selected for analysis, and at least 60% of the cells displaying normal responses were analyzed. The cells that did not respond to the agonists or displayed a sigmoidal curve with a stable plateau after treatment with high [Ca2+]o were excluded. These latter cells maintained a constant, high plateau of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, perhaps because the plasma membrane was excessively permeable to Ca2+. To normalize the concentration response curves for the responses to [Ca2+]o, the maximal response of wild type mGluR1α to extracellular Glu was set at 100% so that the maximal responses of mutant receptors to [Ca2+]o or Glu were transformed into percentages relative to the response of WT mGluR1α to Glu. Data were fitted using the Hill equation as described previously (23Huang Y. Zhou Y. Castiblanco A. Yang W. Brown E.M. Yang J.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We recently developed the computational algorithm MUG, which predicts Ca2+-binding sites using graph theory by identifying all possible liganding oxygen clusters and finding maximal cliques. The positions of Ca2+ and its liganding groups in 144 calcium-binding proteins can be predicted with 0.22–0.49 Å accuracy by geometric filters established on the basis of an extensive survey of known Ca2+-binding sites in the Protein Data Bank (19Kirberger M. Wang X. Deng H. Yang W. Chen G. Yang J.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 1169-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To accommodate Ca2+-induced conformational changes, the side chains of putative Ca2+-binding ligand residues were subjected to rotation using a rotamer library (MUGSR) (48Wong X. Zhao K. Kirberger M. Wong H. Chen G. Yang J. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows one predicted Ca2+-binding site identified here in the crystal structure of the mGluR1α ECD (PDB entry code: 1EWK) using the MUG algorithm. Two other predicted sites not included in this report were also revealed by MUG, one of them (site 2) residing in the Mg2+-binding pocket (Leu-86—Gly-102) inferred from the crystal structure and the other one located within a long loop (Asp-125—Lys-153) that was invisible in the crystal structure because of its high flexibility and was repaired using Modeler (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10551) Google Scholar). The third predicted Ca2+-binding site (site 3), encompassing Ser-129 to Gly-144, was present within this missing loop. The predicted Ca2+-binding site studied in detail here comprises the carboxyl side chains of Asp-318 and Glu-325, the main chain carbonyl Asp-322 in a flexible loop of mGluR1α, and the carboxyl side chain of Glu-701 (a ligand for glutamate). This predicted Ca2+-binding site is located at the hinge region in the ECD adjacent to the reported Glu-binding site (Arg-74, Ser-165, Thr-188, Asp-208, Tyr-236, Asp-318, and Lys-409) (15Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 25Sato T. Shimada Y. Nagasawa N. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4314-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with Asp-318 predicted to be involved in both Glu and Ca2+ binding. Thus, Ca2+ and Glu, when bound to the receptor, both bind to Asp-318. Asp-318 and Asp-322 can be identified in the Glu-free form (PDB entry code: 1EWT), whereas the direct binding of Ca2+ to the carboxyl side chain of the agonist Glu-701 is visualized only in the Glu-loaded form (PDB entry code: 1EWK). Thus, the agonist Glu provides an additional ligand for Ca2+ when the former is bound to the receptor, which is very different from intracellular Ca2+-binding trigger proteins such as calmodulin that lack any additional chelating groups from molecules other than the residues within the Ca2+-binding protein itself, except for water. Fig. 1B shows that the predicted Ca2+-binding pocket has a highly negatively charged surface as revealed by Delphi in the structures of three solved forms of the ECD within mGluR1α (Fig. 1B). To probe the Ca2+-binding capability of the predicted Ca2+-binding site in mGluR1α, we utilized our grafting approach by inserting the protein sequence encompassing the putative mGluR1α Ca2+-binding site into the host protein, CD2.D1 (denoted as CD2-mGluR1-1). The inserted sequence contains all predicted Ca2+-binding residues except Glu-701. This approach had previously enabled us to obtain site-specific Ca2+ binding affinities of the EF-hand motifs from calmodulin and linear Ca2+ binding sequences, free from the limitations of working with membrane proteins (32Ye Y. Lee H.W. Yang W. Shealy S. Yang J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3743-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Ye Y. Shealy S. Lee H.W. Torshin I. Harrison R. Yang J.J. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The putative mGluR1α Ca2+-binding site was flanked by flexible triple-Gly linkers and inserted between Ser-52 and Gly-53 of CD2.D1 (Fig. 2A) to ensure a native-like conformation and close proximity (<15∼20 Å) to Trp-32 in order to enhance the Tb3+-LRET signal. Indeed, grafting the putative Ca2+-binding loop from mGluR1α did not significantly change the secondary and tertiary structures of CD2, as revealed by circular dichroism, Trp fluorescence, and NMR chemical shifts (supplemental Fig. S1). Fig. 2B shows that Tb3+ (which has the same coordination chemistry as Ca2+) elicits an increase in fluorescence of CD2.D1 at 550 nm when excited at 280 nm due to Tb3+- LRET. CD2.D1 had a Tb3+ binding affinity of 49 ± 9 μm (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Ca2+ displaced bound Tb3+ (Fig. 2B), thereby decreasing the Tb3+-LRET signal. CD2.D1 has a Ca2+ dissociation constant of 1.80 ± 0.12 mm determined in this manner (Table 1).TABLE 1Tb3+ binding affinities of the engineered protein CD2.D1 and its double mutants (n = 3)ProteinsMutationsDissociation constant (Kd)CD2.D1WT49 ± 9 μm (Ca2+, 1.8 ± 0.1 mm)CD2.D1-1E331/E333I85 ± 18 μm*p < 0.05.CD2.D1-2D324/E325I113 ± 5 μmCD2.D1-3D318/D322I>4.8 mm*p < 0.05.CD2.D1-4E328/N335I299 ± 15 μm*p < 0.05.* p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Because mGluR1α is modulated by various polyvalent cations, including Ca2+, Gd3+, Tb3+, La3+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ (6Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Murata Y. Science. 1998; 279: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we tested the metal binding selectivity of CD2.D1 by applying K+, Mg2+, La3+, or Gd3+ to compete with prebound Tb3+. Fig. 2C shows that the luminescence intensity of Tb3+ decreased significantly upon adding trivalent La3+ or Gd3+, indicating that Tb3+ bound to the pocket was replaced by these metal ions. Gd3+ had the strongest capacity to displace Tb3+. Similarly, adding La3+ to CD2.D1 produced a split in the resonance of CD2.D1 at 10 ppm (Fig. 2D). Ca2+ competed more effectively than Mg2+, whereas K+ failed to compete with Tb3+. Next, we utilized mutagenesis studies to examine the contribution of proposed ligand-binding residues to metal-binding capability. Double substitutions of negatively charged residues by Ile to delete negative charges but preserve bulky side chains in the proposed binding pocket, as seen in the mutants D324I/E325I, D318I/D322I, and E328I/N335I, produced 2.3-, 6.1-, or 98-fold increases in the respective dissociation constant values (Fig. 2, B and E). However, removing the negative charges from the non-Ca2+-binding residues, Glu-331 and Glu-333 (E331I/E333I) (Fig. 2, B and E) produced a less than 2-fold change in the Kd, with a modest alteration in Tb3+ binding to the predicted binding pocket.

Purified human T cells from healthy subjects were pretreated or not with CCL18, and evaluated for cytokine production. CCL18-pretreated memory but not naive CD4(+) T cells exhibited an increased production of IL-10 (12.3 ± 2.6 vs. 5.6 ± 0.9 ng/ml for medium) and TGF-β1 but not IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-17 compared with control cells. Pretreatment of highly purified CD4(+)CD25(-) memory T cells with CCL18 led to their conversion to CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells able to inhibit the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells by both cytokine and cell contact-dependent mechanisms. However, this regulatory effect of CCL18 was lost when T cells originated from allergic subjects in relation with a decreased binding of CCL18 to these cells [0.7 ± 0.3 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)] as compared to those from healthy subjects (6.0 ± 1.7 MFI). This study is the first to define a chemokine that generates adaptive regulatory T cells from CD4(+)CD25(-) memory T cells. This mechanism appears defective in allergic patients and may underlie the decreased tolerance observed in allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1981399938,"GATA transcription factors have been implicated in controlling adipogenesis in Drosophila and in mammals. In mammals, both GATA2 and GATA3 have been shown to be present in preadipocytes, and their silencing allows the onset of adipogenesis. Overexpression of GATA proteins blocks adipogenesis in cellular assays. GATA factors have been found to operate through recruiting cofactors of the Friend of GATA (FOG) family. FOG proteins, in turn, recruit co-regulators, including C-terminal binding proteins (CTBPs). We have investigated whether FOGs and CTBPs influence adipogenesis. We found that both FOG1 and FOG2 are expressed in cells prior to adipogenesis but are down-regulated as adipogenesis proceeds. Overexpression of FOG1 or FOG2 interferes with adipogenesis. Mutant versions of FOG2 unable to bind CTBP or GATA proteins are impaired in their inability to inhibit adipogenesis. Finally, a mutant version of GATA2, unable to associate with FOGs, also displays abnormal activity and causes enhanced cell proliferation. These results implicate FOGs and CTBPs as partners of GATA proteins in the control of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation."

However, although Mdm2 functions as a ubiquitin ligase for p53, MdmX does not have appreciable ubiquitin ligase activity. In this study, we performed a mutational analysis of the RING domain of MdmX, and we identified two distinct regions that, when replaced by the respective regions of Mdm2, turn MdmX into an active ubiquitin ligase for p53. Mdm2 and MdmX form homodimers as well as heterodimers with each other. One of the regions identified localizes to the dimer interface indicating that subtle conformational changes in this region either affect dimer stability and/or the interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5b. The second region contains the cryptic nucleolar localization signal of Mdm2 but is also assumed to be involved in the interaction with UbcH5b. Here, we show that this region has a significant impact on the ability of respective MdmX mutants to functionally interact with UbcH5b in vitro supporting the notion that this region serves two distinct functional purposes, nucleolar localization and ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, evidence is provided to suggest that the RING domain of Mdm2 not only binds to UbcH5b but also acts as an allosteric activator of UbcH5b.

Genetic experiments in mice have shown that the related proteins Mdm2 and MdmX are critical regulators of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Knock-out of the mdm2 or the mdm4 gene (encoding MdmX) causes embryonic lethality, which is rescued by concomitant deletion of the p53 gene (1Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A.

Mdm2 and MdmX share significant structural similarity, with the most conserved regions being the p53-binding domain within the N terminus of the respective protein, a central zinc- binding domain of unknown function, and a C-terminal RING domain (11Wade M.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In many cases, RING or RING-like domains have been shown to represent interaction sites for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and thus, the presence of a RING domain is commonly assumed to be indicative for proteins with the function of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (17Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 18Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Indeed, Mdm2 has E3 ligase activity and in concert with members of the UbcH5 subfamily of E2s targets p53 for ubiquitination and degradation (20Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H.

It rather acts as a stimulator of the E3 activity of Mdm2 via heterocomplex formation, which is mediated by the respective RING domains of Mdm2 and MdmX (12Badciong J.C. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49668-49675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Linares L.K. Hengstermann A. Ciechanover A. Müller S. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Indeed, di- or multimeric forms of Mdm2 rather than Mdm2 monomers have E3 activity (14Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mdm2-MdmX heteromers appear to be thermodynamically more stable than Mdm2 homomers providing a possible explanation for the observation that MdmX stimulates Mdm2 activity (25Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, Mdm2 but not MdmX contains amino acid sequence motifs for nuclear localization as well as nuclear export (11Wade M. Wang Y.V. Wahl G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 299-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 16Marine J.C. Jochemsen A.G.

Consequently, Mdm2 can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol, whereas the subcellular localization of MdmX depends on its interaction with Mdm2 or p53 (28Migliorini D. Danovi D. Colombo E.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7562-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Finally, there is evidence to indicate that Mdm2 controls the levels of MdmX and vice versa (13Linares L.K. Hengstermann A.

In conclusion, the available data indicate that Mdm2 and MdmX cooperate to control the turnover rate of each other as well as that of p53. Structural studies identified the amino acid residues of the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX that are involved in Mdm2 homodimer formation and Mdm2-MdmX heterodimer formation, respectively, and did not reveal any significant differences between the Mdm2 homodimer and the Mdm2-MdmX heterodimer (the structure of the RING domain of MdmX alone has not yet been reported) (27Linke K.

Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 433-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in silico comparisons with structures of RING domains of other E3s with their cognate E2 enzymes indicate that the amino acid residues of the Mdm2 RING domain that are presumably involved in E2 interaction are at least in part conserved in the MdmX RING domain (27Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33Kostic M. Matt T. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 433-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, to identify the regions within the RING domain of Mdm2 that render it an active E3 ligase for p53, we performed a mutational analysis of the RING domain of MdmX. The results obtained indicate that a region at the interface of the RING-RING dimer and a region overlapping with the cryptic nucleolar localization signal of Mdm2 (34Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) are critical for E3 activity. In addition, the latter region affects the ability of the isolated RING domain of respective MdmX mutants to stimulate UbcH5b activity. H1299 cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Mdm2/MdmX/p53 triple knock-out mice (kindly provided by J. C. Marine, Ghent, Belgium) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS.

For ubiquitination of p53 within cells, one 6-cm plate of H1299 cells was transfected with expression constructs encoding p53 (200 ng), His-tagged ubiquitin (1 μg), Mdm2, MdmX, or the respective MdmX mutants (1 μg). 24 h after transfection, 30% of the cells were lysed under nondenaturing conditions as described previously (14Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to determine expression levels of Mdm2, the various forms of MdmX, and GFP. The remaining cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, and ubiquitinated proteins were purified as described previously (14Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To monitor degradation of ectopically expressed p53 within cells, one 6-cm plate of H1299 cells or one 10-cm plate of mouse embryo fibroblasts was transfected with expression constructs encoding p53 (50 ng), Mdm2, MdmX, or the respective MdmX mutants (200 ng). Protein extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection as described previously (13Linares L.K. Hengstermann A. Ciechanover A. Müller S. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 14Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and p53 levels were determined by Western blot analysis. An obvious explanation for the observation that MdmX is not active or is only weakly active as an E3 ligase is the notion that MdmX does not interact or only poorly interacts with UbcH5b. As we previously reported that Mdm2 detectably interacts with UbcH5b in the yeast two-hybrid system but not under the conditions of an in vitro coprecipitation experiment (14Singh R.K. Iyappan S. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10901-10907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the ability of the RING domain of MdmX to interact with UbcH5b was tested in yeast. This showed that the RING domain of MdmX interacted with UbcH5b, although slightly less efficiently than the RING domain of Mdm2 (data not shown). To corroborate this finding, the ability of the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX to bind to UbcH5b was additionally studied by size exclusion chromatography. Under the conditions used, UbcH5b co-migrated with both Mdm2 and MdmX (supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicate that there is no large difference between the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX in their ability to bind to UbcH5b in vitro. Thus, the inability of MdmX to act as an E3 ligase for p53 does not appear to be due to the notion that MdmX cannot interact with UbcH5b. To obtain information about the regions of the MdmX RING domain that prevent it from acting as an E3 ligase for p53, cDNAs encoding MdmX variants with chimeric RING domains consisting of distinct parts of the RING domain of MdmX and Mdm2 were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). The respective proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Upon purification, the MdmX mutants were tested for their ability to ubiquitinate in vitro translated 35S-labeled p53 (Fig. 1B). The results obtained show that replacement of the asparagine residue at position 448 of MdmX (numbering according to human MdmX) by cysteine, the respective residue of Mdm2, results in an MdmX mutant that can efficiently ubiquitinate p53 in vitro. Furthermore, substitution of residues surrounding Asn-448 by the respective Mdm2 residues, most importantly residues 450 and 453, result in MdmX mutants that ubiquitinate p53 in vitro with an efficiency similar to wild-type Mdm2 (as determined in titration experiments; data not shown). It was previously reported that in addition to an intact RING domain, the central region of Mdm2 (amino acids 202–302) containing the so-called acidic domain (Fig. 2A) is required for p53 ubiquitylation and degradation within cells (37Meulmeester E. Frenk R. Stad R. de Graaf P. Marine J.C. Vousden K.H. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Indeed, a chimeric protein consisting of the RING domain of Mdm2 fused to amino acid residues 1–434 of MdmX was not able to target p53 for degradation in coexpression experiments (Fig. 2C, X/2), whereas the respective chimera containing the central region of Mdm2 (Fig. 2C, AD-X/2) was active (note that in the in vitro system, the central region of Mdm2 is not required for p53 ubiquitination; see under “Discussion”). Thus, to determine whether substitution of amino acids 445–453 of MdmX by the respective amino acids of Mdm2 results in an MdmX mutant that can target p53 for ubiquitination and degradation within cells, the central region of the MdmX mutant CH6 (Fig. 1A) was replaced by the central region of Mdm2 (Fig. 2, AD-CH6). However, neither CH6 nor AD-CH6 was able to target p53 for degradation (Fig. 2C) or for ubiquitination (Fig. 3). This indicates that the requirements for p53 ubiquitination in vitro are different from those for p53 ubiquitination and degradation within cells. To determine the regions of the Mdm2 RING domain that are required for p53 ubiquitination/degradation within cells, cDNAs encoding additional chimeric proteins were generated (Fig. 2B). Coexpression of the respective proteins with p53 revealed that besides N448C, a region spanning amino acids 465–480 (numbering according to human MdmX) is required for both p53 degradation (Fig. 2C) and p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 3) within cells. Amino acids 465–480 contain the cryptic nucleolar localization signal (465–473) of Mdm2 (Fig. 2) (34Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. C"

https://openalex.org/W2076929782,"Several missense mutations in the protein kinase Cγ (γPKC) gene have been found to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. We previously demonstrated that the mutant γPKC found in SCA14 is susceptible to aggregation, which induces apoptotic cell death. The disaccharide trehalose has been reported to inhibit aggregate formation and to alleviate symptoms in cellular and animal models of Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, and prion disease. Here, we show that trehalose can be incorporated into SH-SY5Y cells and reduces the aggregation of mutant γPKC-GFP, thereby inhibiting apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells and primary cultured Purkinje cells (PCs). Trehalose acts by directly stabilizing the conformation of mutant γPKC without affecting protein turnover. Trehalose was also found to alleviate the improper development of dendrites in PCs expressing mutant γPKC-GFP without aggregates but not in PCs with aggregates. In PCs without aggregates, trehalose improves the mobility and translocation of mutant γPKC-GFP, probably by inhibiting oligomerization and thereby alleviating the improper development of dendrites. These results suggest that trehalose counteracts various cellular dysfunctions that are triggered by mutant γPKC in both neuronal cell lines and primary cultured PCs by inhibiting oligomerization and aggregation of mutant γPKC."
https://openalex.org/W2032620170,"Background Hyphal growth and multidrug resistance of C. albicans are important features for virulence and antifungal therapy of this pathogenic fungus. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show by phenotypic complementation analysis that the C. albicans gene AGE3 is the functional ortholog of the yeast ARF-GAP-encoding gene GCS1. The finding that the gene is required for efficient endocytosis points to an important functional role of Age3p in endosomal compartments. Most C. albicans age3Δ mutant cells which grew as cell clusters under yeast growth conditions showed defects in filamentation under different hyphal growth conditions and were almost completely disabled for invasive filamentous growth. Under hyphal growth conditions only a fraction of age3Δ cells shows a wild-type-like polarization pattern of the actin cytoskeleton and lipid rafts. Moreover, age3Δ cells were highly susceptible to several unrelated toxic compounds including antifungal azole drugs. Irrespective of the AGE3 genotype, C-terminal fusions of GFP to the drug efflux pumps Cdr1p and Mdr1p were predominantly localized in the plasma membrane. Moreover, the plasma membranes of wild-type and age3Δ mutant cells contained similar amounts of Cdr1p, Cdr2p and Mdr1p. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that the defect in sustaining filament elongation is probably caused by the failure of age3Δ cells to polarize the actin cytoskeleton and possibly of inefficient endocytosis. The high susceptibility of age3Δ cells to azoles is not caused by inefficient transport of efflux pumps to the cell membrane. A possible role of a vacuolar defect of age3Δ cells in drug susceptibility is proposed and discussed. In conclusion, our study shows that the ARF-GAP Age3p is required for hyphal growth which is an important virulence factor of C. albicans and essential for detoxification of azole drugs which are routinely used for antifungal therapy. Thus, it represents a promising antifungal drug target."
https://openalex.org/W1965451351,"Disturbances in intracellular calcium homeostasis are likely prominent and causative factors leading to neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Familial AD (FAD) is early-onset and exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. FAD-linked mutations have been found in the genes encoding the presenilins and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Several studies have shown that mutated presenilin proteins can directly affect calcium release from intracellular stores independently of Aβ production. Although less well established, there is also evidence that APP may directly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis. Here, we directly examined whether overexpression of FAD-linked APP mutants alters intracellular calcium dynamics. In contrast to previous studies, we found that overexpression of mutant APP has no effects on basal cytosolic calcium, ER calcium store size or agonist-induced calcium release and subsequent entry. Thus, we conclude that mutated APP associated with FAD has no direct effect on intracellular calcium homeostasis independently of Aβ production."
https://openalex.org/W1969166228,"The establishment of epithelial cell polarity requires the assembly of multiprotein complexes and is crucial during epithelial morphogenesis. Three scaffolding proteins, Dlg1, MPP7, and Mals3, can be assembled to form a complex that functions in the establishment and maintenance of apicobasal polarity in epithelial tissues through their L27 domains. Here we report the crystal structure of a 4-L27-domain complex derived from the human tripartite complex Dlg1-MPP7-Mals3 in combination with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements. The heterotrimer consists of 2 pairs of heterodimeric L27 domains. These 2 dimers are asymmetric due to the large difference between the N- and C-terminal tandem L27 domain of MPP7. Structural analysis combined with biochemical experiments further reveals that the loop αA-αB and helix αB of the C-terminal L27 domain of MPP7 play a critical role in assembling the entire tripartite complex, suggesting a synergistic tandem L27-mediated assembling event."
https://openalex.org/W2157118584,"Background Pertussis toxin (PTX), an exotoxin of Bordetella pertussis, enhances the development of experimental autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rodent models. The mechanisms of the promotion of experimental autoimmune diseases by PTX may be based upon PTX-induced disruption of the blood eye/brain barriers facilitating the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the modulation of inflammatory cell migration and the enhancement of the activation of inflammatory cells. We hypothesized that the facilitation of experimental autoimmunity by PTX suggests that its influence on the in vivo immune response to auto-antigen may differ from its influence on non-self antigens. Methodology/Principal Findings We have evaluated the effect of PTX on the simultaneous generation of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and autoimmune responses to uveitogenic interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein peptide (IRBP161–180), encephalitogenic myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG35–55) or ovalbumin (OVA). PTX injection of mice immunized to IRBP peptide161–180 led to (i) the development of EAU as shown by histopathology of the retina, (ii) pro-inflammatory cytokine production by splenocytes in response to IRBP peptide 161–180, and (iii) symptomatic EAE in mice immunized with encephalitogenic MOG peptide35–55. However, mice that received PTX had a reduced DTH response to IRBP161–180 peptide or MOG peptide35–55 when challenged distal to the site affected by autoreactive T cells. Moreover, footpad challenge with MOG35–55 peptide reduced EAE in mice immunized with MOG peptide. In contrast, the use of PTX when immunizing with OVA protein or an OVA immunogenic peptide did not affect the DTH response to OVA. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that that the reduced DTH response in mice receiving PTX may be specific for autoantigens and autoantigen-reactive T cells are diverted away from ectopic sites that received the autoantigen and towards the tissue site of the autoantigen."
