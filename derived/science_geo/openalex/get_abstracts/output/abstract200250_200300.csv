If, for example, it were possible to infer that smoking cigarettes is a cause of this disease, it would equally be possible to infer on exactly similar grounds that inhaling cigarette smoke was a practice of considerable prophylactic value in preventing the disease, for the practice of inhaling is rarer among patients with cancer of the lung than with others."

https://openalex.org/W1974829307,"IN the dilution method of counting Desulphovibrio in soil or water, a selective medium containing lactate and inorganic salts is commonly employed. The growth of a sulphate reducer is recognized by the appearance of the black colour of ferrous sulphide. Since the organisms are anaerobes and the medium is simple in composition the addition of a reducing agent is essential. Grossman and Postgate1 selected cysteine as the most suitable of the reducing substances they examined. Cysteine possesses the disadvantage that it may be attacked with the liberation of sulphide by certain bacteria which do not reduce sulphate. Hence it is necessary to apply some test to confirm the presence of Desulphovibrio in cultures which become black. A further disadvantage in the method proposed by Grossman and Postgate is that the cultures are incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere."

For example, both vanadium and members of the rare-earth group are capable of producing a fatty infiltration of the liver. Furthermore, vanadium can cause a marked reduction in cholesterol and phospholipids1 2. In this connexion, work has been directed towards investigating a possible prophylactic action of vanadium against atherosclerosis2; it has been suggested that disruption of the endogenous balance of the transition elements in the liver could underlie the pathogenesis of this disease1."

https://openalex.org/W2048521429,"IN previous publications1–3 we have reported the effect of various steroids, stilbenes and aliphatic hydrocarbons on the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system, intimating that the strongest stimulants possessed high œstrogenicity. The present communication records the relative effect on phagocytic activity of the substances which we have found to depress the reticulo-endothelial macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2067033386,"LOWERING of the blood cholesterol level by means of large doses of nicotinic acid has been described by Altschul1, and this effect has been confirmed by others2. This effect is caused by nicotinic acid only and its mechanism has not yet been clarified. The use of the amide of the nicotinic acid is said to be without effect."

https://openalex.org/W1988279700,"THE lack of clarity prevailing among yeast cytologists as to the mode of budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae tempted us to study this process by means of an improved ultra-thin sectioning technique. This technique has enabled us to observe nuclear behaviour during bud formation and subsequent division. Except for substitution of potassium permanganate for osmium tetroxide as the fixative, the method of preparing specimens for ultra-thin sections was exactly the same as previously reported1,2. A distillers yeast, S. cerevisiae M-1, was grown in a broth medium for several hours at 25° C. with aeration by means of vigorous shaking. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with distilled water. The washed cells were then fixed in a 1.5 per cent aqueous solution of potassium permanganate at room temperature for 30 min. The time of fixation and concentration of permanganate were critical for preservation of internal cell structure. Explosion was minimized by prolonged treatment of the cells with cold partially polymerized n-butyl methacrylate. The sections were cut on a Porter–Blum microtome and observed in an RCA model EMU-2b electron microscope. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show three parallel sections of a budding yeast cell. It is interesting that the conspicuous invagination of the dividing nucleus is situated a short distance away from the constricted cell wall of the bud. The difference in the planes of constriction between the nucleus and the cell wall seems to be a routine occurrence and is considered characteristic of vegetative division in S. cerevisiae. This suggests that there is some mechanism which regulates the constriction of the nucleus at this point other than the simple pressure of the constricting cell wall. Close observation of these figures reveals that the constriction starts at certain points rather than being initiated uniformly around the site of constriction. The presence of the nuclear membrane throughout vegetative nuclear division implies that typical mitosis in S. cerevisiae, at least in the strict sense of the word, is lacking. Chromosomal figures which have been observed in the nuclei of the cells of higher organisms3–5 have not been detected in either the nuclear vesicle or on the nuclear membrane during any stage of the nuclear division. Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate somewhat later stages of nuclear division during bud-formation."

I have observed that certain particle-bound enzymes in homogenates of the fat body of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria Forsk.) can be separated partially by differential centrifuging, and conclude that there are (at least) two distinct types of particles which resemble mammalian liver mitochondria and microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W2095527764,"THE work of Smith and Larson1, van Reen2 and van Reen and Pearson3 has revealed that the dietary ingestion of toxic levels of zinc results in a marked inhibition of growth and deranged iron metabolism in rats. The latter effect was reflected in anæmia and decreased levels of liver catalase and cytochrome oxidase. Liver extract partially counteracted the growth inhibition, while minute supplements of copper to the toxic diet reversed the anæmic condition1 and restored the levels of the iron enzymes2. From such results it has been concluded that the inhibition of growth is unrelated to the enzymic changes observed, and that the two phenomena are distinct and different effects of zinc toxicity in the animal organism."

https://openalex.org/W2017646211,"WHEN the distribution of active materials in vertebrate tissue is being studied, it is necessary to free tissue extracts from substances which interfere with the bioassay of 5-hydroxytryptamine. Garven1 has described a method for the destruction of polyphenols by the polyphenol oxidase present in mushroom juice. The juice contains both polyphenol and monophenol oxidase, and her method therefore makes use of the faster inactivation of adrenaline and noradrenaline by polyphenol oxidase than of 5-hydroxytryptamine by monophenol oxidase. The present method depends on the differential stability of 5-hydroxytryptamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in alkaline solution."
https://openalex.org/W2041819388,"IN many cases of toxic anæmia refractile granules, generally known as Heinz bodies, are formed in the red blood cells. These inclusions may be identified by their intense basophilia when stained supravitally; after fixation with alcohol they lose this property and as a result are not usually seen in Romanowsky-stained blood films. In these anæmias there is an associated fragmentation and distortion of the red blood cells."

https://openalex.org/W2009686129,"TRICALCIUM phosphate (calcium/phosphorus weight ratio, 1.94) is thought to be hydroxylapatite (calcium/phosphorus, 2.15) with phosphate ions chemi-sorbed. When immersed in lime solutions, this tricalcium phosphate becomes more alkaline and the ratio rises to 2.15. Kinetic studies of lime fixation show that the reaction is not instantaneous. Therefore, it is questionable whether phosphate ions previously in excess should be located on the surface only. On the other hand, the existence of cation defects in the crystalline lattice itself is unlikely."
