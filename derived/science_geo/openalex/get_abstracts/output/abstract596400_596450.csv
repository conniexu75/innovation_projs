https://openalex.org/W2764306162,"South Africa faces an epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), yet national surveillance is limited due to the lack of recent data. We used data from the first comprehensive national survey on NCDs-the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1 (2011-2012))-to evaluate the prevalence of and health system response to diabetes through a diabetes care cascade. We defined diabetes as a Hemoglobin A1c equal to or above 6.5% or currently on treatment for diabetes. We constructed a diabetes care cascade by categorizing the population with diabetes into those who were unscreened, screened but undiagnosed, diagnosed but untreated, treated but uncontrolled, and treated and controlled. We then used multivariable logistic regression models to explore factors associated with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. The age-standardized prevalence of diabetes in South Africans aged 15+ was 10.1%. Prevalence rates were higher among the non-white population and among women. Among individuals with diabetes, a total of 45.4% were unscreened, 14.7% were screened but undiagnosed, 2.3% were diagnosed but untreated, 18.1% were treated but uncontrolled, and 19.4% were treated and controlled, suggesting that 80.6% of the diabetic population had unmet need for care. The diabetes care cascade revealed significant losses from lack of screening, between screening and diagnosis, and between treatment and control. These results point to significant unmet need for diabetes care in South Africa. Additionally, this analysis provides a benchmark for evaluating efforts to manage the rising burden of diabetes in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2763980391,"In this paper we evaluate the three main methods for correcting the susceptibility-induced artefact in diffusion-weighted magnetic-resonance (DW-MR) data, and assess how correction is affected by the susceptibility field’s interaction with motion. The susceptibility artefact adversely impacts analysis performed on the data and is typically corrected in post-processing. Correction strategies involve either registration to a structural image, the application of an acquired field-map or the use of additional images acquired with different phase-encoding. Unfortunately, the choice of which method to use is made difficult by the absence of any systematic comparisons of them. In this work we quantitatively evaluate these methods, by extending and employing a recently proposed framework that allows for the simulation of realistic DW-MR datasets with artefacts. Our analysis separately evaluates the ability for methods to correct for geometric distortions and to recover lost information in regions of signal compression. In terms of geometric distortions, we find that registration-based methods offer the poorest correction. Field-mapping techniques are better, but are influenced by noise and partial volume effects, whilst multiple phase-encode methods performed best. We use our simulations to validate a popular surrogate metric of correction quality, the comparison of corrected data acquired with AP and LR phase-encoding, and apply this surrogate to real datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that failing to account for the interaction of the susceptibility field with head movement leads to increased errors when analysing DW-MR data. None of the commonly used post-processing methods account for this interaction, and we suggest this may be a valuable area for future methods development."
https://openalex.org/W2761467979,"The translocator protein (TSPO) is a mitochondrial membrane protein, of as yet uncertain function. Its purported high expression on activated macrophages, has lent utility to TSPO targeted molecular imaging in the form of positron emission tomography (PET), as a means to detect and quantify inflammation in vivo. However, existing literature regarding TSPO expression on human activated macrophages is lacking, mostly deriving from brain tissue studies, including studies of brain malignancy, and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Here, we utilized three human sources of monocyte derived macrophages (MDM), from THP-1 monocytes, healthy peripheral blood monocytes and synovial fluid monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, to undertake a detailed investigation of TSPO expression in activated macrophages. In this work, we demonstrate a consistent down-regulation of TSPO mRNA and protein in macrophages activated to a pro-inflammatory, or ‘M1’ phenotype. Conversely, stimulation of macrophages to an M2 phenotype with IL-4, dexamethasone or TGF-β1 did not alter TSPO expression, regardless of MDM source. The reasons for this are uncertain, but our study findings add some supporting evidence for recent investigations concluding that TSPO may be involved in negative regulation of inflammatory responses in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2762292687,"Early and accurate identification of factors that predict post-stroke cognitive outcome is important to set realistic targets for rehabilitation and to guide patients and their families accordingly. However, behavioral measures of cognition are difficult to obtain in the acute phase of recovery due to clinical factors (e.g. fatigue) and functional barriers (e.g. language deficits). The aim of the current study was to test whether single channel wireless EEG data obtained acutely following stroke could predict longer-term cognitive function.Resting state Relative Power (RP) of delta, theta, alpha, beta, delta/alpha ratio (DAR), and delta/theta ratio (DTR) were obtained from a single electrode over FP1 in 24 participants within 72 hours of a first-ever stroke. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was administered at 90-days post-stroke. Correlation and regression analyses were completed to identify relationships between 90-day cognitive function and electrophysiological data, neurological status, and demographic characteristics at admission.Four acute qEEG indices demonstrated moderate to high correlations with 90-day MoCA scores: DTR (r = -0.57, p = 0.01), RP theta (r = 0.50, p = 0.01), RP delta (r = -0.47, p = 0.02), and DAR (r = -0.45, p = 0.03). Acute DTR (b = -0.36, p < 0.05) and stroke severity on admission (b = -0.63, p < 0.01) were the best linear combination of predictors of MoCA scores 90-days post-stroke, accounting for 75% of variance.Data generated by a single pre-frontal electrode support the prognostic value of acute DAR, and identify DTR as a potential marker of post-stroke cognitive outcome. Use of single channel recording in an acute clinical setting may provide an efficient and valid predictor of cognitive function after stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2763691785,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the progression of human cancer including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Although previous reports showed that miR-125b-5p was down-regulated in ESCC, the roles and mechanisms of loss of function of miR-125b-5p in ESCC were still unknown. Using microRNA microarray and GEO datasets, we found and confirmed that miR-125b-5p was down-regulated in ESCC tissues. In-vitro assays showed that ectopic miR-125b-5p expression repressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced cell senescence. We also found that miR-125b-5p reduced the expressions of cell cycle regulatory genes including CCNA2, CCND1 and CCNE1, and regulated the markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) including E-cadherin, N-cadherin and EMT associated transcription factor Slug, and also decreased the MMPs including MMP2, MMP7 and MMP13. Furthermore, the candidate target gene HMGA2 was negatively regulated by miR-125b-5p both in mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, knockdown of HMGA2 partially phenocopied the effects of miR-125b-5p overexpression on cell cycle regulators and EMT markers. In conclusion, our results suggested that overexpression of miR-125b-5p inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion partially by down-regulating HMGA2 in ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2762511562,"Objectives Sarcopenia is an emerging clinical challenge in an ageing population and is associated with serious negative health outcomes. This study aimed to assess the current state of the art regarding the knowledge about the concept of sarcopenia and practice of the diagnostic strategy and management of sarcopenia in a cohort of Dutch healthcare professionals (physicians, physiotherapists, dietitians and others) attending a lecture cycle on sarcopenia. Material and methods This longitudinal study included Dutch healthcare professionals (n = 223) who were asked to complete a questionnaire before, directly after and five months after (n = 80) attending a lecture cycle on the pathophysiology of sarcopenia, diagnostic strategy and management of sarcopenia, i.e. interventions and collaboration. Results Before attendance, 69.7% of healthcare professionals stated to know the concept of sarcopenia, 21.4% indicated to know how to diagnose sarcopenia and 82.6% had treated patients with suspected sarcopenia. 47.5% used their clinical view as diagnostic strategy. Handgrip strength was the most frequently used objective diagnostic measure (33.9%). Five months after attendance, reported use of diagnostic tests was increased, i.e. handgrip strength up to 67.4%, gait speed up to 72.1% and muscle mass up to 20.9%. Bottlenecks during implementation of the diagnostic strategy were experienced by 67.1%; lack of awareness among other healthcare professionals, acquisition of equipment and time constraints to perform the diagnostic measures were reported most often. Before attendance, 36.4% stated not to consult a physiotherapists or exercise therapists (PT/ET) or dietitian for sarcopenia interventions, 10.5% consulted a PT/ET, 32.7% a dietitian and 20.5% both a PT/ET and dietitian. Five months after attendance, these percentages were 28.3%, 21.7%, 30.0% and 20.0% respectively. Conclusion The concept of sarcopenia is familiar to most Dutch healthcare professionals but application in practice is hampered, mostly by lack of knowledge, availability of equipment, time constraints and lack of collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2763177371,"The Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies represent a turning point in the food inspection field, particularly for species identification in matrices composed of a blend of two or more species. In this study NGS technologies were applied by testing the usefulness of the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) in seafood traceability. Sixteen commercial surimi samples produced both in EU and non-EU countries were analysed. Libraries were prepared using a universal primer pair able to amplify a short 16SrRNA fragment from a wide range of fish and cephalopod species. The mislabelling rate of the samples was also evaluated. Overall, DNA from 13 families, 19 genera and 16 species of fish, and from 3 families, 3 genera and 3 species of cephalopods was found with the analysis. Samples produced in non-EU countries exhibited a higher variability in their composition. 37.5% of the surimi products were found to be mislabelled. Among them, 25% voluntary declared a species different from those identified and 25% (all produced in non-EU countries) did not report the presence of molluscs on the label, posing a potential health threat for allergic consumers. The use of vulnerable species was also proved. Although the protocol should be further optimized, PGM platform proved to be a useful tool for the analysis of complex, highly processed products."
https://openalex.org/W2762184964,"Dengue has been a major public health concern in Australia. This study has explored the spatio-temporal trends of dengue and potential socio- demographic and ecological determinants in Australia. Data on dengue cases, socio-demographic, climatic and land use types for the period January 1999 to December 2010 were collected from Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, respectively. Descriptive and linear regression analyses were performed to observe the spatio-temporal trends of dengue, socio-demographic and ecological factors in Australia. A total of 5,853 dengue cases (both local and overseas acquired) were recorded across Australia between January 1999 and December 2010. Most the cases (53.0%) were reported from Queensland, followed by New South Wales (16.5%). Dengue outbreak was highest (54.2%) during 2008–2010. A highest percentage of overseas arrivals (29.9%), households having rainwater tanks (33.9%), Indigenous population (27.2%), separate houses (26.5%), terrace house types (26.9%) and economically advantage people (42.8%) were also observed during 2008–2010. Regression analyses demonstrate that there was an increasing trend of dengue incidence, potential socio-ecological factors such as overseas arrivals, number of households having rainwater tanks, housing types and land use types (e.g. intensive uses and production from dryland agriculture). Spatial variation of socio-demographic factors was also observed in this study. In near future, significant increase of temperature was also projected across Australia. The projected increased temperature as well as increased socio-ecological trend may pose a future threat to the local transmission of dengue in other parts of Australia if Aedes mosquitoes are being established. Therefore, upgraded mosquito and disease surveillance at different ports should be in place to reduce the chance of mosquitoes and dengue cases being imported into all over Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2763177328,"HuR (ELAVL1), a RNA-binding protein, plays a key role in posttranscriptional regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR)-related genes. Among various HuR-regulated oncogenic transcripts, the activation of galectin-3/β-catenin survival pathway is critical to induce transcription of cyclin D1, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and/or multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). In this study, we aim to elucidate the HuR-regulating pathways related to epirubicin-mediated resistance in human colorectal carcinoma cells. The effects and mechanisms of epirubicin treatment on the expressions of upstream survival signals (e.g., β-catenin) and downstream MDR transporters (e.g., P-gp) and anti-apoptotic pathways (e.g., Bcl-2) were assessed with or without HuR knockdown (siHuR) or overexpression (overHuR; ectopic HuR or pcDNA3/HA-HuR). Our results showed that siHuR decreased transcriptional expressions of galectin-3, β-catenin, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, P-gp, MRP1, and MRP2 in epirubicin-treated colon cancer cells. Consistently, the co-treatment of epirubicin and siHuR diminished the expressions of galectin-3, ß-catenin, c-Myc, P-gp and MRP1. HuR silencing enhanced the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin in colon cancer cells. On the other hand, overHuR abolished such effects. Furthermore, siHuR significantly intensified epirubicin-mediated apoptosis via increasing reactive oxygen species and thus promoted the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin. The combined treatments of siHuR and epirubicin significantly reduced the expression of Bcl-2, but increased the expression of Bax, as well as activity and expression levels of caspase-3 and -9. In contrast, overHuR abrogated these effects. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which siHuR potentiated epirubicin-induced cytotoxicity via inhibiting galectin-3/β-catenin signaling, suppressing MDR transporters and provoking apoptosis. To our best knowledge, this is an innovative investigation linking the post-transcriptional control by HuR silencing to survival signaling repression, efflux transporter reversal and apoptosis induction. Our study thus provides a powerful regimen for circumventing MDR in colon cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2761888091,"In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the penal code prohibits the provision of abortion. In practice, however, it is widely accepted that the procedure can be performed to save the life of a pregnant woman. Although abortion is highly restricted, anecdotal evidence indicates that women often resort to clandestine abortions, many of which are unsafe. However, to date, there are no official statistics or reliable data to support this assertion.Our study provides the first estimates of the incidence of abortion and unintended pregnancy in Kinshasa.We applied the Abortion Incidence Complications Method (AICM) to estimate the incidence of abortion and unintended pregnancy. We used data from a Health Facilities Survey and a Prospective Morbidity Survey to determine the annual number of women treated for abortion complications at health facilities. We also employed data from a Health Professionals Survey to calculate a multiplier representing the number of abortions for every induced abortion complication treated in a health facility.In 2016, an estimated 37,865 women obtained treatment for induced abortion complications in health facilities in Kinshasa. For every woman treated in a facility, almost four times as many abortions occurred. In total, an estimated 146,713 abortions were performed, yielding an abortion rate of 56 per 1,000 women aged 15-49. Furthermore, more than 343,000 unintended pregnancies occurred, resulting in an unintended pregnancy rate of 147 per 1,000 women aged 15-49.Increasing contraceptive uptake can reduce the number of women who experience unintended pregnancies, and as a consequence, result in fewer women obtaining unsafe abortions, suffering abortion complications, and dying needlessly from unsafe abortion. Increasing access to safe abortion and improving post-abortion care are other measures that can be implemented to reduce unsafe abortion and/or its negative consequences, including maternal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2762717542,"Regional innovation performance is an important indicator for decision-making regarding the implementation of policies intended to support innovation. However, patterns in regional innovation structures are becoming increasingly diverse, complex and nonlinear. To address these issues, this study aims to develop a model based on a multi-output neural network. Both intra- and inter-regional determinants of innovation performance are empirically investigated using data from the 4th and 5th Community Innovation Surveys of NUTS 2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regions. The results suggest that specific innovation strategies must be developed based on the current state of input attributes in the region. Thus, it is possible to develop appropriate strategies and targeted interventions to improve regional innovation performance. We demonstrate that support of entrepreneurship is an effective instrument of innovation policy. We also provide empirical support that both business and government R&D activity have a sigmoidal effect, implying that the most effective R&D support should be directed to regions with below-average and average R&D activity. We further show that the multi-output neural network outperforms traditional statistical and machine learning regression models. In general, therefore, it seems that the proposed model can effectively reflect both the multiple-output nature of innovation performance and the interdependency of the output attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2763108326,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) have been implicated in promoting breast cancer growth and progression. While the autocrine effects of FGFR activation in tumor cells have been extensively studied, little is known about the effects of tumor cell-derived FGFs on cells in the microenvironment. Because FGF signaling has been implicated in the regulation of bone formation and osteoclast differentiation, we hypothesized that tumor cell-derived FGFs are capable of modulating osteoclast function and contributing to growth of metastatic lesions in the bone. Initial studies examining FGFR expression during osteoclast differentiation revealed increased expression of FGFR1 in osteoclasts during differentiation. Therefore, studies were performed to determine whether tumor cell-derived FGFs are capable of promoting osteoclast differentiation and activity. Using both non-transformed and transformed cell lines, we demonstrate that breast cancer cells express a number of FGF ligands that are known to activate FGFR1. Furthermore our results demonstrate that inhibition of FGFR activity using the clinically relevant inhibitor BGJ398 leads to reduced osteoclast differentiation and activity in vitro. Treatment of mice injected with tumor cells into the femurs with BGJ398 leads to reduced osteoclast activity and bone destruction. Together, these studies demonstrate that tumor cell-derived FGFs enhance osteoclast function and contribute to the formation of metastatic lesions in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2762367476,"Application of sunscreen is a widely used mechanism for protecting skin from the harmful effects of UV light. However, protection can only be achieved through effective application, and areas that are routinely missed are likely at increased risk of UV damage. Here we sought to determine if specific areas of the face are missed during routine sunscreen application, and whether provision of public health information is sufficient to improve coverage. To investigate this, 57 participants were imaged with a UV sensitive camera before and after sunscreen application: first visit; minimal pre-instruction, second visit; provided with a public health information statement. Images were scored using a custom automated image analysis process designed to identify areas of high UV reflectance, i.e. missed during sunscreen application, and analysed for 5% significance. Analyses revealed eyelid and periorbital regions to be disproportionately missed during routine sunscreen application (median 14% missed in eyelid region vs 7% in rest of face, p<0.01). Provision of health information caused a significant improvement in coverage to eyelid areas in general however, the medial canthal area was still frequently missed. These data reveal that a public health announcement-type intervention could be effective at improving coverage of high risk areas of the face, however high risk areas are likely to remain unprotected therefore other mechanisms of sun protection should be widely promoted such as UV blocking sunglasses."
https://openalex.org/W2762667718,"Importance In the U.S. presidential election of 2016, substantial shift in voting patterns occurred relative to previous elections. Although this shift has been associated with both education and race, the extent to which this shift was related to public health status is unclear. Objective To determine the extent to which county community health was associated with changes in voting between the presidential elections of 2016 and 2012. Design Ecological study with principal component analysis (PCA) using principal axis method to extract the components, then generalized linear regression. Setting General community. Participants All counties in the United States. Exposures Physically unhealthy days, mentally unhealthy days, percent food insecure, teen birth rate, primary care physician visit rate, age-adjusted mortality rate, violent crime rate, average health care costs, percent diabetic, and percent overweight or obese. Main outcome The percentage of Donald Trump votes in 2016 minus percentage of Mitt Romney votes in 2012 (“net voting shift”). Results Complete public health data was available for 3,009 counties which were included in the analysis. The mean net voting shift was 5.4% (+/- 5.8%). Of these 3,009 counties, 2,641 (87.8%) had positive net voting shift (shifted towards Trump) and 368 counties (12.2%) had negative net voting shift (shifted away from Trump). The first principal component (“unhealthy score”) accounted for 68% of the total variance in the data. The unhealthy score included all health variables except primary care physician rate, violent crime rate, and health care costs. The mean unhealthy score for counties was 0.39 (SD 0.16). Higher normalized unhealthy score was associated with positive net voting shift (22.1% shift per unit unhealthy, p < 0.0001). This association was stronger in states that switched Electoral College votes from 2012 to 2016 than in other states (5.9% per unit unhealthy, p <0.0001). Conclusions and relevance Substantial association exists between a shift toward voting for Donald Trump in 2016 relative to Mitt Romney in 2012 and measures of poor public health. Although these results do not demonstrate causality, these results suggest a possible role for health status in political choices."
https://openalex.org/W2763003347,"The correspondence between five precipitation products, including CMORPH, GPCP-2, TRMM 3B43, GPCC, and ITPCAS, and ground-based measurements of precipitation were evaluated on annual, seasonal, and monthly scales during 2000–2014 in the Qinling-Daba Mountains over China, which is a significant area with vital value of climate and hydrology. Performances of the precipitation products in the relatively arid/humid years were also analyzed. In general, ITPCAS data displayed the highest accuracy, GPCP-2 and CMORPH data showed relatively poor performance, and GPCC and TRMM 3B43 data were average at different temporal scales among the five precipitation products. The Pearson correlation coefficient of each station had minor fluctuations for the five precipitation products. A larger deviation was found at Wudu station, most likely due to the undulating terrain. The performances of the precipitation products from highest to least accuracy are as follows: ITPCAS > TRMM 3B43 > GPCC > GPCP-2 > CMORPH. Except for CMORPH (-20.76%), the percentage precipitation differences (PPDs) of the other four precipitation products fluctuated in the range of 10% during the relatively arid (2001) and humid (2011) years. In addition, all precipitation products and ground gauge observed precipitation did not show an obvious gradient with altitude, which is different from that in other mountainous areas and is perhaps due to complex terrain, lack of observation in high altitudes, and precipitation undercatch. In consideration of the significance of Qinling-Daba Mountains as the geographic and ecological dividing lines, the present study may provide a new perspective for hydrological, climatic, and ecological researches and practices in local and other mountainous areas."
https://openalex.org/W2763597914,"Cell fate regulation is an open problem whose comprehension impacts several areas of the biosciences. DNA damage induces cell cycle checkpoints that activate the p53 pathway to regulate cell fate mechanisms such as apoptosis or senescence. Experiments with different cell types show that the p53 pathway regulates cell fate through a switch behavior in its dynamics. For low DNA damage the pathway presents an oscillatory pattern associated with intense DNA damage repair while for high damage there are no oscillations and either p53 concentration increases inducing apoptosis or the cell enters a senescence state. Apoptosis and senescence phenotypes seem to have compensatory functions in tissues and the microRNA 16–1 (miR-16) is involved in the regulation of the fate between both phenotypes in cancer cells. To investigate the regulation of cell fate we developed a logical model of the G1/S checkpoint in DNA damage response that takes into account different levels of damage and contemplates the influence of miR-16 through its positive feedback loop formed with p53 and Wip1. The model reproduces the observed cellular phenotypes in experiments: oscillatory (for low DNA damage) regulated by negative feedback loops involving mainly p53 and Mdm2 and apoptotic or senescent (for high DNA damage) regulated by the positive p53/Wip1/miR-16 feedback loop. We find good agreement between the level of DNA damage and the probability of the phenotype produced according to experiments. We also find that this positive feedback makes senescent and apoptotic phenotypes to be determined stochastically (bistable), however controlling the expression level of miR-16 allows the control of fate determination as observed experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2761219351,"Changes in the hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands may potentially affect the role of wetlands in the methane (CH4) cycle. In this study, the CH4 production potential and emissions from restored coastal reed wetlands at different water levels were examined in eastern China at a field scale in two phenological seasons. Results showed that the total CH4 flux from reeds at various water levels were positive, indicating that they were “sources” of CH4. During the peak growing season, CH4 flux from reeds was greater than that during the spring thaw. CH4 flux from reeds in inundated conditions was greater than that in non-inundated conditions. The CH4 production potential during the peak growing season was far greater than that during the spring thaw. However, the effect of water level on wetland CH4 production potential differed among seasons. The correlations among CH4 production potential, soil properties and CH4 flux change at different water level. These results demonstrate that water level was related to CH4 production and CH4 flux. The growing season also plays a role in CH4 fluxes. Controlling the hydrological environment in restored wetlands has important implications for the maintenance of their function as carbon sinks."
https://openalex.org/W2761315730,"HIV-1 induces changes in the miRNA expression profile of infected CD4+ T cells that could improve viral replication. HIV-1 regulator Tat modifies the cellular gene expression and has been appointed as an RNA silencing suppressor. Tat is a 101-residue protein codified by two exons that regulates the elongation of viral transcripts. The first exon of Tat (amino acids 1-72) forms the transcriptionally active protein Tat72, but the presence of the second exon (amino acids 73-101) results in a more competent regulatory protein (Tat101) with additional functions. Intracellular, full-length Tat101 induces functional and morphological changes in CD4+ T cells that contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis such as delay in T-cell proliferation and protection against FasL-mediated apoptosis. But the precise mechanism by which Tat produces these changes remains unknown. We analyzed how the stable expression of intracellular Tat101 and Tat72 modified the miRNA expression profile in Jurkat cells and if this correlated with changes in apoptotic pathways and cell cycle observed in Tat-expressing cells. Specifically, the enhanced expression of hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-222 in Jurkat-Tat101 cells was associated with the reduced expression of target mRNAs encoding proteins related to apoptosis and cell cycle such as PTEN, PDCD4 and CDKN1B. We developed Jurkat cells with stable expression of hsa-miR-21 or hsa-miR-222 and observed a similar pattern to Jurkat-Tat101 in resistance to FasL-mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in G2/M and altered cell morphology. Consequently, upregulation of hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-222 by Tat may contribute to protect against apoptosis and to anergy observed in HIV-infected CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2762815139,"The appeal of sweet electronic cigarette flavors makes it important to identify the chemical compounds that contribute to their sweetness. While volatile chemicals that produce sweet aromas have been identified in e-liquids, there are no published reports of sugars or artificial sweeteners in commercial e-liquids. However, the sweetener sucralose is marketed as an e-liquid additive to commercial flavors. The primary aims of the study were to determine if sucralose is delivered in sufficient concentration in the inhaled aerosol to enhance flavor sweetness, and whether the amount delivered depends on the e-liquid delivery system. Thirty-two adult smokers rated flavor intensity, sweetness, harshness and liking/disliking for 4 commercial flavors with and without sucralose (1%) using 2 e-cigarette delivery systems (cartridge and tank). Participants alternately vaped normally or with the nose pinched closed to block perception of volatile flavor components via olfaction. LC/MS was used to measure the concentration of sucralose in the e-liquid aerosols using a device that mimicked vaping. Sweetness and flavor intensity were perceived much more strongly when olfaction was permitted. The contribution of sucralose to sweetness was significant only for the cartridge system, and the chemical analysis showed that the concentration of sucralose in the aerosol was higher when the cartridge was used. Together these findings indicate that future regulation of sweet flavor additives should focus first on the volatile constituents of e-liquids with the recognition that artificial sweeteners may also contribute to flavor sweetness depending upon e-cigarette design."
https://openalex.org/W2763126544,"Black-and-gold howler monkeys Alouatta caraya, are arboreal primates, inhabitants of Neotropical forests, highly susceptible to the yellow fever virus, considered early 'sentinels' of outbreaks, and thus, of major epidemiological importance. Currently, anthropogenic habitat loss and modifications threatens their survival. Habitat modification can prevent, reduce or change dispersal behavior, which, in turn, may influence patterns of gene flow. We explored past and contemporary levels of genetic diversity, elucidated genetic structure and identified its possible drivers, in ten populations (n = 138) located in the southernmost distribution range of the species in South America, in Argentina and Paraguay. Overall, genetic variability was moderate (ten microsatellites: 3.16 ± 0.18 alleles per locus, allelic richness of 2.93 ± 0.81, 0.443±0.025 unbiased expected heterozygosity; 22 haplotypes of 491-bp mitochondrial Control Region, haplotypic diversity of 0.930 ± 0.11, and nucleotide diversity of0.01± 0.007). Significant evidence of inbreeding was found in a population that was, later, decimated by yellow fever. Population-based gene flow measures (FST = 0.13; θST = 018), hierarchical analysis of molecular variance and Bayesian clustering methods revealed significant genetic structure, grouping individuals into four clusters. Shared haplotypes and lack of mitochondrial differentiation (non-significant θST) among some populations seem to support the hypothesis of historical dispersal via riparian forests. Current resistance analyses revealed a significant role of landscape features in modeling contemporary gene flow: continuous forest and riparian forests could promote genetic exchange, whereas disturbed forests or crop/grassland fields may restrict it. Estimates of effective population size allow anticipating that the studied populations will lose 75% of heterozygosity in less than 50 generations. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic modifications on native forests, increasingly ongoing in Northeastern Argentina, Southern Paraguay and Southeastern Brazil, might prevent the dispersal of howlers, leading to population isolation. To ensure long-term viability and maintain genetic connectivity of A. caraya remnant populations, we recommend preserving and restoring habitat continuity. To conserve the species genetic pool, as well, the four genetic clusters identified here should be considered separate Management Units and given high conservation priority. In light of our findings and considering complementary non-genetic information, we suggest upgrading the international conservation status of A. caraya to “Vulnerable”."
https://openalex.org/W2953141494,"The topology of the patient flow network in a hospital is complex, comprising hundreds of overlapping patient journeys, and is a determinant of operational efficiency. To understand the network architecture of patient flow, we performed a data-driven network analysis of patient flow through two acute hospital sites of King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Administration databases were queried for all intra-hospital patient transfers in an 18-month period and modelled as a dynamic weighted directed graph. A ‘core’ subnetwork containing only 13–17% of all edges channelled 83–90% of the patient flow, while an ‘ephemeral’ network constituted the remainder. Unsupervised cluster analysis and differential network analysis identified sub-networks where traffic is most associated with A&E performance. Increased flow to clinical decision units was associated with the best A&E performance in both sites. The component analysis also detected a weekend effect on patient transfers which was not associated with performance. We have performed the first data-driven hypothesis-free analysis of patient flow which can enhance understanding of whole healthcare systems. Such analysis can drive transformation in healthcare as it has in industries such as manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2762644077,"Recently, new alternative matrices of biodiversity such as phylogenetic and functional diversity as a complement to species diversity have provided new insights into the mechanisms of community assembly. In this study, we analyzed the phylogenetic signals of five functional traits and the relative contribution of environmental variables and distance matrices to the alpha and beta components of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity in woody plant assemblages along four local elevational transects on two different mountains. We observed low but significant phylogenetic signals of functional traits, which suggest that phylogenetic dispersion can provide a rough approximation of functional dispersion but not perfect correlations between phylogenetic and functional diversity. Taxonomic alpha diversity showed a monotonic decline with elevation, and climatic variables were the main drivers of this pattern along all studied transects. Furthermore, although the phylogenetic and functional alpha dispersions showed different elevational patterns including increase, decrease and no relationship, the underlying processes driving the patterns of both types of alpha dispersion could be explained by the gradients of climatic and habitat variables as well as biotic interactions such as competition. These results suggest that both alpha dispersion patterns may be significantly controlled by niche-based deterministic processes such as biotic interactions and environmental filtering in our study areas. Moreover, the beta diversity with geographical distances showed distance-decay relationships for all transects. Although the relative importance of the environmental and geographical distances for beta diversity varied across the three facets of diversity and the transects, we generally found that environmental distances were more important for the beta components of the three facets of diversity. However, we cannot discriminate the effects of both distances on the three facets of diversity. Therefore, our study suggests that niche-based deterministic processes, potentially combined with neutral processes such as dispersal limitation and demographic stochasticity, may influence patterns of woody plant assemblage turnover in our study areas."
https://openalex.org/W2761750323,"Few studies have analyzed the gut microbiota of child in unindustrialized countries, but none during the first month of life. Stool samples were collected from healthy newborns in hospitals of Gabon (n = 6) and Republic of the Congo (n = 9) at different time points during the first month of life: meconium, day 2 (D02), day 7 (D07) and day 28 (D28). In addition, one fecal sample was collected from each mother after delivery. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to determine the bacterial communities, and multiplex real-time PCR was used to detect the presence of seven enteric viruses (rotavirus a, adenovirus, norovirus I and II, sapovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus) in these samples. Bacterial diversity was high in the first days of life, and was dominated by the genus Prevotella. Then, it rapidly decreased and remained low up to D28 when the gut flora was composed almost exclusively of strictly anaerobic bacteria. Each infant's fecal bacterial microbiota composition was significantly closer to that of their mother than to that of any other woman in the mothers' group, suggesting an intrauterine, placental or amniotic fluid origin of such bacteria. Moreover, bacterial communities differed according to the delivery mode. Overall, the bacterial microbiota communities displayed a similar diversification and expansion in newborns within and between countries during the first four weeks of life. Moreover, six of the fifteen infants of this study harbored enteric viruses (rotavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) in fecal samples, but never in the meconium. A maternal source for the viruses detected at D02 and D07 can be excluded because none of them was found also in the child's mother. These findings improve our knowledge on the gut bacterial and viral communities of infants from two Sub-Saharan countries during their first month of life."
https://openalex.org/W2761762672,"Several polymorphic gene variants within one-carbon metabolism, an essential pathway for nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions, are related to cancer risk. An aberrant DNA methylation is a common feature in cancer but whether the link between one-carbon metabolism variants and cancer occurs through an altered DNA methylation is yet unclear. Aims of the study were to evaluate the frequency of one-carbon metabolism gene variants in hepatocellular-carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer, and their relationship to cancer risk together with global DNA methylation status. Genotyping for BHMT 716A>G, DHFR 19bp ins/del, MTHFD1 1958G>A, MTHFR 677C>T, MTR 2756A>G, MTRR 66A>G, RFC1 80G>A, SHMT1 1420C>T, TCII 776C>G and TS 2rpt-3rpt was performed in 102 cancer patients and 363 cancer-free subjects. Methylcytosine (mCyt) content was measured by LC/MS/MS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) DNA. The MTHFD1 1958AA genotype was significantly less frequent among cancer patients as compared to controls (p = 0.007) and related to 63% reduction of overall cancer risk (p = 0.003) and 75% of colon cancer risk (p = 0.006). When considering PBMCs mCyt content, carriers of the MTHFD1 1958GG genotype showed a lower DNA methylation as compared to carriers of the A allele (p = 0.048). No differences were highlighted by evaluating a possible relationship between the other polymorphisms analyzed with cancer risk and DNA methylation. The MTHFD1 1958AA genotype is linked to a significantly reduced cancer risk. The 1958GG genotype is associated to PBMCs DNA hypomethylation as compared to the A allele carriership that may exert a protective effect for cancer risk by preserving from DNA hypomethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2762026925,"Circulating fibrocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived leukocytes, which enter the lungs in response to their chemoattractant CXCL12 and differentiate into fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, leading to excess deposition of the collagen-rich extracellular matrix. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2, secreted by fibrocytes, degrade the subendothelial basement membrane and promote fibrocyte influx into the lungs. Here, we demonstrate that R1R2, a novel peptide derived from the bacterial adhesin SFS, attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the differentiation of fibrocytes into myofibroblasts and by reducing the invasion of fibrocytes through basement membrane-like proteins. Moreover, our findings reveal dual regulation of R1R2 on MMP-9 through reduced enzymatic activity on gelatin and increased cleavage of CXCL12. These data suggest that R1R2 has potent anti-fibrotic effects against pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2763187924,"We assessed knowledge and practices related to antibiotic use in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Kenya. Surveys was employed at the beginning (entry) and again at the end (exit) of a 5-month longitudinal study of AMR. Two-hundred households were interviewed at entry, of which 149 were also interviewed at exit. The majority (>65%) of respondents in both surveys could name at least one antibiotic, with amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole jointly accounting for 85% and 77% of antibiotics mentioned during entry and exit, respectively. More than 80% of respondents felt antibiotics should not be shared or discontinued following the alleviation of symptoms. Nevertheless, 66% and 74% of respondents considered antibiotics effective for treating colds and flu in the entry and exit surveys, respectively. There was a high (87%, entry; 70% exit) level of reported antibiotic use (past 12 months) mainly for colds/flu, coughs and fever, with >80% of respondents obtaining antibiotics from health facilities and pharmacies. Less than half of respondents remembered getting information on the correct use of antibiotics, although 100% of those who did reported improved attitudes towards antibiotic use. Clinicians and community pharmacists were highly trusted information sources. Paired household responses (n = 149) generally showed improved knowledge and attitudes by the exit survey although practices were largely unchanged. Weak agreement (κ = -0.003 to 0.22) between survey responses suggest both that unintended learning had not occurred, and that participant responses were not based on established knowledge or behaviors. Targeted public education regarding antibiotics is needed to address this gap."
https://openalex.org/W2764214618,"Although the incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease is increasing, the long-term natural course of the nodular bronchiectatic form of MAC lung disease is not well described. The objective of our study is to evaluate long-term radiologic changes in untreated MAC lung disease by analyzing serial chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings.Of 104 patients with MAC lung disease, we selected 40 untreated nodular bronchiectatic MAC patients who underwent serial chest CTs without treatment for at least four years (mean = 6.23 years). Majority of patients have minimal symptoms. Two chest radiologists retrospectively reviewed initial and final chest CT scans. Each chest CT scan was scored for presence and extent of bronchiectasis, cellular bronchiolitis, consolidation, cavity, and nodule (maximum score: 30).Of 40 patients, 39 (97.5%) experienced a significant increase in overall CT score (overall difference = 4.89, p<0.001). On repeated measure analysis of variance analysis, cavity yielded the largest increase compared with cellular bronchiolitis (p = 0.013), nodule (p<0.001), and consolidation (p = 0.004). However, there was no significant difference in mean score change between cavity and bronchiectasis (p = 0.073). In analysis between radiologic parameters and the absolute number of involved segments, bronchiectasis showed most significant change compared with nodule (p<0.001) and consolidation (p<0.001).Most untreated nodular bronchiectatic MAC lung disease cases showed radiologic deterioration over long-term observation periods when we compared serial chest CT scans. Careful monitoring of MAC lung disease with serial chest CT scan can be beneficial in these untreated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2760966112,"Introduction The goal of palliative care (PC) is to improve the quality of life of terminal stage patients and their families. The subject frequently appears in the mass-media and this helps create a socially accepted identity. The aim of this study is to describe and analyse PC related news items appeared in the Spanish written media. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed. Considering diffusion, scope and the range in editorial policy criteria, four printed newspapers (PN) were selected, together with four exclusively digital media sources (DM). Through Mynews, a newspaper content depository, and the search tool for each DM website, articles published between 2009 and 2014 which included the terms ""palliative care"" and ""palliative medicine"" were sought. A questionnaire was created to characterise each article identified and a descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results A total of 627 articles were identified, of which 359 (57%) were published in PN (42% in the printed editions -PE- 16% in their online editions -OE-) and 268 (43%) in DM. In general, they appeared mainly in sections concerning Health (23%), Culture and Society (18%) and General/Home News (15%). In PE, just 2% were found in the Health section and nearly 70% in Culture and Society and General/Home News. Most of the articles were informative in nature and contained socio-political messages (90%). Statements by PC professionals were found in 35% of the articles and by politicians in 32%. The most frequent content was related to facing end of life (74%) and patient quality of life (70%). Conclusions The Spanish written media reflects the socio-political interest aroused by PC. Nevertheless, messages circulating about PC do not describe professional practice, or the contribution of the same for patients. Content more in line with the clinical practice might help contribute to the development of this new area of medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2763117277,"In this study, we aimed to examine the clinical value of the pleural effusion (PE) biomarkers, soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP), cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the utility of combining chest computed tomography (CT) findings with these biomarkers, in diagnosing malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a single center. Consecutive patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions who underwent PE analysis between September 2014 and August 2016 were reviewed. This study included 240 patients (32 with MPM and 208 non-MPM). SMRP and the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio had a sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing MPM of 56.3% and 86.5%, and 87.5% and 74.0%, respectively. Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis of the ability of these markers to distinguish MPM from all other PE causes, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for SMRP and the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio was 0.804 and 0.874, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of SMRP combined with the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio were 93.8% and 64.9%, respectively. The sensitivity of the combination of SMRP, the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio, and the presence of Leung's criteria (a chest CT finding that is suggestive of malignant pleural disease) was 93.8%. In conclusion, the combined PE biomarkers had a high sensitivity for diagnosing MPM, although the addition of chest CT findings did not improve the sensitivity of SMRP combined with the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio. Combination of these biomarkers helped to rule out MPM effectively among patients at high risk of suffering MPM and would be valuable especially for old frail patients who have difficulty in undergoing invasive procedures such as thoracoscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2761097430,"Background The stepped care model for psychological distress has been promoted in recent years, leading to the enhancing roles of primary care professionals and alternative sources of help. However, most of the research findings come from Western countries. This study investigates help-seeking behaviours of Chinese patients among different types of professional and alternative sources for psychological distress in Hong Kong. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted with 1626 adult primary care attenders from 13 private and 6 public clinics, 650 (40.0%) reported that they had ever experienced psychological distress. Their help-seeking behaviours, demographic background and current distress level (measured by GHQ-12) were analysed. Results Among the respondents with experience of psychological distress, 48.2% had sought help from professional and/or alternative sources for their distress [10.2% from professionals only, 12.6% from alternative sources only, and 25.4% from both]. Those who had sought help from professionals only were more likely to be less educated and with lower income. In contrast, those using alternative sources only were more likely to be younger, better educated, and have higher income. Allowing multiple responses, psychiatrists (22.3%) was reported to be the most popular professional source, followed by primary care physicians (17.5%), clinical psychologists (12.8%) and social workers/counsellors (12.0%). Family members/friends (28.6%) was the top alternative source, followed by exercise/sports (21.8%), religious/spiritual support (16.9%) and self-help websites/books/pamphlets (8.9%). Conclusion While psychiatrists remain the most popular professional source of help to the Chinese patients in Hong Kong, primary care professionals and alternative sources also play significant roles. Distressed patients who are younger, better educated and have higher income are more likely to use alternative sources only. The outcomes need further research."
https://openalex.org/W2762363542,"Adipocyte differentiation is regulated by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. However, the correlation between intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial remodeling during adipocyte differentiation is still unknown. Here, we investigated the effect on adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells of intracellular ROS inhibition using N-acetyl cysteine (Nac) and Mito-TEMPO and of mitochondrial fission inhibition using Mdivi-1. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes displayed an increase in mitochondrial fission, ROS generation, and the expression of adipogenic and mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins. ROS scavenger (Nac or Mito-TEMPO) treatment inhibited ROS production, lipid accumulation, the expression of adipogenic and mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins, and mitochondrial fission during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. On the other hand, treatment with the mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 inhibited mitochondrial fission but did not inhibit ROS production, lipid accumulation, or the expression of adipogenic and mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins, with the exception of phosphorylated Drp1 (Ser616), in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The inhibition of mitochondrial fission did not affect adipocyte differentiation, while intracellular ROS production decreased in parallel with inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, our results indicated that ROS are an essential regulator of adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2763116456,"Although the Japanese diet is believed to be balanced and healthy, its benefits have been poorly investigated, especially in terms of effects on mental health. We investigated dietary patterns and physical and mental health in the Japanese population using an epidemiological survey to determine the health benefits of the traditional Japanese diet. Questionnaires to assess dietary habits, quality of life, sleep quality, impulsivity, and depression severity were distributed to 550 randomly selected middle-aged and elderly individuals. Participants with any physical or mental disease were excluded. Two-hundred and seventy-eight participants were selected for the final statistical analysis. We determined rice to be one of the most traditional foods in Japanese cuisine. Scores for each questionnaire were computed, and the correlations between rice intake and health indices were assessed. When analyzing the direct correlations between rice intake and health indices, we found only two correlations, namely those with quality of life (vitality) and sleep quality. Path analysis using structural equation modeling was performed to investigate the association between rice intake and health, with indirect effects included in the model. Additional associations between rice intake and health were explained using this model when compared to those using direct correlation analysis. Path analysis was used to identify mediators of the rice-health association. These mediators were miso (soybean paste) soup, green tea, and natto (fermented soybean) intake. Interestingly, these mediators have been major components of the Japanese diet since 1975, which has been considered one of the healthiest diets since the 1960s. Our results indicate that the combination of rice with other healthy foods, which is representative of the traditional Japanese diet, may contribute to improvements in physical and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2763301603,"In Aedes aegypti females, the ammonia released during blood meal digestion is partially metabolized to facilitate the disposal of excess nitrogen. In this study, we used low- and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques to investigate the role of glucose during ammonia detoxification. Mosquitoes were fed a blood meal supplemented with [1,2-13C2]glucose, and downstream metabolites were measured for 24 h. Quantification of [13C] amino acids in the entire mosquito body was conducted without sample derivatization using selected reaction monitoring of mass transitions that are indicative of the structural position of [13C] atom incorporation. Identification of unlabeled and [13C] isotopologs of 43 compounds, including amino acids, amino acid derivatives, and organic acids, was performed by high-resolution LC/MS techniques. Blood-fed mosquitoes synthesized [13C] metabolites in mainly 2 carbon positions from [1,2-13C2]glucose. [13C2]Ala and [13C2]Pro were the most abundant and rapidly labeled amino acids synthesized. Additional [13C] amino acids, [13C] amino acid derivatives, and [13C] organic acids in 1 or 2 carbon positions were also identified. Two kinetic routes were proposed based on the incorporation of a [13C] atom at position 1 in specific amino acids. Our findings provide evidence that glucose is used for ammonia detoxification and [13C] uric acid synthesis through multiple metabolic pathways, uncovering a metabolic link at the carbon atomic level in ammonia metabolism of A. aegypti-Horvath, T. D., Dagan, S., Lorenzi, P. L., Hawke, D. H., Scaraffia, P. Y. Positional stable isotope tracer analysis reveals carbon routes during ammonia metabolism of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2761740840,"While factors such as genetics may mediate the relationship between height and mortality, evidence suggests that larger body size may be an important risk indicator of reduced lifespan longevity in particular. This study critically examined this relationship in professional basketball players. We examined living and deceased players who have played in the National Basketball Association (debut between 1946-2010) and/or the American Basketball Association (1967-1976) using descriptive and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The cut-off date for death data collection was December 11, 2015. Overall, 3,901 living and deceased players were identified and had a mean height of 197.78 cm (± 9.29, Range: 160.02-231.14), and of those, 787 former players were identified as deceased with a mean height of 193.88 cm (± 8.83, Range: 167.6-228.6). Descriptive findings indicated that the tallest players (top 5%) died younger than the shortest players (bottom 5%) in all but one birth decade (1941-1950). Similarly, survival analyses showed a significant relationship between height and lifespan longevity when both dichotomizing [χ2 (1) = 13.04, p < .05] and trichotomizing [χ2 (2) = 18.05, p < .05] the predictor variable height per birth decade, where taller players had a significantly higher mortality risk compared to shorter players through median (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13-1.50, p < .05) and trichotomized tertile split (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.18-1.68, p <. 05; tallest 33.3% compared to shortest 33.3%) analyses. The uniqueness of examining the height-longevity hypothesis in this relatively homogeneous sub-population should be considered when interpreting these results. Further understanding of the potential risks of early mortality can help generate discourse regarding potential at-risk cohorts of the athlete population."
https://openalex.org/W2763016055,"Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is often the main piece of information used in fisheries stock assessment; however, the catch and effort data that are traditionally compiled from commercial logbooks can be incomplete or unreliable due to many reasons. Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF) is a seasonal target species in the Taiwanese longline fishery. Since 2010, detailed catch information for each PBF has been made available through a catch documentation scheme. However, previously, only market landing data with a low coverage of logbooks were available. Therefore, several nontraditional procedures were performed to reconstruct catch and effort data from many alternative data sources not directly obtained from fishers for 2001–2015: (1) Estimating the catch number from the landing weight for 2001–2003, for which the catch number information was incomplete, based on Monte Carlo simulation; (2) deriving fishing days for 2007–2009 from voyage data recorder data, based on a newly developed algorithm; and (3) deriving fishing days for 2001–2006 from vessel trip information, based on linear relationships between fishing and at-sea days. Subsequently, generalized linear mixed models were developed with the delta-lognormal assumption for standardizing the CPUE calculated from the reconstructed data, and three-stage model evaluation was performed using (1) Akaike and Bayesian information criteria to determine the most favorable variable composition of standardization models, (2) overall R2 via cross-validation to compare fitting performance between area-separated and area-combined standardizations, and (3) system-based testing to explore the consistency of the standardized CPUEs with auxiliary data in the PBF stock assessment model. The last stage of evaluation revealed high consistency among the data, thus demonstrating improvements in data reconstruction for estimating the abundance index, and consequently the stock assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2763919129,"In this study, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus ac75 was functionally characterized. Ac75 has homologs in all sequenced genomes of alphabaculoviruses, betabaculoviruses, and gammabaculoviruses. It was determined to encode a protein that is associated with the nucleocapsid of budded virus and with both envelope and nucleocapsids of occlusion-derived virus. Sf9 cells transfected by an ac75-knockout bacmid resulted in the infection being restricted to single cells. No budded virus were detected although viral DNA replication and late gene expression were unaffected. Electron microscopy revealed that the virogenic stroma, nucleocapsids and occlusion bodies appeared normal in the cells transfected by an ac75-knockout bacmid. However, the nucleocapsids were unenveloped, the occlusion bodies did not contain any virions or nucleocapsids, and no nucleocapsids were found outside the nucleus or spanning the nuclear membrane. In addition, de novo intranuclear membrane microvesicles that are the precursor of occlusion-derived virus envelopes were absent in the nuclei of transfected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that AC75 protein appeared in the cytoplasm as early as 6 hours post infection. It localized to the ring zone at the periphery of the nucleus from 15 to 24 hours post infection and demonstrated light blocky cloud-like distribution in the center of the nucleus. AC75 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with BV and ODV associated envelope protein ODV-E25. The data from this study suggest that ac75 is essential for induction of the intranuclear membrane microvesicles, it appears to be required for the intranuclear envelopment of nucleocapsids, and is also essential for egress of nucleocapsids from the nuclei, in infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2760916513,"Within a plantation of clonal somatic embryo-derived white spruce trees that belonged to four genotypes, one genotype (G6) has consistently responded for the last 16 years, to the induction of somatic embryogenesis within primordial shoot explants. Analysis of fourteen individuals within this genotype subsequently revealed a group of clonal trees that were nonresponsive. This in turn provided a unique opportunity to conduct differential gene expression analysis in the absence of genotype-specific factors. Absolute qPCR was first used to expand the analysis of several genes previously identified via microarray analysis to be differentially expressed during SE induction, along with the inclusion of two nonresponsive genotypes. While this demonstrated a high level of repeatability within, and between, responsive and nonresponsive genotypes, it did not support our previous contention that an adaptive stress response plays a role in SE induction responsiveness, at least with respect to the candidate genes we analyzed. RNAseq analysis was then used to compare responsive and nonresponsive G6 primordial shoots during the somatic embryogenesis induction treatment. Although not analyzed in this study, this included samples of callus and embryonal masses previously generated from G6 explants. In addition to revealing a large number of differentially expressed genes, de novo assembly of unmapped reads was used to generate over 25,000 contigs that potentially represent previously unidentified transcripts. This included a MADS-domain gene that was found to be the most highly differentially expressed gene within responsive shoot explants during the first seven days of the induction treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2762664653,"In preterm children with very low birth weight (VLBW ≤ 1500 g), reading problems are often observed. Reading comprehension is dependent on word decoding and language comprehension. We investigated neural activation-within brain regions important for reading-related to components of reading comprehension in young VLBW adolescents in direct comparison to normal birth weight (NBW) term-born peers, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that the decoding mechanisms will be affected by VLBW, and expect to see increased neural activity for VLBW which may be modulated by task performance and cognitive ability. The study investigated 13 (11 included in fMRI) young adolescents (ages 12 to 14 years) born preterm with VLBW and in 13 NBW controls (ages 12-14 years) for performance on the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and for semantic, orthographic, and phonological processing during an fMRI paradigm. The VLBW group showed increased phonological activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, decreased orthographic activation in right supramarginal gyrus, and decreased semantic activation in left inferior frontal gyrus. Block Design was related to altered right-hemispheric activation, and VLBW showed lower WISC Block Design scores. Left angular gyrus showed activation increase specific for VLBW with high accuracy on the semantic test. Young VLBW adolescents showed no accuracy and reaction time performance differences on our fMRI language tasks, but they did exhibit altered neural activation during these tasks. This altered activation for VLBW was observed as increased activation during phonological decoding, and as mainly decreased activation during orthographic and semantic processing. Correlations of neural activation with accuracy on the semantic fMRI task and with decreased WISC Block Design performance were specific for the VLBW group. Together, results suggest compensatory mechanisms by recruiting additional brain regions upon altered neural development of decoding for VLBW."
https://openalex.org/W2763802939,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common complication of chronic viral hepatitis. In support of this notion, we have reported that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes critically contribute to inducing chronic liver cell injury that exerts high carcinogenic potential in a hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mouse model. The dynamics of the molecular signatures responsible for hepatocellular carcinogenesis are not fully understood. The current study was designed to determine the serial changes in gene expression profiles in a model of chronic immune-mediated hepatitis. Methods Three-month-old HBV transgenic mice were immunologically reconstituted with bone marrow cells and splenocytes from syngeneic nontransgenic donors. Liver tissues were obtained every three months until 18 months at which time all mice developed multiple liver tumors. Nitrative DNA lesions and hepatocyte turnover were assessed immunohistochemically. Gene expression profiles were generated by extracting total RNA from the tissues and analyzing by microarray. Results The nitrative DNA lesions and the regenerative proliferation of hepatocytes were increased during the progression of chronic liver disease. In a gene expression profile analysis of liver samples, the chemokine- and T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated pathways were enhanced during chronic hepatitis, and the EGF- and VEGF-mediated pathways were induced in HCC. Among these molecules, the protein levels of STAT3 were greatly enhanced in all hepatocyte nuclei and further elevated in the cytoplasm in HCC tissue samples at 18 months, and the levels of phosphorylated TP53 (p-p53-Ser 6 and -Ser 15) were increased in liver tissues. Conclusions HBV-specific immune responses caused unique molecular signatures in the liver tissues of chronic hepatitis and triggered subsequent carcinogenic gene expression profiles in a mouse model. The results suggest a plausible molecular basis responsible for HBV-induced immune pathogenesis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2763479224,"There is growing evidence that transplantation of cadaveric human islets is an effective therapy for type 1 diabetes. However, gauging the suitability of islet samples for clinical use remains a challenge. We hypothesized that islet quality is reflected in the expression of specific genes. Therefore, gene expression in 59 human islet preparations was analyzed and correlated with diabetes reversal after transplantation in diabetic mice. Analysis yielded 262 differentially expressed probesets, which together predict islet quality with 83% accuracy. Pathway analysis revealed that failing islet preparations activated inflammatory pathways, while functional islets showed increased regeneration pathway gene expression. Gene expression associated with apoptosis and oxygen consumption showed little overlap with each other or with the 262 probeset classifier, indicating that the three tests are measuring different aspects of islet cell biology. A subset of 36 probesets surpassed the predictive accuracy of the entire set for reversal of diabetes, and was further reduced by logistic regression to sets of 14 and 5 without losing accuracy. These genes were further validated with an independent cohort of 16 samples. We believe this limited number of gene classifiers in combination with other tests may provide complementary verification of islet quality prior to their clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2763804690,"With chronotherapy, drug administration is synchronized with daily rhythms in drug clearance and pharmacokinetics. Daily rhythms in gene expression are centrally mastered by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus as well as by tissue clocks containing similar molecular mechanisms in peripheral organs. The central timing system is sensitive to changes in the external environment such as those of the light-dark cycle, meal timing and meal composition. We investigated how changes in diet composition and meal timing would affect the daily hepatic expression rhythms of the nuclear receptors PXR and CAR and of enzymes involved in P450 mediated drug metabolism, as such changes could have consequences for the practice of chronotherapy.Rats were subjected to either a regular chow or a free choice high-fat-high-sugar (fcHFHS) diet. These diets were provided ad libitum, or restricted to either the light phase or the dark phase. In a second experiment, rats had access to chow either ad libitum or in 6 meals equally distributed over 24 hours.Pxr, Alas1 and Por displayed significant day-night rhythms under ad libitum chow fed conditions, which for Pxr was disrupted under fcHFHS diet conditions. Although no daily rhythms were detected in expression of CAR, Cyp2b2 and Cyp3a2, the fcHFHS diet did affect basal expression of these genes. In chow fed rats, dark phase feeding induced a diurnal rhythm in Cyp2b2 expression while light phase feeding induced a diurnal rhythm in Car expression and completely shifted the peak expression of Pxr, Car, Cyp2b2, Alas1 and Por. The 6-meals-a-day feeding only abolished the Pxr rhythm but not the rhythms of the other genes.We conclude that although nuclear receptors and enzymes involved in the regulation of hepatic drug metabolism are sensitive to meal composition, changes in meal timing are mainly effectuated via changes in the molecular clock."
https://openalex.org/W2763991441,"Unintentional weight loss (UWL) is common in older age and associated with adverse outcomes including mortality. The aim of the present study was to determine psychosocial correlates of UWL.Data were derived from a large, nationally representative study of community-dwelling individuals in the second half of life (40 years and over) in Germany in 2014 (n = 7,933). Data on UWL were assessed in face-to-face interviews as unintentional loss of more than 5kg (11 pounds) in weight in the past 12 months, and data on psychosocial factors were recorded in self-administered questionnaires.Multiple logistic regressions revealed that UWL was positively associated with depressive symptoms and positive affect, whereas it was negatively associated with self-esteem. Individuals with UWL were more likely to feel lonely and perceive themselves as socially excluded.The findings of important psychosocial correlates of UWL may help to identify individuals at risk for UWL in older age. This is in particular important since interventions to treat this phenomenon in older age are available that reduce adverse consequences resulting from UWL."

The degradation of quinclorac in nature is very slow. On the other hand, degradation of quinclorac using bacteria can be an effective and efficient method to reduce its contamination. In this study, we isolated a quinclorac bioremediation bacterium strain F4 from quinclorac contaminated soils. Based on morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we identified strain F4 as Mycobacterium sp. We investigated the effects of temperature, pH, inoculation size and initial quinclorac concentration on growth and degrading efficiency of F4 and determined the optimal quinclorac degrading condition of F4. Under optimal degrading conditions, F4 degraded 97.38% of quinclorac from an initial concentration of 50 mg/L in seven days. Our indoor pot experiment demonstrated that the degradation products were non-phytotoxic to tobacco. After analyzing the quinclorac degradation products of F4, we proposed that F4 could employ two pathways to degrade quinclorac: one is through methylation, the other is through dechlorination. Furthermore, we reconstructed the whole genome of F4 through single molecular sequencing and de novo assembly. We identified 77 methyltransferases and eight dehalogenases in the F4 genome to support our hypothesized degradation path."
https://openalex.org/W2762679972,"Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a commonly-used method in urology, which may modulate hemostasis and may induce lipid peroxidation in patients with nephrolithiasis. However, previous studies only examine changes occurring in patients 30-240 min after ESWL. The main aim of the present study was to determine whether oxidative stress may modulate the hemostatic activity of plasma in patients with nephrolithiasis before ESWL and the day after treatment ESWL. This will be performed by measuring selected parameters of hemostasis in these patients, both before ESWL and the following day, and assessing the level of oxidative damage to plasma proteins in these patients by measuring two biomarkers.Twelve patients with nephrolithiasis and 10 healthy participants were included. The following parameters of hemostasis were measured: the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) of plasma, the level of fibrinogen, the level of D-dimer and blood platelet count. In addition, two selected biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured: protein carbonylation level and the number of protein thiol groups.No difference was observed between patients with nephrolithiasis before and after ESWL and healthy controls with regard to PT, TT or APTT. Fibrinogen concentration and blood platelet count were lower in the nephrolithiasis patients in the period after ESWL than before ESWL. The nephrolithiasis patients demonstrated elevated D-dimer concentration after ESWL. However, although oxidative damage was observed in the plasma proteins in the nephrolithiasis patients, this was not influenced by ESWL.Oxidative stress may induce changes of hemostasis in patients with nephrolithiasis, both before and after ESWL. In addition, changes of hemostasis parameters such as fibrinogen, blood platelet count and D-dimer level can be observed in these patients, especially after ESWL, and this may suggest that ESWL modulates hemostasis. By having a better understanding of the influence of ESWL on hemostasis, this could lead to modifying patient care for those patients at increased risk of bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2762846130,"Stroke causes severe neuronal damage as disrupted cerebral blood flow starves neurons of oxygen and glucose. The hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) orchestrate oxygen homeostasis and regulate specific aspects of hypoxic adaptation. Here we show the importance of HIF-2α dependant signalling in neuronal adaptation to hypoxic insult. PC12 and NT2 cells were differentiated into neuronal-like cells using NGF and retinoic acid, and exposed to acute hypoxia (1% O2). Gene and protein expression was analysed by qPCR and immunoblotting and the neuronal-like phenotype was examined. PC12 and NT2 differentiation promoted neurite extension and expression of neuronal markers, NSE and KCC2. Induction of HIF-1α mRNA or protein was not detected in hypoxic neuronal-like cells, however marked induction of HIF-2α mRNA and protein expression was observed. Induction of HIF-1α target genes was also not detected in response to acute hypoxia, however significant induction of HIF-2α transcriptional targets was clearly evident. Furthermore, hypoxic insult dramatically reduced both neurite number and length, and attenuated expression of neuronal markers, NSE and KCC2. This correlated with an increase in expression of the neural progenitor and stem cell-like markers, CD44 and vimentin, suggesting HIF-2α molecular mechanisms could potentially promote regression of neuronal-like cells to a stem-like state and trigger neuronal recovery following ischaemic insult. Our findings suggest the HIF-2α pathway predominates over HIF-1α signalling in neuronal-like cells following acute hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2761779399,"Mobile IP allows for location-independent routing of IP datagrams on the Internet. Mobile IP specifies how a mobile node (MN) registers with its home agent and how the home agent routes datagrams to the MN through the tunnel. Current Mobile IP protocols have difficulties meeting the stringent handover delay requirements of future wireless networks. Fast handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FPMIPv6) is used to resolve handover latency and packet loss problems that occur in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol. However, while implementing the FPMIPv6 scheme in a testbed, we encounter the out-of-order packet (OoOP) problem. The cause of this problem is the existence of two paths for data transmitted from a correspondent node (CN) to an MN. Since the problem affects the quality of service (QoS) of the network and the performance of the MN, we propose a new scheme using the last packet marker and packet buffering to solve this problem in FPMIPv6. The new Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) can control and deliver the data transmitted via the old path or the new path to an MN in order, using the last packet marker to notify the end of the data delivery in the old path and the packet buffering for holding the data delivered in the new path. We implement both the proposed scheme and FPMIPv6 in a testbed as a real network environment to demonstrate the correctness, cost effectiveness, and performance of the proposed scheme. A performance evaluation reveals that the proposed scheme can handle the OoOP problem efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2761855082,"Type I IFNs (IFNIs) are involved in the course of antiviral and antimicrobial activities; however, robust inductions of these can lead to host immunopathology. We have reported that the Pias (protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription) family member, Piasy, possesses the ability to suppress IFNI transcriptions in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), yet the specific molecular mechanism by which it acts remains elusive. Here, we identify that the H3K4me3 levels, one activation mark of genes, in MEFs that were stimulated by poly(I:C) were impaired by Piasy in the IFN-β gene. Piasy bound to the promoter region of the IFN-β gene in MEFs. Meanwhile, retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (Rbp2) was proven to be the only known and novel H3K4me3 demethylase that interacted with Piasy. Overexpression of Rbp2, but not its enzymatically inactive mutant Rbp2H483G/E485Q, retarded the transcription activities of IFNI, whereas small interfering RNA–mediated or short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of Rbp2 enhanced IFNI promoter responses. Above all, coexpression of Piasy and Rbp2 led to statistically less IFNI induction than overexpression of either Piasy or Rbp2 alone. Mechanistically, Piasy bound to the Jmjc domain (451–503 aa) of Rbp2 via its PINIT domain (101–218 aa), which is consistent with the domain required for their attenuation of transcription and H3K4me3 levels of IFNI genes. Our study demonstrates that Piasy may prevent exaggerated transcription of IFNI by Rbp2-mediated demethylation of H3K4me3 of IFNI, avoiding excessive immune responses.—Yu, X., Chen, H., Zuo, C., Jin, X., Yin, Y., Wang, H., Jin, M., Ozato, K., Xu, S.

https://openalex.org/W2761534102,"Testosterone deficiency has been correlated with increased cardiovascular diseases, which in turn has been associated with increased oxidative stress. Several studies have considered cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) as oxidative stress biomarkers, since some of them play pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory roles. We have previously described the cardioprotective effects of a dosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplemented diet on the aortic and mesenteric artery function of orchidectomized rats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether impaired gonadal function alters the formation of COPs, as well as the potential preventive role of a DHA-supplemented diet on that effect. For this purpose, aortic and mesenteric artery segments obtained from control and orchidectomized rats, fed with a standard or supplemented with DHA, were used. The content of the following COPs: 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, 5,6α-epoxycholesterol, 5,6β-epoxycholesterol, cholestanetriol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that orchidectomy increased the formation of COPs in arteries from orchidectomized rats, which may participate in the orchidectomy-induced structural and functional vascular alterations already reported. The fact that the DHA-supplemented diet prevented the orchidectomy-induced COPs increase confirms the cardiovascular protective actions of DHA, which could be of special relevance in mesenteric arterial bed, since it importantly controls the systemic vascular resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2763044276,"Animal aggregations can occur for a variety of abiotic factors, such as resource limitation, or biotic factors, including group foraging and protection from predators. In our study, we examined whether time, sex, body size or shelter availability affected aggregation behavior of the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima (Order Dermaptera), an insect found globally at high densities under driftwood. Specifically, we monitored the distribution of two individuals in arenas with either two shelters (no habitat limitation) or one shelter (habitat limitation) to determine their propensity for cohabitation at times of peak activity and times of quiescence. Females, whose high levels of aggression are often associated with maternal care, were particularly averse to cohabitation, whereas males were generally more tolerant of other earwigs. Females initially preferred not to cohabitate when placed with a male, but were more tolerant of cohabitation later, regardless of the number of shelters. Same-sex pairs, on the other hand, were less likely to cohabitate with only one shelter present, but males were again more tolerant of conspecifics than females regardless of habitat limitation. When competition for one shelter did not lead to cohabitation, the lone occupant was more likely to be the larger individual in same-sex trials and females in mixed-sex trials. Understanding the tolerance for close proximity under these varying conditions may provide insight into aggregative behavior and spatial distribution patterns in the maritime earwig."
https://openalex.org/W2762049957,"The success or failure of human collective action often depends on the cooperation tendencies of individuals in groups, and on the information that individuals have about each other's cooperativeness. However, it is unclear whether these two factors have an interactive effect on cooperation dynamics. Using a decision-making experiment, we confirm that groups comprising individuals with higher cooperation tendencies cooperate at a higher level than groups comprising individuals with low cooperation tendencies. Moreover, assorting individuals with similar cooperation tendency together affected behaviour so that the most cooperative individuals tended to cooperate more and the least cooperative individuals cooperated less, compared to their behaviour in randomly formed groups. In line with predictions of evolutionary models of cooperation, there was a strong positive association between individuals' cooperation tendency and success when groups were formed assortatively, whereas such association did not exist when groups were formed randomly. Surprisingly, information about group members' cooperativeness in assorted groups had no effect on cooperation levels. We discuss potential explanations for why information about cooperativeness of others may be disregarded in certain circumstances."
