https://openalex.org/W2080920468,"A recently discovered member of the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) family of retroviruses has been etiologically linked to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This virus, which has been designated HTLV-III, is tropic for OKT4-bearing (helper-inducer) T cells. Moreover, the virus is cytopathic for these cells. Suramin is a drug used in the therapy of Rhodesian trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis, and it is known to inhibit the reverse transcriptase of a number of retroviruses. Suramin has now been found to block in vitro the infectivity and cytopathic effect of HTLV-III at doses that are clinically attainable in human beings."

https://openalex.org/W1572756764,"Ribonucleotide reductase in mammalian cells is composed of two nonidentical subunits, proteins M1 and M2. Protein M2 contains a tyrosyl free radical, essential for activity, which can be quantified directly in frozen, packed cells by EPR spectroscopy. A 3-7-fold increase in the concentration of tyrosyl radical-containing M2 subunit was observed when mouse mammary tumor TA 3 cells passed from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Similar results were obtained with cells synchronized by isoleucine starvation or separated by centrifugal elutriation. Addition of deuterated tyrosine to cells give rise to a different EPR signal in newly synthesized protein M2. Pulse-chase experiments with deuterated tyrosine showed unequivocally that the S phase-correlated increase in radical-containing M2 subunit was due to de novo protein synthesis. Labeled M2 molecules disappeared with a half-life of 3 h, and therefore new molecules must be synthesized at a high rate during the S phase. In contrast, after hydroxyurea inactivation, cells rapidly regenerated the tyrosyl radical in already existing protein M2 molecules. This enzyme activation mechanism is clearly different from the one responsible for regulating protein M2 activity during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1606750992,"Sheep seminal vesicles contain two immunologically distinct phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes that can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Hofmann, S.L., and Majerus, P.W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6461-6469). One of these enzymes (PLC-I) has been purified to homogeneity; the second (PLC-II) has been purified 2600-fold from a crude extract of seminal vesicles. In the present study we have compared the ability of these purified enzymes to hydrolyze PI, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4-P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PI-4,5-P2). Using radiolabeled substrates in small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles of defined composition, the two enzymes were found to hydrolyze all three of the phosphoinositides. Hydrolysis of all three phosphoinositides by both enzymes was stimulated by Ca2+; however, in the presence of EGTA only the polyphosphoinositides were hydrolyzed. The two enzymes displayed substrate affinities in the order PI greater than PI-4-P greater than PI-4,5-P2, and maximum hydrolysis rates in the order PI-4,5-P2 greater than PI-4-P greater than PI. When present in the same vesicles, PI and the polyphosphoinositides competed for a limiting amount of either enzyme. Inclusion of phosphatidylcholine into vesicles containing the phosphoinositides resulted in greater inhibition of PI hydrolysis than polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. When all three phosphoinositides were present in vesicles mimicking the cytoplasmic leaflet of cell membranes, there was preferential hydrolysis of the polyphosphoinositides over PI. We conclude that a single phospholipase C can account for the hydrolysis of all three phosphoinositides seen during agonist-induced stimulation of secretory cells. The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and phospholipid composition of the membrane, however, may influence the relative rate of hydrolysis of the three phosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1562004079,"The ATP-Mg-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase is believed to consist of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory component identified as phosphatase inhibitor-2. It was found in this study that isolated inhibitor-2 was phosphorylated in serine residues by casein kinase II to at least 3 mol of phosphate per mol of inhibitor-2 while another protein kinase, F A/GSK-3, introduced no more than 0.3 mol of phosphate per mol exclusively in threonine residues. Analysis of tryptic digests by high performance liquid chromatography indicated that casein kinase II action resulted in two major (peaks 1 and 2) and two minor phosphopeptides whereas F A/GSK-3 action generated only peak 2. Combined action of the two protein kinases introduced an additional 0.4-0.6 mol of phosphate per mol over that predicted for simple additive behavior. This synergistic phosphorylation was associated with increased phosphate in peak 2 and correlated with unchanged phosphoserine but increased phosphothreonine, to a level approaching 1 mol/mol. ATP-Mg-dependent protein phosphatase was either reconstituted from purified inhibitor-2 and low molecular weight type 1 phosphatase or isolated as an inactive complex (Fc). Both phosphatase complexes were activated by F A/GSK-3 which caused a transient phosphorylation of the inhibitor-2 component. Casein kinase II alone phosphorylated the inhibitor-2 in both phosphatase complexes without affecting the enzyme activity. Exposure to the combination of F A/GSK-3 and casein kinase II resulted in a synergistic phosphorylation. Furthermore, the combined action of the two protein kinases caused a synergistic activation of the phosphatase at submaximal F A/GSK-3 levels. The results suggest that interactions between phosphorylation sites may play a role in the activation of the ATP-Mg-dependent phosphatase, in particular that phosphorylation by casein kinase II at serine can potentiate the phosphorylation of threonine by F A/GSK-3 with subsequent influence on phosphatase activation."

It thus seems that variant surface antigen mRNAs are transcribed discontinuously, and we present two alternative models for how this might occur."
https://openalex.org/W1593495424,"Protein C, a plasma protein, is activated by thrombin to a protease (protein Ca) that functions as a physiological anticoagulant. We have isolated thrombomodulin, a cofactor required for the rapid activation of protein C, from human placenta. The purification to near homogeneity was achieved using a crude Triton-solubilized protein fraction from a placental particulate fraction as starting material. Chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose removed 95% of the protein and achieved a 3-fold purification. Thrombomodulin was then isolated by affinity chromatography on a column of thrombin-Sepharose wherein the thrombin had been previously inactivated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The final preparation was purified 7,900-fold over the membrane extract with a yield of 7%. We obtained 0.88 mg of thrombomodulin from 100 g of membrane extract derived from 5 kg of placenta. The protein was nearly homogeneous as judged by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gels in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol with an apparent Mr = 105,000. Western blot analysis without 2-mercaptoethanol gave an apparent Mr = 75,000. The protein stimulated the rate of protein C activation by thrombin 800-fold to 10 mol of Ca formed/min/mol of thrombin. Thrombin and thrombomodulin appear to form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex as judged from experiments where we measured the effect of varying the concentration of thrombomodulin with respect to thrombin and the converse, on rates of protein C activation. An antibody directed against rabbit lung thrombomodulin inhibited the human placenta protein by 66%, and the amino acid composition of the proteins from the two species was similar indicating that the proteins are closely related. The apparent Michaelis constant of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex for protein C is 9.8 microM. The protein C activation reaction requires calcium ions and is maximal at 1 mM Ca2+; higher concentrations inhibited the reaction. Coagulation factor Va and factor Va light chain both stimulate the activity of human thrombomodulin 2- to 3-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1587065131,"Two newly discovered properties of tau protein are reported; it is soluble in 2.5% perchloric acid and insoluble in 25% glycerol. These properties were exploited in the development of improved methods for the purification of tau. Treatment with perchloric acid did not alter the electrophoretic behavior of tau, and the products of the new isolation method were fully competent in the promotion of microtubule assembly. The application of the new purification techniques to bovine brain tissue demonstrated that tau exists endogenously in the dephosphorylated as well as in a phosphorylated state."
https://openalex.org/W1617349725,"Vascular smooth muscle contains large amounts of a Ca2+-dependent protease. Similar to a Ca2+-dependent protease previously purified from chicken gizzard smooth muscle (Hathaway, D. R., Werth, D. K., and Haeberle, J. R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9072-9077), the mammalian vascular muscle protease is a heterodimer consisting of 76,000- and 30,000-dalton subunits (IIa). The enzyme can undergo autolysis in the presence of Ca2+ to produce a smaller species consisting of 76,000- and 18,000-dalton subunits (IIb). Autolysis greatly reduces the Ca2+ dependence of catalytic activity. The autolytic species, IIb, was approximately 23-fold more sensitive to Ca2+ (K0.5 = 39 microM) than the native enzyme, IIa (K0.5 = 891 microM). In this communication, we report that phosphatidylinositol and to a lesser extent one metabolic derivative, dioleoylglycerol, stimulate autolysis of the vascular Ca2+-dependent protease by reducing the Ca2+ for autolysis from K0.5 = 680 microM in the absence of lipid to K0.5 = 87 microM in the presence of both phosphatidylinositol and dioleoylglycerol. Moreover, the reduction in the Ca2+ requirement for autolysis produced by the phosphatidylinositol was antagonized by the phospholipid-binding drug, trifluoperazine. In addition, the effect of phosphatidylinositol was specific for autolysis, and none of several phospholipids or derivatives tested altered the Ca2+ dependence or maximal rate for protein degradation of the autolytic product, IIb. Our results suggest that autolysis may be an important initial step in the activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease in vascular smooth muscle and that this step may be regulated by a combination of Ca2+ and phosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W1653320450,"Abstract cAMP stimulates the transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) in rat liver. We have investigated the nucleotide sequences required for regulation of PEPCK gene expression by cAMP. A chimeric gene was constructed in which a 620-base pair fragment of the 5'-end of the PEPCK gene (including 547 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence) was ligated to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) structural gene. The PEPCK promoter fragment was introduced either in the proper orientation for transcription of the TK gene or in the opposite orientation. These fusion genes and the parent vector, pOPF, which contains the intact TK gene, were transfected individually into TK-deficient FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells. FTO-2B cells contain an active endogenous PEPCK gene which is stimulated by cAMP. Cells were selected in HAT medium and grown either as mass cell cultures or as individual clones. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) plus theophylline (16 h) stimulated TK activity 1.6-6.1-fold in cell lines transfected with the PEPCK-TK fusion gene containing the PEPCK promoter fragment in the correct orientation. However, the intact TK gene was not induced by Bt2cAMP after transfection, nor was there any expression of the PEPCK-TK fusion gene in cells which contained the PEPCK promoter fragment in the wrong transcriptional orientation. Bt2cAMP also increased the levels of TK mRNA in cells transfected with the PEPCK-TK fusion gene, but not in cells transfected with the intact TK gene. The chimeric PEPCK-TK mRNA initiated at the PEPCK start site, as determined by S1 nuclease mapping. There was no relationship between the number of copies of the PEPCK-TK gene integrated in the various cell lines and either the basal level of TK activity or its inducibility of Bt2cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1515067457,"cis-Unsaturated fatty acids stimulate release of superoxide (O-2) by human neutrophils (Badwey, J. A., Curnutte, J. T., Robinson, J. M., Berde, C. B., Karnovsky, M. J., and Karnovsky, M. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7870-7877). The rate of O-2 release due to arachidonate (105 +/- 24 S.D., nmol of O-2/min/10(7) cells) was comparable to optimal values obtained with other stimuli. Antagonists of calcium-binding proteins (i.e. phenothiazines, naphthalene sulfonamides) inhibited the release of O-2 in a fashion compatible with the involvement of calmodulin in these phenomena. Synthetic substrates for and an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases (e.g. N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester, L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) also blocked O-2 release. Antagonists of calcium-binding proteins and of proteases were effective in this context with neutrophils stimulated with a variety of agents. The implications of these data for recent reports concerning the mechanism of action of cis-unsaturated fatty acids on phagocytes is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1501034910,"The T3 complex has been defined by a group of monoclonal antibodies which react with all human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and a subpopulation of thymocytes. This membrane structure includes glycoproteins of 44 (alpha), 37 (beta), 25 (gamma), and 20 kDa (delta) as well as a nonglycosylated polypeptide of 20 kDa (epsilon). The characterization of the alpha and beta chains has been of particular interest because they may constitute the T cell receptor for antigen. Here we show that the T3 complex prepared by immunoprecipitation from T lymphocytes of a leukemic patient (Sezary syndrome) displays an unusually strong association of the alpha and beta chains with the 20/25-kDa T3 proteins. The alpha and beta chains (48 and 44 kDa) were co-precipitated by anti-20-kDa T3 monoclonal antibodies as a disulfide-linked 90-kDa heterodimer. A minor 220-kDa multimer composed of proteins similar to the alpha and beta chains was also present in these immunoprecipitates. This multimer could be independently precipitated with a new monoclonal antibody WT-31, which detects the larger polypeptide chains of the T3 complex on all human T lymphocytes. After removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, both the alpha and beta chain were found to have 33-kDa peptide backbones with distinct isoelectric points. Using a monoclonal reagent T40/25, a 90-kDa heterodimer, consisting of 40- and 49-kDa chains with peptide backbones of 34 kDa was found to be T3-associated on the T leukemic cell line HPB-ALL. When the alpha and beta chains from the Sezary patient were compared with the corresponding chains from HPB-ALL by peptide mapping, large differences were observed. Taken together, the data presented here provide strong evidence that the T cell receptor for antigen is part of the T3 complex on the surface of human T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2080885305,"Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria infections in its human host. Its wide distribution in tropical countries is a major world health problem. Before a vaccine can be produced, the identification and characterization of parasite antigens is necessary. This can be achieved by the cloning and subsequent analysis of genes coding for parasite antigens1–4. Recently established cDNA banks allow the expression of cDNA derived from the simian parasite Plasmodium knowlesi5 and P. falciparum6,7 in Escherichia coli. Recombinants encoding parasite antigens have been identified by immunodetection in both banks. Two of them contain repetitive units of 11 (ref. 7) or 12 (ref. 5) amino acids. We describe here the construction of an expression bank made directly from randomly generated fragments of P. falciparum genomic DNA. We detect several clones which react strongly with human African immune sera. One clone expresses an antigenic determinant composed of occasionally degenerated repeats of a peptide nonamer."
https://openalex.org/W1563968609,"Abstract A previously cloned partial adenosine deaminase cDNA insert (0.8 kilobase) was used to clone additional nucleotide sequences from human HPB ALL cDNA libraries. cDNA encompassing the entire coding, and 3'-untranslated regions as well as nearly all of the 5'-untranslated region was obtained. The complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme deduced from the cDNA sequence and protein sequencing consists of 362 amino acids, excluding the initiator Met, and accounts for Mr = 40,638. Secondary structure predictions assign adenosine deaminase to the alpha/beta class of proteins. Northern blot analysis with a cDNA probe showed adenosine deaminase mRNA to be present in normal to above normal amounts in B-lymphoblasts derived from adenosine deaminase-deficient patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Knowledge of the cDNA and primary amino acid sequence of adenosine deaminase will be pivotal in further defining the genetic abnormality and its functional consequences in adenosine deaminase expression defects."

https://openalex.org/W199141822,"We have investigated the relationship between the catecholamine-induced occurrence in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells of beta-adrenergic receptors that exhibit low apparent affinity for hydrophilic ligands in short-time assays with intact cells and a population of beta-adrenergic receptors that migrate in a light vesicle fraction on sucrose density gradients. Pretreatment of cells with concanavalin A prevents the generation of both of these forms of the receptor during incubation with agonists but does not prevent the agonist-induced decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production that also occurs during desensitization. Selective labeling of the low affinity beta-receptors with 125I-pindolol followed by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients revealed that all of the receptors in the light vesicle fraction from desensitized cells were of the low affinity type, but that a portion of the low affinity receptors also migrated in a heavier sucrose fraction together with the plasma membrane. In contrast, in control cells, no low affinity receptors were present in the heavy sucrose fractions. The agonist-induced occurrence of these various forms of the beta-adrenergic receptor can be explained on the basis of current models of desensitization involving agonist-induced internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1578065846,"The cyclic interconversion of enzymes between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms comprises a major mechanism of cellular regulation. A theoretical analysis of reversible covalent modification systems (Stadtman, E.R., and Chock, P.B. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 2761-2765) revealed that they are endowed with extraordinary regulatory capacities; they may exhibit smooth, flexible responses to changes in single and multiple metabolite levels, signal amplification, and apparent positive cooperativity. To test qualitatively and quantitatively the theories and equations involved in this analysis, a model in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cyclic cascade was developed in which the converter enzymes catalyzing the covalent modifications were cAMP-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37; type II) and phosphoprotein phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.16; Mr = 38,000), both purified to near homogeneity from bovine heart. The kinetic constants for both enzymes were fully characterized using the nanopeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala-Gln-Leu as the interconvertible substrate, cAMP as an activator for the kinase, and Pi as an inhibitor for the phosphatase. In the presence of a nearly constant concentration of ATP, a steady-state level of phosphorylation of the peptide was attained which was determined by the relative concentrations of the kinase, phosphatase, and effectors. As predicted by the cyclic cascade model, this monocyclic cascade exhibited both signal amplification and an increase in sensitivity to variations in multiple effector concentrations. In addition, the data show that the steady-state level of phosphorylation obtained in the presence of an activator of the kinase (e.g. cAMP) and an inhibitor of the phosphatase (e.g. Pi) is a function of the product of the relative effector concentrations. Finally, the results reveal that when the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex is not negligible, cyclic cascades are potentially more sensitive to variations in effector concentrations and can achieve even greater signal amplification than predicted previously."
https://openalex.org/W1565777341,"The thyroid hormone receptor is a nuclear-associated protein which appears to mediate the actions of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (L-T4) in mammalian cells. In a previous study we reported that N-2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyl-3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3-PAL) serves as an effective photoaffinity label probe of the receptor in GH1 cells, a growth hormone producting rat pituitary cell line. Irradiation of cells at 254 nm covalently cross-links L-[125I]T3-PAL to two molecular weight (Mr) nuclear receptor forms, an abundant 47,000 Mr component and a less abundant 57,000 Mr species (Pascual, A., Casanova, J., and Samuels, H. H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9640-9647). In this study we have explored a number of possible interrelationships of the different Mr receptor forms. Denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicates that the 57,000 Mr form is a doublet species which differ in Mr by 1,000 to 2,000. The various receptor forms are not an artifact of the L-[125I]T3-PAL probe, and identical forms can be labeled at 310 nm using underivatized L-[125I]T4 with a 15-fold lower coupling efficiency. The 57,000 and 47,000 Mr receptor forms are not generated by indiscriminate proteolysis, UV peptide cleavage, or zero length protein-protein cross-linking by irradiation at 254 nm. Micrococcal nuclease excises both the 57,000 and 47,000 Mr forms, and receptor is not identified in the residual nuclear matrix fraction. Receptor is also not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. By coupling dense amino acid labeling and photoaffinity labeling of receptor we determined a half-life of 2.4 h for the 57,000 Mr species and 5.6 h for the 47,000 Mr form while both species have similar relative synthetic rates. n-Butyrate has been previously shown to decrease receptor levels in GH1 cells. We demonstrate that n-butyrate decreases receptor levels primarily by shortening the half-life of the 47,000 Mr form."
https://openalex.org/W1524090319,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to identify specifically genes and transcripts for the high pI isozyme of barley alpha-amylase. From hybridization of coding sequence probes to blots of genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes that do not cut within our cloned high pI alpha-amylase cDNA, it is estimated that about 7 alpha-amylase genes or pseudogenes exist. No difference could be detected between barley aleurone cell and sprout DNAs. Experiments using probes from the 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of the high pI alpha-amylase cDNA clone identified three HindIII fragments that probably carry high pI sequences. Primer extension experiments used as a primer the terminal 5' coding sequence from our cDNA clone; this primer would not cross-hybridize to low pI alpha-amylase transcripts. Two major transcripts were identified. These shared a conserved 23-base sequence immediately 5' to the ATG start codon, although a C----G transversion and a 3-base deletion were present within this sequence. An unusual 8-base pair GC palindrome was present in the conserved region immediately preceding the ATG start codon. Distal to the conserved sequence there was no apparent homology. One transcript carrying a 97-base untranslated region was identical to our high pI cDNA clone E. The gene for the other was recovered from a lambda phage genomic library. The 5' coding sequence was very similar, but not identical to clone E, demonstrating that these transcripts arise from separate genes. The two transcripts increased coordinately in aleurone cells stimulated with gibberellic acid. These data indicate that there is a high pI alpha-amylase multigene family with at least two active members, both of which are regulated in some manner by the plant hormone gibberellic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1540967515,"Analysis of neutrophil phospholipids from rats fed an essential fatty acid-deficient diet revealed a 33% reduction in arachidonate and a 90% reduction in linoleate compared to neutrophil phospholipids of rats fed a normal diet. The neutrophil phospholipids from rats fed the essential fatty acid-deficient diet also contained significant amounts of 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate, a fatty acid not found in the neutrophils of rats fed a normal diet. Analysis of the production of leukotrienes of the B series by ionophore-stimulated neutrophils from rats fed an essential fatty acid-deficient diet revealed a 87% reduction in leukotriene B4 compared to neutrophils from rats fed a normal diet even though the arachidonate content was reduced by only 34%. Essential fatty acid-deficient neutrophils converted endogenous 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid to leukotriene A3 and its nonenzymatic degradation products, but little or no leukotriene B3 was formed. Neutrophils from rats fed a normal diet incubated with ionophore and exogenous 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate also produced leukotriene A3 and its nonenzymatic degradation products but little or no leukotriene B3. Exogenous 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate incubated with ionophore-stimulated normal neutrophils caused a dose-dependent inhibition of leukotriene A hydrolase resulting in diminished production of leukotriene B4 from endogenous arachidonate. Assays of leukotriene A hydrolase in the 10,000 X g supernatant fraction of a homogenate of RBL-1 cells revealed that a lipoxygenase metabolite of 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate rather than 5,8,11-eicosatrienoate itself is the inhibitor of leukotriene A hydrolase. Thus the finding that leukotriene B4 production by neutrophils from essential fatty acid-deficient rats is diminished out of proportion to the decrease in arachidonate content appears to be due to inhibition of leukotriene A hydrolase by a lipoxygenase metabolite."

https://openalex.org/W1537655271,"Mouse monoclonal antibodies to the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor were raised by immunizing with plasma membrane vesicles prepared from A431 cells. This paper describes the characterization of one of the IgG anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies generated and its use to probe the role of transforming growth factor (TGF) in the autonomous growth of a melanoma cell line in culture. This antibody blocks: 1) the binding of 125I-EGF to the A431 EGF receptor; 2) the EGF stimulation of the EGF-dependent protein kinase in vitro; and 3) human fibroblast DNA synthesis and proliferation in culture. It can precipitate the EGF receptor from metabolically labeled A431 cells and human fibroblasts and these receptors have indistinguishable peptide maps. No EGF receptor could be detected by immunoprecipitation after fibroblasts were treated with EGF or conditioned medium from the melanoma cells which secrete EGF-like TGF (alpha TGF). The antibody itself did not down-regulate the receptor but could block down-regulation caused by EGF and alpha TGF. Despite its ability to block EGF-stimulated growth and down-regulation in fibroblasts, the antibody was unable to block the growth and soft agar colony formation of alpha TGF-secreting melanoma cells, nor could the antibody detect EGF receptor in these cells under the conditions developed to prevent down-regulation and lysosomal degradation of the EGF receptor. These studies suggest that these melanoma cells do not have the intact EGF receptor and that the secretion of alpha TGF by these cells plays no role in their growth in culture. The absence of receptor cannot be explained by down-regulation by secreted alpha TGF."
https://openalex.org/W1595140410,"Cyclic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade systems are responsible for regulating numerous metabolic pathways. The capacity of a cyclic cascade system to maintain a steady-state level of phosphorylation and, hence, a specific biological activity of a phosphorylatable protein is dependent upon a constant supply of metabolic energy (ATP). Quantification of the extent of ATP consumption in a cyclic cascade was examined experimentally with the model in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system described in detail in the previous paper (Shacter, E., Chock, P. B., and Stadtman, E. R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12252-12259). The results indicate that (a) when the concentrations of converter enzymes and interconvertible substrate are held constant and the fractional phosphorylation of the substrate is varied by changing the allosteric effector concentrations, the rate of ATP consumption in the monocyclic cascade is directly proportional to the steady-state level of phosphorylation being maintained. (b) Attainment of a particular steady-state level of phosphorylation is determined by the net ratio of the protein kinase and phosphatase activities and is independent of the absolute concentrations of these enzymes. (c) Whereas the time required to reach a given steady state is inversely proportional to the converter enzyme concentrations, the amount of ATP consumed in maintaining that steady state is directly proportional to the kinase and phosphatase concentrations. In addition, a theoretical analysis based upon experimentally determined parameters for two in vivo cyclic cascade systems (pyruvate kinase and glycogen phosphorylase) revealed that under normal conditions, cyclic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades consume only a small proportion (less than 0.02%) of the total cellular energy flux."
https://openalex.org/W1510108535,"Treatment of mouse Leydig cell cultures with luteinizing hormone (LH) or with 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) for 5 days elicited a dose- and time-dependent increase in the microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme activities. 17 alpha-Hydroxylase and C17-20 lyase as well as a parallel increase in testosterone production. Reduction of the oxygen tension from 19 to 1% resulted in a greater increase in enzyme activity. Induction of microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities was 35 to 50% greater with 8-Br-cAMP than with LH and the increase in C17-20 lyase activity was 4-fold greater than that of 17 alpha-hydroxylase. Maximal induction of P-450 enzyme activities was observed between 3 and 5 days of continual treatment with 8-Br-cAMP or LH. Removal of 8-Br-cAMP from the culture medium inhibited any further increase in C17-20 lyase activity and testosterone production. The role of protein synthesis in the induction process was investigated by incubating Leydig cell cultures with and without cycloheximide between 24 and 48 h of treatment with 8-Br-cAMP. Cycloheximide completely inhibited the induction of C17-20 lyase activity and the increase in testosterone production. After removal of the inhibitor, cultures responded in a manner that paralleled induction in cultures that had not been treated with cycloheximide. In both cases, a 24-h lag period occurred prior to an increase in cytochrome P-450 activity. These data suggest that the increase in microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities represents an increase in enzyme synthesis and, furthermore, that reduction of oxygen tension decreases degradation of newly synthesized Leydig cell microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities as recently reported (Quinn, P.G., and Payne, A.H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4130-4135)."
https://openalex.org/W1515304043,"We have established three murine hybridoma cell lines that secrete monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against the alpha subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli. All three antibodies have been purified and identified to be of the IgM class. competition binding assays indicate that these antibodies bind to at least two distinct but adjacent or interacting sites. An immunoblot assay has been developed that permits quantitation of alpha in crude extracts. These assays agree with previous determinations of the number of polymerase molecules present/cell and indicate that the size of alpha is the same in both the crude and pure form. Anti-alpha IgM can be used with fixed Staphylococcus aureus, cells and anti-IgM to specifically precipitate alpha."
https://openalex.org/W201789160,"EPR and optical analysis of the 420 nm form of cytochrome oxidase (Kumar, C., Naqui, A., and Chance, B. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2073-2076) shows that 1) the 420 nm form possesses a 605 nm band, g = 5 EPR signals, and a slightly blue shifted 655 nm band; 2) the reaction of H2O2 with the 420 nm form generates the peroxide complex (Soret band at 427 nm) with the formation of a 580 nm band and abolition of both the 655 nm band and the g = 5 EPR signal. Comparison of our results with past data shows that various forms of oxidase formed from the resting oxidase through different protocols may be identified to be either the 420 nm or the 427 nm form and leads to identification of a peroxy intermediate during oxidase turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1624851035,"The radiation target size of the functional asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) in purified plasma membranes was determined for human liver and the human hepatoma cell line, Hep G2, by evaluation of the binding of 125I-asialoorosomucoid. Identical inactivation curves were observed for ASGP-R from normal human liver and post-mortem human liver and exhibited a functional unit of 70,000 daltons. The human hepatoma Hep G2 ASGP-R, in contrast, showed a target size of 140,000 daltons. These results suggest that the functional ligand-binding unit of the human ASGP-R is a multimer of the approximately 34,000-dalton unglycosylated receptor polypeptide (Schwartz, A. L., and Rup, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11249-11255)."

https://openalex.org/W1501203506,"Gastric vesicles enriched in (H+,K+)-ATPase were prepared from hog fundic mucosa and studied for their ability to transport K+ using 86Rb+ as tracer. In the absence of ATP, the vesicles elicited a rapid uptake of 86Rb+ (t 1/2 = 45 +/- 9 s at 30 degrees C) which accounted for both transport and binding. Transport was osmotically sensitive and was the fastest phase. It was not limited by anion permeability (C1- was equivalent to SO2-4) but rather by availability of either H+ or K+ as intravesicular countercation suggesting a Rb+-K+ or a Rb+-H+ exchange. Selectivity was K+ greater than Rb+ greater than Cs+ much greater than Na+,Li+. The capacity of vesicles which catalyzed the fast transport of K+ was 83 +/- 4% of maximal vesicular capacity of the fraction. Addition of ATP decreased both rate and extent of 86Rb+ uptake (by 62 and 43%, respectively with 1 mM ATP) with an apparent Ki of 30 microM. Such an effect was not seen on 22Na+ transport. ATP inhibition of transport did not require the presence of Mg2+, and inhibition was also produced by ADP even in the presence of myokinase inhibitor. On the other hand, 86Rb+ uptake was as strongly inhibited by 200 microM vanadate in the presence of Mg2+. Efflux studies suggested that ATP inhibition was originally due to a decrease of vesicular influx with little or no modification of efflux. Since ATP, ADP, and vanadate are known modulators of the (H+,K+)-ATPase, we propose that, in the absence of ATP, (H+,K+)-ATPase passively exchanges K+ for K+ or H+ and that ATP, ADP, and vanadate regulate this exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1553095075,"35S- and 32P-labeled proteins from control chick embryo fibroblasts and from fibroblasts transformed by UR2 sarcoma virus, or by a temperature-sensitive mutant (tsLA29) of Rous sarcoma virus, were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on giant gels to detect transformation-specific changes in protein synthesis and total phosphorylation. A nontransforming avian retrovirus, UR2-associated virus (UR2AV), was also studied. Virus-coded proteins appear in whole cell lysates of all infected cells. The structural proteins can be identified by comparison with proteins immunoprecipitated with antivirus serum. The transforming proteins pp60src and p68ros, present in cells transformed with Rous sarcoma virus and UR2, respectively, are phosphorylated in vivo. Eighteen increases and eight decreases in cellular phosphoproteins are associated with transformation, and revert toward normal levels when cells infected with tsLA29 are incubated at 42 degrees C. These changes are more extensive than previously reported, but none represent new phosphorylations, since all phosphoproteins seen in transformed cells also appear to be phosphorylated to a certain extent in control cells. Fifteen cellular proteins show increased relative rates of synthesis apparently related either to transformation or to growth at 42 degrees C. Four other proteins are increased exclusively in cells incubated at 42 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C, whether transformed or not. Eleven additional increases in the synthesis of cellular proteins, many quite large, and one seemingly a de novo induction, appear to be specific for transformation. These changes occur in cells transformed by either UR2 or Rous sarcoma virus at 37 degrees C, do not occur with UR2AV infection, and tend to revert in cells infected with tsLA29 incubated at 42 degrees C. These 11 changes may represent increases in cellular gene expression that are related specifically to the maintenance of the transformed state."
