https://openalex.org/W2047946144,"In cat retina, rod bipolar terminials do not synapse on ganglion cells but on two types of amacrine cell (types I and II). Cone bipolars synapse directly on ganglion cells and on type I amacrines. The type II amacrine appears to play a special internuncial role between bipolars and ganglion cells in the rod system."

This effect is selectively antagonized by the stereospecific narcotic antagonist naloxone. Reserpine and the dopamine-acetaldehyde conjugate salsolinol also produce a depletion of regional brain calcium, but only the salsolinol depletion is antagonized by naloxone. Experiments with naloxone provide evidence for two calcium-sensitive pools in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2048275868,The spadix of Symplocarpus foetidus L. maintains an internal temperature 15 degrees to 35 degrees C above ambient air temperatures of -15 degrees to +15 degrees C. For at least 14 days it consumes oxygen at a rate comparable to that of homeothermic animals of equivalent size. Temperature regulation is accomplished by variations in respiratory rate.

https://openalex.org/W2052177948,"Cultures of the clonally derived pluripotent teratocarcinoma cell line, SIKR, are heterogeneous. They are characterized by the presence of two cell types—the “C cells”, which grow as tight, round colonies on a monolayer of the morphologically distinct “E cells”. In contrast to the C cells, whose proliferation is apparently uninhibited by high cell density, the E cells show density-dependent inhibition of growth. Subclones of SIKR are of two types: they are either similar to the parent culture, in that they contain both C and E cells (CE subclones) and are themselves tumorigenic and pluripotent; or they are composed only of E cells (E-type subclones), which are primarily not tumorigenic, but may become so after spontaneous transformation in vitro. The tumors formed by transformed E cells (E-t cells) are monotypic (“fibroblastic”), consisting of one cell type which is not clearly identifiable, but which is distinctly not embryonal carcinoma. It is concluded that the tumorigenic C cells are the stem cells of this teratocarcinoma line, and that they give rise to nontumorigenic E cells in vitro, but that the reverse does not occur. It is suggested that the C to E transition represents cell determination in vitro. The interest of this cell culture system for both developmental and oncological studies is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1482160007,"Abstract The initial step in the activation of Factor X by a tissue factor-Factor VII complex has been shown to involve hydrolysis of the same peptide bond as is hydrolyzed by Russell's viper venom. The product, designated α-Xa, undergoes autocatalytic conversion to a lower molecular weight form of equal coagulant activity, β-Xa. The rate of this conversion is markedly enhanced by phospholipid which is present as the lipid component of tissue factor. An alternative pathway of activation, initiated by Xa, has been demonstrated. This involves the conversion of Factor X to an enzymically inactive intermediate, designated I1. This intermediate may then be activated directly to β-Xa at rates identical with the activation of Factor X, by either the tissue factor-Factor VII complex or Russell's viper venom. A third, apparently minor, pathway of activation of Factor X to β-Xa has been demonstrated that is catalyzed entirely by Xa. This involves the conversion of Factor X to I1, which is then converted to β-Xa. A second intermediate appears during this reaction, but whether it is an obligatory intermediate is not known. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence data suggest that the conversion by Xa of Factor X to I1, and of α-Xa to β-Xa, probably involve the release of COOH-terminal peptides. The forms of β-Xa produced from I1 and α-Xa are apparently identical. These pathways are under kinetic control; at high rates of activation the direct pathway to α-Xa and β-Xa predominates, whereas at low rates the Xa formed initially by the direct pathway feeds back and converts Factor X to I1, thus initiating an alternative set of reactions. The final yield of Xa is also shown to be a function of the concentration of the tissue factor-Factor VII complex. It is shown that this complex is rapidly inactivated by its product, Xa, and we propose this as a mechanism of control of the tissue factor pathway."

Functional properties of the hemoglobins fromn several elasmobranch species are unaffected by urea concentrations as high as 5 molar. This in. sensitivity to urea, which is not observed with human hemoglobin, is accompanied by an increased sensitivity to sodium chloride."

https://openalex.org/W1923603038,"Abstract A UDP-glucose:aldehyde cyanohydrin β-glucosyltransferase has been isolated and partially purified from shoots of etiolated seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (Linn) Moench. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of dhurrin (p-hydroxy(S)-mandelonitrile-β-d-glucopyranoside), the cyanogenic glucoside of sorghum, from UDP-glucose and (R,S)-p-hydroxymandelonitrile. The reaction with (R,S)-p-hydroxymandelonitrile is stereospecific for the (S) enantiomer since only dhurrin, and not a mixture of dhurrin and its epimer taxiphyllin, was formed. Although the enzyme exhibited higher activity with aromatic cyanohydrins, it also accepted other aromatic substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1482993342,"The β nerve growth factor protein (βNGF), isolated from the high molecular weight 7S NGF complex in the mouse submaxillary gland, is a basic protein of molecular weight 26,500 which contains two identical peptide chains held together by noncovalent forces. The two chains separate in denaturing solvents. βNGF was cross-linked with dimethylsuberimidate at pH 9.5 and the cross-linked dimer separated from higher and lower molecular species by chromatography on an agarose column in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. The behavior of the cross-linked βNGF, compared either to native βNGF or βNGF reacted with but not cross-linked by dimethylsuberimidate, on a agarose column in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride or on electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate confirmed that its two peptide chains were covalently linked. Cross-linked βNGF also gave a molecular weight of 27,000 by measurement of sedimentation equilibrium and the same amino acid composition as native βNGF except for some loss of lysine, arginine, tyrosine and cysteine. The cross-linked dimer of βNGF was indistinguishable from native βNGF in its ability to elicit fiber outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia in the bioassay. Cross-linked βNGF also recombined with the α and γ subunits of 7S NGF to reform a 7S NGF complex."
https://openalex.org/W1588834902,"Abstract A 4-hour intravenous infusion of egg lecithin in the rat produced a significant increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis from acetate in both liver slices and homogenates. Direct in vitro additions of lecithin to the homogenates produced no change in the conversion to acetate to cholesterol. Mevalonate conversion to cholesterol in both homogenates and slices was unchanged by lecithin infusions. An increase of similar magnitude in the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was seen after the lecithin infusion. This increase in enzyme activity was associated with a significantly lower microsomal cholesterol content. The increase in cholesterol synthesis was prevented when the infused lecithin was made to molar ratios of cholesterol to lecithin greater than 0.5:1. Cholesterol-lecithin infusions with molar ratios of 1:1 appeared to inhibit conversion of acetate to cholesterol. The cholesterol content of the microsomes following these infusions was greater than control. Pretreatment of the animals with cycloheximide abolished the activation of cholesterol synthesis by lecithin, but actinomycin D had no effect."

https://openalex.org/W1560270133,"Abstract The plasma membrane-bound penicillinase of Bacillus licheniformis 749/C has been purified from bacteria grown in a medium containing [2-3H]glycerol and 14C-labeled aminoacids, and the purified enzyme compared with exopenicillinase. The procedure consisted of repeated chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex in the presence of Triton X-100, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 in the presence of taurodeoxycholate. The purified membrane enzyme moved as a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its specific penicillinase activity was 354 units per µg of enzyme protein (equivalent to that of the exoenzyme). The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 48,000 in the presence of taurodeoxycholate, as estimated by gel filtration, and exhibited high susceptibility to inactivation by heating and by iodine. The purified enzyme retained characteristic lipophilic properties and contained 3H activity which could not be removed from the enzyme protein by treatment with 8 m urea, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 80° or by extraction with chloroform-methanol. The tritium activity could be separated from the enzyme protein by treatment with trypsin or phospholipase D followed by gel filtration and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The small component(s) released by trypsin contained both 14C and 3H activity. The resulting enzyme had lost its lipophilic character and showed properties similar to exopenicillinase."

https://openalex.org/W1663412252,"Abstract Creatine kinase from chicken breast muscle can be titrated stoichiometrically with 2 equivalents of 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, a chromophoric probe specific for thiols, without loss of enzymatic activity (Quiocho, F. A., and Thomson, J. W. (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 2858–2862). The rate of reaction of mercurinitrophenol with creatine kinase was measured using the stopped flow rapid mixing technique and was found to depend on the liganded state of the enzyme. The observed second order rate constant for the unliganded enzyme in N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine)-NaOH buffer, at pH 8.0 and 20°, was 4.5 x 106 m-1 s-1. Of the various enzyme-substrate complexes examined, the creatine-enzyme-MgADP-nitrate complex, which is an analog of the transition state complex, showed the most pronounced decrease in reactivity, as much as 200-fold. A 13-fold decrease in the rate was observed for the creatine-enzyme-MgADP complex. Creatine, MgADP, or nitrate added separately decreased the rate by only about 2- to 3-fold. ADP or ATP decreased the rate by 7-fold. These rate differences and those observed for other complexes indicate that creatine kinase undergoes progressively different conformations depending on the complexed state of the enzyme. The rate of reaction of the enzyme isolated from dystrophic muscle was identical with that of the enzyme isolated from normal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1602353232,"Abstract The incorporation of [3H]leucine into polypeptides within intact cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii y-1 was analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and was compared with the incorporation of [14C]arginine. Labeled arginine was a useful agent for tracing general protein synthesis in these cells, as the pattern of radioactivity that resulted from the incorporation of this amino acid was nearly identical with the pattern of protein stain. In contrast, the incorporation of [3H]leucine produced patterns of radioactivity that differed markedly from the pattern of protein stain. When the concentration of leucine in the medium was low (5 x 10-8 to 10-7 m), relatively few polypeptides became labeled with [3H]leucine. Synthesis of these polypeptides was not affected by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytoplasmic ribosomes, but was inhibited by chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of the ribosomes within mitochondria and the chloroplast of this alga. However, the following results demonstrated that the site of incorporation of [3H]leucine was on mitochondrial rather than on chloroplast ribosomes. (a) The large subunit of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase, a marker of chloroplast protein synthesis, was not detectably labeled with [3H]leucine, although this polypeptide became prominently labeled with [14C]arginine. (b) Streptolydigin, acriflavine, and ethidium bromide prevented the incorporation of [3H]leucine, but these drugs had no specific effect on the incorporation of [14C]arginine into the bulk of the cellular polypeptides, including incorporation into the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase. Also, streptolydigin had no effect on the synthesis of chlorophyll. (c) When the concentration of leucine in the medium was increased from 10-7 m to 2 x 10-5 m, labeling of polypeptides synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes was observed in addition to those made on mitochondrial ribosomes, but labeling of the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase still was barely noticeable. These characteristics of the incorporation of [3H]leucine, apparently resulting from an unusual accessibility of this amino acid to the mitochondria, have permitted an analysis of the polypeptides synthesized specifically by this organelle within a plant cell. Furthermore, these results indicated that the synthesis of most if not all polypeptides on mitochondrial ribosomes in C. reinhardtii required continuous transcription of mitochondrial DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2080869048,"In this brief article we have touched on some of the solutions to problems universities are encountering in working with the expanding ""new federalism."" These arrangements will bring faculties into new kinds of relationships, which they can find stimulating if they are prepared ahead of time to accept the kind of public scrutiny that they have not encountered at the national level and to learn about the political system and the politician. Universities will find advantages for their academic programs if they involve faculty and students in programs that promote the advancement of public good provided that caution is exercised to prevent the development of arrangements that restrict academic freedom, push the university into the political arena, and drain its financial resources. Faculties need to work closely with their university administrations to make sure that valid academic principles are upheld. The exercise will be time-consuming and frustrating, but vital to the objective and the high quality support the public expects from universities."
