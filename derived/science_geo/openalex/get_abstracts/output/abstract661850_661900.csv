https://openalex.org/W3094427434,"Higher-valency ligands for COFs Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have exhibited more extensive connectivity (valency) and topological diversity than covalent organic frameworks (COFs), mainly because MOF linkers can connect from 3 to 24 discrete units or even infinity for one-dimensional rods. For COFs, linkers generally have a valency of 3 or 4 that reflect the valency of organic carbon. Gropp et al. created cubane-like linkers from 1,4-boronophenylphosphonic acid that could condense to make COFs with a valency of 8 or, by adding acid, could form large, single crystals with an infinite-rod topology.

https://openalex.org/W3094199989,"The HLA-DR15 haplotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), but our understanding of how it contributes to MS is limited. Because autoreactive CD4+ T cells and B cells as antigen-presenting cells are involved in MS pathogenesis, we characterized the immunopeptidomes of the two HLA-DR15 allomorphs DR2a and DR2b of human primary B cells and monocytes, thymus, and MS brain tissue. Self-peptides from HLA-DR molecules, particularly from DR2a and DR2b themselves, are abundant on B cells and thymic antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, we identified autoreactive CD4+ T cell clones that can cross-react with HLA-DR-derived self-peptides (HLA-DR-SPs), peptides from MS-associated foreign agents (Epstein-Barr virus and Akkermansia muciniphila), and autoantigens presented by DR2a and DR2b. Thus, both HLA-DR15 allomorphs jointly shape an autoreactive T cell repertoire by serving as antigen-presenting structures and epitope sources and by presenting the same foreign peptides and autoantigens to autoreactive CD4+ T cells in MS."
https://openalex.org/W3014935876,"The identification of bots is an important and complicated task. The bot classifier was successfully introduced as a way to estimate the number of bots in a given list of accounts and, as a consequence, has been frequently used in academic publications. Given its relevance for academic research and our understanding of the presence of automated accounts in any given Twitter discourse, we are interested in Botometer's diagnostic ability over time. To do so, we collected the Botometer scores for five datasets (three verified as bots, two verified as human; n = 4,134) in two languages (English/German) over three months. We show that the Botometer scores are imprecise when it comes to estimating bots; especially in a different language. We further show in an analysis of Botometer scores over time that Botometer's thresholds, even when used very conservatively, are prone to variance, which, in turn, will lead to false negatives (i.e., bots being classified as humans) and false positives (i.e., humans being classified as bots). This has immediate consequences for academic research as most studies in social science using the tool will unknowingly count a high number of human users as bots and vice versa. We conclude our study with a discussion about how computational social scientists should evaluate machine learning systems that are developed for identifying bots."
https://openalex.org/W3093704180,"<h2>Summary</h2> Processing in cortical circuits is driven by combinations of cortical and subcortical inputs. These inputs are often conceptually categorized as bottom-up, conveying sensory information, and top-down, conveying contextual information. Using intracellular recordings in mouse primary visual cortex, we measured neuronal responses to visual input, locomotion, and visuomotor mismatches. We show that layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons compute a difference between top-down motor-related input and bottom-up visual flow input. Most L2/3 neurons responded to visuomotor mismatch with either hyperpolarization or depolarization, and the size of this response was correlated with distinct physiological properties. Consistent with a subtraction of bottom-up and top-down input, visual and motor-related inputs had opposing influence on L2/3 neurons. In infragranular neurons, we found no evidence of a difference computation and responses were consistent with positive integration of visuomotor inputs. Our results provide evidence that L2/3 functions as a bidirectional comparator of top-down and bottom-up input."

Pyrite oxidizes quickly and is a major source of sulfur to the ocean, but it is also a proxy for the oxygen content historically in Earth's atmosphere. Gu et al. conducted a set of detailed observations of the pyrite oxidation process in a shale unit. The authors found that erosion tied to fracturing is just as important as the oxygen content for the dissolution process. They developed a model that helps determine the conditions in Earth's past for which pyrite might have been stable and the role of microorganisms in the oxidation process.

https://openalex.org/W3093912547,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and Covid-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic in March 2020. As the pandemic still unfolds, uncertainty circles around the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). To diminish the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lessen the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of MS patients, it is essential to understand knowledge, attitudes, and various behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among MS patients. Therefore, this study aimed to look at the behavioral practices related to Covid-19 among patients with MS. A total of 176 MS patients diagnosed at least one year before the survey were conveniently sampled online in Saudi Arabia and their data collected using a structured interview questionnaire in electronic Google form. We determined the reliability of the questionnaire by measuring its internal consistency in a pilot sample of 30 participants. Overall, more than 80% of participants had good knowledge and attitudes towards Covid-19. However, this did not correlate well with the impact on healthcare (r = 0.06). Our study revealed that 46% of participants were anxious about taking their medication, and 32% of participants missed their hospital appointments. Furthermore, 15% of the participants had a relapse but did not go to the hospital because of the pandemic, 15.9% stopped their DMTs, and 35.2% missed drug infusions or refills. Our study revealed overall good knowledge and attitudes related to Covid-19 among MS patients. However, the healthcare impact was considerable, as 32% of the participants missed their hospital appointments, and another 15% had a relapse. This highlights the significance of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare of patients with MS. Measures to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on healthcare service delivery to patients with MS, such as telemedicine, should be strongly encouraged."

This study aimed to examine menstrual knowledge, sociocultural restrictions, and barriers to menstrual hygiene management in school environment among adolescent schoolgirls in a rural community. We collected quantitative data from 250 adolescent schoolgirls and qualitative data from thirty schoolboys and five schoolteachers in five Junior High Schools in Kumbungu district of northern Ghana. Binary logistic regression models were fitted to determine predictors of poor menstrual knowledge. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, coded, and organized into themes. Overall, 53.6% of girls had poor knowledge about menstruation. Most of boys had heard about menstruation and had an idea about what menstruation is with most of them describing it as the flow of blood through vagina of a female. The boys revealed that terms such as Vodafone, Red card, and Palm oil are used to describe menstruation in schools and within community. After adjusting for effect of other sociodemographic factors, we found evidence that girls in their late adolescents were less likely to have poor menstrual knowledge compared to those aged 10-14 years (aOR 0.20, 95%CI 0.08-0.48). Maternal education was protective against poor menstrual knowledge. When compared to adolescents whose mothers were illiterates, those whose mothers had basic education (aOR 0.62, 95%CI 0.28-1.40) and those whose mothers had secondary or higher education (AOR 0.22, 95%CI 0.06-0.76) were less likely to have poor knowledge about menstruation. Adolescents from homes with no television and radio sets were more likely to have poor menstrual knowledge compared to those from homes with television and radio sets (aOR 2.42, 95%CI 1.41-4.15). Comfort, safety, and cost were major factors that influenced their choice of sanitary products. Most of teachers said schools do not provide students with sanitary products, even in emergencies. We found that girls were not to prepare some local dishes (e.g. Wasawasa) during their periods and are forbidden from participating in religious activities (i.e. read Holy Quran or pray in mosque) during period of menstruation. Open discussions about menstruation and its management are not encouraged and girls are considered unclean and impure during period of menstruation. None of schools had a regular supply of water in WASH facilities, a mirror for girls to check their uniforms for bloodstains or soap in toilet facilities for handwashing. Menstrual education through standard school curriculum, starting from primary school, could prepare girls for menarche, improve their knowledge on menstruation, and teach boys how to support girls and women during period of menstruation. This could also eliminate sociocultural misconceptions surrounding menstruation."
https://openalex.org/W3093623200,"Introduction Unintended pregnancies are associated with a number of risk factors such as malnutrition, mental illness, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality and horizontal transmission of HIV to children. These risks are predominant among adolescent girls and young women compared to older women. This study examined the individual and contextual factors associated with unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls and young women in selected high fertility countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods Data for this study was obtained from recent Demographic and Health Surveys carried out between 2010 and 2018 in 10 countries in sub-Sahara Africa. The sample size for this study was made up of 6,791 adolescent girls and young women (aged 15–24), who were pregnant during the surveys and had complete responses on all the variables considered in the study. Unintended pregnancy was the outcome variable in this study. Descriptive and multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed and the fixed effect results of the multilevel logistic regression analysis were reported as adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence interval. Results Unintended pregnancy in the selected countries was 22.4%, with Angola, recording the highest prevalence of 46.6% while Gambia had the lowest prevalence of 10.2%. The likelihood of unintended pregnancy was high among adolescent girls and young women aged 15–19 [aOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.26–1.73], those with primary [aOR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.69–2.33] and secondary/higher [aOR = 2.30; 95% CI = 1.90–2.78] levels of education, single (never married/separated/divorced/widowed) adolescent girls and young women [aOR = 9.23; 95% CI = 7.55–11.28] and those who were cohabiting [aOR = 2.53; 95% CI = 2.16–2.96]. The odds of unintended pregnancy also increased with increasing birth order, with adolescent girls and young women having three or more births more likely to have unintended pregnancies compared to those with one birth [aOR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.59–2.48]. Adolescent girls and young women who had ever used contraceptives (modern or traditional), had higher odds of unintended pregnancies compared to those who had never used contraceptives [aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.12–1.54]. Finally, adolescent girls and young women who belonged to the rich wealth quintile were more likely to have unintended pregnancy compared to those in the poor wealth quintile [1.28; 95% CI = 1.08–1.51]. Conclusion The study found that age, marital status, level of education, parity, use of contraceptives and wealth quintile are associated with unintended pregnancy among adolescent girls and young women in high fertility sub-Saharan African countries. These findings call for the need for government and non-governmental organisations in high fertility sub-Saharan African countries to restructure sexual and reproductive health services, taking into consideration these individual and contextual level characteristics of adolescent girls and young women."
https://openalex.org/W3093548410,"High acuity stereopsis emerges during an early postnatal critical period when binocular neurons in the primary visual cortex sharpen their receptive field tuning properties. We find that this sharpening is achieved by dismantling the binocular circuit present at critical period onset and building it anew. Longitudinal imaging of receptive field tuning (e.g., orientation selectivity) of thousands of neurons reveals that most binocular neurons present in layer 2/3 at critical period onset are poorly tuned and are rendered monocular. In parallel, new binocular neurons are established by conversion of well-tuned monocular neurons as they gain matched input from the other eye. These improvements in binocular tuning in layer 2/3 are not inherited from layer 4 but are driven by the experience-dependent sharpening of ipsilateral eye responses. Thus, vision builds a new and more sharply tuned binocular circuit in layer 2/3 by cellular exchange and not by refining the original circuit."
https://openalex.org/W3094079459,"Mammalian cells respond to insufficient oxygen through transcriptional regulators called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Although transiently protective, prolonged HIF activity drives distinct pathological responses in different tissues. Using a model of chronic HIF1a accumulation in pluripotent-stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), we demonstrate that HIF1a activates non-canonical targets to impair generation of oligodendrocytes from OPCs. HIF1a activated a unique set of genes in OPCs through interaction with the OPC-specific transcription factor OLIG2. Non-canonical targets, including Ascl2 and Dlx3, were sufficient to block differentiation through suppression of the oligodendrocyte regulator Sox10. Chemical screening revealed that inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling overcame the HIF1a-mediated block in oligodendrocyte generation by restoring Sox10 expression without affecting canonical HIF1a activity. MEK/ERK inhibition also drove oligodendrocyte formation in hypoxic regions of human oligocortical spheroids. This work defines mechanisms by which HIF1a impairs oligodendrocyte formation and establishes that cell-type-specific HIF1a targets perturb cell function in response to low oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W3093939296,"To identify objective optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) parameters that characterize the spectrum of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), especially those that distinguish moderate from severe NPDR.Sixty eyes of 60 patients with treatment-naïve NPDR (mild: 21, moderate: 21, severe: 18), 23 eyes with diabetes and no retinopathy, and 24 healthy control eyes were enrolled. OCTA slabs were segmented into superficial (SCP), middle (MCP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP) and thresholded by a new method based on DCP skeletonized vessel length. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, parafoveal vessel density (VD), and adjusted flow index (AFI) from all three capillary layers and the vessel length density (VLD) of the SCP were compared between each severity group, after adjusting for age and image quality.All vessel density markers decreased with increasing severity of NPDR. SCP VD and VLD demonstrated significant differences between eyes with diabetes with no retinopathy and mild NPDR (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), as well as between moderate vs. severe NPDR (p = 0.004 and p = 0.009, respectively). MCP VD significantly decreased between moderate and severe NPDR (p = 0.01). AFI significantly increased in the SCP and showed a decreasing trend in the MCP and DCP with increasing NPDR severity.Changes in the SCP VD, SCP VLD, and MCP VD can distinguish severe NPDR from lower-risk stages. SCP changes may be more reliable due to their lower susceptibility to noise and projection artifacts. Thresholding OCTA images based on DCP skeletonized vessel length showed less variability in moderate and severe NPDR. Additional studies are warranted to validate this new thresholding method."
https://openalex.org/W3094226552,"Rabbits are widely used in studies focusing on pain. However, pain is undertreated in this species and one possible factor to explain this is the lack of evaluation methods. The objective of this study was to identify behaviours related to orthopaedic pain in rabbits and to evaluate the influence of the presence of an observer on these behaviours. Twenty-eight rabbits undergoing orthopaedic surgery and filmed 24 hours before surgery, and 1 hour (before rescue analgesia), 4 hours (3 hours after rescue analgesia), and 24 hours post-recovery were observed in the presence and absence of an observer. The frequency and/or duration of behaviours were compared over time and between the presence and absence of the observer using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests respectively. Data are expressed as median and interquartile range and a significant difference was considered when p<0.05. At 1 hour post-recovery, the rabbits showed reduced activity, hopping, change posture, position in the cage, explore, and open eyes in both the presence and absence of the observer. In the absence of the observer, quadrupedal posture, interact with pinecone, and eat carrot also decreased, while wince behaviour increased. In the presence of the observer, before surgery, the rabbits were less active (Presence-280; 162-300, Absence-300; 300-300) and presented a lower duration of explore (Presence-3; 0-32, Absence-40; 4-63). Post-recovery the rabbits flinched less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-1) and suspended the affected limb less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-65). After rescue analgesia the rabbits put weight on and raised the affected limb less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-2) and licked the affected area less (Presence-0; 0-0, Absence-0; 0-2). These findings demonstrate that the presence of the observer inhibited pain-free behaviours in the rabbits, leading to a false impression of pain, and after the surgery the rabbits masked some pain signs related to the affected area."
https://openalex.org/W3094162052,"Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are a powerful tool to dissect the biology of complex human cell types such as those of the central nervous system (CNS). However, robust, high-throughput platforms for reliably measuring activity in human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures are lacking. Here, we assessed 3D cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes displaying spontaneous, rhythmic, and highly synchronized neural activity that can be visualized as calcium oscillations on standard high-throughput fluorescent readers as a platform for CNS-based discovery efforts. Spontaneous activity and spheroid structure were highly consistent from well-to-well, reference compounds such as TTX, 4-AP, AP5, and NBQX, had expected effects on neural spontaneous activity, demonstrating the presence of functionally integrated neuronal circuitry. Neurospheroid biology was challenged by screening the LOPAC®1280 library, a collection of 1280 pharmacologically active small molecules. The primary screen identified 111 compounds (8.7%) that modulated neural network activity across a wide range of neural and cellular processes and 16 of 17 compounds chosen for follow-up confirmed the primary screen results. Together, these data demonstrate the suitability and utility of human iPSC-derived neurospheroids as a screening platform for CNS-based drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3093960162,"Background The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) struggled to end the tenth outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola), which appeared in North Kivu in 2018. It was reported that rumors were hampering the response effort. We sought to identify any rumors that could have influenced outbreak containment and affected prevention in unaffected areas of DR Congo. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in DR Congo over a period of 2 months (from August 1 to September 30, 2019) using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The participants were recruited from five regional blocks using purposeful sampling. Both areas currently undergoing outbreaks and presently unaffected areas were included. We collected participants’ opinions, views, and beliefs about the Ebola virus. The IDIs (n = 60) were performed with key influencers (schoolteachers, religious and political leaders/analysts, and Ebola-frontline workers), following a semi-structured interview guide. FGDs (n = 10) were conducted with community members. Interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and simultaneous note-taking. Participant responses were categorized in terms of their themes and subthemes. Results We identified 3 high-level themes and 15 subthemes (given here in parentheses): (1) inadequate knowledge of the origin or cause of Ebola (belief in a metaphysical origin, insufficient awareness of Ebola transmission via an infected corpse, interpretation of disease as God’s punishment, belief in nosocomial Ebola, poor hygiene, and bathing in the Congo River). Ebola was interpreted as (2) a plot by multinational corporations (fears of genocide, Ebola understood as a biological weapon, concerns over organ trafficking, and Ebola was taken to be the result of business actions). Finally Ebola was rumored to be subject to (3) politicization (political authorities seen as ambivalent, exclusion of some community leaders from response efforts, distrust of political authorities, and distrust in the healthcare system). Conclusions Due to the skepticism against Ebola countermeasures, it is critical to understand widespread beliefs about the disease to implement actions that will be effective, including integrating response with the unmet needs of the population."

Current understanding of the psychological attributes that distinguish professional actors is incomplete. Here, we compare samples of professional actors (n = 104), undergraduate student actors (n = 100), and non-acting adults (n = 92) on 26 psychological dimensions and use machine-learning methods to classify participants based on these attributes. Nearly all of the attributes measured here displayed significant univariate mean differences across the three groups, with the strongest effect sizes being on Creative Activities, Openness, and Extraversion. A cross-validated Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) classification model was capable of identifying actors (either professional or student) from non-actors with a 92% accuracy and was able to sort professional from student actors with a 96% accuracy when age was included in the model, and a 68% accuracy with only psychological attributes included. In these LASSO models, actors in general were distinguished by high levels of Openness, Assertiveness, and Elaboration, but professional actors were specifically marked by high levels of Originality, Volatility, and Literary Activities."
https://openalex.org/W3094484021,"Knowledge of optimal technical performance is used to determine match strategy and the design of training programs. Previous studies in men’s soccer have identified certain technical characteristics that are related to success. These studies however, have relative limited sample sizes or limited ranges of performance indicators, which may have limited the analytical approaches that were used. Research in women’s soccer and our understanding of optimal technical performance, is even more limited (n = 3). Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify technical determinants of match outcome in the women’s game and to compare analytical approaches using a large sample size (n = 1390 team performances) and range of variables (n = 450). Three different analytical approaches (i.e. combinations of technical performance variables) were used, a data-driven approach, a rational approach and an approach based on the literature in men’s soccer. Match outcome was modelled using variables from each analytical approach, using generalised linear modelling and decision trees. It was found that the rational and data-driven approaches outperformed the literature-driven approach in predicting match outcome. The strongest determinants of match outcome were; scoring first, intentional assists relative to the opponent, the percentage of shots on goal saved by the goalkeeper relative to the opponent, shots on goal relative to the opponent and the percentage of duels that are successful. Moreover the rational and data-driven approach achieved higher prediction accuracies than comparable studies about men’s soccer."
https://openalex.org/W3093513352,"Background Breast and cervical cancer are leading causes of cancer burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We measured breast and cervical cancer symptom and risk factor awareness and lay beliefs in Uganda and South Africa (SA). Methods Between August and December 2018 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of women ≥18 years in one urban and one rural site per country. Households were selected using systematic random sampling, then one woman per household randomly selected to participate. Data were collected by interviewers using electronic tablets customised with the locally validated African Women Awareness of Cancer (AWACAN) tool. This has unprompted questions (testing recall) followed by prompted questions (testing recognition) on risk factor, symptom awareness and lay beliefs for breast and cervical cancer. Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests were used to compare the association between socio-demographic variables and outcomes. Poisson regression with robust variance was conducted to identify independent socio-demographic predictors. Results Of the 1758 women interviewed, 90.8% had heard of breast and 89.4% of cervical cancer. 8.7% recalled at least one breast risk factor and 38.1% recalled at least one cervical cancer risk factor. 78.0% and 57.7% recalled at least one breast/cervical cancer symptom respectively. Recognition of risk factors and symptoms was higher than recall. Many women were unaware that HPV, HIV, and not being screened were cervical cancer risk factors (23.7%, 46.8%, 26.5% respectively). In SA, urban compared to rural women had significantly higher symptom and risk factor awareness for both cancers. In Uganda married women/living with a partner had higher awareness of breast cancer risk factors and cervical cancer symptoms compared to women not living with a partner. Women mentioned several lay beliefs (e.g. putting money in their bra as a breast cancer risk factor). Conclusion We identified gaps in breast and cervical cancer symptom and risk factor awareness. Our results provide direction for locally targeted cancer awareness intervention programs and serve as a baseline measure against which to evaluate interventions in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3094475927,"Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) has been studied in several cancer models and is suggested to act through various pharmacological effects. We investigated the anticancer properties of Rg3 through myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) modulation in FM3A mouse mammary carcinoma cells. The effects of Rg3 on MDSCs and consequent changes in cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated by diverse methods. MDSCs promoted cancer by enhancing breast cancer stemness and promoting EMT. Rg3 at a dose without obvious cytotoxicity downregulated MDSCs and repressed MDSC-induced cancer stemness and EMT. Mechanistic investigations suggested that these inhibitory effects of Rg3 on MDSCs and corresponding cancer progression depend upon suppression of the STAT3-dependent pathway, tumor-derived cytokines, and the NOTCH signaling pathway. In a mouse model, MDSCs accelerated tumor progression, and Rg3 delayed tumor growth, which is consistent with the results of in vitro experiments. These results indicated that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the progression of breast cancer. The anticancer effect of Rg3 might be partially due to its downregulation of MDSCs and consequent repression of cancer stemness and EMT in breast cancer. Hence, we suggest the regulation of MDSCs through Rg3 treatment as an effective therapeutic strategy for breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3094201651,"The 2019-Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a global impact. The effect of environmental temperature on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19 and protective efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination towards COVID-19 remains ambiguous. Therefore, we explored the global impact of environmental temperature and neonatal BCG vaccination coverage on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19. The COVID-19 data for reported cases, deaths and global temperature were collected from 31st December 2020 to 3rd April 2020 for 67 countries. Temperature data were split into quartiles for all three categories (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and mean temperature). The impact of three types of temperature data and policy of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infection was determined by applying the multivariable two-level negative binomial regression analysis keeping daily new cases and daily mortality as outcome. The highest number of cases fell in the temperature categories as following: mean temperature in the second quartile (6°C to 10.5°C), median 26, interquartile range (IQR) 237; minimum temperature in the first quartile (-26°C to 1°C), median 23, IQR 173; maximum temperature in the second quartile (10°C to 16°C), median 27.5, IQR 219. For the minimum temperature category, 28% statistically significant lower incidence was noted for new cases from the countries falling in the second quartile (2°C to 6°C) compared with countries falling in the first quartile (-26°C to 1°C) (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.93). However, no statistically significant difference in incidence rate was observed for mean temperature categories in comparison to the first quartile. Countries with BCG vaccination policy had 58% less mortality as compared with countries without BCG coverage (IRR 0.42; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.95). Our exploratory study provides evidence that high temperature might not be associated with low transmissibility and countries having neonatal BCG vaccination policy had a low fatality rate of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3094043825,"Coral disease outbreaks are expected to increase in prevalence, frequency and severity due to climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. This is especially worrying for the Caribbean branching coral Acropora palmata which has already seen an 80% decrease in cover primarily due to disease. Despite the importance of this keystone species, there has yet to be a characterization of its transcriptomic response to disease exposure. In this study we provide the first transcriptomic analysis of 12 A. palmata genotypes and their symbiont Symbiodiniaceae exposed to disease in 2016 and 2017. Year was the primary driver of gene expression variance for A. palmata and the Symbiodiniaceae. We hypothesize that lower expression of ribosomal genes in the coral, and higher expression of transmembrane ion transport genes in the Symbiodiniaceae indicate that a compensation or dysbiosis may be occurring between host and symbiont. Disease response was the second driver of gene expression variance for A. palmata and included a core set of 422 genes that were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, 2 genes (a predicted cyclin-dependent kinase 11b and aspartate 1-decarboxylase) showed negative Log2 fold changes in corals showing transmission of disease, and positive Log2 fold changes in corals showing no transmission of disease, indicating that these may be important in disease resistance. Co-expression analysis identified two modules positively correlated to disease exposure, one enriched for lipid biosynthesis genes, and the other enriched in innate immune genes. The hub gene in the immune module was identified as D-amino acid oxidase, a gene implicated in phagocytosis and microbiome homeostasis. The role of D-amino acid oxidase in coral immunity has not been characterized but could be an important enzyme for responding to disease. Our results indicate that A. palmata mounts a core immune response to disease exposure despite differences in the disease type and virulence between 2016 and 2017. These identified genes may be important for future biomarker development in this Caribbean keystone species."
https://openalex.org/W3094012616,"Background Recent guidelines for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) recommended the door-to-balloon time (DTBT) <90 minutes. However, some patients could have poor clinical outcomes in spite of DTBT <90 minutes, which suggest the importance of therapeutic targets except DTBT. The purpose of this study was to find factors associated with poor clinical outcomes in STEMI patients with DTBT <90 minutes. Methods This retrospective study included 383 STEMI patients with DTBT <90 minutes. The primary endpoint was the major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as the composite of all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, and acute heart failure requiring hospitalization. Result The median follow-up duration was 281 days, and the cumulative incidence of MACE was 16.2%. In the multivariate Cox hazard model, low body mass index (< 20 kg/m2) (vs. >20 kg/m2: HR 2.80, 95% CI 1.39–5.64, p = 0.004), history of previous myocardial infarction (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.06–5.37, p = 0.04), and Killip class 3 or 4 (vs. Killip class 1 or 2: HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.30–4.40, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with MACE. In another multivariate Cox hazard model, flow worsening during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (HR 3.24, 95% CI 1.79–5.86, p<0.001) and use of mechanical support (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.71–5.79, p<0.001) were significantly associated with MACE, whereas radial approach (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.92, p = 0.02) was inversely associated with MACE. Conclusion Low body mass index, Killip class 3/4, history of previous myocardial infarction, use of mechanical support, and flow worsening were significantly associated with MACE, whereas radial-access was inversely associated with MACE. It is important to avoid flow worsening during primary PCI even when appropriate DTBT was achieved."
https://openalex.org/W3094278820,"The transfibular approach is a common procedure for tibiotalar fusion. However, this technique has several concerns: inadequate stability to resist rotational and shearing forces, a fibula is suboptimal for bone grafting, and an onlay fibular graft that might prevent impacting and cause distraction. We present a modified transfibular technique using partial fibular resection and onlay bone graft, which may address these potential problems. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ankle joint is well fused with neutral alignment and functionally improved at the final follow-up. For this study, 27 consecutive patients (mean age, 68.5 years; range, 58–83) who underwent tibiotalar fusion with a follow-up period of >1 year were retrospectively included. A modified transfibular lateral approach was performed, in which the distal anterior half fibula was resected and fixed as an onlay graft to achieve fusion between the tibia, fibula, talus, and fibular onlay graft simultaneously. Radiographic outcomes were assessed using computed tomography at 4 months after operation and serial follow-up radiographs. Functional outcomes were assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot scale and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score. The mean follow-up period was 17.3 (range, 12–32) months. Four months after operation, complete union was achieved in 13 patients, near-complete union in 8 patients, and partial union in the remaining 6 patients. At the final follow-up, all the patients achieved complete union and maintained neutral ankle alignment. The functional outcome showed a significant increase between the preoperative and postoperative periods. One minor complication occurred, in which medial side ankle pain was relieved after screw removal. This modified technique is safe and effective, and has several merits, including saving the soft tissue of the anterior ankle, saving the course of the peroneal tendons by leaving the posterior half of the fibula, resected fibula serving as a good bone stock, and reducing the likelihood of valgus deformity after fibulectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3093546604,"Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are complications of severe equine asthma, as a consequence of pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction. However, as pulmonary hypertension is only partially reversible by oxygen administration, other etiological factors are likely involved. In human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary artery remodeling contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension. In rodent models, pulmonary vascular remodeling is present as a consequence of allergic airway inflammation. The present study investigated the presence of remodeling of the pulmonary arteries in severe equine asthma, its distribution throughout the lungs, and its reversibility following long-term antigen avoidance strategies and inhaled corticosteroid administration. Using histomorphometry, the total wall area of pulmonary arteries from different regions of the lungs of asthmatic horses and controls was measured. The smooth muscle mass of pulmonary arteries was also estimated on lung sections stained for α-smooth muscle actin. Reversibility of vascular changes in asthmatic horses was assessed after 1 year of antigen avoidance alone or treatment with inhaled fluticasone. Pulmonary arteries showed increased wall area in apical and caudodorsal lung regions of asthmatic horses in both exacerbation and remission. The pulmonary arteries smooth muscle mass was similarly increased. Both treatments reversed the increase in wall area. However, a trend for normalization of the vascular smooth muscle mass was observed only after treatment with antigen avoidance, but not with fluticasone. In conclusion, severe equine asthma is associated with remodeling of the pulmonary arteries consisting in an increased smooth muscle mass. The resulting narrowing of the artery lumen could enhance hypoxic vasoconstriction, contributing to pulmonary hypertension. In our study population, the antigen avoidance strategy appeared more promising than inhaled corticosteroids in controlling vascular remodeling. However, further studies are needed to support the reversibility of vascular smooth muscle mass remodeling after asthma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3093599704,"Background Treatment for tuberculosis lasts for a minimum of 6 months. The treatment burden experienced by patients in a low-incidence setting where directly observed therapy is the standard of care is not well-known. Methods Patients receiving tuberculosis treatment through the chest clinic at a tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia, participated in a semi-structured interview. The interviews explored the treatment burden experienced by patients and possible solutions to ameliorate this burden. Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. They were recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo 12 software. Results Twenty participants (80% male, mean age 40 years) with pulmonary (n = 13) and extra-pulmonary (n = 7) tuberculosis were interviewed. Participants experienced healthcare, financial, social and medication burdens along with lifestyle changes due to treatment. Medication intake was challenging due to the high number of pills, and 55% (n = 11) of patients experienced fatigue amongst other side effects. Patients found clinic-based directly observed therapy inconvenient, especially those working and/or studying. Suggestions to lessen treatment burden included reducing medication burden and better access to health services. Conclusion Tuberculosis treatment is associated with substantial treatment burden for patients. Measures to reduce treatment burden including alternative treatment delivery methods which are more accommodating to patients than clinic-based directly observed therapy, such as video directly observed therapy or partially self -administered treatment, should be considered on a case-by-case basis."
https://openalex.org/W3094559280,"Background There is very little data on long-term immune recovery responses in patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the setting of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Thus, we sought to determine CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and CD4/CD8 ratio responses in a cohort of HIV infected individuals on sustained suppressive ART followed up for more than a decade. Methods The cohort comprised adult patients who started ART between 2001 and 2007 and followed for up to 14 years. Trends in median CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and CD4/CD8 ratio were reviewed retrospectively. Poisson regression models were used to identify factors associated with achieving normalized T-cell biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the probability of attaining normalized counts while on suppressive ART. Results A total of 227 patients with a median duration of follow-up on ART of 12 (IQR: 10.5–13.0) years were included. CD4 cell count increased from baseline median of 138 cells (IQR: 70–202) to 555 cells (IQR: 417–830). CD4 cell increased continuously up until 5 years, after which it plateaued up until 14 years of follow up. Only 69.6% normalized their CD4 cell count within a median of 6.5 (IQR: 3.0–10.5) years. In addition, only 15.9% of the cohort were able to achieve the median reference CD4+ T-cell threshold count in Ethiopians (≈760 cells/μL). CD8+ T-cell counts increased initially until year 1, after which continuous decrease was ascertained. CD4/CD8 ratio trend revealed continuous increase throughout the course of ART, and increased from a median baseline of 0.14 (IQR: 0.09–0.22) to a median of 0.70 (IQR: 0.42–0.95). However, only 12.3% normalized their ratio (≥ 1.0) after a median of 11.5 years. In addition, only 8.8% of the cohort were able to achieve the median reference ratio of healthy Ethiopians. Conclusion Determination of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, along with CD4/CD8 ratio is highly relevant in long-term follow-up of patients to assess immune recovery. Monitoring ratio levels may serve as a better biomarker risk for disease progression among patients on long-term ART. In addition, the findings emphasize the relevance of initiation of ART at the early stage of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3094240148,"Traditional pathogen surveillance methods for white-nose syndrome (WNS), the most serious threat to hibernating North American bats, focus on fungal presence where large congregations of hibernating bats occur. However, in the western USA, WNS-susceptible bat species rarely assemble in large numbers and known winter roosts are uncommon features. WNS increases arousal frequency and activity of infected bats during hibernation. Our objective was to explore the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring as a surveillance tool for WNS. We propose a non-invasive approach to model pre-WNS baseline activity rates for comparison with future acoustic data after WNS is suspected to occur. We investigated relationships among bat activity, ambient temperatures, and season prior to presence of WNS across forested sites of Montana, USA where WNS was not known to occur. We used acoustic monitors to collect bat activity and ambient temperature data year-round on 41 sites, 2011–2019. We detected a diverse bat community across managed (n = 4) and unmanaged (n = 37) forest sites and recorded over 5.37 million passes from bats, including 13 identified species. Bats were active year-round, but positive associations between average of the nightly temperatures by month and bat activity were strongest in spring and fall. From these data, we developed site-specific prediction models for bat activity to account for seasonal and annual temperature variation prior to known occurrence of WNS. These prediction models can be used to monitor changes in bat activity that may signal potential presence of WNS, such as greater than expected activity in winter, or less than expected activity during summer. We propose this model-based method for future monitoring efforts that could be used to trigger targeted sampling of individual bats or hibernacula for WNS, in areas where traditional disease surveillance approaches are logistically difficult to implement or because of human-wildlife transmission concerns from COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3094443869,"In present-day Seoul Korean, the primary phonetic feature for the lenis–aspirated stop distinction is shifting from VOT to F0. Some previous studies have considered this sound change to be a tonogenesis, whereby the low-level F0 perturbation has developed into tonal features (L for the lenis and H for the aspirated) in the segmental phonology. They, however, have examined the stop distinction only at a phrase- or utterance-initial position. We newly explore the sound change in relation to various prosodic structural factors (position and prominence). Apparent-time production data were recorded from four speaker groups: young female, young male, old female, old male. The way the speakers use VOT versus F0 indeed varies as a function of position and prominence. Crucially, in all groups, VOT is still used for the lenis–aspirated distinction phrase-medially due to the lenis stop voicing. This role of VOT, however, is found only in the non-prominent (unfocused) condition, in which the F0 difference is reduced to a low-level perturbation effect. In the prominent (focused) context in which tones come into play, the role of VOT diminishes, led by young female speakers. These can be interpreted as a prosodically-conditioned, complementary use of the features to maintain sufficient contrast. Importantly, however, the tonal difference under focus is not bidirectionally polarized, so that F0 is not lowered for the lenis stop. A lack of direct enhancement of the distinctive L tone weakens a possibility that F0 is transphonologized to the phonemic feature system of the language. As an alternative to the view that tonal features are newly introduced in the segmental phonology, we propose a prosodic account: the sound change is best characterized as a prosodically-conditioned change in the use of the segmental voicing feature (implemented by VOT) versus already available post-lexical tones in the intonational phonology of Korean."
https://openalex.org/W3094163299,"Background A limited number of epidemiological studies have investigated the association between serum uric acid and pulmonary function in the general population. However, the results have been inconclusive. Objectives This study was performed to investigate the association between serum uric acid and spirometric pulmonary function in general population. Methods Among the 8,150 participants who participated in the 2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2,901 participants were analyzed in this study. Subjects were divided into four groups according to forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted quartiles. Participants in the lowest quartile of FVC % predicted and FEV1% predicted were compared to those in the remaining quartiles according to age, education level, household income, smoking status, alcohol consumption, aerobic exercise, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, renal impairment, serum uric acid, and hyperuricemia. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of hyperuricemia for participants in the lowest quartile of FVC% and FEV1 predicted, with above covariates. Results In women, hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FVC% predicted (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.06–2.75, p = 0.027) and FEV1 predicted (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.06–2.74, p = 0.028) respectively, serving as above confounding variables. In men, hyperuricemia (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07–2.22, p = 0.021) was associated with the lowest quartile of FEV1% predicted, not FVC% predicted. According to median age, in women, age ≥ 56 years old with hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FVC% predicted (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.04–3.28, p = 0.037) and FEV1% predicted (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.11–3.75, p = 0.021), respectively. In men, age ≥ 56 years old with hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FEV1% predicted (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.05–2.94, p = 0.033), not FCV% predicted. Conclusions Hyperuricemia was associated with lowest quartile of FEV1% or FVC% predicted in Korean general population. This correlation between hyperuricemia and low pulmonary function was more pronounced in women and older age."
https://openalex.org/W3094402875,"Background Acetabular labral tears cause of pain in patients with symptomatic hip dysplasia. To date, no structured grading system has been developed to evaluate labral tears in these patients. The present study describes a new system of grading labral tears in patients with acetabular dysplasia. Methods The data of 66 patients who underwent hip arthroscopy for symptomatic hip dysplasia from March 2014 to February 2018 were reviewed. Labral tears were classified into four groups, based on the occurrence of chondrolabral junction (CLJ) disruption, capsulolabral recess (CLR) disruption, and labral displacement. Labral tears without instability were classified as grade 1 or 2. Partial delamination or blistering of the labrum with minimal fraying at the CLJ was classified as grade 1, whereas labral tears with CLJ disruption were classified as grade 2. Unstable labral tears with CLR disruption followed by CLJ disruption, but without labral displacement, were classified as grade 3, whereas unstable labral tears with CLR and CLJ disruption, but with labral displacement, were classified as grade 4. The radiological and clinical characteristics of patients in each grade were determined including by simple radiographs and MRI/MR arthrography, as were concomitant findings, including rupture of the ligamentum teres, articular cartilage damage, and presence of a paralabral cyst. The surgical options selected for each grade and clinical outcomes, including modified Harris hip scores (mHHS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) scores, were evaluated. Spearman’s correlation analyses were performed to assess whether labral tear grade correlated with baseline characteristics, the incidence of concomitant injuries, and the severity of osteoarthritis (OA). The Wilcoxon test for paired data was performed to compare treatment results with pain scores. Results The study cohort included six men and 53 women of mean ± SD age 39.9 ± 13.0 years (range, 15–66 years). Of the 66 hips, seven (10.6%), 10 (15.2%), 30 (45.5%), and 19 (28.8%) were classified as grades 1–4, respectively. Symptom duration (P = 0.017), preoperative Tönnis OA grade (P < 0.001), cartilage damage (P < 0.001), and the presence of a paralabral cyst (P = 0.001) correlated significantly with baseline tear grade. In all groups, mHHS and WOMAC scores improved after surgical treatment. Conclusions Arthroscopic findings of labral tears in patients with hip dysplasia differed from the conventional classification. The classification system proposed in this study will likely be useful for determining the degree of labral tear in patients with hip dysplasia and for predicting treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3094419578,"Introduction Maternal, and under-five mortality rates in Gombe State are disproportionately high. The Society for Family Health (a Non-Governmental Organization) in collaboration with Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency implemented the Village Health Worker (VHW) Program in Gombe to address the low uptakes of maternal neonatal and child health (MNCH) services and reduced the impact of healthcare worker insufficiency. VHWs are lay indigenous women trained to educate and encourage women to use MNCH services, provide simple community-based maternal and new-born care through home visits, and facilitate facility linkage. We assessed the acceptability of VHW services among women beneficiaries of the Program. Methods Qualitative data were obtained through six focus group discussions with 58 women beneficiaries of the VHW program who delivered within the last 12 months preceding study period (October–November 2018). Themes explored were roles and acceptability of VHWs, and the influence of VHWs on the uptake of MNCH services. We analyzed data with NVivo 12, using Grounded Theory. Results Participants’ mean age was 25.1 (± 5.3) years old. Most participants 39 (67%), had been in contact with a VHW for at least 10 months. VHWs visited pregnant women at home and registered them for antenatal care, provided them basic maternal healthcare, health education, and facilitated facility linkage. Participants generally accepted the VHW Program because it was community-based, VHWs were indigenous community members, delivered clear messages, and influenced husbands and mothers-in-law to support women’s’ use of MNCH services. VHWs’ interventions were perceived to have improved health literacy and the uptake of MNCH services. Participants generally admired the VHW occupation and recommended VHW program scale-up, and for VHWs to be offered basic obstetric training and employment by health facilities or the government. Conclusion The general acceptance and positive views of VHWs from beneficiaries of the program demonstrates the feasibility of the program to improve the uptake of MNCH services."
https://openalex.org/W3094074950,"Introduction Within country inequality in infant mortality poses a big challenge for countries moving towards the internationally agreed upon targets on child mortality by 2030. There is a lack of high-quality evidence on infant mortality measured through different dimensions of social inequality in Angola. Thus, this paper was carried out to address the knowledge gap by conducting in-depth examination of infant mortality rate (IMR) inequality among population subgroups to provide more nuanced evidence to help end IMR disparity in the country. Methods The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) was used to analyze IMR inequality. HEAT is a software application that facilitates examination of disparities in reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health indicators using the WHO Health Equity Monitor (HEM) database. Inequality of IMR was analyzed through disaggregation by five equity stratifiers: education, wealth, gender, subnational region and residence. These were analyzed through three inequality measures: Population Attributable Risk, Ratio and Slope Index of Inequality. A 95% confidence Interval (CI) was built around point estimates to determine statistical significance. Results A notable disadvantage was found for children born to poor (Population Attributable Risk (PAR): -27.0; -28.4, -26.0) and uneducated (PAR: -17.0; -17.9, -16.0), women who live in rural areas (PAR: -7.3;-7.8, -6.7) and those residing in certain regions of the country (PAR: -43.0; 45.3, -4). Male infants had a higher risk of death than female infants (PAR: -6.8;-7.5, -6.2). The subnational regional variation of IMR had been the most evident when compared with the disparities in the other equity stratifers. Conclusions Policymakers and planners need to address the disproportionately higher clustering of IMR among infants born to disadvantaged subpopulations through interventions that benefit such subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W3094289339,"Background Disadvantaged socioeconomic status is associated with higher stroke incidence and mortality, and higher readmission rate. We aimed to assess the effect of socioeconomic factors on case fatality, health related quality of life (HRQoL), and satisfaction with care of stroke survivors in the framework of the European Health Care Outcomes, Performance and Efficiency (EuroHOPE) study in Hungary, one of the leading countries regarding stroke mortality. Methods We evaluated 200 consecutive patients admitted for first-ever ischemic stroke in a single center and performed a follow-up at 3 months after stroke. We recorded pre- and post-stroke socioeconomic factors, and assessed case fatality, HRQoL and patient satisfaction with the care received. Stroke severity at onset was scored by the National Institutes of Health Stroke scale (NIHSS), disability at discharge from acute care was evaluated by the modified Rankin Score (mRS). To evaluate HRQoL and patient satisfaction with care we used the EQ-5D-5L, 15D and EORTC IN PATSAT 32 questionnaires. Results At 3 months after stroke the odds of death was significantly increased by stroke severity (NIHSS, OR = 1.209, 95%CI: 1.125–1.299, p<0.001) and age (OR = 1.045, 95%CI: 1.003–1.089, p = 0.038). In a multiple linear regression model, independent predictors of HRQoL were age, disability at discharge, satisfaction with care, type of social dwelling after stroke, length of acute hospital stay and rehospitalization. Satisfaction with care was influenced negatively by stroke severity (Coef. = -1.111, 95%C.I.: -2.159- -0.062, p = 0.040), and positively by having had thrombolysis (Coef. = 25.635, 95%C.I.: 5.212–46.058, p = 0.016) and better HRQoL (Coef. = 22.858, 95%C.I.: 6.007–39.708, p = 0.009). Conclusion In addition to age, disability, and satisfaction with care, length of hospital stay and type of social dwelling after stroke also predicted HRQoL. Long-term outcome after stroke could be improved by reducing time spent in hospital, i.e. by developing home care rehabilitation facilities thus reducing the need for readmission to inpatient care."
https://openalex.org/W3094272743,"The plasma seed treatment is effective for promoting seed germination in many crops. However, the biological mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, mRNA sequencing was used to screen differentially expressed genes in the germination process of Andrographis paniculata seeds treated with air plasma (power density = 8.99 J/cm3). Following plasma treatment, the germination percentages were significantly higher than those of the control, they were 3.5±0.6% vs. 0 at 28 hours after sowing (HAS) and 50.3±2.6% vs. 37.3±1.7% at 48 HAS. After unigenes were assembled and annotated, 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected at 28 HAS, compared with nine DEGs at 48 HAS, but no DEGs were detected at 0 HAS, indicating that air plasma treatment mainly changed the gene expression of A. paniculata seeds at 28 HAS. The NCED5 expression level of the treated group was less than one-fifth of the control, and the expressions of three ethylene response factors were significantly higher than the control at 28 HAS, indicating that lower abscisic acid levels play an important role and ethylene signal transduction also participates in radicle protrusion. ACO, NRT1 and PRP3 expressions were significantly higher than in the control at 48 HAS, suggesting that higher ethylene levels cause the endosperm cap to weaken and start to grow root hairs and lateral roots earlier. These findings reveal that plasma promotes seed germination mainly by regulating the expression of hormone-related genes. And the possible signal transduction of related hormones was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3092976217,"There arose one of the most important ecological transitions in Earth’s history approximately 750 million years ago during the middle Neoproterozoic Era (1000 to 541 million years ago, Ma). Biomarker evidence suggests that around this time there was a rapid shift from a predominantly bacterial-dominated world to more complex ecosystems governed by eukaryotic primary productivity. The resulting ‘Rise of the algae’ led to dramatically altered food webs that were much more efficient in terms of nutrient and energy transfer. Yet, what triggered this ecological shift? In this study we examined the theory that it was the alleviation of phosphorus (P) deficiency that gave eukaryotic alga the prime opportunity to flourish. We performed laboratory experiments on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis salina and the eukaryotic algae Tetraselmis suecica and examined their ability to compete for phosphorus. Both these organisms co-occur in modern European coastal waters and are not known to have any allelopathic capabilities. The strains were cultured in mono and mixed cultures in chemostats across a range of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations to reflect modern and ancient oceanic conditions of 2 μM P and 0.2 μM P, respectively. Our results show that the cyanobacteria outcompete the algae at the low input (0.2 μM P) treatment, yet the eukaryotic algae were not completely excluded and remained a constant background component in the mixed-culture experiments. Also, despite their relatively large cell size, the algae T. suecica had a high affinity for DIP. With DIP input concentrations resembling modern-day levels (2 μM), the eukaryotic algae could effectively compete against the cyanobacteria in terms of total biomass production. These results suggest that the availability of phosphorus could have influenced the global expansion of eukaryotic algae. However, P limitation does not seem to explain the complete absence of eukaryotic algae in the biomarker record before ca. 750 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W3093794981,"Introduction South Africa is the HIV epidemic epicentre; however, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will be the most common cause of death by 2030. To improve identification and initiation of care for HIV and NCDs, we assessed proportion of clients referred and linked to care (LTC) for abnormal/positive screening results and time to LTC and treatment initiation from a HIV Testing Services (HTS) Centre before and after integrated testing for NCDs with optional peer-navigated linkage to care. Materials and methods This two-phase prospective study was conducted at an adult HTS Centre in Soweto, South Africa. Phase 1 (February-June 2018) utilised standard of care (SOC) HTS services (blood pressure [BP], HIV rapid diagnostic testing (RDT), sexually transmitted infections [STI]/Tuberculosis [TB] symptom screening) with passive referral for abnormal/positive results. Phase 2 (June 2018-March 2019) further integrated blood glucose/cholesterol/chlamydia RDT, with optional peer-navigated referral. Enrolled referred clients completed telephonic follow-up surveys confirming LTC/treatment initiation ≤3 months post-screening. Socio-demographics, screening results, time to LTC/treatment initiation, peer-navigated referral uptake were reported. Analysis included Fisher’s exact, chi-squared, Kruskal Wallis, and Student’s T-tests. Thematic analysis was conducted for open-ended survey responses. Results Of all 320 referrals, 40.0% were HIV-infections, 11.9% STIs, 6.6% TB, and 28.8% high/low BP. Of Phase 2-only referrals, 29.4% were for glucose and 23.5% cholesterol. Integrated NCD-HTS had significantly more clients LTC for HIV (76.7%[n = 66/86] vs 52.4%[n = 22/42], p = 0.0052) and within a shorter average time (6–8 days [Interquartile range (IQR):1–18.5] vs 8–13 days [IQR:2–32]) as compared to SOC HTS. Integrated NCD-HTS clients initiated HIV/STIs/BP treatment on average more quickly as compared to SOC HTS (5 days for STIs [IQR:1–21], 8 days for HIV/BP [IQR:5–17 and 2–13, respectively] vs 10 days for STIs [IQR: 4–32], 19.5 days for HIV [IQR:6.5–26.5], 8 days for BP [IQR:2–29)]. Participants chose passive over active referral (89.1% vs 10.9%; p<0.0001). Participants rejecting peer-navigated referral preferred to go alone (55.7% [n = 39/70]). Non-LTC was due to being busy (41.1% [n = 39/95]) and not being ready/refusing treatment (31.6% [n = 30/95]). Normalised results assessed at referral clinic (49.7% [n = 98/196]), prescribed lifestyle modification/monitoring (30.9% [n = 61/196]), and poor clinic flow/congestion and/or further testing required (10.7% [n = 21/196]) were associated with non-treatment initiation. Conclusion Same-day treatment initiation is not achieved across diseases, despite peer-navigated referral. There are psychosocial and health systems barriers at entry to care/treatment initiation. Additional research may identify best strategies for rapid treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3094232477,"The hemoglobin disorders are the most common single gene disorders in the world. Previous studies have suggested that they are deeply geographically structured and a variety of genetic determinants influences different clinical phenotypes between patients inheriting identical β-globin gene mutations. In order to get new insights into the heterogeneity of hemoglobin disorders, we investigated the molecular variations on nuclear genes (i.e. HBB, HBG2, BCL11A, HBS1L and MYB) and mitochondrial DNA control region. This pilot study was carried out on 53 patients belonging to different continents and molecularly classified in 4 subgroup: β-thalassemia (β+/β+, β0/β0 and β+/β0)(15), sickle cell disease (HbS/HbS)(20), sickle cell/β-thalassemia (HbS/β+ or HBS/β0)(10), and non-thalassemic compound heterozygous (HbS/HbC, HbO-Arab/HbC)(8). This comprehensive phylogenetic analysis provided a clear separation between African and European patients either in nuclear or mitochondrial variations. Notably, informing on the phylogeographic structure of affected individuals, this accurate genetic stratification, could help to optimize the diagnostic algorithm for patients with uncertain or unknown origin."
https://openalex.org/W3094301115,"Shrubs play an important role in the global carbon cycle and are particularly sensitive to climate change. However, the altitudinal pattern of biomass allocation in mountainous shrubs and its responses to climate change are still unclear. In this study, biomass accumulation and allocation of the shrub community and their relationships with climatic factors were investigated in 331 sampling sites along an extensive altitudinal gradient (311–4911 m) in Southwest China. The results showed that the above-ground biomass (AGB) and the total biomass (TB) of the shrub community decreased quadratically (R2 = 0.107) and linearly (R2 = 0.024) from 9.86 to 0.15 kg·m-2 and 15.61 to 0.26 kg·m-2 with increasing altitude, respectively. However, the below-ground biomass (BGB) and TB of the herb layer increased quadratically with increasing altitudes (R2 = 0.136 and 0.122, respectively. P<0.001). The root/shoot ratio (R/S) of the community and its component synusiae increased gradually with increasing altitudes (P<0.001). The standardized major axis (SMA) indicated an isometric relationship between AGB and BGB for the whole shrub community, but allometric relationships were found for the shrub and herb layer. Redundancy analysis and Pearson correlation analysis showed that the biomass and R/S were significantly correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and reconnaissance drought index (RDI). These findings indicate that shrub biomass allocation is strongly affected by the altitude, MAT and MAP and support the isometric relationship of AGB and BGB partitioning at the community level on mountainous shrub biomes."
https://openalex.org/W3094305681,"The Roundabout (Robo) family of axon guidance receptors has a conserved ectodomain arrangement of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains plus three fibronectin type III (Fn) repeats. Based on the strong evolutionary conservation of this domain structure among Robo receptors, as well as in vitro structural and domain-domain interaction studies of Robo family members, this ectodomain arrangement is predicted to be important for Robo receptor signaling in response to Slit ligands. Here, we define the minimal ectodomain structure required for Slit binding and midline repulsive signaling in vivo by Drosophila Robo1. We find that the majority of the Robo1 ectodomain is dispensable for both Slit binding and repulsive signaling. We show that a significant level of midline repulsive signaling activity is retained when all Robo1 ectodomain elements apart from Ig1 are deleted, and that the combination of Ig1 plus one additional ectodomain element (Ig2, Ig5, or Fn3) is sufficient to restore midline repulsion to wild type levels. Further, we find that deleting four out of five Robo1 Ig domains (ΔIg2-5) does not affect negative regulation of Robo1 by Commissureless (Comm) or Robo2, while variants lacking all three fibronectin repeats (ΔFn1-3 and ΔIg2-Fn3) are insensitive to regulation by both Comm and Robo2, signifying a novel regulatory role for Robo1’s Fn repeats. Our results provide an in vivo perspective on the importance of the conserved 5+3 ectodomain structure of Robo receptors, and suggest that specific biochemical properties and/or ectodomain structural conformations observed in vitro for domains other than Ig1 may have limited significance for in vivo signaling in the context of midline repulsion."
https://openalex.org/W3094463555,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has drastically affected the world economy, raised public anxiety, and placed a substantial psychological burden on the governments and healthcare professionals by affecting over 4.7 million people worldwide. As a preventive measure to minimise the risk of community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in India, a nationwide lockdown was imposed initially for 21 days to limit the movement of 1.3 billion people. These restrictions continue in most areas, with a conditional relaxation occurring in a few Indian states. In an attempt to assess the emerging mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and determine their spread in India, we analysed 112 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in a time-lapse manner. We found 72 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, defined by 143 polymorphic sites and high haplotype diversity, suggesting that this virus possesses a high evolutionary potential. We also demonstrated that early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into India was from China, Italy and Iran and observed signs of community spread of the virus following its rapid demographic expansion since its first outbreak in the country. Additionally, we identified 18 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and a few selected mutations showed to increase stability, binding affinity, and molecular flexibility in the overall tertiary structure of the protein that may facilitate interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The study provides a pragmatic view of haplotype-dependent spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India which could be important in tailoring the pharmacologic treatments to be more effective for those infected with the most common haplotypes. The findings based on the time-lapse sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 will aid in the development of a real-time practical framework to tackle the ongoing, fast-evolving epidemic challenges in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3094509370,"Objectives To examine the association between penicillin susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae and penicillin consumption in Japan. Methods We used Japan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance data on the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae and sales data obtained from IQVIA Services Japan K.K. for penicillin consumption. We analysed both sets of data by decomposing them into seasonality and chronological trend components. The cross-correlation function was checked using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to examine the correlation between susceptibility and consumption. Results After adjusting for seasonality, the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillins gradually improved (55.7% in 2013 and 60.6% in 2018, respectively) and penicillin consumption increased during the same period (0.76 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day [DID] in 2013, and 0.89 DID in 2018). The results showed positive cross-correlation (coefficient 0.801, p-value < 0.001). In contrast, cephalosporin consumption decreased (3.91 DID in 2013 and 3.19 DID in 2018) and showed negative cross-correlation with susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillins (coefficient −0.981, p-value < 0.001). Conclusions The rates of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates did not negatively correlate with penicillin consumption at the population level. Increased penicillin consumption might not impair the penicillin susceptibility of S. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W3093803189,"Traffic sign boards are often blown away by strong winds, seriously endangering the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. To increase their resistance to strong winds, sign boards are perforated. Using computational fluid dynamics simulations, the wind load resistance of traffic signs with holes was optimised. By comparing the solutions to different turbulence models with empirical results, it was found that the simulation results of the re-normalisation group (RNG) model have the smallest error. Therefore, the RNG model is used to simulate the wind load of traffic sign boards with different perforation diameters and different hole spacings under different wind speeds. By analysing the wind pressure distribution on the surface of the perforated traffic sign board, the perforation scheme for different regions of the sign board under different wind loads was obtained. The results show that reasonable perforation diameters and hole spacings can reduce the wind load and improve the wind load resistance of sign boards. This study provides decision-makers with useful information for installing traffic signs in areas affected with strong winds, thereby improving the wind resistance of traffic signs and ensuring traffic safety."
https://openalex.org/W3094451333,"The continuous development and evolvement of sports provide a challenge for researchers who study psychological correlates and consequences of sports, as no single study can include all sports and results cannot easily be generalized across different sports. In this preregistered study, we present a new way of distinguishing sports based on the eight DIAMONDS situational characteristics: Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Deception, and Sociality. In a cross-sectional online survey, athletes were asked to judge the sport they perform on the eight DIAMONDS dimensions. 138 sports were rated by N = 7,835 athletes using the 24-item version of the S8*questionnaire measuring the DIAMONDS. Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed, and situational characteristics profiles were computed. The sport-specific profiles and identified clusters resemble existing sport categorizations but add relevant information based on the situational characteristics of sports, especially regarding their relation with psychologically relevant variables."
https://openalex.org/W3094493398,"Purpose 
To investigate factors associated with poor visual acuity (VA) in branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO).


Methods 
This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of 72 eyes with BRAO of 72 patients. For statistical comparison, we divided the patients into worse-VA (decimal VA = 0.5) groups. We examined the association of clinical findings, including blood biochemical test data and carotid artery ultrasound parameters, with poor VA.


Results 
Median age, hematocrit, hemoglobin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) differed significantly between the groups (P = 0.018, P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P = 0.025). There was a tendency towards higher median IMT-Bmax in the worse-VA group (worse-VA vs. better-VA: 2.70 mm vs. 1.60 mm, P = 0.152). Spearman’s rank correlation test revealed that logMAR VA was significantly correlated to IMT-Bmax (rs = 0.31, P < 0.01) and IMT-Cmax (rs = 0.24, P = 0.035). Furthermore, logMAR VA was significantly correlated to HDL level (rs = -0.33, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IMT-Bmax (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70, P = 0.049), HDL level (OR = 0.91, P = 0.032), and female gender (OR = 15.63, P = 0.032) were independently associated with worse VA in BRAO.


Conclusions 
We found that increased IMT-Bmax, decreased HDL, and female sex were associated with poor VA in BRAO patients. Our findings might suggest novel risk factors for visual dysfunction in BRAO and may provide new insights into the pathomechanisms underlying BRAO."
https://openalex.org/W3094187158,"Emergency surveillance following an outbreak of transboundary animal diseases such as classical swine fever (CSF), is conducted to find another new infection as early as possible. Although larger sample sizes can help achieve higher disease surveillance sensitivity, the sample size is limited by the availability of resources in an emergency situation. Moreover, the recent CSF outbreak reported in Japan was associated with fewer clinical signs; this emphasizes the importance of detecting infected farms by surveillance. In this study, we aimed to identify effective and labor-efficient sampling methods showing high probabilities of detecting infection, by simulating infection and sampling in pigsties. We found that impartial sampling, which involves selection of pigs to be sampled from the four corners and the center of the pigsty, and random sampling showed comparable probabilities of detection. Impartial sampling involves sample collection without pig identification and random selection. Owing to its simplicity, impartial sampling is labor-efficient and thus a possible substitute for random sampling. In a group-housing pigsty, testing five pigs from five pens showed a higher detection probability than testing five pigs from one pen. These results suggest preferable surveillance methods for conducting emergency surveillance of infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3094247010,"For acute medicine physicians, distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) and clinically relevant urinary tract infections (UTI) is challenging, resulting in overtreatment of ABU and under-recognition of urinary-source bacteraemia without genitourinary symptoms (USB). We conducted a retrospective analysis of ED encounters in a university hospital between October 2013 and September 2018 who met the following inclusion criteria: Suspected UTI with simultaneous collection of paired urinary cultures and blood cultures (PUB) and determination of Procalcitonin (PCT). We sought to develop a simple algorithm based on clinical signs and PCT for the management of suspected UTI. Individual patient presentations were retrospectively evaluated by a clinical “triple F” algorithm (F1 =“fever”, F2 =“failure”, F3 =“focus”) supported by PCT and PUB. We identified 183 ED patients meeting the inclusion criteria. We introduced the term UTI with systemic involvement (SUTI) with three degrees of diagnostic certainty: bacteremic UTI (24.0%; 44/183), probable SUTI (14.2%; 26/183) and possible SUTI (27.9%; 51/183). In bacteremic UTI, half of patients (54.5%; 24/44) presented without genitourinary symptoms. Discordant bacteraemia was diagnosed in 16 patients (24.6% of all bacteremic patients). An alternative focus was identified in 67 patients, five patients presented with S. aureus bacteremia. 62 patients were diagnosed with possible UTI (n = 20) or ABU (n = 42). Using the proposed “triple F” algorithm, dichotomised PCT of < 0.25 pg/ml had a negative predictive value of 88.7% and 96.2% for bacteraemia und accordant bacteraemia respectively. The application of the algorithm to our cohort could have resulted in 33.3% reduction of BCs. Using the diagnostic categories “possible” or “probable” SUTI as a trigger for initiation of antimicrobial treatment would have reduced or streamlined antimicrobial use in 30.6% and 58.5% of cases, respectively. In conclusion, the “3F” algorithm supported by PCT and PUB is a promising diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship tool."
https://openalex.org/W3094575299,"Conventional refolding methods are associated with low yields due to misfolding and high aggregation rates or very dilute proteins. In this study, we describe the optimization of the conventional methods of reverse dilution and affinity chromatography for obtaining high yields of a cysteine rich recombinant glycoside hydrolase family 19 chitinase from Streptomyces griseus HUT6037 (SgChiC). SgChiC is a potential biocontrol agent and a reference enzyme in the study and development of chitinases for various applications. The overexpression of SgChiC was previously achieved by periplasmic localization from where it was extracted by osmotic shock and then purified by hydroxyapatite column chromatography. In the present study, the successful refolding and recovery of recombinant SgChiC (r-SgChiC) from inclusion bodies (IB) by reverse dilution and column chromatography methods is respectively described. Approximately 8 mg of r-SgChiC was obtained from each method with specific activities of 28 and 52 U/mg respectively. These yields are comparable to that obtained from a 1 L culture volume of the same protein isolated from the periplasmic space of E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described in previous studies. The higher yields obtained are attributed to the successful suppression of aggregation by a stepwise reduction of denaturant from high, to intermediate, and finally to low concentrations. These methods are straight forward, requiring the use of fewer refolding agents compared with previously described refolding methods. They can be applied to the refolding of other cysteine rich proteins expressed as inclusion bodies to obtain high yields of actively folded proteins. This is the first report on the recovery of actively folded SgChiC from inclusion bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3093811484,"In response to the recent development of ear corn feeding systems and the shortage of bulking agents for manure composting in the Hokkaido region, the plausibility of using corn stover (a residue of ear corn harvesting) as an alternative bulking agent for dairy manure composting was tested. The temperature profile, quality of the final product, and greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated and compared with the values obtained from manure that used wheat straw, a typical bulking agent. A sufficiently high temperature profile (>70°C) and active organic matter degradation were achieved by mixing in corn stover. After active organic matter degradation for 8 weeks, CO2 production was significantly lower and the stable final products were obtained. The total solids level increased significantly, to 48.8-50.4%, while the C/N ratio dropped significantly, from 19.9-21.8 to 11.2-12.8. Methane emission from the corn-stover-based pile was 0.36% of initial volatile solids, while nitrous oxide emission was 0.58% of initial N, proving that the use of corn stover can mitigate greenhouse gas emission and that its mitigating effect was comparable to those of other bulking agents. Together, the results showed that the use of corn stover can be a suitable alternative bulking agent for dairy manure composting and can serve as part of an ecologically friendly and circular method of dairy farming."
https://openalex.org/W3094313009,"Perceptions acquired during tertiary health promotion education can influence students' interactions with their future service-users. Reflective practice can highlight these perceptions. Here we describe the findings of a reflective exercise conducted with postgraduate health promotion students as part of a learning activity. Students (n = 44) reflected on their understandings of at-risk populations in three priority areas-tobacco, obesity and alcohol. The activity aimed to deconstruct students' understandings of these populations and identify understandings juxtaposed to the philosophical underpinnings of health promotion, for addressing through teaching and learning. Thematic analysis revealed students' understanding of all three at-risk populations fit within five themes: apathy/lack of altruism, complexity/choice, pressure/control, escaping /excuses, and environmental contexts. Students also have varying levels of tolerance to at-risk populations, expressing greatest tolerance towards those whose addiction undermines choice and self-control, and least towards those who are overweight/obese or whose behaviour causes risk to others. Our findings show reflective practice is a valuable tool to help educators understand students' attitudes and values and implement changes to support their future role in the community."
