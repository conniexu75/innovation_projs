https://openalex.org/W1975721518,"The reaction of C(60) with BH(3): tetrahydrofuran in toluene followed by hydrolysis yielded C(60)H(2). This product was separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized as the addition product of H(2) to a 6,6-ring fusion (1alb isomer). The (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of the product remained a sharp singlet between -80 degrees and +100 degrees C, which suggests a static structure on the NMR time scale. Hydrolysis of the proposed borane addition product with acetic acid-d(1) or D(2)O yielded C(60)HD, and its (3)J(HD) coupling constant is consistent with vicinal addition. The observation of a single C(60)H(2) isomer is in complete agreement with earlier calculations that indicated that at most 2 of the 23 possible isomers of C(60) would be observable at equilibrium at room temperature. These results suggest that organoborane chemistry may be applied to further functionalization of fullerenes."

https://openalex.org/W2000876663,"Interfacial force microscopy has been used to show that a single layer of self-assembling molecules adsorbed on a gold substrate can prevent adhesion between gold and a tungsten probe. The passivated gold is able to elastically support large repulsive loads, with plots of load versus deformation closely following the Hertzian model. The gold shear-stress threshold for plastic deformation is determined to be âˆ¼1 gigapascal, which is in agreement with the theoretical value for the intrinsic gold-lattice stability."
https://openalex.org/W2072367428,"The SNC (shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite) meteorites, thought to be igneous rocks from Mars, contain melt inclusions trapped at depth in early-formed crystals. Determination of the pre-eruptive water contents of SNC parental magmas from calculations of the solidification histories of these amphibole-bearing inclusions indicates that martian magmas commonly contained 1.4 percent water by weight. When combined with an estimate of the volume of igneous materials on Mars, this information suggests that the total amount of water outgassed since 3.9 billion years ago corresponds to global depths on the order of 200 meters. This value is significantly higher than previous geochemical estimates but lower than estimates based on erosion by floods. These results imply a wetter Mars interior than has been previously thought and support suggestions of significant outgassing before formation of a stable crust or heterogeneous accretion of a veneer of cometary matter."
https://openalex.org/W1976348250,"Ground waters in three adjacent regional flow systems in the midcontinent exhibit extreme chemical and isotopic variations that delineate large-scale fluid flow and mixing processes and two distinct mechanisms for the generation of saline fluids. Systematic spatial variations of major ion concentrations, H, O, and Sr isotopic compositions, and ground-water migration pathways indicate that each flow system contains water of markedly different origin. Mixing of the three separate ground waters exerts a fundamental control on ground-water composition. The three ground waters are: (i) dilute meteoric water recharged in southern Missouri; (ii) saline Na-Ca-Cl water in southeastern Kansas of far-traveled meteoric origin that acquired its salinity by halite dissolution; and (iii) Na-Ca-Cl brines in north-central Oklahoma that may have originated as Paleozoic seawater."

https://openalex.org/W2029271704,"Van der Waals forces that bind C(60) molecular solids are found to be sufficiently strong to allow the reproducible fabrication of free-standing C(60) membranes on (100) silicon wafers. Membranes, 2000 to 6000 angstroms thick, were fabricated by a modified silicon micro-machining process and were found to be smooth, flat, and mechanically robust. An important aspect of the silicon-compatible fabrication procedure is the demonstration that C(60) films can be uniformly and nondestructively thinned in a CF(4) plasma. Young's modulus and fracture strength measurements were made on membranes with areas larger than 6 millimeters by 6 millimeters. It may be possible to use C(60), membranes for physical property measurements and applications."

One explanation for the slow burning in a detonation is that successive surface layers of the solid or liquid must react sequentially. Another mechanism, which can also account for the slowness of reactions in shock waves in gases, is the basis for starvation kinetics: the bond that is breaking must draw its activation energy from a vibrational reservoir in disequilibrium with the translational degrees of freedom of the reacting molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2085867477,"Elliptical galaxies were once thought to be similar in their structure and dynamics to rotationally flattened bodies like stars. The discovery that elliptical galaxies rotate much more slowly than a fluid body with the same shape has led to a qualitative change in our understanding of the dynamics of these systems. It is now believed that elliptical galaxies are fully triaxial in shape. Self-consistent triaxial equilibria have been constructed and appear to be long-lived; they are made possible by the existence of conserved quantities, or integrals of motion, for galactic potentials without rotational symmetry. Many self-consistent equilibria are unstable; the nonexistence of elliptical galaxies with axis ratios more extreme than 3:1 is probably the result of such an instability. There is evidence for strong central mass concentrations, perhaps massive black holes, at the centers of some nearby galaxies. Recent observations suggest that many elliptical galaxies formed through the merger of two or more spiral galaxies."

One by one, these problems have been overcome until, today, tar sands are the most promising near term alternative source of fossil fuels. One company has been mining tar sands and extracting oil from them for 10 yr, the last 2 yr at a profit. A second, much larger plant is now about 95% complete, and a third plant and possible fourth are on the drawing board. More than 20 companies have operated pilot projects for in situ recovery of oil from the tar sands. About 16 of these pilot projects are still in operation and one commercial facility may be under construction within 2 yr. The greatest immediate beneficiary of this activity will be Canada, where most of the work is taking place. The development is described in some detail."

https://openalex.org/W2031334526,"Each type of particle, by definition, is special. The special property of neutrinos is that they are penetrating. This has made their discovery and the understanding of their properties elusive, but it has also made them a useful tool in the study of particles and their interactions. In astrophysics, on account of this property, neutrinos provide an important means for energy transfer and permit insight into the interior of stars hidden to other radiation. The special conditions in space permit, in turn, the study of neutrino properties not possible in the laboratory."
