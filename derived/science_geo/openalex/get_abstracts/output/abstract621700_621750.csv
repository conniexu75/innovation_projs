https://openalex.org/W2899587674,"The science of meditation has grown tremendously in the last two decades. Most studies have focused on evaluating the clinical effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions, neural and other physiological correlates of meditation, and individual cognitive and emotional aspects of meditation. Far less research has been conducted on more challenging domains to measure, such as group and relational, transpersonal and mystical, and difficult aspects of meditation; anomalous or extraordinary phenomena related to meditation; and post-conventional stages of development associated with meditation. However, these components of meditation may be crucial to people's psychological and spiritual development, could represent important mediators and/or mechanisms by which meditation confers benefits, and could themselves be important outcomes of meditation practices. In addition, since large numbers of novices are being introduced to meditation, it is helpful to investigate experiences they may encounter that are not well understood. Over the last four years, a task force of meditation researchers and teachers met regularly to develop recommendations for expanding the current meditation research field to include these important yet often neglected topics. These meetings led to a cross-sectional online survey to investigate the prevalence of a wide range of experiences in 1120 meditators. Results show that the majority of respondents report having had many of these anomalous and extraordinary experiences. While some of the topics are potentially controversial, they can be subjected to rigorous scientific investigation. These arenas represent largely uncharted scientific terrain and provide excellent opportunities for both new and experienced researchers. We provide suggestions for future directions, with accompanying online materials to encourage such research."
https://openalex.org/W2899810690,"Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in Ghana. This study examines the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension among Ghanaian aged 15-49 years. This cross-sectional study retrieved data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS). The sample, comprising of 13,247 respondents aged 15-49 years, was analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-Square tests, independent sample t-tests and binary logistic regressions. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 13.0% (12.1% for males and 13.4% for females). Among respondents who had hypertension, 45.6% were aware of their hypertension status; 40.5% were treating the condition while 23.8% had their blood pressure controlled (BP <140/90 mmHg). Socio-economic and demographic factors, health insurance coverage and recent visit to health facilities played significant roles in hypertension prevalence and awareness. While region of residence and health facility visits were predictors of hypertension treatment, age and region of residence predicted hypertension control in this population. This study suggests that in order to address the increasing burden of hypertension in Ghana, there should be an expansion of the National Health Insurance Scheme and development of measures to reduce health inequities. Also, some of the determining factors such as age, gender, marital status are similar to other cultures; therefore, existing interventions from those cultures could be adapted in addressing hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment and control in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2796283458,"Use-wear analysis provides a means of studying traces produced on animal bone during manufacture and use in an effort to reconstruct these processes. Often, these analyses are qualitative and based on experience and expertise. Previous studies have focused on interpreting final traces, but little is known about how these traces develop and change over time. We propose the use of an innovative quantitative method for studying bone surface traces that aims to reduce any unreliable or non-replicable results that can confound more traditional qualitative analyses. We seek to understand the basics of use-wear formation over Time by taking incremental molds of bone specimens subjected to a controlled, mechanical experiment. This study assesses how bone wears during extended use on three Material types (fresh skin, processed leather, or dry bark), from three initial Manufacturing states (unworked, ground with sandstone, or scraped with flint). With data obtained from a confocal disc-scanning microscope, we then apply 3D surface texture analysis using ISO 25178 parameters: surface roughness [Sa], autocorrelation length [Sal], peak curvature [Spc], and upper material ratio [Smr1]. We employ a multilevel multivariate Bayesian model to explain parameter variation under experimental conditions. Our findings show how duration of use strongly affects the transformation of the bone's surface. Unworked bone is completely distinguishable from bone used for long time intervals and those modified by scraping. Interestingly, material wear does not often produce type-specific traces, but does affect the rate of bone alteration and how it is transformed. Specifically, fresh skin transforms bone at a faster rate than other materials. This novel quantitative and experimental approach enhances our understanding of the use of bone as a raw material for making and using tools and provides a foundation for future exploration of archaeological materials and questions."
https://openalex.org/W2900090038,"The Parental Stress Scale (PSS) was developed as a short measure of perceived stress resulting from being a parent. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Danish version in a sample of 1110 mothers of children aged 0 to 12 months using Rasch models. Emphasis was placed on the issues of uni-dimensionality and absence of differential item functioning relative to the age and educational level of the mothers. Results showed that no adequate fit could be established for the full PSS scale with 18 dichotomized items. Further analyses showed that items 2 and 11 had to be eliminated from the scale, and that the remaining items did not make up a unidimensional PSS scale, but two subscales measuring different aspect of parental stress: a 9-item scale measuring parental stress and a 7-item scale measuring lack of parental satisfaction. Fit to the Rasch model could not be established for any of the two subscales. For the parental stress subscale, we found evidence of local dependence for four item pairs (3 and 4, 9 and 10, 10 and 16, 12 and 16), as well as evidence of two items functioning differentially: item 16 relative to level of education, and item 3 relative to both age and educational level. For the lack of parental satisfaction subscale, we found evidence of local dependence between some two pairs (1 and 17, 17 and 18), but no evidence of differential item functioning. Both subscales fit graphical loglinear Rasch models adjusting for local dependence and differential item functioning. Plotting the adjusted subscale scores against one another showed that the two-scale solution provides additional information, as some mothers are stressed but not lacking in parental satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2899822717,"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is often a life-threatening arrhythmia disorder with variable penetrance and expressivity. Little is known about the incidence or outcomes of CPVT patients with ≥2 variants.The phenotypes, genotypes and outcomes of patients in the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society CPVT Registry with ≥2 variants in genes linked to CPVT were ascertained. The American College of Medical Genetics & Genomics (ACMG) criteria and structural mapping were used to predict the pathogenicity of variants (3D model of pig RyR2 in open-state).Among 237 CPVT subjects, 193 (81%) had genetic testing. Fifteen patients (8%) with a median age of 9 years (IQR 5-12) had ≥2 variants. Sudden cardiac arrest occurred in 11 children (73%), although none died during a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 2.5-6.1). Thirteen patients (80%) had at least two RYR2 variants, while the remaining two patients had RYR2 variants plus variants in other CPVT-linked genes. Among all variants identified, re-classification of the commercial laboratory interpretation using ACMG criteria led to the upgrade from variant of unknown significance (VUS) to pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) for 5 variants, and downgrade from P/LP to VUS for 6 variants. For RYR2 variants, 3D mapping using the RyR2 model suggested that 2 VUS by ACMG criteria were P/LP, while 2 variants were downgraded to likely benign.This severely affected cohort demonstrates that a minority of CPVT cases are related to ≥2 variants, which may have implications on family-based genetic counselling. While multi-variant CPVT patients were at high-risk for sudden cardiac arrest, there are insufficient data to conclude that this genetic phenomenon has prognostic implications at present. Further research is needed to determine the significance and generalizability of this observation. This study also shows that a rigorous approach to variant re-classification using the ACMG criteria and 3D mapping is important in reaching an accurate diagnosis, especially in the multi-variant population."
https://openalex.org/W2900131972,"This study aimed to investigate the higher-level cognitive functions (i.e. metacognition and executive functions) of Dutch competitive table tennis players to better understand its relevance for performance in this fast and complex sport. Thirty elite (age 16 ± 4) and thirty age and sex-matched sub-elite peers (age 16 ± 5) were assessed on metacognition and executive functions (working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility) using D-KEFS tests. Compared to norm scores, both the Dutch competitive elite and sub-elite table tennis players scored above average on all tests (p < 0.05). MANOVA showed a main effect for performance level (elites outscored sub-elites; p < 0.05). T-tests revealed that elite players make less mistakes on tests for inhibitory control (CWI-3: 0.9 ± 0.9; CWI-4: 1.1 ± 1.2) than sub-elite players (CWI-3: 1.8 ± 1.1; CWI-4: 2.6 ± 1.5) (p < 0.05). When controlling for training hours in a MANCOVA, no significant main effect of performance level remained (p > 0.05). In conclusion, Dutch elite and sub-elite table tennis players are characterized by above-average scores on higher-level cognitive functions compared to norm scores. A relation with performance level has been shown, which may be explained by the greater exposure to table tennis for elite compared to sub-elite players. However, longitudinal research is needed to indicate the direction of this association."
https://openalex.org/W2899753238,"The Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) is under threat due to hunting for local consumption and illegal trafficking of scales and meat. The dearth of scientific studies on the ecology of the M. crassicaudata has impaired accurate assessments of its conservation needs. This study investigated the habitat preference and burrow characteristics of M. crassicaudata in a tropical lowland rainforest in southwest Sri Lanka. A total of 75 burrows (54 feeding burrows and 21 resting burrows) of M. crassicaudata in four different habitat types i.e. secondary forest, Pine-dominated forest, rubber cultivations and tea-dominated home gardens bordering forest were observed using fixed-width transects in order to characterize resting and feeding burrows of this species. The highest density of resting burrows was recorded from the secondary forest (4ha-1), followed by rubber cultivations (2.5ha-1) while no resting burrows were recorded in the Pine-dominated forest and the tea-dominated home gardens bordering forest. Feeding burrows were more abundant in the Pine-dominated forest (5.7ha-1). The burrow depth, burrow opening height, and width were significantly larger in resting burrows compared to feeding burrows. Resting burrows were located at higher elevations (75-100m) with moderately high slopes (450-600), dense canopy cover (>75%) and away from human habitation. Feeding burrows showed a greater variability in terms of associated environmental features. The study further revealed that Indian pangolins exclusively prefer habitats with rocks and boulders under which they dig resting burrows while the location of feeding burrows largely overlaps with the distribution of prey species. The resting burrow design consisted of a bending tunnel that initially slopes downward and then gradually inclines at an angle between 20 and 300, leading to the resting chamber. Our study highlights the importance of conserving fragmented secondary natural forests in changing landscapes of the southwest lowlands of Sri Lanka as these habitats appear to be critical to sustaining populations of M. crassicaudata."
https://openalex.org/W2899885077,"This paper explores the contribution of body-mass index (BMI) categories in shaping past trends of use of healthcare services and associated expenditure in the US and projects results to 2025.The study uses Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data for 2000-2012, reweighted on National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data for 1972-2012 and US Census Bureau data, to carry out projections for up to 2025. A combination of logistic regressions and generalized linear models was used to model use and associated expenditure for the following healthcare services: inpatient care (with/without surgery), office-based care, outpatient-care, drug prescription and home health care. Quantile regressions were used to analyse and project BMI levels.20.5 million individuals will be severely obese in 2025. Normal-weight and overweight individuals have stable trends in use for many healthcare services. Conversely, use of healthcare services in patients in class II and class III obesity will increase substantially. Total healthcare expenditure increases more quickly in the obese population than in normal-weight individuals.Class III obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m2) significantly affects demand and expenditure for all healthcare services. Careful healthcare service planning and implementing effective policy actions to counteract such trends is crucial to meet future demand."
https://openalex.org/W4233250549,"It has been quite a challenge to diagnose Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI) and Alzheimer-type dementia (AD-type dementia) using the currently available clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. As such we propose an automated diagnostic technique using a variant of deep neural networks language models (DNNLM) on the verbal utterances of affected individuals. Motivated by the success of DNNLM on natural language tasks, we propose a combination of deep neural network and deep language models (D2NNLM) for classifying the disease. Results on the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset show that D2NNLM sufficiently learned several linguistic biomarkers in the form of higher order n-grams to distinguish the affected group from the healthy group with reasonable accuracy on very sparse clinical datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2899964485,"Diabetes mellitus represents a major independent risk factor for developing fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) presumably through accelerating atherosclerosis; the underlying cause of most CVDs. Notably, this relative risk is reported to be higher in women than men. Endeavors directed towards identifying novel reliable predictive biomarkers are immensely thereby urged to improve the long-term outcome in these diabetic female patients. Sclerostin (SOST) is a Wnt signaling antagonist whereas irisin is a muscle-derived factor released after exercising which enhances browning of white adipose tissue. Emerging lines of evidence hint at potential crosstalk between them and CVDs. The present study aimed to assess the serum levels of SOST and irisin in Egyptian type 2 diabetic (T2DM) female patients with and without atherosclerosis and explore the possible relationship between both markers and other studied parameters among the studied cohorts. In this case-control study, 69 female subjects were enrolled; 39 type 2 diabetes patients with atherosclerosis (T2DM+ATHR), 22 type 2 diabetes patients without atherosclerosis (T2DM-ATHR) and 8 healthy controls. Their serum levels of SOST and irisin were assessed using ELISA. Significant increase in SOST levels were found in T2DM+ATHR compared to T2DM-ATHR and control (259.9 ±17.98 vs. 165.8±13.12 and 142.0±13.31 pg/mL respectively, P<0.001). Conversely, irisin levels were significantly lower in T2DM+ATHR (P<0.001) and T2DM-ATHR (P<0.01) compared to the control group (32.91±2.545 and 58.55±13.19 vs. 473.6±112.7 pg/mL). Interestingly, significant correlations between the levels of SOST and both irisin and fasting blood glucose were noticed in T2DM+ATHR group (r = 0.3754 and 0.3381 respectively, P<0.05). In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the correlation between SOST and irisin levels in atherosclerotic T2DM female patients implying their potential implication in diabetic cardiovascular pathophysiology and supporting their use as reliable diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for monitoring and preventing CVDs progression of T2DM female patients."
https://openalex.org/W2899966302,"Large subsurface treatment systems (LSTS) and rapid infiltration basins (RIB) are preferred onsite wastewater treatments compared to direct discharge of treated wastewater to streams and adjacent facilities. Discharge of these wastewater treatments may result in contaminant loading to aquifers that also serve as drinking water sources downgradient from the discharge site. Until recently, few studies have characterized the contribution of micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals, fragrances, flame retardants, etc.) to receiving aquifers. We conducted a pilot project to characterize the occurrence of micropollutants in groundwater downgradient from 7 on-site treatment systems in Minnesota, USA: 5 community LSTS and 2 municipal RIB. One downgradient monitoring well was sampled three times at each facility over one year. Of 223 micropollutants analyzed, 35 were detected. Total sample concentrations ranged from 90 to 4,039 ng/L. Sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic) was detected in all samples at concentrations from 7 to 965 ng/L. Other pharmaceuticals (0.12–1,000 ng/L), organophosphorus flame retardants (10–500 ng/L), and other anthropogenic chemicals (4–775 ng/L) were also detected. The numbers and concentrations of micropollutants detected were inversely related to dissolved oxygen and depth to water. Ratios of pharmaceutical concentrations to human-health screening values were <0.10 for most samples. However, concentrations of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole exceeded screening values at two sites. Study results illustrate that large on-site wastewater systems designed to discharge to permeable soil or shallow groundwater effectively deliver pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants to groundwater aquifers and could contribute micropollutants to drinking water via water supply wells."
https://openalex.org/W2900394090,"Adipose tissue (AT) plays a major role in metabolic adaptations in postpartum (PP) dairy cows. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key regulator of metabolism and energy homeostasis; however, information about this system in ruminants is scarce. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the eCB system in subcutaneous AT, and to determine its relation to the metabolic profile in peripartum cows. Biopsies of AT were performed at 14 d prepartum, and 4 and 30 d PP from 18 multiparous peripartum cows. Cows were categorized retrospectively according to those with high body weight (BW) loss (HWL, 8.5 ± 1.7% BW loss) or low body weight loss (LWL, 2.9 ± 2.5% BW loss) during the first month PP. The HWL had higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids and a lower insulin/glucagon ratio PP than did LWL. Two-fold elevated AT levels of the main eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were found 4 d PP compared with prepartum in HWL, but not in LWL cows. AT levels of the eCB-like molecules oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and of arachidonic acid were elevated PP compared with prepartum in all cows. The abundance of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), the 2-AG degrading enzyme, was lower in HWL vs. LWL AT PP. The relative gene expression of the cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 in AT tended to be higher in HWL vs. LWL PP. Proteomic analysis of AT showed an enrichment of the inflammatory pathways' acute phase signaling and complement system in HWL vs. LWL cows PP. In summary, eCB levels in AT were elevated at the onset of lactation as part of the metabolic adaptations in PP dairy cows. Furthermore, activating the eCB system in AT is most likely associated with a metabolic response of greater BW loss, lipolysis, and AT inflammation in PP dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W2899905321,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a huge public health, development and human rights issue worldwide. Despite the fact that working women in patriarchal contexts commonly report higher level of IPV, literature on this subject is still scanty. This paper assessed the magnitude of different types of IPV against female garment workers and identified its correlates using cross-sectional survey data collected during September-December, 2016 from 800 female garment workers randomly selected from lists provided by eight garment factories in and around Dhaka, Bangladesh. The results reveal high levels of IPV experienced by the workers (physical = 34%; sexual = 43%; economic = 35%, last 12 months). Logistic regression results were nuanced. While the worker’s ability to mobilize resources in crises reduced IPV, her savings beyond a threshold increased its likelihood. Moreover, her ownership of jewellery/ large household assets increased the likelihood of IPV. Having moderately or highly controlling husband, substance abuse by husband and his involvement in extramarital sex predicted IPV. Although the worker’s education up to 6 years or more was protective, education more than the husband increased the likelihood of IPV. Young age, having two or more children, experience of non-partner sexual violence and high acceptance of IPV increased the likelihood of IPV. Middle income group protected against IPV, while household food insecurity increased its likelihood. Work at a factory in the Export Processing Zone protected against IPV. The findings indicate that financial empowerment alone is not sufficient to protect the workers from IPV; interventions that combine gender empowerment training for workers in the context of better factory working conditions may be useful in reducing IPV; working with men is essential in this endeavour."
https://openalex.org/W2900129601,"Aspartame (ASP) has been used as an alternative to sucrose for diabetics and obese people worldwide. Co-administration of L-carnitine (LC) with ASP has a protective effect against the liver and kidney toxicity induced of ASP. The goal of the investigation was to assess the enhancement of LC effect on the cardiac toxicity caused of ASP. The rats were divided into 6 groups: control with saline, LC (10 mg/kg), ASP (75 mg/kg), ASP (150 mg/kg), LC with 75 mg/kg of ASP, and LC with 150 mg/kg ASP. The antioxidants were determined by measuring the activities of myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and by assessing the levels of lipid peroxidation, total thiols, and glutathione. There was a significant elevation in LPO, in conjunction with a significant decline in the enzymatic antioxidants superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and the non-enzymatic antioxidants glutathione and thiols. The cardiac myofibrils were found in a disarrayed pattern in ASP treated-animals as compared to the control rats. The animals treated with ASP-HD showed more than one apoptotic cell with a large tail and a small head, and the relaxed loops of the damaged DNA were extended to form a comet-shaped structure. These effects may be due to the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species by ASP, which reduces cardiac function. Co-administration of LC with ASP improved all of the above-mentioned parameters that were disrupted of ASP alone. This study evidences a sufficient originality in showing how LC plays a positive role against cardiac toxicity of ASP."
https://openalex.org/W2899658317,"Impacts of invasive species on native communities are often difficult to assess, because they depend on a range of factors, such as species identity and traits. Such context-dependencies are poorly understood yet, but knowledge is required to predict the impact of invasions.We assessed species- and developmental stage-specificity of competitive and allelopathic effects of the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera on different developmental stages of four native plant species. While some studies have shown a reduction in plant growth caused by I. glandulifera, the magnitude of its impact is ambiguous. For our study we used seedlings and juveniles of I. glandulifera and the native target species Geum urbanum, Filipendula ulmaria, Urtica dioica, and Salix fragilis (seedlings only of the latter), which often co-occur with I. glandulifera in different habitats. Plants were grown in competition with I. glandulifera or treated with I. glandulifera leaf material, or 2-metoxy-1,4-naphtoquinone (2-MNQ), its supposedly main allelochemical.Overall I. glandulifera had a negative effect on the growth of all target species depending on the species and on the plant's developmental stage. F. ulmaria was the least affected and U. dioica the most, and seedlings were less affected than juveniles. The species-specific response to I. glandulifera may lead to an altered community composition in the field, while growth reduction of seedlings and juveniles should give I. glandulifera an advantage in cases where plant recruitment is crucial. 2-MNQ led to minor reductions in plant growth, suggesting that it may not be the only allelopathic substance of I. glandulifera. Surprisingly, I. glandulifera was not fully tolerant to 2-MNQ. This autotoxicity could contribute to I. glandulifera population dynamics. We conclude that I. glandulifera reduces the growth of native vegetation and alters early successional stages without fully hindering it."
https://openalex.org/W2951665462,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans constitutes a leading animal model to study how signaling pathway components function in conserved biological processes. Here, we describe the role of an Axin family member, PRY-1, in lipid metabolism. Axins are scaffolding proteins that play crucial roles in signal transduction pathways by physically interacting with multiple factors and coordinating the assembly of protein complexes. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of a pry-1 mutant revealed differentially regulated genes that are associated with lipid metabolism such as vitellogenins (yolk lipoproteins), fatty acid desaturases, lipases, and fatty acid transporters. Consistent with these categorizations, we found that pry-1 is crucial for the maintenance of lipid levels. Knockdowns of vit genes in a pry-1 mutant background restored lipid levels, suggesting that vitellogenins contribute to PRY-1 function in lipid metabolic processes. Additionally, lowered expression of desaturases and lipidomic analysis provided evidence that fatty acid synthesis is reduced in pry-1 mutants. Accordingly, an exogenous supply of oleic acid restored depleted lipids in somatic tissues of worms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRY-1/Axin signaling is essential for lipid metabolism and involves the regulation of yolk proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2900073669,"Introduction Both the preventive and curative healthcare provisions accumulate agents’ health stock and stimulate economies’ productivities. However, with limited medical resources, increases in preventive health expenditure crowd out curative expenditure, and vice versa, which in turn impairs the population’s health and deters economic growth. This research aims to provide a empirically rigorous test on the hypothesis that optimally allocating health expenditure between prevention and cures stimulates economic growth within different countries, especially developed countries, and investigates whether health services are luxury goods on the path of economic development. Methods Based on OECD country experiences, this present study uses the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method to examine the roles of preventive and curative healthcare services over the path of economic development and proves that preventive and curative health spending have non-linear effects on economic performance. Results For growth maximization, the optimal share of preventive health expenditure to GDP is 0.44% with per capita GDP at US$40,465; the real share is 0.25% with per capita GDP at US$35,230. The optimal share of curative health expenditure to GDP is 10.96% with per capita GDP at US$41,816; the real share is 8.26% with per capita GDP at US$35,230. Accordingly, the estimated optimal provision of health services are currently underprovided. This research further estimates the effects of income on demand for care and shows that the income elasticities of preventive and curative health care are greater than unity. Health services are luxury goods. Conclusions Economies with higher incomes demand such services more than those with lower incomes. The large positive effects of income on preventive care use exist."
https://openalex.org/W2899613952,"The African lion (Panthera leo), listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Appendix II of CITES), is mainly impacted by indiscriminate killing and prey base depletion. Additionally, habitat loss by land degradation and conversion has led to the isolation of some subpopulations, potentially decreasing gene flow and increasing inbreeding depression risks. Genetic drift resulting from weakened connectivity between strongholds can affect the genetic health of the species. In the present study, we investigated the evolutionary history of the species at different spatiotemporal scales. Therefore, the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (N = 128), 11 microsatellites (N = 103) and 9,103 SNPs (N = 66) were investigated in the present study, including a large sampling from Tanzania, which hosts the largest lion population among all African lion range countries. Our results add support that the species is structured into two lineages at the continental scale (West-Central vs East-Southern), underlining the importance of reviewing the taxonomic status of the African lion. Moreover, SNPs led to the identification of three lion clusters in Tanzania, whose geographical distributions are in the northern, southern and western regions. Furthermore, Tanzanian lion populations were shown to display good levels of genetic diversity with limited signs of inbreeding. However, their population sizes seem to have gradually decreased in recent decades. The highlighted Tanzanian African lion population genetic differentiation appears to have resulted from the combined effects of anthropogenic pressure and environmental/climatic factors, as further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2899782571,"Pine mushroom (PM, Tricholoma matsutake) is an important ectomycorrhizal fungus in Asia primarily due to its value as a food delicacy. Recent studies have shown that fairy rings of PM have distinctive fungal communities, which suggests that other fungi influence the growth of PM. Trichoderma is a well-known saprotrophic fungus commonly found in pine roots within PM fairy rings; however, little is known about the diversity of Trichoderma associated with PM and how these species influence PM growth. This study focused on diversity of Trichoderma isolated from pine roots within PM fairy rings and how these species affect the growth of PM isolate. Based on tef1a phylogenetic analyses, nine Trichoderma species (261 isolates) were identified. Trichoderma songyi and T. spirale were the dominant species, and Trichoderma community varied geographically. Growth experiments indicated that metabolites from five Trichoderma species had a significant influence on the growth of PM isolates. Metabolites of two Trichoderma species increased PM growth, while those of three Trichoderma species suppressed the growth. Within the fairy rings, Trichoderma that had a positive or neutral effect comprised the majority of Trichoderma communities. The results of this study suggest that various Trichoderma species co-exist within PM fairy rings and that these species influence PM growth."
https://openalex.org/W2900148434,"The great diversity of dinosaurian tooth shapes and sizes, and in particular, the amazing dental complexity in derived ornithischians has attracted a lot of attention. However, the evolution of dental batteries in hadrosaurids and ceratopsids is difficult to understand without a broader comparative framework. Here we describe tooth histology and development in the ""middle"" Cretaceous ornithischian dinosaur Changchunsaurus parvus, a small herbivore that has been characterized as an early ornithopod, or even as a more basal ornithischian. We use this taxon to show how a ""typical"" ornithischian dentition develops, copes with wear, and undergoes tooth replacement. Although in most respects the histological properties of their teeth are similar to those of other dinosaurs, we show that, as in other more derived ornithischians, in C. parvus the pulp chamber is not invaded fully by the newly developing replacement tooth until eruption is nearly complete. This allowed C. parvus to maintain an uninterrupted shearing surface along a single tooth row, while undergoing continuous tooth replacement. Our histological sections also show that the replacement foramina on the lingual surfaces of the jaws are likely the entry points for an externally placed dental lamina, a feature found in many other ornithischian dinosaurs. Surprisingly, our histological analysis also revealed the presence of wavy enamel, the phylogenetically earliest occurrence of this type of tissue. This contradicts previous interpretations that this peculiar type of enamel arose in association with more complex hadrosauroid dentitions. In view of its early appearance, we suggest that wavy enamel may have evolved in association with a shearing-type dentition in a roughly symmetrically-enameled crown, although its precise function still remains somewhat of a mystery."
https://openalex.org/W2900325472,"Chicken is widely favored by consumers because of some unique features. The leg muscles occupy an important position in the market. However, the specific mechanism for regulating muscle growth speed is not clear. In this experiment, we used Jinghai yellow chickens with different body weights at 300 days as research subjects. The chickens were divided into fast- and slow-growing groups, and we collected leg muscles after slaughtering for use in RNA-seq. After comparing the two groups, 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (fold change ≥ 2 and FDR < 0.05). The fast-growing group had 42 up-regulated genes and 45 down-regulated genes among these DEGs compared to the slow-growing group. Six items were significantly enriched in the biological process: embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching, chordate embryonic development, embryonic skeletal system development, and embryo development as well as responses to ketones and the sulfur compound biosynthetic process. Two significantly enriched pathways were found in the KEGG pathway analysis (P-value < 0.05): the insulin signaling pathway and the adipocytokine signaling pathway.

In this study we confronted non-specialized, yet innovative tool making birds, Goffin’s cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana), with an apparatus featuring an out-of-reach food reward that could be placed at different distances from a tool opening. Alternatively, the food stayed at a constant distance but the tool opening in the front of the apparatus had different diameters. We used a novel material for tool manufacture (cardboard) that demanded an incrementally increased manufacturing effort from the actor, depending on the length of the tool required. We found that our subjects used two strategies to succeed in this tasks: either by making carboard-stripe tools using the full length of the material sheets originally offered or by adjusting the lengths of their tools to different goal distances. Subjects also discarded cardboard stripes that were too short to reach the goal prior to use and discarded longer pieces when the goal was further away than when it was close. Nevertheless, likely due to morphological constraints, the birds failed to adjust the widths of their tools depending on the diameter of the tool opening."
https://openalex.org/W2900100142,"In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the expression of development-related genes, including germ cell-related genes, is globally repressed. The transcription factor MAX represses germ cell-related gene expression in ESCs via PCGF6-polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which consists of several epigenetic factors. However, we predicted that MAX represses germ cell-related gene expression through several additional mechanisms because PCGF6-PRC1 regulates the expression of only a subset of genes repressed by MAX. Here, we report that MAX associated with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 cooperatively control germ cell-related gene expression in ESCs. Both DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation of the promoter regions of several germ cell-related genes were not affected by knockout of the PRC1 components, indicating that the MAX-DNMT and MAX-SETDB1 pathways are independent of the PCGF6-PRC1 pathway. Our findings provide insights into our understanding of MAX-based repressive mechanisms of germ cell-related genes in ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2900030406,"River ecosystems in semi-arid environments provide an array of resources that concentrate biodiversity, but also attract human settlement and support economic development. In the southwestern United States, land-use change, drought, and anthropogenic disturbance are compounding factors which have led to departures from historical conditions of river ecosystems, consequently affecting wildlife habitat, including important wintering areas for migratory birds. The Rio Grande (River) in central New Mexico is the lifeblood of the Middle Rio Grande Valley (MRGV), maintaining large urban and agricultural centers and riparian and wetland resources, which disproportionately support a diversity of wildlife. The MRGV has been identified as the most important wintering area for the Rocky Mountain Population of greater sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis tabida). Presently, however, changes in the hydrogeomorphology of the Rio Grande and landscape modification by humans have reshaped the MRGV and winter habitat for sandhill cranes. To evaluate these impacts, we investigated how land-use practices, anthropogenic disturbance, and river morphology influenced patterns of diurnal and roosting habitat selection by sandhill cranes. During the diurnal period, sandhill cranes relied heavily on managed public lands selecting agriculture crops, such as corn fields, and wetlands for foraging and loafing while avoiding areas with increasing densities of human structures. Sandhill cranes selected areas for roosting in the Rio Grande characterized by shallower water interspersed with sandbars, wide channel width, low bank vegetation, and farther away from disturbances associated with bridges. Our results establish and identify the central processes driving patterns of diel habitat selection by wintering sandhill cranes. Land use and riverine trends have likely gradually reduced winter habitat to managed public lands and limited reaches of the Rio Grande, underscoring the importance of natural resources agencies in supporting migratory birds and challenges involved when managing for wildlife in highly pressured semi-arid environments."
https://openalex.org/W2900215683,"Clonogenic assays are powerful tools for testing cell reproductive death after biological damage caused by, for example, ionizing radiation. Traditionally, the methods require a cumbersome, slow and eye-straining manual counting of viable colonies under a microscope. To speed up the counting process and minimize those issues related to the subjective decisions of the scoring personnel, we developed a semi-automated, image-based cell colony counting setup, named CoCoNut (Colony Counter developed by the Nutech department at the Technical University of Denmark). It consists in an ImageJ macro and a photographic 3D-printed light-box, conceived and demonstrated to work together for Crystal Violet-stained colonies. Careful attention was given to the image acquisition process, which allows background removal (i.e. any unwanted element in the picture) in a minimally invasive manner. This is mainly achieved by optimal lighting conditions in the light-box and dividing the image of a flask that contains viable colonies by the picture of an empty flask. In this way, CoCoNut avoids using aggressive background removal filters that usually lead to suboptimal colony count recovery. The full method was tested with V79 and HeLa cell survival samples. Results were compared to other freely available tools. CoCoNut proved able to successfully distinguish between single and merged colonies and to identify colonies bordering on flask edges. CoCoNut software calibration is fast; it requires the adjustment of a single parameter that is the smallest colony area to be counted. The employment of a single parameter reduces the risk of subjectivity, providing a robust and user-friendly tool, whose results can be easily compared over time and among different bio-laboratories. The method is inexpensive and easy to obtain. Among its advantages, we highlight the possibility of combining the macro with a perfectly reproducible 3D-printed light-box. The CoCoNut software and the 3D-printer files are provided as supporting information (S1 CoCoNut Files)."
https://openalex.org/W2900169069,"Bees receive nectar and pollen as reward for pollinating plants. Pollen of different plant species varies widely in nutritional composition. In order to select pollen of appropriate nutritional quality, bees would benefit if they could distinguish different pollen types. Whether they rely on visual, olfactory and/or chemotactile cues to distinguish between different pollen types, has however been little studied. In this study, we examined whether and how Apis mellifera workers differentiate between almond and apple pollen. We used differential proboscis extension response conditioning with olfactory and chemotactile stimulation, in light and darkness, and in summer and winter bees. We found that honeybees were only able to differentiate between different pollen types, when they could use both chemotactile and olfactory cues. Visual cues further improved learning performance. Summer bees learned faster than winter bees. Our results thus highlight the importance of multisensory information for pollen discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2900350616,"Howiesons Poort (HP) sites, over the past decades, have provided exceptional access to anthropogenic remains that are enhancing our understanding of early modern human behaviour during the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa. Here, we analyse the technological and typological trends in the lithic record that form part of these behaviours, based on the HP sequence recently excavated at Klipdrift Shelter, located on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This study contributes to enhance knowledge on the mechanisms of changes that occurred during the transition to the post-HP. Despite patterns of continuity observed, notably for core reduction methods, the seven successive lithic assemblages show significant changes in the typological characteristics and raw material selection but also in the relative importance of blade production over time. However, these changes are not necessarily synchronic and occur either as gradual processes or as abrupt technological shifts. Consequently, we cross-examine the association between the lithic phasing and other anthropogenic remains within the HP sequence at Klipdrift Shelter. We explore the implications of these patterns of changes in terms of cultural behaviours and population dynamics during the HP and we highlight the relationship between the different phases of the HP sequence at Klipdrift Shelter and those from other South African HP sites."
https://openalex.org/W2899546195,"Generic medicine prescribing has become common practice in many countries. However, data regarding the perceptions of stakeholders (patients, prescribers and dispensers) regarding generic medicines in Ethiopia is scarce. The present survey aimed to investigate the perception of patients, physicians and pharmacy professionals regarding generic medicines in Ethiopia.A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia between January 1 and February 1, 2017. The questionnaire, comprised of 5-point Likert scale items on perception and concerns regarding generic medicine, was administered to patients, physicians and pharmacy professionals working in the community drug retail outlets. Frequencies, percentages, and median were calculated using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 21.0 for Windows to describe different variables.The survey was completed by 612 participants. More than half of patients, 56% (n = 219) knew about the term brand and generic medicines and 38.7% (n = 151) of patients agreed/strongly agreed that brand medicines are more effective. Nearly half, 47% (n = 184) of patients agreed that they should have the option of choosing between generic and brand medicines and 61.4% (n = 240) of patients believed that cost should be considered before a medicineis prescribed. The majority of physicians 70.6% (n = 101) indicated a very low generic medicine prescription rate. 56% (n = 130) of physicians and 87.2% (n = 68) of pharmacy professionals agreed that they need a standard guideline to both prescribers and pharmacists on brand substitution process. Furthermore, 39.9% (n = 57) of the physicians and 87.2% (n = 68) of pharmacy professionals agreed that drug advertisements by the manufacturers would influence their prescribing/dispensing practice.Overall, our findings demonstrate a knowledge gap among patients towards the perception of generics, perceiving generics are less effective and inferior in quality compared to their branded equivalents. The majority of physicians reported a very low generic medicine prescribing rate and the majority pharmacy professionals' dispensing practice was influenced by drug advertisements. Hence, a customized educational program should be developed and implemented to patients, prescribers and dispensers so as to boost the acceptability of generic medicines and increase generic prescribing and/or substitution."
https://openalex.org/W2899756380,"Multifurca is a small genus newly established to accommodate lactarioid and russuloid species with some characters reminiscent of corticoid members of Russulaceae. It shows an amphi-pacific distribution with strong preference for the tropical zone of the Northern Hemisphere and thus has particular significance for biogeographical study. Using worldwide samples and three loci (ITS, 28S rDNA and rpb2), we demonstrated that Multifurca is split into two highly supported major clades that are here recognized at the subgeneric level: subg. Furcata subg. nov. exclusively includes lactarioid species, while subg. Multifurca includes species with a russuloid habit. Using phylogenetic species recognition and comparison of genetic distances we recognize five new and six previously described species, almost double the known number of species before this study. Molecular dating using a Bayesian method suggested that Multifurca originated in early Paleocene and diversified in the Eocene. The most recent interspecific divergences occurred both in Asia and America, roughly at the same time around the Pliocene. Ancestral area reconstruction and comparisons of genetic distances and morphology suggested an early divergence within Australasia or tropical Asia. From the early Miocene to Pliocene, multiple dispersals/migrations to Australasia and North America by island hopping or land bridge likely happened. Vicariance at the late Tertiary might be the most likely mechanism accounting for the eastern Asia—southeastern North America and Australasia—tropical Asia disjunct distributions. The shared polymorphisms in the ITS alignment, numerous degenerated base pairs in the rpb2 sequences and weak conflict between the ITS and LSU genealogies of M. subg. Furcata suggest recent speciation. Host specificity of Multifurca species or species pairs is relatively low. Host shifts are believed to have aided establishment in new territories during the dispersals and migrations."
https://openalex.org/W2900076976,"Research on the music-language interface has extensively investigated similarities and differences of poetic and musical meter, but largely disregarded melody. Using a measure of melodic structure in music--autocorrelations of sound sequences consisting of discrete pitch and duration values--, we show that individual poems feature distinct and text-driven pitch and duration contours, just like songs and other pieces of music. We conceptualize these recurrent melodic contours as an additional, hitherto unnoticed dimension of parallelistic patterning. Poetic speech melodies are higher order units beyond the level of individual syntactic phrases, and also beyond the levels of individual sentences and verse lines. Importantly, auto-correlation scores for pitch and duration recurrences across stanzas are predictive of how melodious naive listeners perceive the respective poems to be, and how likely these poems were to be set to music by professional composers. Experimentally removing classical parallelistic features characteristic of prototypical poems (rhyme, meter, and others) led to decreased autocorrelation scores of pitches, independent of spoken renditions, along with reduced ratings for perceived melodiousness. This suggests that the higher order parallelistic feature of poetic melody strongly interacts with the other parallelistic patterns of poems. Our discovery of a genuine poetic speech melody has great potential for deepening the understanding of the music-language interface."
https://openalex.org/W2900416989,"Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a highly detrimental invasive species that occupy a rapidly expanding range within the United States. In Australia, field trials evaluating baits containing 0.09% warfarin resulted in wild pig population reduction >95%. The objective of this study was to conduct an EPA-approved field trial to evaluate the use of bait containing low-dose warfarin (0.01% and 0.005%) in reducing wild pig numbers in Texas. An 8-week field test was conducted in the panhandle ~100 km southeast of Amarillo. Two ~8 km2 treatment plots were selected and each presented with either 0.01% or 0.005% warfarin baits. One control plot (~8 km2) was presented placebo. The baits were delivered using 30 species-specific feeders per plot (n = 90) that kept wildlife from accessing the toxicant. Pig movements and feed consumption were monitored during pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment periods. All pigs with VHF transmitters within the 0.005% warfarin-treated plot (n = 14) succumbed to the warfarin (100% mortality). Overall, 35 wild pigs were found dead from warfarin toxicosis, within both treatment plots. Total feed consumption by wild pigs was reduced by ~97.8% and ~96.2% for the 0.005% and 0.01% warfarin baited plots, respectively, indicating the absence of pigs was a result of toxic bait consumption. Results of 97 systematic searches of the treatment plots indicated no warfarin-induced non-target wildlife fatalities. Warfarin residues in wild pig livers averaged 3.69 mg/kg (n = 13) and 2.89 mg/kg (n = 9) for pigs recovered within the 0.005% plot and 0.01% warfarin plot, respectively. This study is the first efficacy field evaluation of a wild pig toxicant conducted in the US. The results suggest low-dose warfarin bait, presented in species-specific feeders, can effectively reduce wild pig numbers and pose minimal risk to non-target wildlife and domestic animals. A product containing warfarin may provide another management tool in reducing wild pig problems."
https://openalex.org/W2899987832,"Ooencyrtus spp. (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Encyrtidae) are important natural enemies of agricultural and forest insect pests, and are distributed worldwide. Their reduced dimensions, highly variable morphological characters and possible effect of wide host range and abiotic factors, make correct identification at the species level particularly difficult. This paper combined molecular, morphological, and biological data to characterize a group of Ooencyrtus spp. emerging from the eggs of the variegated caper bug, Stenozygum coloratum in the east Mediterranean area. COI and ITS2 sequencing revealed the presence of six and five divergent clades, respectively. Three clades were identified as Ooencyrtus telenomicida, Ooencyrtus pityocampae and O. pistaciae. Two clades represent new species which are here described and named Ooencyrtus zoeae and Ooencyrtus mevalbelus. These features were combined with reliable morphological characters to facilitate the separation of these species. A dichotomous key and a new synonymy are proposed. Ooencyrtus pistaciae had two distinct COI clades but only one ITS2 clade. Crossbreeding trials that included Ooencyrtus telenomicida, Ooencyrtus melvabelus sp. nov. and Ooencyrtus zoeae sp. nov. confirmed their reproductive isolation. COI sequences showed 0-0.8% and 4-9% within and between-species genetic differences, respectively. ITS2 showed 0.4-5.9% genetic differences between species, with no genetic differences within species. Haplotype diversity of Israeli and Turkish populations of the various species was 0-0.98 and was particularly low in Ooencyrtus pityocampae, whose Israeli population showed no diversity. The discovery of the Ooencyrtus spp. on the eggs of the caper bug, and their abundance support the idea that the bug can be used as an alternative host for augmentation of populations of these parasitoids in agricultural and forestry systems."
https://openalex.org/W2899595761,"Autosomal-dominant, early-onset DYT1 dystonia is associated with an in-frame deletion of a glutamic acid codon (ΔE) in the TOR1A gene. The gene product, torsinA, is an evolutionarily conserved AAA+ ATPase. The fact that constitutive secretion from patient fibroblasts is suppressed indicates that the ΔE-torsinA protein influences the cellular secretory machinery. However, which component is affected remains unclear. Prompted by recent reports that abnormal protein trafficking through the Golgi apparatus, the major protein-sorting center of the secretory pathway, is sometimes associated with a morphological change in the Golgi, we evaluated the influence of ΔE-torsinA on this organelle. Specifically, we examined its structure by confocal microscopy, in cultures of striatal, cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons obtained from wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous ΔE-torsinA knock-in mice. In live neurons, the Golgi was assessed following uptake of a fluorescent ceramide analog, and in fixed neurons it was analyzed by immuno-fluorescence staining for the Golgi-marker GM130. Neither staining method indicated genotype-specific differences in the size, staining intensity, shape or localization of the Golgi. Moreover, no genotype-specific difference was observed as the neurons matured in vitro. These results were supported by a lack of genotype-specific differences in GM130 expression levels, as assessed by Western blotting. The Golgi was also disrupted by treatment with brefeldin A, but no genotype-specific differences were found in the immuno-fluorescence staining intensity of GM130. Overall, our results demonstrate that the ΔE-torsinA protein does not drastically influence Golgi morphology in neurons, irrespective of genotype, brain region (among those tested), or maturation stage in culture. While it remains possible that functional changes in the Golgi exist, our findings imply that any such changes are not severe enough to influence its morphology to a degree detectable by light microscopy."

All the lead isotope ratios conform to the characteristics of common lead and most of them are similar to Nanyang local lead ores. The lead of another two bronzes, NY9 and NY13, should be imported from southern China. Combined with the historical background of early Western Han Dynasty, the wider range of the lead ore circulation may be an indicator for, as the loose policy, economic prosperity and transportation improvement."

To unravel the binding between derivatives of Withania somnifera and HSA, fluorescence spectroscopy was used. Binding studies were further studied by molecular docking and dynamics and results confirmed greater stability upon binding of derivatives with HSA. Circular dichroism data illustrated change in the secondary structure of protein upon interaction with these derivatives, particularly the helical structure was increased and β-sheets and random coils were decreased. Furthermore, morphological and topological changes were observed using AFM and TEM upon binding of ligands with HSA indicating that HSA-withnoside/withanolide complexes were formed. All the results cumulatively demonstrate strong binding of withanosides and withanolides derivatives with serum albumin, which should further be explored to study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these derivatives."

Presence of PAGs in dam's circulation has been widely used in pregnancy diagnosis. The present study reports the identification and characterization of different PAG isoforms in buffalo during early stages of pregnancy. The PAG mRNAs isolated from fetal cotyledons (Pregnancy stages: 45, 75 and 90 days) were successfully cloned in pJET1.2 vector and transformed in E. coli. A total of 360 random clones were sequenced and correlated with their stages of expression. A total of 12 isoforms namely, BuPAG 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 18 and one new isoform were identified. BuPAG 7 was found as the most abundant isoform in all three stages followed by BuPAG 18. Further, a large number of variants were found for most of these isoforms. Phylogenetic relationship of identified BuPAGs showed that BuPAG 2 belonged to an ancient group while other members clustered with modern group. Three-dimensional (3D) structure of BuPAG 7 was determined by homology modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations which displayed a typical fold represented by other aspartic proteinase (AP) family members. Molecular docking of Pepstatin inhibitor with BuPAG 7 revealed to interact through various hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Various amino acid substitutions were observed in peptide-binding cleft of BuPAG 7. Superimposition of BuPAG 7 with homologous structures revealed the presence of a 35–41 amino acid long insertion (alpha helix connected by two loops) near the N- terminus which seems to be a unique feature of BuPAG 7 in AP family. This is the first report on identification and sequence characterization of PAG isoforms in buffalo with unique finding that these isoforms represent many transcript variants. We also report 3D structure of the most abundant isoform BuPAG 7 for the first time."

There is limited evidence to suggest MHT use is associated with the specific subtype characterised as ER+/PR+/HER2- (Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor positive and Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor2 negative) status. This study aims to investigate the MHT-breast cancer relationship for breast cancer tumor receptor subtypes defined by ER expression alone, by ER and PR expression only and by joint expression of ER, PR, and HER2. Analyses compared 399 cancer registry-verified breast cancer cases with receptor status information and 324 cancer-free controls. We used multinomial logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for current and past versus never MHT use, for subgroups defined by tumor receptor expression. Current, but not past, use of MHT was associated with an elevated risk of ER+ breast cancer (aOR = 2.04, 95%CI: 1.28–3.24) and ER+/PR+ breast cancer (aOR = 2.29, 1.41–3.72). Current MHT use was also associated with an elevated risk of the ER+/PR+/HER2- subtype (aOR = 2.30, 1.42–3.73). None of the other subtypes based on ER, ER/PR or ER/PR/HER2 expression were significantly associated with current MHT use in this analysis. Current, but not past, use of MHT increases the risk of breast cancer, with consistently higher risks reported for ER+ and ER+/PR+ subtypes and mounting evidence regarding the specific ER+/PR+/HER2- subtype. Our findings contribute to quantification of the effects of MHT, and support efforts to articulate the receptor-mediated mechanisms by which MHT increases the risk of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2899961219,"The global production of cereal straw as an agricultural by-product presents a significant source of biomass, which could be used as feedstock for the production of second generation biofuels by fermentation. The production of sugars for fermentation is an important measure of straw quality and in its suitability for biofuel production. In this paper, we present a characterization of straw digestibility from a wide range of cereal. Our main objective is to evaluate the variability of fermentable sugars released from different species including wheat (Triticum durum L., Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack). To this end, we adapted a saccharification method (IAS Method) capable of detecting significant differences of released sugars between cultivars and species, while using separately another method that would serve as a control and with which we could contrast our results (CNAP method). ANOVA analyses revealed that barley has a higher saccharification potential than wheat and triticale and shows more variation between genotypes. Thus, populations derived from crosses among them such as Steptoe × Morex and OWB Dominant × OWB Recessive hold potential for the identification of genetic basis for saccharification-related traits. The correlation of glucose released between the two methods was moderate (R2 = 0.57). An evaluation of the inter- and intra- specific correlation between a number of chemical and agronomical parameters and saccharification suggests that the cell wall thickness and lignin content in straw could be used in breeding programs for the improvement of the saccharification potential. Finally, the lack of correlation between grain yield and saccharification suggests that it would be possible to make a selection of genotypes for dual purpose, low recalcitrance and grain yield."
https://openalex.org/W2900261345,"It is generally difficult to predict fractures of low-permeability reservoirs under high confining pressures by data statistical method and simplified strain energy density method. In order to establish a series of geomechanical models for the prediction of multi-scale fractures in brittle tight sandstones, firstly, through a series of rock mechanics experiments and CT scanning, we determined 0.85 σc as the key thresholds for mass release of elastic strain energy and bursting of micro-fractures. A correlation between fracture volume density and strain energy density under uniaxial stress state was developed based on the Theory of Geomechanics. Then using the combined Mohr-Coulomb criterion and Griffith's criterion and considering the effect of filling degree in fractures, we continued to modify and deduce the mechanical models of fracture parameters under complex stress states. Finally, all the geomechanical equations were loaded into the finite element (FE) platform to quantitatively simulate the present-day 3-D distributions of fracture density, aperture, porosity, permeability and occurrence based on paleostructure restoration of the Keshen anticline. Its predictions agreed well with in-situ core observations and formation micro-imaging (FMI) interpretations. The prediction results of permeability were basically consistent with the unobstructed flow distributions before and after the reservoir reformation."
https://openalex.org/W2900397631,"NetF-producing type A Clostridium perfringens is an important cause of canine and foal necrotizing enteritis. NetF, related to the β-sheet pore-forming Leukocidin/Hemolysin superfamily, is considered a major virulence factor for this disease. The main purpose of this work is to demonstrate the pore-forming activity of NetF and characterize the chemical nature of its binding site. Electron microscopy using recombinant NetF (rNetF) confirmed that NetF is able to oligomerize and form large pores in equine ovarian (EO) cell membranes and sheep red blood cells. These oligomeric pores appear to be about 4–6 nm in diameter, and the number of oligomer subunits to vary from 6 to 9. Sodium periodate treatment rendered EO cells non-susceptible to NetF, suggesting that NetF binding requires cell surface carbohydrates. NetF cytotoxicity was also inhibited by a lectin that binds sialic acid, by sialidase, and by free sialic acid in excess, all of which clearly implicate sialic acid-containing membrane carbohydrates in NetF binding and/or toxicity for EO cells. Binding of NetF to sheep red blood cells was not inhibited by the gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3, nor did the latter promote membrane permeabilization in liposomes, suggesting that they do not constitute the cellular receptors. In contrast, treatment of EO cells with different proteases reduced their susceptibility to NetF, suggesting that the NetF receptor is a sialic acid-containing glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2899588951,"Background To investigate relationships among neonatal hypothyroidism, family income, and intellectual disability, as well as the combined effects of neonatal hypothyroidism and low family income on intellectual disability. Methods Data were extracted from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2002 to 2011. This retrospective study included 91,247 infants. The presence of intellectual disability was based on the disability evaluation system in Korea. Newborn hypothyroidism was identified from diagnosis and prescription codes. Family income was determined from average monthly insurance premiums. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios. Results Of the 91,247 infants, 208 were considered to have intellectual disability (29.18 cases per 100,000 person-year). The risk of intellectual disability was higher in infants with hypothyroidism than in those without hypothyroidism (hazard ratio = 5.28, P: < .0001). The risk of intellectual disability was higher in infants with low family income than in those with high family income (hazard ratio = 2.32, P: < .0001). The risk of intellectual disability was higher in infants with hypothyroidism and low family income than in those without hypothyroidism and with high family income (hazard ratio = 36.05, P: < .0001). Conclusions Neonatal hypothyroidism and low family income were associated with the risk of intellectual disability in Korea. Additionally, neonatal hypothyroidism and low family income significantly increased the risk of intellectual disability. Public health policymakers should consider providing additional resources for alleviating neonatal hypothyroidism among low-income families."
https://openalex.org/W2899956406,"Several species of the Gypsophila genus are endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, including gypsophytes of particular ecological, evolutionary and biochemical interest, and taxa that have undergone both sympatric and allopatric genetic differentiation. The niche shift among these taxa has been assessed using ecological niche modelling and ordination techniques, adopting a niche overlap approach to compare the similarity and equivalency of the ecological niches. We used the Maximum Entropy method to study the potential distribution of these taxa in different eras: the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Mid Holocene and the current conditions. We present evidence of niche shift during the speciation of G. bermejoi, with a strong niche overlap between the parental taxa (G. struthium subsp. struthium and G. tomentosa), yet both overlap much more weakly with the hybrid species. This phenomenon may be explained by genetic and epigenetic interactions, and it has been described in other species. We also studied the sister subspecies G. struthium subsp. struthium and G. struthium subsp. hispanica, with mostly allopatric distributions and with the Iberian System mountain range acting as a geographical barrier. The Iberian System and other mountain ranges may have favored differences in the climatic conditions on either side of the mountain range, which is consistent with an incipient process of bioclimatic ecological speciation. These results seem to indicate that niche shift can occur over very different timespans. In the case of G. bermejoi, speciation may have produced significant niche shifting in one or two generations due to its alloploid nature. By contrast, G. struthium subsp. struthium and G. struthium subsp. hispanica seem to have undergone a more gradual process of allopatric genetic differentiation driven by bioclimatic factors. Both these processes are relatively recent and they will have been strongly influenced by the climate change at the end of LGM."

Study 2 investigated another group of participants with similar ages’ comprehension of the SVO construction, the ba-construction, the long and short passive constructions with novel verbs and FCPP. Although these constructions have differing cue strengths, participants in the same age groups comprehended these construction types equally well. The results suggest that children as young as two attended to the case markers of ba and bei, allowing them to employ abstract syntactic representations in comprehending Mandarin transitive constructions. The findings demonstrate that children are sensitive early on to the structural information encoded in the constructions."

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, Mormon), a generally conservative denomination, have historically harbored strong anti-evolution sentiments. We report here a significant shift toward acceptance, compared to attitudes 30 years earlier, by students at Brigham Young University, which is owned and operated by the LDS church. This change appears to have multiple explanations. Students currently entering the university have been exposed to a much-improved introduction to evolution during high school. More importantly, there has been a significant decrease in negative messaging from Church authorities and in its religious education system. There is also evidence that current students have been positively influenced toward evolution by their parents, a large percentage of whom were BYU students, who earlier were given a strong science education deemed compatible with the maintenance of religious belief. A pre-post comparison demonstrates that a majority of current students become knowledgeable and accepting following a course experience focused on evolutionary principles delivered in a faith-friendly atmosphere. Elements of that classroom pedagogy, intended to promote reconciliation, are presented. Our experience may serve as a case-study for prompting changes in acceptance of evolution in other conservative religious groups."

Understanding the full range of sexual behavior among young people, especially oral and anal sexual experience is very crucial to design appropriate intervention strategies. This study was to assess oral and anal sexual experience and associated factors among preparatory school youths in Dire Dawa city, Eastern Ethiopia.School based cross sectional study was conducted among 1067 school youths attending preparatory school. Systematic random sampling method was used to select study participants. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire and entered in to Epi-data version 3.3.1 and exported to SPSS 20 for analysis. Descriptive and bivariate logistic regression was done. Variables in bivariate analysis with P< 0.25 were entered to multiple bivariate logistic regression analysis to determine predictor variables. P < 0.05 was declared as statistically significance and AOR with 95% CI used to assess strength of association.The proportion of youths who reported having oral sex was 9% (88) and that of anal sex was 6.7% (66). Having multiple sexual partners was reported by 65.8% and 56.5% of youths who ever engaged in oral and anal sex respectively. From those who ever engaged to oral sex and anal sex 15.9% and 34.8% consistently used condom respectively. Oral sex practice was significantly associated with intimate partner ever engaged to oral sex practice (AOR = 4.53, 95% CI: 2.26-9.05), ever engaged to vaginal sex (AOR = 16.38, 95% CI: 7.22-37.19), older age (20-24years) (AOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.24-4.86), ever drinking alcohol (AOR = 2.11,95% CI:1.02-4.34), and ever smoke shisha (AOR = 2.85,95% CI:1.4-5.83). Similarly anal sex experience was significantly associated with intimate partner ever engaged to anal sex (AOR = 5.34, 95% CI: 4.2-26.98), ever engaged to vaginal sex (AOR = 10.64, 95% CI: 2.39-11.9), ever watching pornographic movies (AOR = 3.86, 95% CI: 1.45-10.29) and parental monitoring of youth's sexual behavior (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.12-6.19).Significant proportion of youths had engaged in oral and anal sexual practice and multiple sexual partners were common among youths for oral and anal sex. In the contrary consistent condom use was very poor. A combination of sexual health education intervention strategies should be implemented at family, school and community level."

Access to the subjectivity of mastectomized patients becomes relevant to elucidate failures in early detection of breast cancer and thus improve the cancer care network. Given that, the present study aimed to identify mastectomized women's perception of the quality of care provided by the cancer care network for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.Qualitative study carried out at a public outpatient cancer center in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Northeastern Brazil, to analyze the perceptions of 26 women who had undergone mastectomy after breast cancer based on Symbolic Interactionism.The thematic analysis showed how women (re)structure their lives in the face of the structural and social aspects of coping with breast. Two essential themes emerged: ""Contradictions regarding access to primary health care services and obstacles to the organization of SUS formal care network services"" and ""The informal and private health care network increase quality care coverage"".The absence of effective measures in Primary Health Care and patients' 'pilgrimage' in the formal health care network have delayed early detection breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2900046354,"Pupil diameter measurement is crucial for physical assessment and disease monitoring in a health and nursing care situation. A general penlights (GPLs) is frequently used and allow for an approximate and indirect measurement of the pupil diameter. Health caregivers or nurses generally have less confidence in the value of the pupil diameter measured using the GPL. The Advanced Penlight (APL) is a new device designed for accurate measurement of the pupil diameter. The purpose of the presented research was to compare the accuracies and operational times of the pupil diameter measurements by means of the GPL and APL. One-group post-test and single-blind study designed was used in this study. The innovation of the APL is the addition of a perspective measurement ruler (PMR) attached to one side of the penlight that allows precise measurement of the pupil diameter before and after pupillary contraction. The PMR can be rotated by any angle for adaptation to the measurement conditions. After standard pupil diameter measurements by a refractometer (RM) were performed on a subjects, ninety study participants measured the pupil diameters of the same subject separately by the GPL and APL. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the opinions of the participants after using the GPL compare to the APL. The mean age of the participants was 20.01 (SD = 0.47) years and 83% of them were female senior nursing students. There were no statistically significant differences between the average values of pupil diameters measured by the APL and the RM. Compared to the GPL, the pupil diameter measured by APL was much similar to the RM measurement. The average operational time was 8.72 seconds shorter (t = -3.81, p = 0.001) for the APL measurement compared to the GPL measurement. The average scores of convenience and confidence on pupil diameter measurements of questionnaire were higher for the APL compared to the GPL. The APL can increase the accuracy and save operating time of pupil diameter measurement and thereby promote the quality of health assessment and nursing care practice."
https://openalex.org/W2900338839,"The cross-section of a cell in a monolayer epithelial tissue can be modeled mathematically as a k-sided polygon. Empirically studied distributions of the proportions of k-sided cells in epithelia show remarkable similarities in a wide range of evolutionarily distant organisms. A variety of mathematical models have been proposed for explaining this phenomenon. The highly parsimonious simulation model of (Patel et al., PLoS Comput. Biol., 2009) that takes into account only the number of sides of a given cell and cell division already achieves a remarkably good fit with empirical distributions from Drosophila, Hydra, Xenopus, Cucumber, and Anagallis. Within the same modeling framework as in that paper, we introduce additional options for the choice of the endpoints of the cleavage plane that appear to be biologically more realistic. By taking the same data sets as our benchmarks, we found that combinations of some of our new options consistently gave better fits with each of these data sets than previously studied ones. Both our algorithm and simulation data are made available as research tools for future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2900389647,"Background Panic disorder is associated with high productivity costs. These costs, which should be included in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) from a societal perspective, have a considerable impact on cost-effectiveness estimates. However, they are often omitted in published CEAs. It is therefore uncertain whether choosing a societal perspective changes priority setting in future research as compared to a healthcare perspective. Objectives To identify research priorities regarding the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention for subthreshold panic disorder using value of information (VOI) analysis and to investigate to what extent priority setting depends on the perspective. Methods We calculated the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention for panic disorder from a healthcare perspective and a societal perspective. We performed a VOI analysis, which estimates the expected value of eliminating the uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates, for both perspectives. Results From a healthcare perspective the early intervention was more effective at higher costs compared to usual care (€17,144 per QALY), whereas it was cost-saving from a societal perspective. Additional research to eliminate parameter uncertainty was valued at €129.7 million from a healthcare perspective and €29.5 million from a societal perspective. Additional research on the early intervention utility gain was most valuable from a healthcare perspective, whereas from a societal perspective additional research would generate little added value. Conclusions Priority setting for future research differed substantially according to the perspective. Our study underlines that the health-economic perspective of CEAs on interventions for panic disorder must be chosen carefully in order to avoid inappropriate choices in research priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2900419197,"To evaluate the relationship between leisure-time activities at 11 years old and the incidence of school failures from 11 to 15 years in adolescents.The sample comprised 4,090 adolescents from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort, Brazil. The outcome was measured as the number of school failures from 11 to 15 years, based on reported information from cohort participants and their parents. The exposures were collected at 11 years old, as follows: reading; meeting friends; talking to parents; and dating.In the group from 11 to 15 years old, 53.3% failed at school at least once. Meeting friends 4-7 times/week (RR = 1.15) and dating 1-3 times/week (RR = 1.22) were associated with high risk for school failure. Reading showed an inverse relationship with school failures (1-3 times/week RR = 0.83; 4-7 times/week RR = 0.71). Reading at least once a week could prevent around 16% of school failures.The context in which adolescents are inserted plays a relevant role in school performance. Understanding these factors may help to propose actions to reduce school failure rates even further."
