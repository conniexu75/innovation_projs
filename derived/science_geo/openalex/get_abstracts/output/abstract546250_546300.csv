https://openalex.org/W2229124923,"A concentrated effort for battery safety Aqueous electrolytes are limited to run below 1.23 V to avoid degradation. Suo et al. smash through this limit with an aqueous salt solution containing lithium (Li) bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide to create an electrolyte that has an electrochemical window of 3 V (see the Perspective by Smith and Dunn). They used extremely high-concentration solutions, which suppressed hydrogen evolution and electrode oxidation. At these concentrations, the Li solvation shell changes because there simply is not enough water to neutralize the Li + charge. Thus, flammable organic electrolytes could potentially be replaced with a safer aqueous alternative. Science , this issue p. 938 ; see also p. 918"

Previous GEVIs had insufficient signaling speed and dynamic range to resolve action potentials in live animals. We coupled fast voltage-sensing domains from a rhodopsin protein to bright fluorophores through resonance energy transfer. The resulting GEVIs are sufficiently bright and fast to report neuronal action potentials and membrane voltage dynamics in awake mice and flies, resolving fast spike trains with 0.2-millisecond timing precision at spike detection error rates orders of magnitude better than previous GEVIs. In vivo imaging revealed sensory-evoked responses, including somatic spiking, dendritic dynamics, and intracellular voltage propagation. These results empower in vivo optical studies of neuronal electrophysiology and coding and motivate further advancements in high-speed microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2231368253,"From sensing leucine to metabolic control The mTORC1 protein kinase complex plays central roles in regulating cell growth and metabolism and is implicated in common human diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The level of the amino acid leucine tells an organism a lot about its physiological state, including how much food is available, how much insulin is going to be needed, and whether new muscle mass can be made (see the Perspective by Buel and Blenis). Wolfson et al. identified a biochemical sensor of leucine, Sestrin2, which connects the concentration of leucine to the control of organismal metabolism and growth. When leucine bound to Sestrin2, it was released from a complex with the mTORC1 regulatory factor GATOR2, activating the mTORC1 complex. Saxton et al. describe the crystal structure of Sestrin2 and show how it specifically detects leucine. Aylett et al. determined the structure of human mTORC1 by cryoelectron microscopy and the crystal structure of a regulatory subunit, Raptor. The results reveal the structural basis for the function and intricate regulation of this important enzyme, which is also a strategic drug target.

In species with PRDM9 , hotspots move rapidly within the genome, varying among populations and closely related species (see the Perspective by Lichten). To investigate recombination hotspots in species lacking PRDM9 , Singhal et al. examined bird genomes, which lack a PRDM9 gene. They looked closely at the genomes of finch species and found that recombination was localized to the promoter regions of genes and highly conserved over millions of years. Similarly, Lam and Keeney examined recombination localization within yeast, which also lacks PRDM9 . They found a similar more-or-less fixed pattern of hotspots. Thus, recombination in species lacking a PRDM9 gene shows similar patterns of hotspot localization and evolution. Science , this issue p. 913 , p. 928 ; see also p. 932"
https://openalex.org/W2190199438,"Animals require the ability to ignore sensory stimuli that have no consequence yet respond to the same stimuli when they become useful. However, the brain circuits that govern this flexibility in sensory processing are not well understood. Here we show in mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) that daily passive sound exposure causes a long-lasting reduction in representations of the experienced sound by layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. This habituation arises locally in A1 and involves an enhancement in inhibition and selective upregulation in the activity of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOM cells). Furthermore, when mice engage in sound-guided behavior, pyramidal cell excitatory responses to habituated sounds are enhanced, whereas SOM cell responses are diminished. Together, our results demonstrate the bidirectional modulation of A1 sensory representations and suggest that SOM cells gate cortical information flow based on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2314712188,"Notch role in multipotency or cell fate Multipotent Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) generate either nutrient-absorbing enterocytes (ECs) or secretory enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Guo and Ohlstein investigated the role of Notch signaling in this process. They tracked ISC asymmetric divisions and found that EEC daughter cells, which have a low level of Notch, signal back to the ISC in order to keep it multipotent. However, during EC production, ISCs activate strong Notch signaling in daughters. Thus, Notch signaling functions in two directions to achieve stem cell multipotency.

https://openalex.org/W2181277840,"Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic bladder disease with urinary frequency, bladder discomfort or bladder pain of unknown etiology. Based on cystoscopic findings, patients with IC are classified as either Hunner-type/classic IC (HIC), presenting with a specific Hunner lesion, or non-Hunner-type IC (NHIC), presenting with no Hunner lesion, but post-hydrodistension mucosal bleeding. Inflammatory cell infiltration, composed predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells and epithelial denudation, has in the past been documented as a major pathological IC finding. However, the significance of the pathological evaluation of IC, especially with regard to the difference between HIC and NHIC, has been downplayed in recent years. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical quantification of infiltrating T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and plasma cells, and measured the amount of residual epithelium in urinary bladder biopsy specimens taken from patients with HIC and NHIC, and those with no IC, using image analysis software. In addition, in situ hybridization of the light chains was performed to examine clonal B-cell expansion. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was significantly more severe in HIC specimens than in NHIC specimens (P <0.0001). Substantial lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (≥200 cells/mm2) was observed in 93% of HIC specimens, whereas only 8% of NHIC specimens were inflamed. Plasmacytic infiltration was more prominent in HIC specimens compared with NHIC and non-IC cystitis specimens (P <0.005). Furthermore, expansion of light-chain-restricted B-cells was observed in 31% of cases of HIC. The amount of residual epithelium was decreased in HIC specimens compared with NHIC specimens and non-IC cystitis specimens (P <0.0001). These results suggest that NHIC and HIC are distinct pathological entities, with the latter characterized by pancystitis, frequent clonal B-cell expansion and epithelial denudation. An abnormality in the B-cell population may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIC."
https://openalex.org/W2209787832,"Stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) increases life span and health span in nematodes through an unknown mechanism. We report that neuronal stabilization of HIF-1 mediates these effects in Caenorhabditis elegans through a cell nonautonomous signal to the intestine, which results in activation of the xenobiotic detoxification enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (FMO-2). This prolongevity signal requires the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH-1 in neurons and the serotonin receptor SER-7 in the intestine. Intestinal FMO-2 is also activated by dietary restriction (DR) and is necessary for DR-mediated life-span extension, which suggests that this enzyme represents a point of convergence for two distinct longevity pathways. FMOs are conserved in eukaryotes and induced by multiple life span–extending interventions in mice, which suggests that these enzymes may play a critical role in promoting health and longevity across phyla."

https://openalex.org/W2175307482,"Cells must interpret environmental information that often changes over time. In our experiment, we systematically monitored the growth of yeast cells under various frequencies of oscillating osmotic stress. Growth was severely inhibited at a particular resonance frequency, at which cells show hyperactivated transcriptional stress responses. This behavior represents a sensory misperception: The cells incorrectly interpret oscillations as a staircase of ever-increasing osmolarity. The misperception results from the capacity of the osmolarity-sensing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) network to retrigger with sequential osmotic stresses. Although this feature is critical for coping with natural challenges, such as continually increasing osmolarity, it results in a trade-off of fragility to non-natural oscillatory inputs that match the retriggering time. These findings demonstrate the value of non-natural dynamic perturbations in exposing hidden sensitivities of cellular regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2221967615,"Infection with intestinal helminths results in immunological changes that influence co-infections, and might influence fecundity by inducing immunological states affecting conception and pregnancy. We investigated associations between intestinal helminths and fertility in women, using 9 years of longitudinal data from 986 Bolivian forager-horticulturalists, experiencing natural fertility and 70% helminth prevalence. We found that different species of helminth are associated with contrasting effects on fecundity. Infection with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) is associated with earlier first births and shortened interbirth intervals, whereas infection with hookworm is associated with delayed first pregnancy and extended interbirth intervals. Thus, helminths may have important effects on human fertility that reflect physiological and immunological consequences of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2172897039,"One of the proposed canonical circuit motifs employed by the brain is a feedforward network where parallel signals converge, diverge, and reconverge. Here we investigate a network with this architecture in the Drosophila olfactory system. We focus on a glomerulus whose receptor neurons converge in an all-to-all manner onto six projection neurons that then reconverge onto higher-order neurons. We find that both convergence and reconvergence improve the ability of a decoder to detect a stimulus based on a single neuron's spike train. The first transformation implements averaging, and it improves peak detection accuracy but not speed; the second transformation implements coincidence detection, and it improves speed but not peak accuracy. In each case, the integration time and threshold of the postsynaptic cell are matched to the statistics of convergent spike trains."
https://openalex.org/W2197472068,"Nature provides a multitude of examples of multifunctional structural materials in which trade-offs are imposed by conflicting functional requirements. One such example is the biomineralized armor of the chiton Acanthopleura granulata, which incorporates an integrated sensory system that includes hundreds of eyes with aragonite-based lenses. We use optical experiments to demonstrate that these microscopic lenses are able to form images. Light scattering by the polycrystalline lenses is minimized by the use of relatively large, crystallographically aligned grains. Multiscale mechanical testing reveals that as the size, complexity, and functionality of the integrated sensory elements increase, the local mechanical performance of the armor decreases. However, A. granulata has evolved several strategies to compensate for its mechanical vulnerabilities to form a multipurpose system with co-optimized optical and structural functions."
https://openalex.org/W2241444925,"The timing of flowering in perennial plants is crucial for their survival in temperate climates and is regulated by the duration of bud dormancy. Bud dormancy release and bud break depend on the perception of cumulative chilling during endodormancy and heat during the bud development. The objectives of this work were to identify candidate genes involved in dormancy and flowering processes in sweet cherry, their mapping in two mapping progenies ‘Regina’ × ‘Garnet’ and ‘Regina’ × ‘Lapins’, and to select those candidate genes which co-localized with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with temperature requirements for bud dormancy release and flowering. Based on available data on flowering processes in various species, a list of 79 candidate genes was established. The peach and sweet cherry orthologs were identified and primers were designed to amplify sweet cherry candidate gene fragments. Based on the amplified sequences of the three parents of the mapping progenies, SNPs segregations in the progenies were identified. Thirty five candidate genes were genetically mapped in at least one of the two progenies and all were in silico mapped. Co-localization between candidate genes and QTLs associated with temperature requirements and flowering date were identified for the first time in sweet cherry. The allelic composition of the candidate genes located in the major QTL for heat requirements and flowering date located on linkage group 4 have a significant effect on these two traits indicating their potential use for breeding programs in sweet cherry to select new varieties adapted to putative future climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2290428086,"Despite appearing featureless to our eyes, the open ocean is a highly variable environment for polarization-sensitive viewers. Dynamic visual backgrounds coupled with predator encounters from all possible directions make this habitat one of the most challenging for camouflage. We tested open-ocean crypsis in nature by collecting more than 1500 videopolarimetry measurements from live fish from distinct habitats under a variety of viewing conditions. Open-ocean fish species exhibited camouflage that was superior to that of both nearshore fish and mirrorlike surfaces, with significantly higher crypsis at angles associated with predator detection and pursuit. Histological measurements revealed that specific arrangements of reflective guanine platelets in the fish's skin produce angle-dependent polarization modifications for polarocrypsis in the open ocean, suggesting a mechanism for natural selection to shape reflectance properties in this complex environment."

It is important to understand the mechanism of AGE-mediated signaling leading to the activation of autophagy (self-eating) that might result in obesity. We detected AGE as one of the potent inducers of autophagy compared with doxorubicin and TNF. AGE-mediated autophagy is inhibited by suppression of PI3K and potentiated by the autophagosome maturation blocker bafilomycin. It increases autophagy in different cell types, and that correlates with the expression of its receptor, receptor for AGE. LC3B, the marker for autophagosomes, is shown to increase upon AGE stimulation. AGE-mediated autophagy is partially suppressed by inhibitor of NF-κB, PKC, or ERK alone and significantly in combination. AGE increases sterol regulatory element binding protein activity, which leads to an increase in lipogenesis. Although AGE-mediated lipogenesis is affected by autophagy inhibitors, AGE-mediated autophagy is not influenced by lipogenesis inhibitors, suggesting that the turnover of lipid droplets overcomes the autophagic clearance.

Diabetic patients are often prone to obesity because of the activation of lipogenesis. The inability of peripheral tissues to take up glucose in insulin resistance leads to altered metabolic conditions associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

Although autophagy is a simple process, it plays an important role and has physiological and pathophysiological consequences. TNF, a monokine, has been reported previously to be one of the major immune regulators of macroautophagy in skeletal muscles (13Djavaheri-Mergny M. Amelotti M. Mathieu J. Besançon F. Bauvy C.

On the other hand, doxorubicin, a potent anti-cancer drug, has been shown to increase autophagy flux in cardiomyocytes (14Dimitrakis P. Romay-Ogando M.I. Timolati F. Suter T.M. Zuppinger C.

Half of the autophagy genes (Atg), discovered in yeast, have mammalian counterparts, such as Beclin1 and DNA-damage regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1). These genes are required for the activation of autophagy and are under the control of different transcription factors. Mammalian microtubular light chain protein 3 (LC3B), the counterpart of yeast Atg8, has been shown to be cleaved, modified, and attached to the autophagosome membrane (15Nakatogawa H. Ichimura Y.

LAMP2 encodes three variants, LAMP-2A, LAMP-2B, and LAMP-2C. These are lysosomal membrane proteins implicated in the measurement of autophagy turnover (17Koga H. Kaushik S. Cuervo A.M. Altered lipid content inhibits autophagic vesicular fusion.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). AGE have been shown to increase NF-κB activation upon interaction with their receptor, RAGE, and induce inflammatory responses (18Lappas M. Permezel M. Rice G.E.

Many molecules involved in autophagy are dependent on NF-κB (20Copetti T. Bertoli C. Dalla E. Demarchi F. Schneider C. p65/RelA modulates BECN1 transcription and autophagy.Mol.

There might be a correlation between the activation of the NF-κB and Ras pathways for AGE-mediated autophagy. Diminished metabolic activities often lead to an increase in sugar level and, later on, lipogenesis, especially in aged persons and diabetic patients. High sugar levels increase AGE under these conditions. In this study, we clearly show that the increased amount of AGE leads to lipid accumulation in cells. Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that expresses several genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides synthesis (25Ferré P. Foufelle F. SREBP-1c transcription factor and lipid homeostasis: clinical perspective.Horm. Res. 2007; 68: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 26Kotzka J. Lehr S. Roth G. Avci H.

The statin group of compounds is known to block lipogenesis by inhibiting the HMG-CoA pathway (27Cachefo A. Boucher P. Dusserre E. Bouletreau P. Beylot M. Chambrier C. Stimulation of cholesterol synthesis and hepatic lipogenesis in patients with severe malabsorption.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1349-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because AGE increase lipogenesis via activation of SREBP on one hand and autophagy on the other, there might be a correlation between AGE-mediated autophagy and lipogenesis. Autophagy is beneficial to cells and individuals. However, AGE mediate several deleterious effects, and lipogenesis is one of them. To nullify this effect, autophagy might start immediately upon AGE stimulation. Clearance of these lipids is ideal for autophagy. Surprisingly, we found that AGE-mediated autophagy is unable to clear the lipids. For the first time, we provide data showing that AGE-mediated autophagy is unable to reduce the lipid load in cells that arises because of a high amount of AGE in cells. Obesity has typical adverse effects in these scenarios. This study will help to design therapeutics that will help to reduce obesity by targeting the signaling cascade that helps to reduce lipogenesis in addition to the classical therapeutic medicines like the statin group of compounds or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor analogs, which are used as anti-diabetes drugs and often have obesity as a side effect.

Cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) and stained with MDC for 10 min at 37 °C after their respective treatments. Thereafter, intracellular MDC was measured by fluorescence photometry/fluorimetry (excitation at 380 nm and emission at 525 nm) as described previously (29Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsässer H.P. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) is a specific in vivo marker for autophagic vacuoles.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, treated cells were used for fluorescence microscopy for qualitative analysis of autophagy. Autophagy was measured by determining the increased intensity of fluorescence in MDC-stained autophagosomes. The amount of autophagy is represented as -fold increase per relative fluorescence units. The TRIzol method was used to isolate total RNA from treated cells. 1 μg of total RNA (quantified by absorbance at 260 nm) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by the ONE-Step-Access RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by amplification of the gene of interest using gene-specific primers for Beclin-1, DRAM1, and tubulin. PCR was performed by inactivating avian myeloblastosis virus and RNA primer denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C and by repeating the cycles at 94, 55, and 72 °C. Amplified products were separated on agarose gel by gel electrophoresis (2%) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. To visualize AGE-mediated autophagosome formation/induction, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with vector control GFP and GFP-LC3B constructs using the Lipofectamine reagent kit according to the instructions. After 5 h, cells were incubated in rich DMEM for the next 12 h. Cells were used further to determine the amount of LC3B by fluorescence microscopy or Western blot by analyzing whole-cell extracts. The DNA binding activity of NF-κB and SREBP was determined by EMSA as described before (30Manna S.K. Babajan B. Raghavendra P.B. Raviprakash N. Sureshkumar C. Inhibiting TRAF2-mediated activation of NF-κB facilitates induction of AP-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11617-11627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extract proteins (10 μg) were incubated with 32P end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated from free oligonucleotides on 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized in an image reader using Multi-Gauge software 3.0 (Fuji, Japan). Treated cells were washed gently three times and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by 0.1% Triton-mediated permeabilization at 30 °C for 15 min. This was followed by gentle washing with PBS three times, followed by blocking using 1% BSA at room temperature for 30 min and incubation with primary antibody for 90 min at 4 °C. This procedure was followed by washing three times with PBS and incubation with secondary antibody in the dark for 90 min. After washing and air-drying the slide, DAPI was applied, and a coverslip was placed gently to avoid bubbles. Oil Red O staining was carried out to determine lipogenesis in cells (31Mahali S.K. Verma N. Manna S.K. Advanced glycation end products induce lipogenesis: regulation by natural xanthone through inhibition of ERK and NF-κB.J. Cell Physiol. 2014; 229: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were first fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and washed with PBS three times, followed by staining with freshly diluted Oil Red O stain (6:1 in water) from 0.5% stock solution in isopropanol for 15 min. After gentle washing with PBS three times, cells were observed under a microscope. For subsequent quantification of lipid droplets, Oil Red O-stained cells were dissolved in isopropanol, and absorbance was recorded at 500 nm. After various treatments, whole-cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared, and 50 μg of protein was used for this procedure. The same gel was stripped and used to detect tubulin. The data were plotted as mean ± S.D. from one experiment of triplicate samples. Statistically significant differences were determined by unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the appropriate post hoc test (Tukey's multiple comparison test) using GraphPad Prism5. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. HSA coupled with methylglyoxal was used as the AGE for this study. Various reagents, especially inhibitors, used for this study did not show any cytolysis as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release by the treated cells (data not shown). To understand the effect of AGE on autophagy, HepG2 cells were incubated with TNF (1 nm), doxorubicin (1 μm), or AGE (100 μg/ml) for different times. Cells were then stained with MDC, and the fluorescence intensity was measured and indicated in -fold of induction from three independent experiments (Fig. 1A1). All three inducers increased MDC fluorescence kinetically, but AGE-mediated enhancement was more compared with doxorubicin and TNF. MDC-stained HepG2 cells consistently showed increased fluorescence intensity as a result of autophagosome formation by AGE (Fig. 1A2). These data suggest that AGE potently increase autophagy. Furthermore, AGE-mediated autophagy was assessed by fluorescence photometry in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). AGE are known to bind RAGE and initiate downstream signaling cascades. To confirm this, HepG2 cells were blocked by anti-RAGE antibody, and then the status of autophagy upon AGE treatment was examined by fluorescence photometry and microscopy. Interestingly, these experiments showed that recruitment of RAGE is essential in AGE-mediated autophagy (Fig. 1, C and D). AGE treatment in HepG2 cells resulted in an increase in autophagy in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, but this effect may be cell type-specific. By fluorescence photometry, AGE was found to exemplify autophagy in different cell lines, following a similar pattern as in HepG2 cells, as determined by the fluorescence intensity of MDC-stained cells. The experiments were repeated three times and are indicated in mean -fold increase (Fig. 2A). The amount of RAGE was determined by Western blot analysis of WCE (Fig. 2B). The variation in the level of autophagy in different cell types can be justified by the difference in RAGE expression in these cells. Upon stimulation of AGE for different times, the amount of RAGE was not altered in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that AGE are unable to increase the expression of their receptor, RAGE. Collectively, these results support our hypothesis that AGE-mediated autophagy is independent of cell type. Autophagy markers (LC3B, an indicator of autophagy induction; p62, a marker for autophagic clearance; and Beclin1 and DRAM1, proteins for autophagy initiation) were determined in AGE-stimulated cells. Total mRNA for DRAM1 was increased and stabilized with time. On the other hand, Beclin1 expression was increased and then decreased slightly (Fig. 3A). These data were supported further by determining the amount of proteins as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). LC3B expression was found to be dynamic, indicating the induction of autophagy. The decrease in the amount of p62 (Fig. 3C) well complemented our data showing that autophagy was maintained upon AGE treatment. AGE, like rapamycin, a positive inducer of autophagy, increased autophagy, as shown by an increased amount of LC3B (Fig. 3C). Evidence from the GFP-LC3B transfection study confirmed the formation and accumulation of GFP-LC3B puncta in cells upon AGE treatment, as shown by fluorescent cells (Fig. 3E2) and the number of puncta (Fig. 3E1) and the amount of LC3B from transfected cells (Fig. 3D). Autophagosomes accumulated in cells pretreated with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and in AGE-stimulated cells, although wortmannin (WM), an inhibitor of PI3K treatment, decreased this accumulation, as shown by immunofluorescence images (Fig. 3F1) and the number of LC3B puncta (Fig. 3F2). These data suggest that AGE-mediated autophagy might be proceeding through activation of PI3K and that interfering with autophagosome-lysosome fusion protects the autophagosome and prevents further maturation or degradation. Treatment with AGE alone strongly enhanced the amounts of phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 MAPK, and LC3B, with a notable decrease in p62 and LAMP2B proteins. Conversely, BAY11-7082 (an IKK inhibitor) partially inhibited AGE-mediated autophagy and reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, the effect of sorafenib (SR) (a Raf kinase inhibitor), PKC I (a PKC inhibitor), and MAPK inhibitors (SB202190 for p38 MAPK and PD98059 for MEK1) on phosphorylation of its target proteins and autophagy was examined by Western blot analysis. The results showed a marked reduction in autophagy and efficient blocking of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B, C1, and C2). Taken together, these findings clearly indicate that the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK directed by upstream kinases Raf and PKC is under surveillance of NF-κB and controls autophagy. Overall, the quantitative representation of autophagy, as determined from MDC-stained cell fluorescence, supported the similar activity with various inhibitors, as determined from three independent experiment (Fig. 4D). Subsequently, upon AGE stimulation in IκBα-DN (IκBα dominant negative)-transfected cells, there was a significant reduction in the amount of Beclin1, LC3B, p62, or phospho-ERK (Fig. 4E) and autophagy, as determined by MDC-stained cells (Fig. 4F1) and fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4F2). To gain more insights into the mechanism, we investigated the time-dependent activation of NF-κB by AGE. AGE increased NF-κB DNA binding in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). From previous results (Fig. 4, A–D), we suggested the existence of NF-κB-driven MAPK activation via Raf kinase in autophagy. We also found that the amount of nuclear p65 was decreased in BAY-pretreated cells and partially inhibited in SR- or PKC I-pretreated cells, as determined by an immunofluorescence study (data not shown). A gel shift assay demonstrated a similar result with all of these inhibitors (Fig. 4D, inset). The effect of these inhibitors on ERK1/2 phosphorylation strengthened our data by pointing out the existence of a complex cascade involving NF-κB, Raf kinase, PKC, and MAPK in AGE-mediated autophagy regulation. To explore the contribution of autophagy in lipogenesis, Oil Red O staining was done in AGE-treated HepG2 cells. This further correlated with MDC-stained fluorescence images of autophagosomes. As shown in Fig. 5A, both lipogenesis and autophagy were enhanced remarkably upon AGE stimulation in a time-dependent manner. Mangiferin was used as a known inhibitor of AGE-mediated lipogenesis. To validate the probable role of autophagy in lipogenesis, Oil Red O staining was again done in the presence of autophagy inhibitors and mangiferin and showed a dramatic drop in lipid droplets, as indicated by microscopic viewing (Fig. 5B), and the mean -fold of induction, as determined from absorbance data of three independent experiments (Fig. 5C). AGE-mediated lipid accumulation, as detected by Oil Red O staining, was inhibited to almost 50% by PKC I or SB and PD98059. BAY or SR inhibited almost 80% of lipid accumulation in AGE-stimulated cells, as shown by microscopic viewing of cells with Oil Red O-stained particles (Fig. 6A) or the absorbance of Oil Red O stain in cells (Fig. 6C). Almost complete inhibition of lipid accumulation was observed in AGE-stimulated cells pretreated with novastatin, a known inhibitor of the HMG-CoA pathway or SR and BAY (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that the NF-κB and Raf kinase pathways are involved in AGE-mediated lipid accumulation. To detect the role of AGE-mediated autophagy in lipogenesis, we determined the amount of molecular markers of autophagy. The AGE-mediated increases in the amounts of Beclin1, DRAM1, and fatty acyl synthase were decreased substantially in BAY-pretreated cells as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 6D). BAY- and SR-pretreated cells showed inhibition of the AGE-mediated increase in the amount of Beclin1, p62, and LCB I and II as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6E). Suppression of AGE-mediated lipid accumulation (Fig. 6, F1 and F2) and SREBP expression, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6G), was observed in IκBα-DN-transfected cells. These data suggest that NF-κB plays an important role in the regulation of AGE-mediated autophagy. BAY, in combination with SR, completely inhibited AGE-mediated lipogenesis, as shown by the absorbance of Oil Red O-stained particles in cells (Fig. 6H1), and NF-κB and SREBP DNA binding activity (Fig. 6J). Although novastatin completely inhibited AGE-induced SREBP DNA binding (Fig. 6K) and lipogenesis (Fig. 6H1), the amounts of LC3B and Beclin1 (Fig. 6I) and MDC fluorescence (Fig. 6H2) were not decreased significantly. These data suggest that NF-κB and Raf kinase are major determinants for AGE-mediated lipogenesis and autophagy. Lipogenesis may not induce autophagy, and novastatin did not significantly affect autophagy. However, lipogenesis was reduced in the case of autophagy inhibition. Suppression of NF-κB shows significant inhibition of AGE-mediated autophagy and lipogenesis. AGE kinetically increased SREBP DNA binding (Fig. 7A). Unlabeled SREBP DNA and antibody against SREBP, but not cyclin D1 or p65, suppressed SREBP DNA binding in AGE-ind"
https://openalex.org/W2174383425,"To translate the 13 mtDNA-encoded mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mammalian mitochondria contain a dedicated set of ribosomes comprising rRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) that are encoded by nuclear genes and imported into the matrix. In addition to their role in the ribosome, several MRPs have auxiliary functions or have been implicated in other cellular processes like cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. For example, we have shown that human MRPL12 binds and activates mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), and hence has distinct functions in the ribosome and mtDNA transcription. Here we provide concrete evidence that there are two mature forms of mammalian MRPL12 that are generated by a two-step cleavage during import, involving efficient cleavage by mitochondrial processing protease and a second inefficient or regulated cleavage by mitochondrial intermediate protease. We also show that knock-down of MRPL12 by RNAi results in instability of POLRMT, but not other primary mitochondrial transcription components, and a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial transcription rates. Knock-down of MRPL10, the binding partner of MRPL12 in the ribosome, results in selective degradation of the mature long form of MRPL12, but has no effect on POLRMT. We propose that the two forms of MRPL12 are involved in homeostatic regulation of mitochondrial transcription and ribosome biogenesis that likely contribute to cell cycle, growth regulation, and longevity pathways to which MRPL12 has been linked."
https://openalex.org/W2172728366,"Syringa oblata Lindl. is a woody ornamental plant with high economic value and characteristics that include early flowering, multiple flower colors, and strong fragrance. Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, 12,388 unigenes were sorted into 286 pathways. Based on these transcriptomic data, we obtained a large number of candidate genes that were differentially expressed at different flower stages and that were related to floral pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides fundamental information on the genes and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism and development in S. oblata, providing a useful database for further research on S. oblata and other plants of genus Syringa."
https://openalex.org/W2174645621,"There is a strain of Clostridium perfringens, W5052, which does not produce a known enterotoxin. We herein report that the strain W5052 expressed a homologue of the iota-like toxin components sa and sb of C. spiroforme, named Clostridium perfringens iota-like enterotoxin, CPILE-a and CPILE-b, respectively, based on the results of a genome sequencing analysis and a systematic protein screening. In the nicotinamide glyco-hydrolase (NADase) assay the hydrolysis activity was dose-dependently increased by the concentration of rCPILE-a, as judged by the mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, the actin monomer of the lysates of Vero and L929 cells were radiolabeled in the presence of [32P]NAD and rCPILE-a. These findings indicated that CPILE-a possesses ADP-ribosylation activity. The culture supernatant of W5052 facilitated the rounding and killing of Vero and L929 cells, but the rCPILE-a or a non-proteolyzed rCPILE-b did not. However, a trypsin-treated rCPILE-b did. Moreover, a mixture of rCPILE-a and the trypsin-treated rCPILE-b enhanced the cell rounding and killing activities, compared with that induced by the trypsin-treated rCPILE-b alone. The injection of the mixture of rCPILE-a and the trypsin-treated rCPILE-b into an ileum loop of rabbits evoked the swelling of the loop and accumulation of the fluid dose-dependently, suggesting that CPILE possesses enterotoxic activity. The evidence presented in this communication will facilitate the epidemiological, etiological, and toxicological studies of C. perfringens food poisoning, and also stimulate studies on the transfer of the toxins' gene(s) among the Genus Clostridium."
https://openalex.org/W2268934537,"FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer)-based protein voltage sensors can be useful for monitoring neuronal activity in vivo because the ratio of signals between the donor and acceptor pair reduces common sources of noise such as heart beat artifacts. We improved the performance of FRET based genetically encoded Fluorescent Protein (FP) voltage sensors by optimizing the location of donor and acceptor FPs flanking the voltage sensitive domain of the Ciona intestinalis voltage sensitive phosphatase. First, we created 39 different “Nabi1” constructs by positioning the donor FP, UKG, at 8 different locations downstream of the voltage-sensing domain and the acceptor FP, mKO, at 6 positions upstream. Several of these combinations resulted in large voltage dependent signals and relatively fast kinetics. Nabi1 probes responded with signal size up to 11% ΔF/F for a 100 mV depolarization and fast response time constants both for signal activation (~2 ms) and signal decay (~3 ms). We improved expression in neuronal cells by replacing the mKO and UKG FRET pair with Clover (donor FP) and mRuby2 (acceptor FP) to create Nabi2 probes. Nabi2 probes also had large signals and relatively fast time constants in HEK293 cells. In primary neuronal culture, a Nabi2 probe was able to differentiate individual action potentials at 45 Hz."
https://openalex.org/W2174007027,"The population structure, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) from cats are rarely characterized. The aim of this study was to compare and characterize the UPEC isolated from cats in four geographic regions of USA in terms of their multilocus sequence typing (MLST), virulence profiles, clinical signs, antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic grouping. The results showed that a total of 74 E. coli isolates were typed to 40 sequence types with 10 being novel. The most frequent phylogenetic group was B2 (n = 57). The most frequent sequence types were ST73 (n = 12) and ST83 (n = 6), ST73 was represented by four multidrug resistant (MDR) and eight non-multidrug resistant (SDR) isolates, and ST83 were significantly more likely to exhibit no drug resistant (NDR) isolates carrying the highest number of virulence genes. Additionally, MDR isolates were more diverse, and followed by SDR and NDR isolates in regards to the distribution of the STs. afa/draBC was the most prevalent among the 29 virulence-associated genes. Linking virulence profile and antimicrobial resistance, the majority of virulence-associated genes tested were more prevalent in NDR isolates, and followed by SDR and MDR isolates. Twenty (50%) MLST types in this study have previously been associated with human isolates, suggesting that these STs are potentially zoonotic. Our data enhanced the understanding of E. coli population structure and virulence association from cats. The diverse and various combinations of virulence-associated genes implied that the infection control may be challenging."
https://openalex.org/W2181213288,"Prototoxins are a diverse family of membrane-tethered molecules expressed in the nervous system that modulate nicotinic cholinergic signaling, but their functions and specificity have yet to be completely explored. We tested the selectivity and efficacy of leukocyte antigen, PLAUR (plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor) domain-containing (LYPD)-6B on α3β4-, α3α5β4-, and α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). To constrain stoichiometry, fusion proteins encoding concatemers of human α3, β4, and α5 (D and N variants) subunits were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and tested with or without LYPD6B. We used the 2-electrode voltage-clamp method to quantify responses to acetylcholine (ACh): agonist sensitivity (EC50), maximal agonist-induced current (Imax), and time constant (τ) of desensitization. For β4-α3-α3-β4-α3 and β4-α3-β4-α3-α3, LYPD6B decreased EC50 from 631 to 79 μM, reduced Imax by at least 59%, and decreased τ. For β4-α3-α5D-β4-α3 and β4-α3-β4-α-α5D, LYPD6B decreased Imax by 63 and 32%, respectively. Thus, LYPD6B acted only on (α3)3(β4)2 and (α3)2(α5D)(β4)2 and did not affect the properties of (α3)2(β4)3, α7, or (α3)2(α5N)(β4)2 nAChRs. Therefore, LYPD6B acts as a mixed modulator that enhances the sensitivity of (α3)3(β4)2 nAChRs to ACh while reducing ACh-induced whole-cell currents. LYPD6B also negatively modulates α3β4 nAChRs that include the α5D common human variant, but not the N variant associated with nicotine dependence."

It is often observed that cervical collars are applied incorrectly, resulting in reduced immobilization of the cervical spine. The objective of this study was to analyze the practical skills of trained professional rescue personnel concerning the application of cervical collars.Within emergency medical conferences, n = 104 voluntary test subjects were asked to apply a cervical collar to a training doll, wherein each step that was performed received an evaluation. Furthermore, personal and occupational data of all study participants were collected using a questionnaire.The test subjects included professional rescue personnel (80.8%) and emergency physicians (12.5%). The average occupational experience of all study participants in pre-clinical emergency care was 11.1±8.9 years. Most study participants had already attended a certified training on trauma care (61%) and felt ""very confident"" in handling a cervical collar (84%). 11% applied the cervical collar to the training doll without errors. The most common error consisted of incorrect adjustment of the size of the cervical collar (66%). No association was found between the correct application of the cervical collar and the occupational group of the test subjects (trained rescue personnel vs. emergency physicians) or the participation in certified trauma courses.Despite pronounced subjective confidence regarding the application of cervical collars, this study allows the conclusion that there are general deficits in practical skills when cervical collars are applied. A critical assessment of the current training contents on the subject of trauma care must, therefore, be demanded."

Cytochrome P450c17 can exhibit either one or two physiological enzymatic activities differentially regulated by cytochrome b5. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, comprehensive in silico, in vivo and in vitro analyses were undertaken. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer analysis showed close interactions within living cells between cytochrome P450c17 and cytochrome b5. In silico modeling identified the sites of interaction and confirmed that E48 and E49 residues in cytochrome b5 are essential for activity. Quartz crystal microbalance studies identified specific protein-protein interactions in a lipid membrane. Voltammetric analysis revealed that the wild type cytochrome b5, but not a mutated, E48G/E49G cyt b5, altered the kinetics of electron transfer between the electrode and the P450c17.

https://openalex.org/W2180151595,"This study investigated global gene expression in the small yellow follicles (6-8 mm diameter) of broiler-type B strain Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) in response to acute heat stress. Twelve 30-wk-old TCC hens were divided into four groups: control hens maintained at 25°C and hens subjected to 38°C acute heat stress for 2 h without recovery (H2R0), with 2-h recovery (H2R2), and with 6-h recovery (H2R6). Small yellow follicles were collected for RNA isolation and microarray analysis at the end of each time point. Results showed that 69, 51, and 76 genes were upregulated and 58, 15, 56 genes were downregulated after heat treatment of H2R0, H2R2, and H2R6, respectively, using a cutoff value of two-fold or higher. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes are associated with the biological processes of cell communication, developmental process, protein metabolic process, immune system process, and response to stimuli. Upregulation of heat shock protein 25, interleukin 6, metallopeptidase 1, and metalloproteinase 13, and downregulation of type II alpha 1 collagen, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2, and Kruppel-like factor 2 suggested that acute heat stress induces proteolytic disintegration of the structural matrix and inflamed damage and adaptive responses of gene expression in the follicle cells. These suggestions were validated through gene expression, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Functional annotation clarified that interleukin 6-related pathways play a critical role in regulating acute heat stress responses in the small yellow follicles of TCC hens."

Co-incubation assay confirmed that LP eosinophils induced the differentiation of naïve T cells into Treg cells. Differentiation promoted by LP eosinophils were inhibited by blocked either TGF-β1 or ATRA. Peripheral blood (PB) eosinophils did not produce ATRA and could not induce Treg differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2232279910,"Human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (KLK2) is a key serine protease in semen liquefaction and prostate cancer together with KLK3/prostate-specific antigen. In order to decipher the function of its potential N-glycosylation site, we produced pro-KLK2 in Leishmania tarentolae cells and compared it with its non-glycosylated counterpart from Escherichia coli expression. Mass spectrometry revealed that Asn-95 carries a core glycan, consisting of two GlcNAc and three hexoses. Autocatalytic activation was retarded in glyco-pro-KLK2, whereas the activated glyco-form exhibited an increased proteolytic resistance. The specificity patterns obtained by the PICS (proteomic identification of protease cleavage sites) method are similar for both KLK2 variants, with a major preference for P1-Arg. However, glycosylation changes the enzymatic activity of KLK2 in a drastically substrate-dependent manner. Although glyco-KLK2 has a considerably lower catalytic efficiency than glycan-free KLK2 toward peptidic substrates with P2-Phe, the situation was reverted toward protein substrates, such as glyco-pro-KLK2 itself. These findings can be rationalized by the glycan-carrying 99-loop that prefers to cover the active site like a lid. By contrast, the non-glycosylated 99-loop seems to favor a wide open conformation, which mostly increases the apparent affinity for the substrates (i.e. by a reduction of Km). Also, the cleavage pattern and kinetics in autolytic inactivation of both KLK2 variants can be explained by a shift of the target sites due to the presence of the glycan. These striking effects of glycosylation pave the way to a deeper understanding of kallikrein-related peptidase biology and pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2239037442,"The interface between relay and converter domain of muscle myosin is critical for optimal myosin performance. Using Drosophila melanogaster indirect flight muscle S1, we performed a kinetic analysis of the effect of mutations in the converter and relay domain. Introduction of a mutation (R759E) in the converter domain inhibits the steady-state ATPase of myosin S1, whereas an additional mutation in the relay domain (N509K) is able to restore the ATPase toward wild-type values. The R759E S1 construct showed little effect on most steps of the actomyosin ATPase cycle. The exception was a 25-30% reduction in the rate constant of the hydrolysis step, the step coupled to the cross-bridge recovery stroke that involves a change in conformation at the relay/converter domain interface. Significantly, the double mutant restored the hydrolysis step to values similar to the wild-type myosin. Modeling the relay/converter interface suggests a possible interaction between converter residue 759 and relay residue 509 in the actin-detached conformation, which is lost in R759E but is restored in N509K/R759E. This detailed kinetic analysis of Drosophila myosin carrying the R759E mutation shows that the interface between the relay loop and converter domain is important for fine-tuning myosin kinetics, in particular ATP binding and hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2225176933,"A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) represent a family of structurally diverse proteins, all of which bind PKA. A member of this family is glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) interaction protein (GSKIP). GSKIP interacts with PKA and also directly interacts with GSK3β. The physiological function of the GSKIP protein in vivo is unknown. We developed and characterized a conditional knock-out mouse model and found that GSKIP deficiency caused lethality at birth. Embryos obtained through Caesarean section at embryonic day 18.5 were cyanotic, suffered from respiratory distress, and failed to initiate breathing properly. Additionally, all GSKIP-deficient embryos showed an incomplete closure of the palatal shelves accompanied by a delay in ossification along the fusion area of secondary palatal bones. On the molecular level, GSKIP deficiency resulted in decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 starting early in development (embryonic day 10.5), leading to enhanced GSK3β activity. At embryonic day 18.5, GSK3β activity decreased to levels close to that of wild type. Our findings reveal a novel, crucial role for GSKIP in the coordination of GSK3β signaling in palatal shelf fusion. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) represent a family of structurally diverse proteins, all of which bind PKA. A member of this family is glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) interaction protein (GSKIP). GSKIP interacts with PKA and also directly interacts with GSK3β. The physiological function of the GSKIP protein in vivo is unknown. We developed and characterized a conditional knock-out mouse model and found that GSKIP deficiency caused lethality at birth. Embryos obtained through Caesarean section at embryonic day 18.5 were cyanotic, suffered from respiratory distress, and failed to initiate breathing properly. Additionally, all GSKIP-deficient embryos showed an incomplete closure of the palatal shelves accompanied by a delay in ossification along the fusion area of secondary palatal bones. On the molecular level, GSKIP deficiency resulted in decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 starting early in development (embryonic day 10.5), leading to enhanced GSK3β activity. At embryonic day 18.5, GSK3β activity decreased to levels close to that of wild type. Our findings reveal a novel, crucial role for GSKIP in the coordination of GSK3β signaling in palatal shelf fusion. PKA is a serine/threonine kinase that controls a wide variety of cellular processes (1Taylor S.S. Ilouz R. Zhang P. Kornev A.P. Assembly of allosteric macromolecular switches: lessons from PKA.Nat.

This coordinating function of AKAPs is not limited to PKA signaling; AKAPs directly bind further signaling proteins and thereby coordinate crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways. An example is the AKAP glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) interaction protein (GSKIP). GSKIP directly interacts with PKA and GSK3β (6Hundsrucker C. Skroblin P. Christian F. Zenn H.M. Popara V.

Recently, an autosomal dominant 700-kb duplication encompassing the Gskip gene was identified in humans; this alteration causes a predisposition for myeloid malignancies, indicating a likely role in tumorigenesis (7Saliba J.

To date, functional analyses of the GSKIP protein have been limited to in vitro and overexpression studies. GSKIP contains a structurally conserved PKA-binding domain (amino acids 28–52) that is characteristic for AKAPs and specifically binds regulatory RII subunits of PKA. GSK3β binds GSKIP at its C-terminal conserved GSK3β-binding domain (GID; amino acids 115–139) (6Hundsrucker C. Skroblin P. Christian F. Zenn H.M. Popara V. Joshi M. Eichhorst J. Wiesner B.

GSKIP is homologous to the Axin GSK3β interaction domain and functions as a negative regulator of GSK3β.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11379-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The interaction between GSKIP and GSK3β through the GID is conserved among vertebrates and invertebrates, whereas its interaction with PKA RII subunits is restricted to vertebrates. This indicates that it functions as an AKAP exclusively in vertebrates (6Hundsrucker C. Skroblin P. Christian F. Zenn H.M. Popara V. Joshi M. Eichhorst J. Wiesner B. Herberg F.W. Reif B. Rosenthal W.

GSK3 is a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase involved in a plethora of cellular processes including glycogen metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and development. It is found in the cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria of all eukaryotic cells (9Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β is highly activated in nuclei and mitochondria.Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 2415-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There are two homologous genes encoding two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3α (51 kDa) and GSK3β (47 kDa). Both isoforms of GSK3 are constitutively active and phosphorylate primed substrates, i.e. substrates that have been pre-phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (CK1), MAPK, ERK, or other kinases (reviewed in Ref. 10Beurel E. Grieco S.F. Jope R.S. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3): regulation, actions, and diseases.Pharmacol. Ther. 2015; 148: 114-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarities, GSK3α and GSK3β are functionally non-redundant (11Kaidanovich-Beilin O. Woodgett J.R. GSK-3: functional insights from cell biology and animal models.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2011; 4: 40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSK3β activity is inhibited by Ser-9 phosphorylation (12Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H.

We have shown that GSKIP facilitates the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser-9 by PKA when overexpressed in cultured cells (6Hundsrucker C. Skroblin P. Christian F. Zenn H.M. Popara V.

GSK3β is a component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in embryonic development. Canonical Wnt signaling controls essential processes such as body axis patterning, cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate, and cell migration (13Logan C.Y. Nusse R.

A comprehensive review of the genetic basis of cleft lip and palate.J. Oral Maxillofac. Pathol. 2012; 16: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling is activated by binding of Wnt ligands to receptor complexes at the plasma membrane that consist of LRP5/6 transmembrane proteins and G protein-like receptors of the Frizzled (Fz) family. The knock-out of Lrp6 resulted in defects in orofacial development and disruptions of other embryonic features. Lrp6−/− animals exhibit hypoplasia of the upper lip and midline cleft of the mandible at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), and the absence of the primary palate at E16.5 (15Song L. Li Y. Wang K. Wang Y.Z.

Lrp6-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is required for lip formation and fusion.Development. 2009; 136: 3161-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), giving rise to a cleft lip and palate phenotype. Gpr177 (mouse ortholog of Wntless) is a ubiquitous transmembrane protein directly activated by β-catenin and TCF/LEF-dependent transcription. Gpr177-Wnt complexes enhance Wnt production in a positive feedback loop. Mice deficient for mesenchymal Gpr177 in craniofacial neural crest cells display a secondary cleft palate, which is mainly due to aberrant cell proliferation and increased cell death in the palatal shelves (16Liu Y. Wang M. Zhao W. Yuan X. Yang X. Li Y. Qiu M. Zhu X.J. Zhang Z. Gpr177-mediated Wnt signaling is required for secondary palate development.J. Dent. Res. 2015; 94: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Wnt5a deficiency also causes a secondary cleft palate. These mice exhibited altered cell proliferation patterns and a lack of directional cell migration along the anterior-posterior axis within the developmental palate (17He F. Xiong W. Yu X. Espinoza-Lewis R. Liu C. Gu S. Nishita M. Suzuki K. Yamada G. Minami Y. Chen Y. Wnt5a regulates directional cell migration and cell proliferation via Ror2-mediated noncanonical pathway in mammalian palate development.Development. 2008; 135: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). 50% of Wnt9b knock-out mice display a cleft lip and palate (20Juriloff D.M. Harris M.J. Mouse genetic models of cleft lip with or without cleft palate.Birth Defects Res. A Clin. Mol.

In canonical Wnt signaling, GSK3β assembles with Axin, β-catenin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and CK1 in the destruction complex located in the cytosol. In the absence of a Wnt signal, GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin (22Sadot E. Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Shnizer D. Lando Z. Zharhary D. Kam Z. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B.

Activation of Wnt signaling leads to the inhibition of GSK3β through phosphorylation, allowing β-catenin to accumulate and induce transcription of Wnt target genes. Inhibitors of GSK3β include GSKIP and GSKIPtide, a peptide encompassing the GID and corresponding to amino acid residues 115–139 of GSKIP; they activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (27Lin C.C. Chou C.H. Howng S.L. Hsu C.Y. Hwang C.C. Wang C. Hsu C.M. Hong Y.R. GSKIP, an inhibitor of GSK3β, mediates the N-cadherin/β-catenin pool in the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells.J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 108: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The overexpression of GSKIP induces β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus and down-regulates N-cadherin expression, thus blocking neurite outgrowth during retinoic acid-mediated differentiation of the cells (8Chou H.Y. Howng S.L. Cheng T.S. Hsiao Y.L. Lieu A.S. Loh J.K. Hwang S.L. Lin C.C. Hsu C.M. Wang C. Lee C.I. Lu P.J. Chou C.K. Huang C.Y. Hong Y.R. GSKIP is homologous to the Axin GSK3β interaction domain and functions as a negative regulator of GSK3β.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11379-11389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite considerable knowledge of GSKIP functions gained in cell culture systems, its physiological relevance remains unknown. Here we generated and characterized a new conditional Gskip knock-out mouse to gain insights into its function. GSKIP deficiency is associated with the modulation of GSK3β activity during development and a cleft palate. To generate conditional Gskip mice (Gskipfl/fl), exon 2 was flanked with loxP sites via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Therefore, the targeting vector pPNT-FRT3-gskip was transfected into E14.1 mouse embryonic stem cells, and clones harboring the expected mutation (clone H3) were identified by Southern analysis. Germline chimeras were generated by injection in blastocyst using standard procedures. Heterozygous Gskip+/− mice lacking exon 2 were obtained upon mating to the general B6.C-Tg(CMV-cre)1Cgn/J Cre deleter strain (28Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. A cre-transgenic mouse strain for the ubiquitous deletion of loxP-flanked gene segments including deletion in germ cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Cre-mediated deletion results in the deletion of a genomic region encoding 86 out of a total of 119 amino acids of GSKIP including the start codon, thus causing a Gskip null mutation (Gskip−/−). Gskip+/− as well as Gskipflx/wt mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 animals for at least 10 generations. For genotyping, the following primers were used: GSKIP-fw (see Fig. 1C, red), 5′AAA AGT TTA AAA AGG TCT GGA AAG C 3′ in combination with either GSKIP-rev (see Fig. 1C, blue), 5′ TAG TGT TGC TTT TAA GAC AGG GTT T 3′, or loxP-rev (see Fig. 1C, green), 5′ TCT GCA AGA AAG GAG TAA CAG ATT T 3′. All mice were housed and maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment in the animal facility of the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine according to the recommendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA), with chow and water ad libitum in air-conditioned rooms at 22–23 °C with a standard 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice were weaned 4 weeks after birth and ear-punched for numbering, and female and male mice were separated. After genotyping, one or two females were placed in a cage with one male for standard breeding. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales (LaGeSo), Berlin, Germany. Embryo analysis was conducted as approved by License G 0361/13. Timed matings were set up by intercrossing Gskip+/− animals for the generation of homozygous Gskip−/− embryos. Genotype ratios were calculated and compared with expected Mendelian ratios to determine the time point of death of Gskip−/− mice. E18.5 animals were born through Caesarean sectioning, and P0 animals were abdominally delivered. E18.5 and P0 embryos were weighed, lungs were carefully dissected, and their ability to float on PBS was tested as readout for air in the lung. Dissections for optical inspections and staining procedures were carried out for determination of gross morphological abnormalities. Organs and whole embryos were ground to powder in liquid N2 and resuspended in standard radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Homogenates were sonicated and centrifuged, and total protein concentrations of supernatants were determined using the Coomassie Plus Bradford protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Proteins (10–25 μg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature with 1% BSA in TBS-T and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies directed against: GSKIP (custom-made, used as described previously (6Hundsrucker C. Skroblin P. Christian F. Zenn H.M. Popara V. Joshi M. Eichhorst J. Wiesner B. Herberg F.W. Reif B. Rosenthal W. Klussmann E.

The blots were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories/Dianova) and Western chemiluminescence HRP substrate (Merck Millipore). Signals were visualized using an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Signals were semi-quantitatively analyzed using the ImageJ 1.47v software (National Institutes of Health). For the evaluation of GSK3β protein activity, the ratio was calculated between the signal intensity measured for inactive GSK3β phosphorylated at Ser-9 (inactive) to the signal for total GSK3β (both active and inactive forms). The ratios were normalized to wild type controls and determined as -fold changes as compared with wild type. Total RNA was isolated from homogenized mouse tissue using TRIzol (Sigma-Aldrich) and chloroform according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (100–1,000 ng) was reverse-transcribed according to the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit protocol (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Duplex-real-time RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan system and a Bio-Rad iCycler and the comparative ΔΔCT method for relative gene expression analysis comparing wild type and Gskip−/− mouse tissue. GAPDH was included as a control. For histologic analysis, freshly dissected embryos and isolated heads were rinsed briefly in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. H&E and Azan stain were used on sections of paraffin-embedded whole embryos or skulls for morphological inspection according to standard protocols. In accordance with ethical guidelines, animals were sacrificed by decapitation; hence whole-body sections lack the skull. For microscopic evaluation, a digital Keyence BZ-8100E bright-field microscope was used. For whole-mount staining of skulls, E18.5 embryos were dissected and decapitated. The lower jaw of the skull including the tongue was carefully removed, and the remaining upper part of the skull eviscerated and fixed in 99% ethanol at room temperature for 2–5 days (in a total volume of 15 ml per skull). The material was processed by a 24-h incubation in acetone at room temperature for fat removal. Samples were rinsed once in distilled water. Each skull was transferred to a new tube containing Alizarin red/Alcian blue double staining solution (0.3% Alcian blue, 0.1% Alizarin red) optimized according to Erdoğan et al. (29Erdoğan D.K. Kadioğlu D. Peker T. Visualisation of fetal skeletal system by double staining with Alizarin red and Alcian blue.Gazi Med. J. 1995; : 55-58Google Scholar). Staining was performed at 40 °C for 4 days under rotation. Skulls were briefly washed and transferred into 1.5% aqueous KOH solution for 4 days for clearing. The skulls were transferred into an aqueous solution of 20% glycerol containing 1% KOH until the skulls were clearly visible through the surrounding tissue. Cleared specimens were placed successively into 50, 80, and 100% glycerol for 3–5 days each for long-term storage and imaging. Stained skulls were viewed under a stereomicroscope connected to a Leica DFC 495 camera. All values are presented as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.01 software using paired or unpaired Student's t test (for comparison of two groups) or one-way analysis of variance in combination with Bonferroni's multiple comparison post test (for comparison of three or more groups). For the statistical evaluation of distributions, the contingency test χ2 was used. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The human GSKIP gene (also known as C14orf129 or HSPC120) encodes four alternatively spliced transcripts (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)). Splice variant 1 is the longest; the others differ only in their 5′-UTR as compared with transcript 1. Only a single transcript is expressed from the mouse Gskip gene (4933433P14Rik). For the generation of a conditional Gskip knock-out mouse, the Cre/loxP system was used (Fig. 1). Exon 2 of the Gskip gene contains the start codon and encodes the PKA-binding domain and 86 of the total of 139 amino acids. Exon 2 was flanked by loxP sites and thereby targeted for Cre-mediated deletion (Fig. 1A). Recombinant ES cells were identified via Southern blotting (Fig. 1B). The successful deletion of Gskip was confirmed at DNA (Fig. 1C), mRNA (Fig. 1D), and protein levels (Fig. 1E) in tissues of newborn (P0) mice. Gskip mRNA levels in adult Gskip+/− mice were significantly down-regulated in heart, lung, liver, brain, pancreas, kidney cortex, and spleen, with the strongest reduction appearing in the lung (Fig. 2A). In contrast, of all the tissues that were analyzed in Gskip+/− mice, only the renal medulla exhibited changes in GSKIP protein levels, where expression was reduced (Fig. 2B). Hence, hemizygosity in Gskip+/− animals does not affect GSKIP protein levels in most tissues. In line with these data, Gskip+/− mice did not exhibit any overt phenotype. Timed matings between heterozygous Gskip+/− animals were set up to analyze Gskip−/− embryos at different developmental stages. The expected Mendelian ratios of wild type to heterozygous to homozygous knock-out mice of 1:2:1 were observed up to embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5; Table 1). The number of the Gskip−/− embryos decreased significantly after E16.5. Although many Gskip−/− embryos were still alive at E18.5, the embryos rapidly died within 5–30 min after Caesarean section, whereas wild type and heterozygous controls survived (Table 1). At parturition (P0), no viable GSKIP−/− embryos were detectable. At P0, maternal cannibalism could not be excluded and may have led to an underrepresentation of Gskip−/− embryos. Therefore, parturition appears to be the critical time point in the lethality of Gskip-deficient mice. The loss of GSKIP causes perinatal lethality and is not compatible with life.TABLE 1Genotype analysis of embryos at different developmental stagesEmbryonic stage (E)Gskip+/+aa Mendelian ratios expected: 25 (1).Gskip+/−bb Mendelian ratios expected: 50 (2).Gskip−/−cc Mendelian ratios expected: 25 (1).Total embryo numberχ2 test (p)%%%E11.5265123660.9114 nsE12.53242261180.4645 nsE14.5235225710.9170 nsE16.5284527730.8029 nsE18.5295318#4250.0473*P0226612#990.0301*P28–3547530373<0.0001***a a Mendelian ratios expected: 25 (1).b b Mendelian ratios expected: 50 (2).c c Mendelian ratios expected: 25 (1). Open table in a new tab Gskip+/+ (n = 43) and Gskip−/− (n = 42) E18.5 embryos were genotyped for the presence of the Y chromosome-specific gene Sry. Male (Sry-positive) and female embryos were present in the tested groups in a similar distribution of 1:1. This indicates that the Gskip−/− phenotype in mice is sex-independent (data not shown). The cause of the perinatal lethality seemed to be acute respiratory distress marked by cyanosis. All Gskip−/− embryos at E18.5 appeared cyanotic and pale (Fig. 3A, upper). Visual inspection of the organs of Gskip−/− mice at E18.5 did not reveal aberrations that could obviously explain the lung phenotype: e.g. the diaphragm appeared normal, and gross histological abnormalities did not appear in an analysis of Azan-stained E18.5 whole-body sections in different planes (Fig. 3A, lower). In addition, no significant changes in body weight were noticed between wild type, heterozygous, and Gskip−/− embryos at E18.5 or at P0 (Fig. 3B). E18.5 Gskip−/− mice exhibited distinct gasping movements and costal retraction, indicating a normal neuromuscular function and respiratory drive. However, a marked reduction in breathing frequency, usually in excess of 90%, was observed as compared with wild type littermates. Despite extensive efforts to breathe, all Gskip−/− mice died within 30 min of delivery. As residual air remains in the lung even after death, it causes the tissue to float on a liquid PBS surface. This permits the amount of air in the lung to be used as an indicator of the efficiency of breathing prior to death. The lungs were dissected, weighed, and measured for their ability to float on PBS (Fig. 3, C and D). Only 4.2% out of 24 tested Gskip−/− lungs floated on a PBS surface (Fig. 3D), pointing to lung atelectasis. These results indicate that cyanosis resulted from a failure of lung inflation in the Gskip−/− mice, and most likely a consequent reduction of oxygen diffusion into the blood. No significant alterations were noticed in postmortem lung weight to body weight ratios at E18.5, indicating that pulmonary hypo- or hyperplasia was absent in Gskip−/− mice (Fig. 3C). In addition to the lung phenotype, an anatomical abnormality of the secondary palate was consistently detected in all Gskip−/− mice. Histological examination of H&E-stained E16.5 and E18.5 mouse skull sections revealed a pronounced palatal cleft (Fig. 4A). In Gskip−/− mice, the secondary palatal shelf formation is disturbed in the upper jaw and the two lateral hard palatal shelves do not fuse, resulting in no separation between the nasal and oral cavities. In wild type controls, the two lateral maxillary palatal paired shelves were fused and the midline epithelial seam disappeared at E16.5 and E18.5 (Fig. 4A). Palatal shelf development takes place between E12.5 and E15.5 (30"
https://openalex.org/W2175950309,"In damselflies, sexual colour dimorphism is commonly explained as a consequence of selection on traits that increase male attractiveness to females. However, while many species in the damselfly family Coenagrionidae (Insecta: Odonata) are sexually dimorphic, the males do not engage in displays, and male competition for mates resembles a ""scramble"". An alternative explanation for the sexual differences in coloration within these species is that sexual dimorphism has evolved as a sex-related warning signal, with males signalling their uprofitability as mates to other males, thereby avoiding harassment from conspecifics. We evaluated an underlying assumption of the theory that male-male harassment rate is influenced by colour by comparing harassment of males of the species Nehalennia irene that had been painted to make them appear: (i) similar to an unaltered male (blue), (ii) different from a male (orange) and (iii) more similar to a female (black). When caged together we found that blue-painted males experienced significantly lower harassment than black-painted males. When unpainted males were caged with each type of painted male we found that blue-painted males and the unpainted males housed in the same cages experienced lower rates of harassment than males housed in cages where some males were painted black, suggesting that a single, reliable signal of unprofitability may benefit the individuals that carry it. While our results do not in themselves demonstrate that sexual colour dimorphism originally evolved as an intra-specific warning signal, they do show that harassment is influenced by coloration, and that such selection could conceivably maintain male coloration as a warning signal."
https://openalex.org/W2180179715,"We recently reported that an amide bond is unexpectedly formed by an acyl-CoA synthetase (which catalyzes the formation of a carbon-sulfur bond) when a suitable acid and l-cysteine are used as substrates. DltA, which is homologous to the adenylation domain of nonribosomal peptide synthetase, belongs to the same superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, which includes many kinds of enzymes, including the acyl-CoA synthetases. Here, we demonstrate that DltA synthesizes not only N-(d-alanyl)-l-cysteine (a dipeptide) but also various oligopeptides. We propose that this enzyme catalyzes peptide synthesis by the following unprecedented mechanism: (i) the formation of S-acyl-l-cysteine as an intermediate via its “enzymatic activity” and (ii) subsequent “chemical” S → N acyl transfer in the intermediate, resulting in peptide formation. Step ii is identical to the corresponding reaction in native chemical ligation, a method of chemical peptide synthesis, whereas step i is not. To the best of our knowledge, our discovery of this peptide synthesis mechanism involving an enzymatic reaction and a subsequent chemical reaction is the first such one to be reported. This new process yields peptides without the use of a thioesterified fragment, which is required in native chemical ligation. Together with these findings, the same mechanism-dependent formation of N-acyl compounds by other members of the above-mentioned superfamily demonstrated that all members most likely form peptide/amide compounds by using this novel mechanism. Each member enzyme acts on a specific substrate; thus, not only the corresponding peptides but also new types of amide compounds can be formed.

This finding demonstrated that the enzyme formed a carbon-nitrogen bond involving the carboxyl group of the acid and the amino group of l-cysteine. Furthermore, this unexpected enzyme activity was also observed for acetyl-CoA synthetase (4Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C.

However, the mechanism underlying the carbon-nitrogen bond synthesis remains unknown. The adenylation domain of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) 4The abbreviations used are: NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; NCL, native chemical ligation; d-Ala-l-Cys, N-d-alanyl-l-cysteine; N-Boc, N-t-butoxycarbonyl; ACES, 2-[(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. is also a member of this superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes. This domain is responsible for the selective substrate recognition and formation of acyl-AMP as an intermediate during ATP consumption (12Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12120-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). NRPSs are modular enzymes frequently used to synthesize small peptides such as antibiotics and antiviral agents (14Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D.

These multienzyme complexes are organized into modules, each of which can be further subdivided into a series of domains that catalyze the individual steps of nonribosomal peptide synthesis. DltA,the d-alanine:d-alanyl carrier protein (DltC) ligase involved in the initial step of lipoteichoic acid d-alanylation in Gram-positive bacteria, is structurally homologous to the adenylation domain (16Yonus H. Neumann P. Zimmermann S. May J.J. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Crystal structure of DltA: implications for the reaction mechanism of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase adenylation domains.J. Biol.

DltA not only activates d-alanine but also attaches the activated ester to the DltC-bound cofactor 4′-phosphopantetheine via a thioester bond (18Kiriukhin M.Y.

The DltA features of ATP-dependent activation of the amino acid substrate and utilization of the carrier protein are also features of the adenylation domain of NRPSs. Like the adenylation domain of NRPSs, DltA belongs to the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, their three-dimensional structures being analogous to one another (20Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we here examined the enzyme activity of DltA using l-cysteine instead of the physiological substrate DltC. We succeeded in using DltA to synthesize a dipeptide (N-(d-alanyl)-l-cysteine:d-Ala-l-Cys). Moreover, we revealed the mechanism underlying this previously unidentified peptide/amide bond formation reaction. In addition, we used DltA for this discovered reaction to obtain various oligopeptides. l-Cysteine, S-methyl-l-cysteine, and l-lysine were purchased from Sigma. d-Alanine, d-cysteine, d-serine, d-valine, d-asparagine, d-phenylalanine, l-alanine, l-serine, l-glutamic acid, l-glutamine, l-valine, l-histidine, l-isoleucine, l-phenylalanine, glycine, β-alanine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, and thioglycolic acid were purchased from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). d-Lysine, d-methionine, d-isoleucine, d-tryptophan, and N-Boc-l-Ala were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). l-2-Aminobutyric acid, d-2-aminobutyric acid, and d-glutamine were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). S-Aminoethyl-l-cysteine, S-acetamidomethyl-l-cysteine, and dipeptides were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). N-Boc-l-Cys was purchased from Merck Millipore. ATP and AMP were purchased from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). The pentapeptide (l-Cys-Gly-Gly-l-Arg-l-Glu), hexapeptide (d-Ala-l-Cys-Gly-Gly-l-Arg-l-Glu), decapeptide (l-Cys-Gly-Gly-l-Arg-l-Glu-l-Ser-Gly-l-Ser-Gly-l-Ser), and undecapeptide (d-Ala-l-Cys-Gly-Gly-l-Arg-l-Glu-l-Ser-Gly-l-Ser-Gly-l-Ser) wereprepared by Operon Biotechnology Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). The DNA fragment of the dltA gene was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA of Bacillus subtilis strain 168 as a template. The following two oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-AGAATTCCATATGAAACTTTTACATGCTATTCAAACAC-3′ (NdeI recognition site is underlined) and 5′-TTCTCGAGTACAAGAACCTCTTCGCCAATG-3′ (XhoI recognition site is underlined). The PCR products were subcloned into vector pUC18 and checked by DNA sequencing. To construct C-terminally His6-tagged DltA, the insert DNA (dltA gene) was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-24a(+) (Merck Millipore). The resultant plasmid was designated as pET-dltA. Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was transformed with pET-dltA. The transformants were grown in 2× YT medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C. When the cultures had grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, the incubation temperature was reduced to 24 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). After 24 h of culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, and then suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The resuspended cells were sonicated, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (27,000 × g, 30 min). The resulting supernatant was applied to a nickel-chelating column of HisTrapTM HP (5 ml) (GE Healthcare, Ltd., UK), and washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.01 m imidazole. DltA was eluted with a linear gradient (0.01–0.4 m) of imidazole. The fractions comprising the 57-kDa size peak were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The homogeneity of the purified proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal sequence of the purified DltA was analyzed with a model 490 Procise® protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The purified fraction was used in all experiments in this study. The reaction mixture, comprising 200 mm d-alanine, 200 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and purified DltA (0.2 mg/ml) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), was incubated at 50 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of a perchloric acid solution (pH 1.5). Then the mixture was analyzed by HPLC on a CROWNPAK CR(+) column (4.0 × 150 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The mobile phase was the perchloric acid solvent (pH 1.5), and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A new product peak (retention time, 3.0–3.7 min) distinct from that of AMP was detected on monitoring of the column effluent at 190 nm. The product peak was collected, concentrated, and then subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Ionelectrospray tandem mass spectrometric measurement of the product was carried out using a Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) LCMS-8030 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system and a TSK-gel ODS-100V column (4.6 × 150 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase solvent was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The MS/MS analysis data were acquired under the following conditions: curved desolvation and heat block temperatures of 300 and 200 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizer gas and drying gas at flow rates of 2 and 15 liters/min, respectively. The collision energy was varied from −35 to 35 V, and the ion source polarity was set in the positive or negative mode. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple-bond connectivity spectra of the product were measured with an Avance 600 spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Samples were prepared by dissolution in D2O, which was used as an internal standard. The composition of the reaction mixture, except for the omission of d-alanine, was the same as in the case of identification of d-Ala-l-Cys. β-Alanine, glycine, d-serine, l-alanine, or d-threonine was used instead of d-alanine. Each reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC on a Develosil® RPAQUEOUS column (4.6 × 250 mm; Nomura Chemical Co., Ltd., Aichi, Japan). The mobile-phase solvent included 5% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Each product peak differing from that of AMP was fractionated, concentrated, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The mixture was analyzed with a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system and a Develosil® RPAQUEOUS column (4.6 × 250 mm). The mobile-phase solvent was 5% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The MS/MS analysis data were collected under the same conditions as for the d-Ala-l-Cys analysis except for the column and mobile-phase solvent. The composition of the reaction mixture, except for the omission of l-cysteine, was the same as in the case of identification of dipeptides (Xaa-l-Cys). l-Cysteinyl-glycine (l-Cys-Gly) was used instead of l-cysteine. The mixture was analyzed with a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system and a SeQuant® ZIC®-HILIC column (2.1 × 150 mm; Merck Millipore). The mobile phases for elution were as follows: mobile phase A, acetonitrile; and mobile phase B, 10 mm ammonium acetate. Samples were eluted at 0.2 ml/min using a linear gradient of 20–40% of mobile phase B over the course of 20 min. The final composition of 40% mobile phase B was held for 20 min from 20–40 min. Chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C. The MS/MS analysis data were collected under the same conditions as for the d-Ala-l-Cys analysis except for the column and mobile-phase solvent. The composition of the reaction mixture, except for the omission of l-cysteine, was the same as in the case of identification of d-Ala-l-Cys. The pentapeptide or decapeptide was used instead of l-cysteine. The mixture, including the pentapeptide, was analyzed with a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 and a SeQuant® ZIC®-HILIC column. The HPLC program for hexapeptide elution was the same as that for the dipeptides. The mixture, including the decapeptide, was analyzed with a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 and a SeQuant® ZIC®-HILIC column with acetonitrile, 10 mm ammonium acetate (6:4, v/v) as the mobile phase, and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The MS/MS analysis data were collected under the same conditions as for the d-Ala-l-Cys analysis except for the column and mobile-phase solvent. The reaction mixture, comprising 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 200 mm d-alanine, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 150 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid or thioglycolic acid, was incubated with the purified DltA (0.2 mg/ml) at 50 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of a perchloric acid solution (pH 1.5) to the reaction mixture. Then the mixture was analyzed by HPLC on a COSMOSIL® HILIC column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nakalai Tesque). The mobile phase solvent was 5 mm ammonium acetate in 50% acetonitrile, and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The product peak was fractionated, concentrated, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system and a Develosil® RPAQUEOUS column (2.0 × 150 mm). The mobile phase solvent was 10 mm ammonium acetate, and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The reaction mixture, comprising 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 50 mm d-alanine, 10 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 50 mm N-Boc-l-Cys, was incubated with the purified DltA (1.0 mg/ml) at 50 °C. At several time points, the reaction mixture was subjected to LC-MS and LC-MS/MS analyses. These analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera UPLC system and a Kinetex 1.7u C18 100A column (2.1 × 50 mm). The mobile phases for elution were as follows: mobile phase A, 0.1% formic acid; and mobile phase B, methanol. Samples were eluted at 0.4 ml/min using a linear gradient of 10–50% of mobile phase B over the course of 6 min. The final composition of 50% mobile phase B was held for 1 min from 6 to 7 min. Chromatographic separation was performed at 30 °C. The MS/MS analysis data were collected under the same conditions as for the d-Ala-l-Cys analysis except for the column and mobile-phase solvent. The reaction mixture, comprising 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 20 mm acetic acid, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid, was incubated with S-acetyl-CoA synthetase from bakers' yeast (Sigma, 0.5 mg/ml) at 28 °C. The mixture was analyzed with a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 and a Develosil® RPAQUEOUS column (2.0 × 150 mm) with 10 mm ammonium acetate as the mobile phase, and chromatographic separation was performed at 30 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. When 100 mm thioglycolic acid was added as a substrate instead of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, a COSMOSIL® π-nap column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nakalai Tesque) was used with 0.05% (v/v) formic acid solvent as the mobile phase. The reaction mixture, comprising 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 20 mm isobutyric acid, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid or thioglycolic acid, was incubated with the purified AcsA (0.5 mg/ml) at 28 °C. Then the mixture was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system and a Develosil® RPAQUEOUS column (2.0 × 150 mm). The mobile phases for elution were as follows: mobile phase A, 10 mm ammonium acetate; and mobile phase B, acetonitrile. Samples were eluted at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0–20% of mobile phase B over the course of 15 min. The composition of 20% mobile phase B was held for 5 min from 15 to 20 min, and then the final composition of 0% mobile phase B was held for 5 min from 20 to 25 min. The reaction mixture, comprising 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm acetic acid, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 50 mm N-Boc-l-Cys, was incubated with S-acetyl-CoA synthetase (1.0 mg/ml) at 28 °C. At two time points (10 and 60 min), the reaction mixture was subjected to LC-MS and LC-MS/MS analyses. These analyses were carried out using a Shimadzu LCMS-8030 equipped with a COSMOSIL® π-nap column. The mobile phases for elution were as follows: mobile phase A, 0.05% formic acid; and mobile phase B, acetonitrile. Samples were eluted at 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 2–100% of mobile phase B over the course of 8 min after 1 min from the start. The final composition of 100% mobile phase B was held for 2 min from 9 to 11 min. Chromatographic separation was performed at 40 °C. The standard assay A mixture (100 μl) included 5–200 mm d-alanine, 5–500 mm l-cysteine, 0.5–20 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and purified DltA in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction was started by adding DltA (0.2 mg/ml), followed by incubation at 50 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of a perchloric acid solution (pH 1.5). Then the mixture was analyzed by HPLC on a CROWNPAK CR(+) column. The mobile phase was the perchloric acid solvent (pH 1.5), and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The d-Ala-l-Cys product peak was quantitated by monitoring the column effluent at 210 nm with authentic d-Ala-l-Cys as the standard. One unit of d-Ala-l-Cys synthetic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of d-Ala-l-Cys/min under the assay conditions used. Standard assay A was used to routinely measure d-Ala-l-Cys synthetic activity. To determine the specificity of the enzyme for various amino acids, we assayed its activity using standard assay B, which measures acid-dependent AMP formation. Although the ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assay (21Lee S.G. Lipmann F.

Assay of enzymes forming AMP + PPi by the pyrophosphate determination based on the formation of 18-molybdopyrophosphate.Anal. Biochem. 2012; 421: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) has been used for measuring the specific activity of adenylating enzymes (involved in the reaction ATP → AMP + PPi), these assays are based upon indirect quantification of acyl-AMP or PPi, respectively. Therefore, in our study the modified method to measure directly the amount of AMP by HPLC (23Kimura Y. Shibasaki S. Morisato K. Ishizuka N. Minakuchi H. Nakanishi K. Matsuo M. Amachi T. Ueda M. Ueda K. Microanalysis for MDR1 ATPase by high-performance liquid chromatography with a titanium dioxide column.Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used, because the HPLC method allows easier and more accurate quantification than the methods reported previously. The composition of the standard assay B mixture, except for d-alanine, was the same as that for standard assay A. AMP and ATP in each of the reaction series were separated on a Titan sphere TiO HPLC column (4.6 × 150 mm; GL Science Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase was 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 55% (v/v) acetonitrile, and chromatographic separation was performed at 50 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with monitoring at 254 nm. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of AMP/min under the assay conditions used. kcat values were calculated using a Mr of 56,874 for DltA. In the pH profile experiments, a three-component buffer system that maintained the ionic strength at a set value throughout each range was used (24Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Buffers of constant ionic strength for studying pH-dependent processes.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry, substrate consumption and product formation during the synthesis of N-d-alanyl-l-cysteine were examined in a reaction mixture comprising 5 mm ATP, 200 mm d-alanine, 200 mm l-cysteine, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and 0.6 mg of DltA, in a final volume of 1000 μl. The reaction was carried out at 50 °C. At several time points, the molar amounts of the formed products (d-Ala-l-Cys and AMP) and accompanying decreases in the substrate (ATP) were measured by means of standard assays. Protein concentrations were measured with a Nakalai Tesque protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The relative molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated from the mobilities of the marker proteins, phosphorylase b (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). DltA was simply purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of the DltA was confirmed by migration of the protein as a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 57 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The purified DltA had the N-terminal sequence of MKLLHAIQTH, which is the same as that deduced from the DNA sequence. DltA of B. subtilis uses d-alanine (H3C-CH(NH2)-COOH) and 4′-phosphopantetheine-bound DltC as substrates and forms a thioester bond involving the carboxyl group of d-alanine and the thiol group of 4′-phosphopantetheine. Therefore, we examined whether or not DltA could catalyze the N-acyl-l-cysteine synthetic reaction when l-cysteine (HS-CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH) was used instead of DltC. When the reaction mixture, including the purified DltA, ATP, d-alanine, and l-cysteine, was analyzed by HPLC on a Titan sphere TiO column, a marked increase in AMP was observed (see under “Stoichiometry”). This increase in AMP with consumption of ATP indicates that the reaction proceeded. In addition, when the same reaction mixture was analyzed on a CROWNPAK CR(+) column, a new product peak (retention time, 3.0 min) distinct from that of AMP appeared. No other new peaks were detected. Without DltA, the peaks due to the new product and AMP were not detected. We therefore used LC-MS/MS and NMR to characterize the product. The molecular mass of the product, as determined by LC-ESI-MS, was 192 Da. Next, the structure of the product was determined by means of LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2). A fragment ion at m/z 113 (negative ion mode) derived from the precursor ion at m/z 191 was observed, suggesting that the new product was not S-(d-alanyl)-l-cysteine (H3C-CH(NH2)-CO-S-CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH) but N-(d-alanyl)-l-cysteine (H3C-CH(NH2)-CO-NH-CH(COOH)-CH2-SH) (namely d-Ala-l-Cys). This identification was supported by the NMR spectra of the following product: 1H NMR (600 MHz, D2O): δ 1.44 (d, J = 7.1 Hz, 3H, C4-Me), 2.85 (ddd, J = 14.2, 6.9 Hz, 1H, H-5), 2.88 (ddd, J = 14.2, 4.4 Hz, 1H, H-5), 4.04 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 1H, H-4), 4.48 (dd, J = 6.9, 4.4 Hz, 1H, H-2); 13C NMR (150 MHz, D2O): δ 16.7 (C4-Me), 25.4 (C-5), 49"

It is co-translationally inserted into selenoproteins (selenium-containing proteins) in response to the UGA codon in mRNA (1Turanov A.A. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Yoo M.H. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L.

Selenoproteins are found in each of the three domains of life: prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes but are absent in yeast and higher plants. Seleno-proteomes have been reported to exist in kinetoplastids, apicomplexan parasites, insects, nematodes etc. (2Lobanov A.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N.

Selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases have biological functions in oxidoreductions, redox signaling, and antioxidant defense (3Lu J. Holmgren A. Selenoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 723-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Selenoprotein biosynthesis requires two specialized metabolic pathways: one that incorporates Sec into proteins and the other that synthesizes Sec. The Sec insertion machinery has the capability to distinguish between the UGA for amino acid incorporation or termination. This is due to the presence of a stem-loop structure in the 3′-untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNA in eukaryotes known as the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element. The distance between the Sec UGA codon and the SECIS element plays an essential role in this distinction. SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP2) binds to the SECIS element and forms a complex with the specific elongation factor, EFSec, for incorporation of Sec into the selenoprotein (1Turanov A.A. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Yoo M.H. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Biosynthesis of selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid in the genetic code, and a novel pathway for cysteine biosynthesis.Adv.

UGA recoding in higher organisms requires additional factors like SECp43, which was found to associate with the Sec-tRNASec·EFsec complex in vitro and also enhance the interaction between EFsec and SBP2 in vivo (5Small-Howard A.

Biol. 2006; 26: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sec synthesis occurs on its transfer RNA (tRNA), designated tRNASec. The bacterial Sec synthesis system is different from that of archaea and eukaryotes (1Turanov A.A. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Yoo M.H. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L.

In bacteria following the serylation of tRNASec, its direct transformation to Sec-tRNASec occurs by SelA (Fig. 1). However, archaea and eukaryotes have an additional step to form Sec-tRNASec. tRNASec is initially aminoacylated with serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase and the resulting seryl moiety is converted to phosphoserine by O-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (PSTK) in eukaryotes. This phosphorylation step is absent in bacteria. The selenium donor, selenophosphate is synthesized from selenide and ATP by selenophosphate synthetase in eukaryotes and SelD in bacteria (1Turanov A.A. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Yoo M.H. Gladyshev V.N.

Selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase (SepSecS) then uses the O-phosphoseryl-tRNASec and selenophosphate to form Sec-tRNASec in eukaryotes (Fig. 1).

A survey of the Leishmania genome using the known selenoproteins as a search tool led to the identification of genes for glutathione peroxidase, selenoprotein R, and a selenoprotein SPS2 homolog (11Cassago A.

It was postulated that these homologs in Leishmania have evolved into nonselenium-containing proteins consistent with the loss of an identifiable SECIS element in their sequence (11Cassago A.

However, in another study, in silico analysis of the genomes of Trypanosoma and Leishmania for the occurrence of homologs of known selenoprotein genes, led to the identification of SelK and SelT, as well as a novel multidomain selenoprotein designated SelTryp (12Lobanov A.V.

Kinetoplastida SelK was found to have a predicted transmembrane motif (12Lobanov A.V. Gromer S. Salinas G. Gladyshev V.N. Selenium metabolism in Trypanosoma: characterization of selenoproteomes and identification of a Kinetoplastida-specific selenoprotein.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4012-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In mammals, SelK associates with proteins involved in the elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (14Shchedrina V.A. Everley R.A. Zhang Y. Gygi S.P. Hatfield D.L.

It is also a target of calpain proteases that are involved in regulation of inflammation and immune response (14Shchedrina V.A. Everley R.A. Zhang Y. Gygi S.P. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N.

Selenoprotein T in mammals is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and neuroendocrine secretion in response to a cAMP-stimulating trophic factor (15Grumolato L. Ghzili H.

It also plays a role in cell adhesion (16Sengupta A. Carlson B.A. Labunskyy V.M. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Selenoprotein T deficiency alters cell adhesion and elevates selenoprotein W expression in murine fibroblast cells.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 87: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The functions of SelK and SelT in kinetoplastids need to be experimentally deciphered. SelTryp ORF has Sec present in the conserved C-terminal peptide region, SI(V)I(V)-CI(V)SUPR (U is Sec). This C-terminal location is common to eukaryotic selenoproteins (e.g. thioredoxin reductase, SelK, SelS, and SelO) (12Lobanov A.V. Gromer S. Salinas G. Gladyshev V.N. Selenium metabolism in Trypanosoma: characterization of selenoproteomes and identification of a Kinetoplastida-specific selenoprotein.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4012-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In SelTryp, Sec is present within a CXXU motif, which is often found in selenoproteins that carry out redox function through reversible formation of a selenenylsulfide bond. This observation suggests a redox function for the CXXU motif in SelTryp (12Lobanov A.V. Gromer S. Salinas G. Gladyshev V.N.

Our earlier comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the Leishmania genome led to the identification of an enzyme with SepSecS-like domains (17Gowri V.S. Ghosh I. Sharma A. Madhubala R. Unusual domain architecture of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and their paralogs from Leishmania major.BMC Genomics. 2012; 13: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our in silico analysis showed that kinetoplastid SepSecS enzymes are phylogenetically closer to worm SepSecS, whereas the metazoan enzymes are closer to fly and viridiplantae/algae SepSecS enzymes. In the present study, we for the first time report that Leishmania encodes an active selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase, which is dependent on the action of PSTK enzyme in the Sec insertion pathway. Gene deletion studies indicate that Leishmania SepSecS is dispensable for the survival of the parasite. The parasite was found to encode three selenoproteins, which were expressed only in the presence of SepSecS enzyme. Auranofin, a known inhibitor of selenoprotein synthesis showed the same sensitivity toward the wild-type and null mutant suggesting its effect in Leishmania donovani is not through binding to selenoproteins. All restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Paromomycin, hygromycin, and zeocin were obtained from Sigma. Plasmid pET-30a was obtained from Novagen. Escherichia coli DH10β and BL21(DE3) were used as the host for plasmid cloning and protein expression, respectively.

Wild-type promastigotes were cultured at 22 °C in M199 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma), and 5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Wild-type (WT) parasites were routinely cultured in media with no drug supplementations, whereas the genetically manipulated SepSecS heterozygotes (SepSecS/HYG, SepSecS/NEO) and null mutants (ΔSepSecS) were maintained in either 200 μg/ml of hygromycin or 300 μg/ml of paromomycin or both, respectively. The “add-back” line ΔSepSecS/+ was grown in 800 μg/ml of zeocin, 200 μg/ml of hygromycin, and 300 μg/ml of paromomycin. For characterizing the mutant parasites phenotypically, cells were subcultured without selection marker prior to experiments. The mouse monocyte macrophage-like cell line J774.A1 obtained from ATCC was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Structural comparison of the model with human homolog and structural mapping of the active site residues was performed using PyMOL (28DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The gene for LdSepSecS (LdBPK_091000.1) was amplified by PCR using forward primer with a flanking BamHI site (5′-TTTTGGATCCATGGATGATCGCTCGCTAAAACT-3′) and reverse primer with a flanking HindIII site (5′-TTTTAAGCTTTCATGCGGGAACAGGCCACAG-3′) from L. donovani genomic DNA. The 1788-bp amplification product encompassing the entire LdSepSecS open reading frame (ORF) was cloned into pET30a vector (Novagen) using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. This construct containing a His6 tag at the N terminus was transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen). Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and the cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture). Protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) by eluting with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Purified protein was found to be >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Purified recombinant LdSepSecS protein (50 μg) was subcutaneously injected in mice using Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma), followed by three booster doses of the recombinant protein (20 μg) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma), at 2-week intervals. The mice were sacrificed after the last booster and serum was collected for Western blot analysis. Early log phase wild-type and genetically manipulated promastigotes were harvested and the resultant cell pellets re-suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The cell pellets were lysed by freeze-thaw cycles and sonication on ice followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. For recombinant LdSepSecS protein, 30 μg of the total soluble promastigote cell extracts were fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% skimmed milk, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-LdSepSecS antibody (1:1000) generated in mice as described above. In the case of only recombinant protein, incubation was done with anti-His tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology number 2365) (1:3000). The membrane was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling Technology number 7076S) (1:5000). The blot was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) tablets (Sigma) or ECL® kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 50 μg of rLdSepSecS in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) was treated with 2 μl of 5% freshly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for 30 s, 2 min, and 10 min, respectively, at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Cross-linked protein samples were mixed with loading buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol and subsequently analyzed on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel. LdSepSecS and M. jannaschii SepSecS (MjSepSecS) genes were individually transformed into E. coli ΔselA deletion strain JS1, with or without the M. jannaschii PSTK gene. Aerobic overnight cultures were streaked on LB agar plates supplemented with 0.5% glucose and 0.01 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The transformants were then grown anaerobically at 37 °C. After growth, the plates were removed from the anaerobic jar and immediately overlaid with 0.75% top agar (containing 1 mg/ml of benzyl viologen, 0.25 m sodium formate, and 25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0).

https://openalex.org/W2288047922,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that have the dual ability to stimulate immunity and maintain tolerance. However, the signalling pathways mediating tolerogenic DC function in vivo remain largely unknown. The β-catenin pathway has been suggested to promote a regulatory DC phenotype. The aim of this study was to unravel the role of β-catenin signalling to control DC function in the autoimmune collagen-induced arthritis model (CIA). Deletion of β-catenin specifically in DCs was achieved by crossing conditional knockout mice with a CD11c-Cre transgenic mouse line. Bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were generated and used to study the maturation profile of these cells in response to a TLR2 or TLR4 ligand stimulation. CIA was induced by intra-dermal immunization with 100 μg chicken type II collagen in complete Freund’s adjuvant on days 0 and 21. CIA incidence and severity was monitored macroscopically and by histology. The T cell profile as well as their cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry. Lack of β-catenin specifically in DCs did not affect the spontaneous, TLR2- or TLR4-induced maturation and activation of BMDCs or their cytokine production. Moreover, no effect on the incidence and severity of CIA was observed in mice lacking β-catenin in CD11c+ cells. A decreased frequency of splenic CD3+CD8+ T cells and of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (CD4+CD25highFoxP3+), but no changes in the frequency of splenic Th17 (CCR6+CXCR3-CCR4+), Th2 (CCR6-CXCR3-CCR4+) and Th1 (CCR6-CXCR3+CCR4-) cells were observed in these mice under CIA condition. Furthermore, the expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-4 or IFNγ was also not affected. Our data indicate that ablation of β-catenin expression in DCs did not alter the course and severity of CIA. We conclude that although deletion of β-catenin resulted in a lower frequency of Tregs, this decrease was not sufficient to aggravate the onset and severity of CIA."
https://openalex.org/W2264704432,"Severe infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during infancy is strongly associated with the development of asthma. To identify genetic variation that contributes to asthma following severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy, we sequenced the coding exons of 131 asthma candidate genes in 182 European and African American children with severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy using anonymous pools for variant discovery, and then directly genotyped a set of 190 nonsynonymous variants. Association testing was performed for physician-diagnosed asthma before the 7th birthday (asthma) using genotypes from 6,500 individuals from the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) as controls to gain statistical power. In addition, among patients with severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy, we examined genetic associations with asthma, active asthma, persistent wheeze, and bronchial hyperreactivity (methacholine PC20) at age 6 years. We identified four rare nonsynonymous variants that were significantly associated with asthma following severe RSV bronchiolitis, including single variants in ADRB2, FLG and NCAM1 in European Americans (p = 4.6x10-4, 1.9x10-13 and 5.0x10-5, respectively), and NOS1 in African Americans (p = 2.3x10-11). One of the variants was a highly functional nonsynonymous variant in ADRB2 (rs1800888), which was also nominally associated with asthma (p = 0.027) and active asthma (p = 0.013) among European Americans with severe RSV bronchiolitis without including the ESP. Our results suggest that rare nonsynonymous variants contribute to the development of asthma following severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy, notably in ADRB2. Additional studies are required to explore the role of rare variants in the etiology of asthma and asthma-related traits following severe RSV bronchiolitis."
https://openalex.org/W2175177246,"The formation and development of maize kernel is a complex dynamic physiological and biochemical process that involves the temporal and spatial expression of many proteins and the regulation of metabolic pathways. In this study, the protein profiles of the endosperm and pericarp at three important developmental stages were analyzed by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS in popcorn inbred N04. Comparative quantitative proteomic analyses among developmental stages and between tissues were performed, and the protein networks were integrated. A total of 6,876 proteins were identified, of which 1,396 were nonredundant. Specific proteins and different expression patterns were observed across developmental stages and tissues. The functional annotation of the identified proteins revealed the importance of metabolic and cellular processes, and binding and catalytic activities for the development of the tissues. The whole, endosperm-specific and pericarp-specific protein networks integrated 125, 9 and 77 proteins, respectively, which were involved in 54 KEGG pathways and reflected their complex metabolic interactions. Confirmation for the iTRAQ endosperm proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that 44.44% proteins were commonly found. However, the concordance between mRNA level and the protein abundance varied across different proteins, stages, tissues and inbred lines, according to the gene cloning and expression analyses of four relevant proteins with important functions and different expression levels. But the result by western blot showed their same expression tendency for the four proteins as by iTRAQ. These results could provide new insights into the developmental mechanisms of endosperm and pericarp, and grain formation in maize."
https://openalex.org/W2180636865,"Since the early 1990s, Congress and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have agreed to dedicate roughly 10% of the NIH budget to fighting HIV/AIDS. Now, however, that special arrangement is under fire. Health policy experts, lawmakers, and even NIH officials have wondered why, 2 decades after AIDS death rates began dropping dramatically in the United States, the disease still gets a lion9s share of NIH resources, or $3 billion this year. As questions have arisen about how HIV/AIDS research funds are spent, NIH has also resolved to refocus AIDS money on ending the epidemic. Some voice a broader critique: that NIH9s spending on a disease often doesn9t align with how much suffering it causes. They note that diseases imposing a relatively small burden on U.S. society, such as AIDS, can get a larger share of NIH funding than those that cause greater harm, such as heart disease. Recently, while responding to pointed questions from a member of Congress about the issue, NIH Director Francis Collins said the agency is ready to abandon the 10% set-aside. And next month officials are expected to release an agency-wide strategic plan that they say will address how disease burden should influence the allocation of research dollars."
https://openalex.org/W2174901551,"Dialysis patients have high cardiovascular mortality risk. This study aimed to investigate the association between SNPs of genes involved in vascular processes and mortality in dialysis patients.Forty two SNPs in 25 genes involved in endothelial function, vascular remodeling, cell proliferation, inflammation, coagulation and calcium/phosphate metabolism were genotyped in 1330 incident dialysis patients. The effect of SNPs on 5-years cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality was investigated.The mortality rate was 114/1000 person-years and 49.4% of total mortality was cardiovascular. After correction for multiple testing, VEGF rs699947 was associated with all-cause mortality (HR1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.92). The other SNPs were not associated with mortality.This study provides further evidence that a SNP in the VEGF gene may contribute to the comorbid conditions of dialysis patients. Future studies should unravel the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increase in mortality in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2181043116,"Rationale Recently, the efficacy of renal denervation (RDN) has been debated. It is discussed whether RDN is able to adequately target the renal nerves. Objective We aimed to investigate how effective RDN was by means of functional hemodynamic measurements and nerve damage on histology. Methods and Results We performed hemodynamic measurements in both renal arteries of healthy pigs using a Doppler flow and pressure wire. Subsequently unilateral denervation was performed, followed by repeated bilateral hemodynamic measurements. Pigs were terminated directly after RDN or were followed for 3 weeks or 3 months after the procedure. After termination, both treated and control arteries were prepared for histology to evaluate vascular damage and nerve damage. Directly after RDN, resting renal blood flow tended to increase by 29±67% (P = 0.01). In contrast, renal resistance reserve increased from 1.74 (1.28) to 1.88 (1.17) (P = 0.02) during follow-up. Vascular histopathology showed that most nerves around the treated arteries were located outside the lesion areas (8±7 out of 55±25 (14%) nerves per pig were observed within a lesion area). Subsequently, a correlation was noted between a more impaired adventitia and a reduction in renal resistance reserve (β: -0.33; P = 0.05) at three weeks of follow-up. Conclusion Only a small minority of renal nerves was targeted after RDN. Furthermore, more severe adventitial damage was related to a reduction in renal resistance in the treated arteries at follow-up. These hemodynamic and histological observations may indicate that RDN did not sufficiently target the renal nerves. Potentially, this may explain the significant spread in the response after RDN."
https://openalex.org/W2223323343,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 2 (CEACAM2) regulates food intake as demonstrated by hyperphagia in mice with the Ceacam2 null mutation (Cc2(-/-)). This study investigated whether CEACAM2 also regulates insulin secretion. Ceacam2 deletion caused an increase in β-cell secretory function, as assessed by hyperglycemic clamp analysis, without affecting insulin response. Although CEACAM2 is expressed in pancreatic islets predominantly in non-β-cells, basal plasma levels of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin, islet areas, and glucose-induced insulin secretion in pooled Cc2(-/-) islets were all normal. Consistent with immunofluorescence analysis showing CEACAM2 expression in distal intestinal villi, Cc2(-/-) mice exhibited a higher release of oral glucose-mediated GLP-1, an incretin that potentiates insulin secretion in response to glucose. Compared with wild type, Cc2(-/-) mice also showed a higher insulin excursion during the oral glucose tolerance test. Pretreating with exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, suppressed the effect of Ceacam2 deletion on glucose-induced insulin secretion. Moreover, GLP-1 release into the medium of GLUTag enteroendocrine cells was increased with siRNA-mediated Ceacam2 down-regulation in parallel to an increase in Ca(2+) entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. Thus, CEACAM2 regulates insulin secretion, at least in part, by a GLP-1-mediated mechanism, independent of confounding metabolic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2173397349,"The villin/gelsolin/fragmin superfamily is a major group of Ca2+-dependent actin-binding proteins (ABPs) involved in various cellular processes. Members of this superfamily typically possess three or six tandem gelsolin-like (G) domains, and each domain plays a distinct role in actin filament dynamics. Although the activities of most G domains have been characterized, the biochemical function of the G3 domain remains poorly understood. In this study, we carefully compared the detailed biochemical activities of ABP29 (a new member of this family that contains the G1-G2 domains of lily ABP135) and ABP135G1-G3 (which contains the G1-G3 domains of lily ABP135). In the presence of high Ca2+ levels in vitro (200 and 10 μM), ABP135G1-G3 exhibited greater actin severing and/or depolymerization and nucleating activities than ABP29, and these proteins had similar actin capping activities. However, in the presence of low levels of Ca2+ (41 nM), ABP135G1-G3 had a weaker capping activity than ABP29. In addition, ABP29 inhibited F-actin depolymerization, as shown by dilution-mediated depolymerization assay, differing from the typical superfamily proteins. In contrast, ABP135G1-G3 accelerated F-actin depolymerization. All of these results demonstrate that the G3 domain plays specific roles in regulating the activities of the lily villin/gelsolin/fragmin superfamily proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2176500907,"This study investigated the relationship between host efflux system of the non-vertebrate nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) strain virulence. This is the first comprehensive effort to profile host-transporters within the context of Bcc infection. With this aim, two different toxicity tests were performed: a slow killing assay that monitors mortality of the host by intestinal colonization and a fast killing assay that assesses production of toxins. A Virulence Ranking scheme was defined, that expressed the toxicity of the Bcc panel members, based on the percentage of surviving worms. According to this ranking the 18 Bcc strains were divided in 4 distinct groups. Only the Cystic Fibrosis isolated strains possessed profound nematode killing ability to accumulate in worms' intestines. For the transporter analysis a complete set of isogenic nematode single Multidrug Resistance associated Protein (MRP) efflux mutants and a number of efflux inhibitors were interrogated in the host toxicity assays. The Bcc pathogenicity profile of the 7 isogenic C. elegans MRP knock-out strains functionality was classified in two distinct groups. Disabling host transporters enhanced nematode mortality more than 50% in 5 out of 7 mutants when compared to wild type. In particular mrp-2 was the most susceptible phenotype with increased mortality for 13 out 18 Bcc strains, whereas mrp-3 and mrp-4 knock-outs had lower mortality rates, suggesting a different role in toxin-substrate recognition. The use of MRP efflux inhibitors in the assays resulted in substantially increased (>40% on average) mortality of wild-type worms."
https://openalex.org/W2180490057,"We previously showed that galectin-9 suppresses degranulation of mast cells through protein-glycan interaction with IgE. To elucidate the mechanism of the interaction in detail, we focused on identification and structural analysis of IgE glycans responsible for the galectin-9-induced suppression using mouse monoclonal IgE (TIB-141). TIB-141 in combination with the antigen induced degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells, which was almost completely inhibited by human and mouse galectin-9. Sequential digestion of TIB-141 with lysyl endopeptidase and trypsin resulted in the identification of a glycopeptide (H-Lys13-Try3; 48 amino acid residues) with a single N-linked oligosaccharide near the N terminus capable of neutralizing the effect of galectin-9 and another glycopeptide with two N-linked oligosaccharides (H-Lys13-Try1; 16 amino acid residues) having lower activity. Enzymatic elimination of the oligosaccharide chain from H-Lys13-Try3 and H-Lys13-Try1 completely abolished the activity. Removal of the C-terminal 38 amino acid residues of H-Lys13-Try3 with glutamyl endopeptidase, however, also resulted in loss of the activity. We determined the structures of N-linked oligosaccharides of H-Lys13-Try1. The galectin-9-binding fraction of pyridylaminated oligosaccharides contained asialo- and monosialylated bi/tri-antennary complex type oligosaccharides with a core fucose residue. The structures of the oligosaccharides were consistent with the sugar-binding specificity of galectin-9, whereas the nonbinding fraction contained monosialylated and disialylated biantennary complex type oligosaccharides with a core fucose residue. Although the oligosaccharides linked to H-Lys13-Try3 could not be fully characterized, these results indicate the possibility that cooperative binding of oligosaccharide and neighboring polypeptide structures of TIB-141 to galectin-9 affects the overall affinity and specificity of the IgE-lectin interaction."
