https://openalex.org/W1935132610,"The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) has been identified and characterized based on the acquisition of high affinity vesamicol binding and proton-dependent, vesamicol-sensitive acetylcholine accumulation by a fibroblast cell line transfected with a clone from a rat pheochromocytoma cDNA library encoding this protein. The distribution of VAChT mRNA coincides with that reported for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme required for acetylcholine biosynthesis, in the peripheral and central cholinergic nervous systems. A human VAChT cDNA was used to localize the VAChT gene to chromosome 10q11.2, which is also the location of the ChAT gene. The entire sequence of the human VAChT cDNA is contained uninterrupted within the first intron of the ChAT gene locus. Transcription of VAChT and ChAT mRNA from the same or contiguous promoters within a single regulatory locus provides a previously undescribed genetic mechanism for coordinate regulation of two proteins whose expression is required to establish a mammalian neuronal phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1554644961,"The view that the two isoforms of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (cyclooxygenase), PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, mediate physiologic and inflammatory processes, respectively, implies separate pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism with different benefits to the host. Functional segregation of these steps in endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism in a single cell in response to different stimuli is now demonstrated. When mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells developed in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-containing medium were cultured with c-kit ligand in combination with IL-10 and IL-1 beta, transient expression of PGHS-2 mRNA and protein occurred in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, accompanied by substantial release of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) into the culture medium from 2 to 10 h. In contrast, induction of PGHS-2 did not mediate an increase in PGD2 generation in response to stimulation with IgE and antigen. After a longer period of culture, from 24 to 48 h, the expression of PGHS-1 increased, as did the increase in IgE/antigen-dependent generation of PGD2. Dexamethasone, which inhibited the induction of PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1, and a PGHS-2-selective inhibitor suppressed cytokine-induced PGD2 generation but not IgE-dependent PGD2 generation. Thus, at a time when both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are present in bone marrow-derived mast cells, they function independently by coupling to different stimulus-initiated pathways to PGD2 generation from endogenously derived arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1520928812,"The beta-subunits of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) are important regulators of G-protein alpha-subunits as well as of certain signal transduction receptors and effectors. We have identified a fifth member of the G-protein beta-subunit family, G beta 5, by molecular cloning. Sequence analysis of recombinant clones revealed an open reading frame of 1,059 base pairs, potentially encoding a protein of 353 amino acids having 53% identity to previously identified G beta-subunit proteins. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-selected mRNA prepared from different mouse tissues demonstrated that G beta 5 is predominantly expressed in adult brain as two transcripts of 2.3 and 1.75 kilobases. A G beta 5-specific antiserum detected a band of 39.3 kilodaltons on immunoblots of crude membrane proteins isolated from normal mouse brain but not from other tissues. Using a transient cotransfection assay, we showed that a plasmid construct expressing the G beta 5 open reading frame, when coexpressed with different G-protein gamma (G gamma)-subunits, can stimulate the activity of the beta 2 isoform of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC beta 2). The stimulation of PLC beta 2 was most pronounced when G beta 5 was co-expressed with G gamma 2, although activation was observed when G beta 5 was cotransfected with either G gamma 1, G gamma 3, G gamma 5, or G gamma cone. These results prove that G beta 5 can functionally associate with G gamma proteins and is therefore a bona fide member of the G beta protein family. The rather low level of identity between G beta 5 and the other mammalian G beta-subunits may shed light on structural/sequence elements necessary for G beta protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1588131283,"Given the amino acid composition of a protein, how may one predict its folding type? Although around this problem a number of methods have been proposed, none of them has taken into account the correlative effect among different amino acids, and hence the accuracy of prediction could not be improved to the extent that it should have. In view of this, a new method has been developed in which the similarity between two protein molecules is based on the scale of Mahalanobis distance rather than on the ordinary intuitive geometric distances, such as Minkowski's distance and Euclidian distance. By introducing the Mahalanobis distance, the correlative effect among different amino acids can be automatically incorporated. Predictions have been performed for 131 real proteins consisting of alpha, beta, alpha+beta, and alpha/beta proteins. The results indicate that the rates of correct prediction for both alpha and beta proteins are 100%, and those for alpha+beta and alpha/beta are 88.9 and 89.7%, respectively, with an average accuracy of 94.7%. Predictions have also been performed for 10,000 simulated proteins generated by Monte Carlo sampling for each of the above four folding types, yielding an average accuracy of 95.9%. The accuracy thus obtained for the simulated proteins can avoid the bias due to the limited number of testing proteins selected arbitrarily by different investigators and hence can be regarded as an objective accuracy. It is anticipated that a method with such a high objective accuracy should become a reliable tool in predicting the protein folding type and a useful tool for improving the prediction of secondary structure as well."
https://openalex.org/W1601928222,"Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is the biosynthetic enzyme of acetylcholine. In mammalian tissues, it is encoded by multiple mRNAs with different 5‘-ends. This diversity results from the alternative usage of three promoters and from differential splicing events. Here, we show that the first intron of the rat ChAT gene contains an open reading frame that encodes a potential vesicular acetylcholine transporter based on the following criteria. (i) The encoded protein is structurally similar to transporter proteins, the highest identity being found with the vesicular acetylcholine transporters from Torpedo and Caenorhabditis elegans (77 and 56%, respectively, in 352 amino acids). (ii) The corresponding mRNAs exhibit a cholinergic expression profile. Amplification experiments with spinal cord cDNA revealed that at least three mRNAs encode this transporter. Two contain the same 5‘ non-coding region as two ChAT mRNAs and, therefore, are derived from the ChAT transcription unit by alternative splicing. The third mRNA may be transcribed from an additional internal promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2153084851,"Monocytes and macrophages can modulate the turnover of extracellular matrix by producing metalloproteinases such as interstitial collagenase and 92-kDa gelatinase as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. To study mechanisms of metalloproteinase induction in human mononuclear phagocytes, the effects of direct cell-cell contact between activated T lymphocytes and the human monocytic cell line THP-1 were determined. T cells were first activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin for 24 h, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and then exposed to THP-1 cells for 48 h. Upon contact with fixed activated T lymphocytes, a massive induction in the expression of both proteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases was observed, whereas unstimulated T cells had no effect. Stimulation of metalloproteinase biosynthesis by THP-1 cells was mimicked by a membrane preparation derived from activated T cell lines, whereas cytosol and nuclear fractions of the T cells were ineffective. Furthermore, activated T lymphocytes exposed to trypsin, tunicamycin, or cycloheximide lost the capacity to stimulate THP-1 cells upon subsequent contact, implying the involvement of cell-surface glycoproteins. Similar induction of metalloproteinases by direct contact with activated T cells was also observed using normal blood monocytes as the target cells, and stimulation of monocyte metalloproteinases by T cell contact occurs at a pretranslational level. Consequently, cell-cell contact may represent an important biological mechanism for potentiating the inflammatory response that leads to extracellular matrix destruction."

NMR spectroscopy indicates that both polysaccharides have a tetrasaccharide repeat unit in which the separate residues differ only in the extent and position of their sulfate substitution. The sea urchin fucan has the structure, [formula: see text] This type of regular structure has not previously been described, and is in contrast with the random arrangement of substituents on the similar 1-->3-linked alpha-L-fucopyranose backbone of the fucoidans from brown algae."
https://openalex.org/W1576319682,"Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) has various biological effects upon different cells, i.e. induces increased motility and proliferation as well as invasiveness and morphogenesis. The signals given to epithelial cells by SF/HGF are all mediated through the Met receptor tyrosine kinase (Weidner, K. M., Sachs, M., and Birchmeier, W. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 111, 145-154) suggesting that signal diversity is due to the interplay of different downstream pathways. It has also been shown that SF/HGF activates the protooncogene product Ras, i.e. stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange. In order to examine whether Ras is involved in mediating the dissociation and motility signal of SF/HGF to epithelial cells, we have expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells the dominant-negative N17Ras under the control of a modified metallothionein promoter. Induced expression of N17Ras by the addition of Zn2+ clearly prevented dissociation of the cells by SF/HGF. These data indicate that the Ras pathway is indeed essential to mediate the motility signal of SF/HGF-Met to the cell-cell adhesion system and the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1657755666,"Apolipoprotein (apo) B is an obligatory component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In the rare autosomal recessive disorder abetalipoproteinemia (ABL), no triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are secreted. Mutations in the gene encoding the 97-kDa subunit of a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) cause ABL (Sharp, D., Blinderman, L., Combs, K. A., Klenzle, B., Ricci, B., Wager-Smith, K., Gil, C. M., Turck, C. W., Bouma, M. E., Rader, D. J., Aggerbeck, L. P., Gregg, R. E., Gordon, D. A., and Wetterau, J. R. (1993) Nature 365, 65-69; Shoulders, C. C., Brett, D. J., Bayliss, J. D., Narcisi, T. M., Jarmuz, A., Grantham, T. T., Leoni, P. R. D., Bhattacharya, S., Pease, R. J., Cullen, P. M., Levi, S., Byfield, P. G. H., Purkiss, P., and Scott, J. (1993) Hum. Mol. Genet. 2, 2109-2116). Here we have examined whether MTP is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from cells that do not normally express either of these proteins. Carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of apoB, apoB17, and apoB41 on the centile system were expressed in COS-1 cells. ApoB17 was secreted whereas apoB41 was unable to traverse the secretory pathway. Cotransfection of apoB41 and MTP promoted the secretion of apoB41 as a buoyant lipoprotein particle with a modal density of 1.15 g/ml. When cotransfected COS-1 cells were cultured under conditions that increase the secretion of apoB100 from HepG2 cells, secretion of apoB41 was similarly increased. N-Acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), a calpain I inhibitor, abolished intracellular degradation of apoB41 and increased secretion 2.5-fold. Oleate, a substrate for triglyceride synthesis, reduced degradation from 50 to 19% and increased secretion by 2.5-fold. The effects of ALLN and oleate were additive. We conclude that the secretion of apoB from COS-1 cells cotransfected with apoB and MTP is determined by the competitive processes of lipoprotein assembly and intracellular degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum and that MTP is the only tissue-specific component, other than apoB, required for the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1540079092,"Previous studies demonstrated that the intraperitoneal injection of epidermal growth factor (EGF) into mice resulted in the appearance, within minutes, of several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in liver nuclei. Two of these proteins have been identified as the transcription factors p91/p84 (Stat1 alpha/1 beta) (Ruff-Jamison, S., Chen, K., and Cohen, S. (1993) Science 261, 1733-1736). We have now identified, by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, an additional EGF-modulated transcription factor, Stat3. We find that Stat3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and present in mouse liver nuclei following either EGF or lipopolysaccharide administration. Gel shift analyses show that Stat3 is capable of specifically binding the SIE (a DNA sequence present in the c-fos promoter). Three active SIE binding complexes (SIF A, B, and C) exist in the nucleus after the administration of EGF: one complex that contains Stat3, one that contains Stat1, and a third complex that appears to contain both proteins. Only one active SIE binding complex, containing Stat3, was detected after the administration of lipopolysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1564614506,"Arachidonate metabolism by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) coincides with the translocation of the enzyme from a soluble to a pelletable fraction in thoroughly disrupted granulocytic cells. While immunoelectron microscopy has identified the nuclear membrane as the site at which 5-LO, as well as 5-LO activating protein (FLAP), are localized in activated cells, the locale of soluble 5-LO in unstimulated cells could not be established by this technique. We asked whether the nucleus might also be the site for soluble 5-LO in unstimulated cells, and utilized rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells as model granulocytic cells to address this question. Using three different techniques to disrupt cells while leaving nuclei intact (mild nitrogen cavitation, Dounce homogenization, and detergent lysis), immunoblot analysis indicated abundant 5-LO in isolated nuclei. Within purified nuclei, 5-LO existed in two pools: a soluble pool that was readily released upon nuclear disruption and a bound pool that was not removed by 300 mM NaCl treatment. In all cases, 5-LO was also found in cytosolic and non-nuclear membrane fractions. Indirect immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of abundant 5-LO within the nucleus with minimal extranuclear signal in most cells. However, a minority of cells, characterized by condensed chromatin, showed no nuclear-associated staining with increased cytoplasmic staining for 5-LO. This suggested that some of the cytosolic 5-LO found by cell fractionation resulted from these dividing cells. When the contribution from dividing cells was minimized, either by overnight serum deprivation or by isolating cytoplasts of nucleus-containing cells, 5-LO was prominent in the nuclear fraction but negligible in the cytosolic fraction. In contrast to this distribution in RBL cells, 5-LO in unstimulated human neutrophils was predominantly cytosolic, by both immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. In both RBL cells and human neutrophils, FLAP was localized at the nuclear membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. These data provide the first evidence for the localization of 5-LO in unstimulated granulocytic cells. The finding that a substantial proportion of enzyme is localized within the nucleus of unstimulated RBL cells suggests potentially novel roles for 5-LO or its products within the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1485182117,"Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects that overlap with IL-6. To determine if IL-11 is produced by epithelial cells, we determined whether human alveolar A549 cells and airway 9HTE cells produce IL-11. We also determined whether retinoic acid (RA) altered this IL-11 production. Unstimulated cells produced low levels of IL-11, while IL-1, transforming growth factor (TGF-beta 1), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) stimulated IL-11 protein production and mRNA accumulation in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. IL-1 and TGF-beta 1 also interacted in a synergistic, and presumedly transcriptional, fashion since they augmented A549 cell IL-11 protein production and mRNA accumulation without altering IL-11 mRNA half-life. In contrast, IL-4 only weakly stimulated, and IL-7, hepatocyte growth factor, and herpes simplex virus Type 2 did not stimulate, IL-11 production. RA did not alter the IL-11 production of unstimulated or RSV infected cells. It did, however, inhibit rIL-1-stimulated and synergistically augment TGF-beta-stimulated IL-11 production. Thus, IL-1, TGF-beta, and RSV stimulate epithelial-like cell IL-11 production, and RA regulates these inductive processes in a stimulus-specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1598432083,"The Escherichia coli GreA and GreB proteins induce cleavage of 3' fragments from nascent transcripts in halted transcription complexes. We have overproduced and purified the GreA protein and tested how it affects initiation, pausing, and termination by E. coli RNA polymerase. Recombinant GreA induced cleavage of two to three nucleotide fragments in two promoter-proximal complexes, whereas an apparently endogenous cleavage removed a single larger fragment. Both types of cleavage stopped once the transcript was shortened to approximately 10 nucleotides. However, during initiation, GreA induced cleavage of transcripts as short as four nucleotides, inhibiting their release as abortive products and stimulating both productive initiation and primer-shifting at a weak promoter. GreA induced repetitive cleavage over a long distance in complexes containing a long G-less nascent transcript. However, reverse translocation was inhibited in transcription complexes that contained a G-rich, C-less nascent transcript. Substituting IMP for GMP in the transcript relieved inhibition. Finally, GreA had little effect on transcription through the his and trp leader pause sites or on termination at nine different p-independent terminators. We propose that transcript cleavage and reverse translocation are controlled in part by backsliding of the nascent transcript through an RNA-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1564113586,"Potent active-site inhibitors of human tissue factor-Factor VIIa (TF.FVIIa) have been selected from Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein precursor inhibitor (APPI) Kunitz domain libraries displayed on phage. Eight randomized positions on the extended primary binding loop (P5 through P4') and positions 34 and 39 were examined in three separate libraries. Libraries contained from 3.2 x 10(5) to 3.2 x 10(6) potential variants resulting from replacing up to 5 positions with all 20 amino acids. Following 4 rounds of selection against FVIIa associated with immobilized tissue factor (TF), 12 clones from each library were sequenced. Variants were purified by trypsin affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized for their ability to inhibit TF.FVIIa chromogenic activity. Measured apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki*) ranged from about 10 to 500 nM. From sequence and activity data, an overall consensus sequence, TF7I-C, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. TF7I-C differed from APPI at 4 key residues, T11P, M17L, S19L, and G39Y, and inhibited TF.FVIIa with a Ki* = 1.9 +/- 0.4 nM, which represented an increase in binding affinity of more than 150-fold compared to APPI. At 40 microM, TF7I-C prolonged the clotting times 3.5-fold in a prothrombin time assay and > 10-fold at 7 microM in an activated partial thromboplastin time assay. Prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time correlates with potent inhibition of FXIa (Ki* = 0.8 nM) and plasma kallikrein (Ki* = 1.2 nM). TF7I-C also inhibited plasmin (Ki* = 40 nM) and FXa (Ki* = 55 nM), but not activated protein C, thrombin, or FXIIa (Ki* > 10 microM each)."
https://openalex.org/W1489222126,"The polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and drug ligands for the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) have been shown to regulate cholesterol transport, the rate-determining step in steroidogenesis, in hormone-responsive steroidogenic cells including the MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The present study was designed to characterize the role of DBI and PBR in the R2C rat Leydig tumor constitutive steroid-producing cell model. Both DBI and PBR were present in R2C cells. R2C cell treatment with a cholesterol-linked phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to DBI, but not sense, resulted in the reduction of DBI levels and a concomitant dramatic decrease of the amount of progesterone produced. These observations strongly suggested that DBI was important in maintaining constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells. Radioligand binding assays revealed the presence of a single class of PBR binding sites with an affinity 10 times higher (Kd approximately 0.5 nM) than that displayed by the MA-10 PBR (Kd approximately 5 nM). Photolabeling of R2C and MA-10 cell mitochondria with the photoactivatable PBR ligand [3H]1-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3- isoquinolinecarboxamide showed that the M(r) 18,000 PBR protein was specifically labeled. This indicates that the R2C cells express a PBR protein which has properties similar to the MA-10 PBR. Chemical crosslinking studies of purified metabolically radiolabeled DBI to mitochondria provided direct evidence that DBI specifically binds to the M(r) 18,000 PBR protein. Moreover, DBI and a PBR synthetic ligand were able to increase steroid production in isolated R2C cell mitochondria which express the 5 nM affinity receptor. However, mitochondrial PBR binding was increased by 6-fold upon addition of the post-mitochondrial fraction, suggesting that a cytosolic factor modulates the binding properties of PBR in R2C cells and is responsible for the 0.5 nM affinity receptor seen in intact cells. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that DBI plays a key role in maintaining R2C constitutive steroidogenesis by binding to the mitochondrial higher affinity PBR which promotes a continuous supply of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial side chain cleavage cytochrome P450."
https://openalex.org/W1501624911,"Potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) contains 39 amino acids and three disulfides. Reduced and denatured PCI refolds spontaneously in vitro to regain its native structure. The folding pathway of a recombinant form of this protein has been elucidated by structural analysis and stop/go folding experiments of both acid and iodoacetate-trapped intermediates. The results reveal that folding of PCI proceeds through an initial stage of nonspecific disulfide formation (packing), followed by disulfide reshuffling (consolidation) of partially packed intermediates to acquire the native structure. The process of nonspecific packing involves a sequential flow of fully reduced PCI through 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates and leads to the formation of scrambled 3-disulfide species. All three classes of intermediates are highly heterogeneous. Disulfide reshuffling occurs at the final stage which refines and consolidates the scrambled species to acquire the native conformation. The efficiencies of disulfide formation and disulfide reshuffling can be selectively regulated by redox potential. Disulfide formation is promoted by cystine or oxidized glutathione, whereas disulfide reshuffling requires free thiols, such as cysteine, reduced glutathione, or beta-mercaptoethanol. Consolidation of scrambled species to form the native PCI represents the major rate-limiting step. When folding of PCI was carried out in the presence of cystine (2 mM) alone, more than 98% of the intermediates accumulate as the scrambled species after 1 min of folding. Furthermore, denaturant (5 M GdmCl or 8 M urea) mainly disrupts the final stage of PCI folding and exerts no apparent influence on the early stage of nonspecific packing. The compositions of 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates, according to their high performance liquid chromatography patterns, remain indistinguishable regardless of whether folding is performed in the absence or presence of denaturant."
https://openalex.org/W1577440671,"beta-Amyloid, the principal component of senile plaques in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, is derived from larger integral membrane glycoproteins, termed amyloid precursor proteins (APP). APP is a member of a family of proteins that includes the amyloid precursor-like proteins APLP1 and APLP2. The present study examines the metabolism of mouse APLP2 in cultured mammalian cells. We report that in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary and transiently transfected African green monkey kidney (COS-1) cells, APLP2 is modified by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) addition. The sensitivity of GAG-modified APLP2 to digestion with chondroitinase AC indicates that chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains are the preponderant GAG on APLP2. CS GAG modification of APLP2 occurs in a region with little homology to APP. Contained within this heterologous region is a predicted CS modification site, ENEGSGMAEQ (APLP2 residues 610-619); APLP2 polypeptides harboring a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 614 fail to undergo CS GAG modification. Our observation that APLP2 is modified by a pathway distinct from APP suggests that the two molecules may be functionally divergent."
https://openalex.org/W1508895516,"Region I of the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP; also called CC10) promoter contains at least three functional factor binding sites, an upstream HNF-3 site and a downstream overlapping AP-1/HNF-3 site (Sawaya, P.L., Stripp, B. R., Whitsett, J.A., and Luse, D. S. Mol. Cell. Biol. (1993) 13, 3860-3871). Fragments containing -320/+58 of the rat CCSP promoter were mutagenized to eliminate one or two factor binding sites in region I, cloned into a luciferase reporter cassette, and assayed for activity by transfection into cultured lung (H441) cells. We found that the HNF-3 sites alone can account for the activity of region I in H441 cells. The activity of the two HNF-3 sites is synergistic; this effect depends on the presence of an upstream factor binding site. We had shown previously that H441 cells contain exclusively the HNF-3 alpha form of HNF-3, whereas HeLa cells have essentially no HNF-3. Co-transfection of an HNF-3 alpha expression plasmid with a CCSP reporter containing four copies of region I in HeLa cells stimulated CCSP activity 4-fold, whereas co-expression of HNF-3 beta inhibited activity 8-fold. HNF-3 beta was also inhibitory to region I expression in H441 cells, but to a lesser extent than in HeLa cells, presumably because of the high levels of HNF-3 alpha already present in H441 cells. We have thus identified a gene regulatory element through which two members of the HNF-3 transcription factor family, HNF-3 alpha and HNF-3 beta, exert opposite effects."
https://openalex.org/W1486876329,"Active-site inhibitors of the human tissue factor-Factor VIIa complex (TF.FVIIa) that are both potent and specific have been selected from Alzheimer's amyloid beta-protein precursor inhibitor (APPI) Kunitz domain libraries using a strategy termed competitive phage selection. Phage display Libraries I-III, previously sorted by direct selection, were sorted by competitive selection against immobilized TF.FVIIa in which increasing amounts of Factor XIa (FXIa) were added to the selection buffer to remove phage with high affinity for FXIa. The most striking difference in the selected Kunitz domain sequences was at the P4' position where Lys was highly preferred instead of Leu which was found here by direct selection (Dennis, M. S., and Lazarus, R. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22129-22136). In addition, both Lys and Arg were selected in the P1 position as opposed to Arg alone. A new library (Library IV) was constructed which contained all previously observed amino acids at 9 positions in the primary and secondary binding loops of APPI. Comparable results were obtained by sorting Library IV against immobilized TF.FVIIa in the presence of either FXIa alone or FXIa, plasma kallikrein, and plasmin. The Kunitz domains obtained by either competitive selection strategy potently inhibited TF.FVIIa, with Ki* values ranging from about 2 to 20 nM; the Ki* values were generally > 1 microM for FXIa and plasma kallikrein and ranged from 4 to 200 nM for plasmin. Variants selective for TF.FVIIa were assayed for free FVIIa and FXa inhibitory activity and characterized in coagulation assays. A rationale for the selection of Lys at both the P4' and P1 positions based upon comparison of sequences and structures of relevant serine proteases and inhibitors is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1527921831,"The neutrophil respiratory burst oxidase consists of both the plasma membrane-associated flavocytochrome b558 and cytosolic regulatory proteins including p47-phox, p67-phox, and a small GTP-binding protein (Rac1 and/or Rac2). Oxidase activation is thought to result from the assembly of the cytosolic components on the cytochrome. A model has been proposed in which p47-phox binds directly to the cytochrome, while p67-phox binding occurs indirectly by binding to p47-phox. We have carried out a steady state kinetic analysis using a cell-free semirecombinant activation system (isolated plasma membrane plus recombinant cytosolic factors) to analyze the effects of p47-phox and p67-phox on one another's association in the active oxidase complex. As predicted from the model, increasing p47-phox concentration markedly lowered the EC50 for p67-phox, indicating that p67-phox is dependent upon p47-phox for binding. Unexpectedly, increasing p67-phox concentration also produced a significant enhancement of p47-phox binding. Thus, a more complex binding model must be invoked in which p47-phox and p67-phox mutually enhance one another's binding."
https://openalex.org/W1596654413,"An exopolyphosphatase (polyphosphate phosphohydrolase; EC 3.6.1.11) activity that cleaves inorganic polyphosphates to orthophosphate has been purified to apparent homogeneity (> 95% pure) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The exopolyphosphatase is a monomeric protein with a polypeptide molecular mass of 28 kDa. The enzyme, which can be stabilized in the presence of Triton X-100, has a pH optimum of 7.5 and requires, for maximal activity, Co2+ or Mg2+ ions. In the absence of these ions, the exopolyphosphatase binds to polyphosphate but does not degrade it, allowing affinity purification of the enzyme on a polyphosphate-modified zirconia support. o-Vanadate, Cu2+, and Ca2+ are effective inhibitors of the exopolyphosphatase. The enzyme preferentially hydrolyzes linear polyphosphates in a non-processive manner; pyrophosphate as well as cyclic tri- and tetrametaphosphate are degraded only at very low rates, whereas ATP is not split by the exopolyphosphatase. The only product formed by the action of the enzyme is orthophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1537461545,"To characterize NH4+ transport in the renal medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), cell pH was monitored with the use of 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein in suspensions of rat MTAL tubules in CO2-free media. Abrupt exposure to NH4Cl led to initial cell alkalinization (NH3 entry) followed by cell acidification due to NH4+ influx. The latter had 1 microM amiloride- and barium-sensitive components; the barium effect was unchanged when K+ conductances were completely blocked by quinidine, as assessed with the use of the cell membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine. NH4+ entry-induced depolarization was abolished by 1 microM amiloride, but it was unaffected by barium. In NH(4+)-free media, barium, verapamil, and raising of the extracellular K+ concentration alkalinized MTAL cells; imposing an outward directed K+ gradient in Na(+)-free medium induced cellular acidification, which was abolished by barium and verapamil but not by other K+ channel and Na+/H+ antiport inhibitors (quinidine and 2 mM amiloride). As measured with a K(+)-selective extracellular electrode, a component of K+ efflux (in presence of furosemide, ouabain, and quinidine) was stimulated by decreasing the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 7.0 and inhibited by barium and verapamil. It was also demonstrated that the K+/H+ antiporter transports NH4+ better than H+ at physiological NH4+ and H+ concentrations. These results demonstrate the presence in MTAL cells of two novel NH4+ transport pathways, amiloride-sensitive NH4+ conductance and barium- and verapamil-sensitive K+/NH4+(H+) antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1516369138,"Chlorophyll a accumulated when chlorophyllide b was incubated with isolated cucumber etioplasts in the dark. When [14C]chlorophyllide b was used as the substrate for chlorophyll synthesis, [14C]chlorophyll a was formed, showing that chlorophyll a was synthesized from the exogenously added chlorophyllide b, not by light-independent reduction of endogenous protochlorophyllide. The reaction studied showed an optimal pH of 7.5 and required both the soluble and membrane fractions of etioplasts together with ATP. Time course experiments showed that chlorophyll a began to accumulate later than chlorophyll b. Chlorophyllide b esterified with geranylgeraniol accumulated first, but there was little accumulation of chlorophyll a with an unhydrogenated prenyl side chain. No chlorophyllide a was detected during incubation. These observations indicate that esterified chlorophyll b was converted to chlorophyll a. This conversion would play an important role in the use of chlorophyll b for the synthesis of chlorophyll a in the reconstruction of photosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1540955234,"A 30-kDa proteolytic fragment from the gelatin/collagen-binding domain of fibronectin is a potent inhibitor of fibronectin binding to Candida albicans, with a molar inhibition constant equal to that of intact fibronectin. Recombinant and proteolytic fragments from the cell-, the fibrin I-, and the heparin II-binding domains also inhibit fibronectin binding, but are 13-1000-fold less active. In suspension, binding of fibronectin to C. albicans is regulated by growth conditions and is specific, saturable, time-dependent, reversible, and divalent cation-independent. Scatchard plot analyses indicate the presence of high affinity (Kd = 1.3 x 10(-9) M) and low affinity (Kd = 1.2 x 10(-7) M) receptors. Recombinant or proteolytic fragments from four binding domains of fibronectin promote adhesion of C. albicans. A recombinant fragment corresponding to the cell-binding domain but with the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser deleted promotes C. albicans adhesion and inhibits fibronectin binding to C. albicans with the same activity as the natural sequence. Furthermore, four peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp-Val sequence and the peptides CS-1 and Arg-Glu-Asp-Val did not block the binding of fibronectin to C. albicans. Thus, in contrast to the specific binding of soluble fibronectin, recognition of immobilized fibronectin by C. albicans is mediated by several domains of the protein. Interactions with the cell-binding domain are not mediated by the Arg-Gly-Asp or other known recognition sequences as it has been suggested. Binding of fibronectin also did not correlate with C3d binding to the avirulent clones of C. albicans strain H12 or with iC3b binding to variants of the strain 4918."
https://openalex.org/W1606579380,"Initiation of chromosome replication occurs excessively in the dnaAcos mutant at 30 degrees C. DnaAcos protein was purified from an overproducing strain and found to be as active as wild-type DnaA protein in initial synthesis rates of minichromosome replication in vitro at 30 degrees C. However, whereas efficient initiation occurred for only 20 min with wild-type DnaA protein, it continued for 45 min with DnaAcos protein, an indication that DnaAcos protein retained initiation activity for a longer time than wild-type DnaA protein. Also, whereas wild-type DnaA protein is inactivated by ADP binding, DnaAcos protein failed to be inactivated by ADP due to its inability to bind nucleotide. Thus, DnaAcos protein appears to lack negative regulation for its initiation activity. At 42 degrees C, a temperature at which initiation of chromosome replication is normal in the dnaAcos mutant, in vitro DnaAcos protein activity decreased to 25% of that observed at 30 degrees C. This coincident occurrence of normal initiation in vivo and reduced activity is consistent with the idea that negative control of DnaA protein activity is necessary for normal replication."
https://openalex.org/W1515480883,"The acid-induced reversible unfolding of several forms of the mitochondrial isoenzyme of mammalian aspartate aminotransferase, including its precursor form, has been characterized under equilibrium conditions. A minimum of two transitions can be detected for the holoenzyme (pyridoxal form). One transition takes place at pH 3.6 and corresponds to the monomerization of the dimeric protein. The second transition is centered at pH 3.3 and represents the disappearance of much of the tertiary and secondary structures. The presequence peptide in the precursor protein does not affect the equilibria nor the rate of unfolding in the pH range from 7.5 to 2.0. The presence of the cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, stabilizes the protein against acid denaturation. At pH 2.0, the protein retains significant amounts of secondary structure (26% alpha-helix, 20% beta-structure). Increasing the ionic strength at pH 2.0 results in significant changes in the secondary structure of the unfolded protein that acquires some of the characteristics ascribed to a compact molten globule. According to the circular dichroism spectra these changes are characterized by an increase in beta-structure, although Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicates that this increase in beta-structure is due mostly to the formation of intermolecular beta-sheet as a consequence of protein aggregation. The formation of high molecular weight aggregates has been confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Following neutralization of the acid-unfolded state at low ionic strength both mature and precursor proteins refold to their native active state (> 80% yield). By contrast the compact state present at pH 2.0 and high ionic strength is unable to recover its activity following neutralization. Thus, this compact state does not appear to represent an intermediate in the folding pathway of the protein, but rather a dead end product of aggregation, which may reflect the intrinsic tendencies of the unfolded protein to oligomerize at intracellular salt concentrations unless controlled by factors such as chaperones present in the cellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W1491897518,"Abstract The formation of 11-cis-[3H]retinal in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and its release to extracellular medium containing interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) were studied in the RPE eyecup of the toad (Bufo marinus). The RPE was labeled with all-trans-[3H]retinol during an initial 1-h incubation. In phase 2 of the incubation (0-2 h), the extracellular medium contained initially ligand-free IRBP (0-26 microM). Retinoids subsequently extracted from the extracellular medium and RPE were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and scintillation counting. IRBP increased both the molar amount and specific radioactivity of 11-cis-retinal released by the RPE during phase 2. The molar amount of 11-cis-retinal in the RPE was small relative to that of retinal released with high IRBP. With 21 microM IRBP and phase 2 incubations of > or = 10 min, the specific radioactivity of released 11-cis-retinal exceeded that of all-trans-retinyl ester in the RPE. The specific radioactivity of 11-cis-retinyl ester was less than that of all-trans-ester, independent of IRBP concentration. The results indicate that IRBP promotes the formation (from all-trans-precursor) as well as the release of 11-cis-retinal and suggest the preferred utilization of recently incorporated and esterified all-trans-retinol in 11-cis-retinal synthesis in a last in/first out manner."
https://openalex.org/W1606125297,"The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), is expressed in definite spatiotemporal patterns during development. To identify factors that may influence place-dependent n-cam gene expression, we have studied the binding and activation of the n-cam promoter by Pax-8, a member of the Pax family of transcription factors. Pax-8 increased n-cam promoter activity 13.4-fold in cellular co-transfection experiments, and a short segment of the promoter (-143 to -15) mediated the response. This region of the n-cam promoter produced a DNA-protein complex when incubated with either extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with the Pax-8 expression vector or a Pax-8/GST fusion protein. Pax-8 bound to the n-cam promoter through two TGCTCC motifs (designated PBS-1 and PBS-2) that resemble paired domain binding sites. Mutation of PBS-1 and PBS-2 eliminated Pax-8 activation of the n-cam promoter. Transfection of N2A neuroblastoma cells with the Pax-8 expression vector resulted in a 5-fold increase in the transcription of the endogenous n-cam gene. The combined results suggest that Pax-8 activates transcription of the n-cam gene through binding of sequences resembling paired domain binding sites in the n-cam promoter. The data raise the possibility that the n-cam promoter may be regulated by other members of the Pax gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1514054515,"The early increase in luminal membrane Na+ permeability by aldosterone in Na(+)-reabsorbing epithelia is attributed to an increase in the open probability (and number) of preexisting amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. Carboxyl methylation reactions are involved, but the mechanism of action is unknown. We report that the 90-95-kDa polypeptide subunit of a purified renal Na+ channel protein can be specifically carboxymethylated and that this biochemical reaction, in the presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, leads directly to an increase in channel activity. Further, we show that protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation can synergistically activate these channels. We suggest that renal Na+ channels have multiple biochemical regulatory inputs and that post-translational modifications underlie the increases in luminal membrane Na+ channel activity produced by aldosterone and vasopressin in Na(+)-reabsorbing epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1482321525,"Efficient folding of carboxypeptidase Y is dependent on the presence of the proregion. Thus, denatured procarboxypeptidase Y, in contrast to the mature enzyme, refolds efficiently in vitro in low ionic strength buffers. Under these conditions denatured mature carboxypeptidase Y forms an inactive, soluble folding intermediate, which has been characterized in the present study. The inactive intermediate can be folded into the active enzyme at a low efficiency (5-10%) by the addition of 0.9 M ammonium sulfate. The refolding is accompanied by pronounced structural changes. As seen for other protease zymogens the isolated proregion from carboxypeptidase Y was found to stimulate refolding without covalent linkage to the mature part. However, the added proregion does not form a stable complex with the native enzyme and requires the presence of 0.9 M ammonium sulfate to exhibit its function. The proregion increases the yield of correctly folded enzyme, and kinetic analysis suggests that this is due to a reduction of the rate of nonproductive folding or aggregation. In addition, the proregion stabilizes carboxypeptidase Y toward thermoinactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1598138899,"Sclerotization of insect cuticle is an extremely important biochemical process for the successful survival of most insects. N-Acetyldopamine and N-beta-alanyldopamine are two widely used sclerotizing precursors. N-Acetyldopamine is converted by phenoloxidase, quinone isomerase, and quinone methide isomerase to generate the reactive intermediates quinone, quinone methide, and quinone methide imine amide for use in quinone tanning, quinone methide sclerotization, and alpha,beta-sclerotization, respectively. N-beta-Alanyldopamine has been claimed to be used only by phenoloxidase and quinone isomerase for quinone tanning and quinone methide sclerotization thereby attributing biochemical diversity to the coloration and strength of different cuticles. However, we demonstrate here that cuticular enzymes isolated from the larvae of Calliphora possess the capacity to generate 1,2-dehydro-N-beta-alanyldopamine from N-beta-alanyldopamine. Chemical synthesis of 1,2-dehydro-N-beta-alanyldopamine and its further oxidation are reported for the first time. Comparative biochemical studies confirm that both the sclerotizing precursors, N-acetyldopamine and N-beta-alanyldopamine, are used by all three different mechanisms of the unified theory of sclerotization."
https://openalex.org/W1962733560,"Analysis by the circular permutation assay of the human epsilon-globin gene region revealed that the DNA bend sites were located every 682.5 +/- 132.0 base pairs on average, separating the region into domains. Among 10 major and 1 minor bend sites mapped in the region, the transcription initiation and termination sites of the epsilon-globin gene were located close to the bend sites, and the first and the second exons of the epsilon-globin gene were separated from the third exon by another site. The bend sites were also located anterior to the two Alu family sequences. Short poly(dA).poly(dT) tracts typical for DNA bending were not always present in the sites. Fine mapping of a bend site having no poly(dA).poly(dT) tracts with concatenated oligonucleotides and analysis by S1 nuclease nicking assay indicated that the unusual structure, a base slippage or a partial triplex DNA structure, formed by a polypurine.polypyrimidine sequence in the region is the basis of bending. The bend sites were mapped in the promoter region (within approximately 300 base pairs from the cap site) of the human beta-globin and in c-myc and erythropoietin receptor genes, as well as in the mouse beta maj-globin gene. The conservation and the periodicity of the bend sites in the noncoding region suggest the active role of the sites that is a signal for nucleosome phasing."
https://openalex.org/W1550109103,"The cRel-RelA and NF-kappa B (p50-RelA) transcription factors bind to a kappa B-like sequence termed Rel-related proteins binding element localized in the regulatory region of the human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) gene. This sequence is highly conserved in murine and porcine uPA genes where it retained the ability to associate with cRel-RelA. On the other hand, NF-kappa B binding was obtained with the human and porcine elements only. Methylation interference analysis showed that NF-kappa B and cRel-RelA had identical interference patterns. Mutational analysis showed that DNA binding was highly sensitive to mutations within the decameric Rel-related proteins binding element core site. However, alterations of nucleotides flanking the decameric IgK-kappa B motif, which preferentially associated with NF-kappa B, resulted in high affinity cRel-RelA binding both in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate that NF-kappa B and cRel-RelA have overlapping but distinct DNA sequence specificities. Bandshift analysis with HeLa and Jurkat cell extracts or with in vitro translated proteins revealed that the SV40-, HIV-1-, and interleukin-2 receptor alpha subunit kappa B elements efficiently associated with cRel-RelA, suggesting that this heterodimer may be involved in the regulation of several genes. Cotransfection studies of HIV-1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter DNA with RelA, cRel, and p50 expression vectors were performed in COS7 and U293 cells to analyze the ability of cRel-RelA to regulate HIV-1 enhancer activity. In vivo formation of the cRel-RelA complex resulted in specific stimulation of the viral enhancer at a level comparable with that obtained with NF-kappa B. These data suggest that activation of cellular cRel-RelA may play a critical role in the regulation of HIV-1 enhancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W1528375303,"In vitro translation studies indicate that the beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) light chain influences the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds in class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules during their biosynthesis. We now have examined the influence of beta 2-m on class I MHC intrachain disulfide bond formation in vivo. Using beta 2-m+ and beta 2-m- derivatives of a cell line transfected with the mouse H-2Ld gene, we show that all of the H-2Ld molecules from beta 2-m+ cells have both the alpha 2 and alpha 3 intrachain disulfide bonds, whereas about 50% of the H-2Ld molecules from beta 2-m- cells have only one of these bonds. All of the free H-2Ld heavy chains from beta 2-m+ cells can undergo a peptide-induced conformational change and can bind exogenous peptide and beta 2-m stably in vitro. Only those H-2Ld molecules from beta 2-m- cells, which have both intrachain disulfide bonds, undergo a peptide- and beta 2-m-induced conformational change in vitro. These H-2Ld molecules do not bind beta 2-m and peptide stably in vitro. From these results emerges a greater understanding of the role of beta 2-m at the time of class I MHC molecule synthesis: beta 2-m promotes intrachain disulfide bond formation in the class I MHC molecule and additionally affects class I MHC structure to render it competent to form stable trimolecular complexes with peptide and beta 2-m."
https://openalex.org/W1549920025,"Uracil DNA N-glycosylase (UDG) has been used as a model enzyme to test a novel universal approach to discriminate between two possible enzymatic mechanisms of specific site location in DNA, processive (DNA-scanning mechanism) and distributive (random diffusion-mediated mechanism). Two double-stranded concatemeric polynucleotides of defined length (440-480 nucleotides) containing deoxyuridine at either every 10th or 20th nucleotide in the DNA chain were prepared by the ligation of self-complementary 10- or 20-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Incubation of these polynucleotides with Escherichia coli UDG, followed by thermal breakage of the abasic sites, formed fragments that were multiples of either the 10- or the 20-mer. Since the processive and distributive mechanisms of uracil removal by UDG would be very different, the fragment distribution, generated at each time interval during the UDG reaction, should be unique. To show this, we developed a computer model illustrating both possible mechanisms of UDG functioning. The distribution of DNA fragments experimentally generated during the time course of the UDG reaction was compared with the results of the computer programs that modeled the distributive and processive mechanisms. The data indicated that uracil removal, catalyzed by UDG, is consistent with a distributive model."

N., Wang, D., Chan, C. L., and Landick, R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22282-22294, accompanying report). During transcript elongation, the sizes of the DNA footprint and the single-stranded transcription bubble vary markedly among transcription complexes halted at different template positions. To test whether transcription complex intermediates formed during transcript cleavage-induced reverse translocation also display heterogeneous conformations at different template positions, we examined the structures of two different transcription complexes before and after GreA treatment. Transcription complexes halted at position +16 after initiation at the T7 A1 promoter or paused at the trpL pause site exhibited strong blocks to transcript cleavage after removal of 6 to 10 nucleotides. In both cases, the down-stream contact between RNA polymerase and DNA moved little during transcript cleavage, thereby increasing its distance from the active site, whereas the upstream DNA contact and the borders of the transcription bubble moved in approximate register with the transcript 3'-end. The backward movements of halted E. coli RNA polymerase are similar to a recently postulated model for discontinuous translocation during transcription, but differ from those reported for arrested RNA polymerase II transcription complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1488258975,"All known tRNAs have a universal CCA sequence at the 3'-terminal. To study the role of this terminal sequence in the aminoacylation process, base substitutions were introduced into a transcript of Escherichia coli valine tRNA and the effects on the aminoacylation activity with valyl-tRNA synthetase were evaluated. Substitution of the terminal adenosine residue at position 76 by C or U caused a 5-7-fold decrease of valine charging activity in Vmax/Km, while substitution by G resulted in about a 300-fold decrease. In addition, these mutations gave rise to an appreciable level of misaminoacylation with threonine. ATP hydrolysis activity during threonylation was lower in the terminal adenosine mutants than in the wild-type. Mutations introduced at positions 75 and 74 also caused threonylation instead of reducing valylation, albeit to a much smaller extent. These results indicate that the CCA sequence, especially the base portion of the terminal adenosine residue, plays an important role not only in amino-acylation efficiency with valine but also in preventing misaminoacylation by hydrolyzing misactivated threonyl-tRNA(Val)."
https://openalex.org/W1891515826,"In resting DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) was higher than the free Ca2+ concentration in the nucleus ([Ca2+]n). However, this nucleocytosolic [Ca2+] gradient was reversed by Ca2+ agonists like ATP or, as is shown here, by the epidermal growth factor (EGF). The ATP-induced reversal of the nucleocytosolic [Ca2+] gradient was blocked by stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or with the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor R59949, or by inhibition of the Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatases-1 and -2A with okadaic acid or calyculin A. Moreover, the magnitude of the ATP-induced reversal of the [Ca2+] gradient diminished during prolonged culture of the cells. The EGF-induced [Ca2+] rise in the cytosol and nucleus was blocked by okadaic acid and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and psi-tectorigenin. Our data suggest that the nucleocytosolic [Ca2+] gradient is modulated by (de)phosphorylation processes catalyzed by tyrosine protein kinases, by protein kinase C, and by Ser/Thr protein phosphatases-1 and -2A.— Himpens, B., De Smedt, H., Bollen, M.

https://openalex.org/W1575721437,"A dialyzed whole human reticulocyte (beta-thalassemic) lysate was incubated with human 125I-alpha globin at 37 degrees C for 15 min in a medium supporting proteolysis with ATP and added ubiquitin (Ub). Analysis of this reaction mixture by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that approximately 0.5% of the initial 125I-alpha globin substrate radioactivity (125I cpm) was in the conjugate (Ub1-alpha), of one Ub monomer with one 125I-alpha globin monomer and substantially less in the Ub2-alpha conjugate. When the reaction mixture contained 0.5 microM ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal) to inhibit endogenous isopeptidases, there was a 7-9-fold increase in the Ub1-alpha and Ub2-alpha conjugates and an appearance of higher molecular weight species including polyubiquitinated 125I-alpha globin (Ub > 10-alpha). Purified fractions of Ub1-alpha, Ub2-alpha, Ub3,4-alpha, and Ub > 10-alpha conjugates were isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE, dialyzed and treated with triethylamine to remove SDS, and dissolved in 10 mM HCOO-(Na+),pH 4.0. Incubation of each of the conjugate fractions with Ubal-treated lysate in a proteolysis reaction mixture showed a progressive increase in the initial rate of degradation (conversion to acid-soluble 125I cpm) with increase in molar amount of Ub from approximately 3 times that of the unconjugated 125I-alpha globin precursor for Ub1-alpha to approximately 6 times for Ub > 10-alpha. Analytical SDS-PAGE of the Ub1-alpha mixture also showed a rapid conversion to higher M(r) conjugates. These results suggest that monoubiquitinated alpha globin, in addition to higher M(r) conjugates, is an intermediate in the ATP-dependent proteolysis of alpha globin. The finding that addition of Ubal enhances the amount of these conjugates suggests that isopeptidase activity contributes to the poor turnover of hemoglobin alpha chains observed in intact beta-thalassemic reticulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1544669502,"In human immunodeficiency virus, RNA selection and packaging during assembly involve the two retroviral-type fingers of the nucleocapsid protein that are held in a constrained configuration by coordinated zinc ions. In this report, we demonstrate that the nucleocapsid protein in a metal bound state is resistant to cleavage by the viral protease, but upon removal of zinc ions by chelating agents, it is hydrolyzed within the first zinc finger between Phe-16 and Asn-17. However, 3-nitrosobenzamide and cupric ions, which release zinc through oxidation of the cysteine residues of the finger, render the nucleocapsid protein resistant to cleavage. Since protease inhibitors and 3-nitrosobenzamide restrict processes relating to steps early in infection, the cleavage of the nucleocapsid protein may represent an essential event that can be exploited for the design of novel antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W1666121479,"The lipophosphoglycan (LPG)-like glycoconjugate expressed on the cell surface of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes was isolated, purified, and partially characterized. The glycoconjugate migrated as a homogeneous band (42 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectral analysis of the native molecule indicated the presence of two major components whose molecular masses were about 18.4 and 22.5 kDa. The LPG could be metabolically labeled with [3H]galactose, [3H]mannose, [14C]glucose, or [3H]palmitic acid. Monosaccharide compositional analysis of the LPG indicated that galactose, glucosamine, and sialic acid predominate over mannose, galactosamine, and inositol. A peptide associated with the LPG molecule contained about 40 amino acid residues per inositol and had threonine as the predominant amino acid. The LPG showed strong binding to Ricinus communis agglutinin-1 and Tritium vulgare wheat germ agglutinin, indicating the presence of terminal beta 1,4-linked galactosyl residue(s) and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. Lectin binding studies also suggested the presence of a terminal beta-galactose and GlcNAc in the glycan-inositol lipid core of LPG. Virtually all of the sialic acids appeared to be located in the saccharide portion of the molecule. Treatment of the LPG with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C liberated an alkylacylglycerol. Structural analysis of the alkylacylglycerol and its acidic methanolysis products by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry indicated that the glycerol substituents were primarily the C16 1-alkyl group and C16 2-acyl group. The ratio of inositol to 1-O-alkyl-2-O-acylglycerol was 1:1. Treatment of the glycoconjugate with nitrous acid released a major phospholipid product that migrated close to the phosphatidylinositol standard on thin layer chromatography. This result implied that phosphatidylinositol was glycosidically linked to the nonacetylated amino sugar. Furthermore, the LPG was found to contain phosphate and was labile to mild acid hydrolysis, strongly suggesting that the intact molecule is related to Leishmania LPG. The most striking and unique feature of T. cruzi LPG is the presence of large amounts of glucosamine and sialic acid as well as galactosamine. These results indicate that the glycoconjugate expressed on the T. cruzi cell surface is a new type of LPG-like molecule anchored on the cell surface via an alkylacylphosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W1520620678,"In an effort to prepare crystals and determine the structure of alpha-thrombin complexed to a synthetic peptide inhibitor (MDL-28050) of the hirudin 54-65 COOH-terminal region, it was discovered that the crystals were not those of the complex but of gamma-thrombin. Gel electrophoresis studies revealed that autolytic degradation had occurred prior to crystallization. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of these autolytic fragments confirmed the gamma-thrombin product (cleavages at Arg75-Tyr76 and/or Arg77A-Asn78, and Lys149E-Gly150; chymotrypsinogen numbering) with a minor amount of another autolysis product, beta-thrombin (first two cleavages only). The final structure has an R-factor of 0.156 for 7.0-2.5-A data, and includes 186 water molecules. A comparison of gamma-thrombin with the thrombin structure in the alpha-thrombin-hirugen complex revealed that the two structures agreed well (r.m.s. delta = 0.39 A for main chain atoms). These structures possess uninhibited active sites where the disposition of the catalytic triad residues is nearly identical. The electron density in the vicinity of the gamma-thrombin cleavage regions is poor, and only becomes well-defined several residues prior to and after the actual cleavage sites. The extensive disorder evoked by beta-cleavage(s) in the Lys70-Glu80 loop region indicates that this part of the molecule is severely disrupted by autolysis and is the reason exosite functions are dramatically impaired in beta-and gamma-thrombin. Since autolysis did not lead to a major reorganization of the folded structure of alpha-thrombin, the likely structural features of the interaction of thrombin substrate with thrombin enzyme during beta-cleavage have been modeled by docking the exosite region of one molecule at the active site of another."

To examine the effect of a ribozyme insertion in another nuclear genome, the Tetrahymena IVS was introduced into the analogous position in a cloned Schizosaccharomyces pombe ribosomal gene, and the mutant rDNA was expressed in vivo. RNA analyses indicated that mature 5.8 S rRNA was not formed from the mutant gene transcript and the amount of 27 S nRNA was significantly reduced. In contrast, hybridization analyses indicated that RNA splicing continued, and normal forms of free ribozyme were present. The results show that the IVS sequence can interfere with rRNA processing and suggest that the unusual amplification of a single rDNA repeat may have forced Tetrahymena to accommodate its ribozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1563764217,"To understand the roles of metal ions on the catalytic properties and thermostability of the thermostable beta-galactosidase of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, a thermophilic actinomycete, we have investigated the binding kinetics and requirements of divalent metal ions by equilibrium dialysis, titration, and metal ion buffer techniques. We found that the monomeric multimetal enzyme (M(r) 136,977) had eight specific binding sites for divalent metal ions. These sites were classified as follows: a very tight (class I) site for Ca2+, three tight (class II) sites consisting of two Ca(2+)-specific sites (class IICa) and one Mn(2+)-specific site (class IIMn; Kd for Mn2+, 2.0 nM), and four loose (class III) sites for Mn2+ (Kd, 1.2 microM) and Mg2+ (Kd, 2 microM). Removal of metal ions bound to class II and III sites of the holoenzyme (Ca3Mn5 species; relative Vmax (Vrel), 100%) by a chelating resin at 4 degrees C yielded a less thermostable Ca1 species (Vrel, 1.7%) with a class I Ca2+ ion, removal of which by a chelating resin at 50 degrees C caused a complete irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Titration studies revealed that stoichiometric binding of Mn2+ to a class IIMn site of the Ca1 species caused a 33-fold activation whereas binding of Ca2+ to class IICa sites had no effect on enzyme activity. Ca1 species could be also activated 8-fold by heating at 60 degrees C for 20 min, suggesting that the catalytically important class II Mn2+ plays important roles in maintaining the native structure essential for activity. Occupation of class III sites by Mg2+ or Mn2+ was of physiological importance to attain sufficient thermostability by which this extracellular beta-galactosidase remained active for a prolonged time at elevated temperatures as was observed during growth of S. rectivirgula."

In addition to these, types I and II TNFR-related species of M(r) > 100,000 were detected after purification by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-affinity chromatography, suggesting that TNF had driven receptor aggregation during this step. To test this hypothesis ligand blots were performed on receptor preparations that had been partially purified by gel filtration chromatography and incubated with TNF before electrophoretic separation. Indeed, type II TNFR aggregates, but not type I TNFR aggregates, were generated at optimal TNF concentrations. Formation of type II TNFR aggregates in this last experimental setting and of both type I and type II TNFR aggregates during affinity purification could be prevented if an alkylating agent (N-ethylmaleimide) was added during the TNFR-TNF incubation step. Similar results were obtained when intact K562 cells were incubated with TNF and then analyzed for receptor aggregation; type II TNF receptor aggregates were generated at TNF concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-10) M and their formation was prevented in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide."
https://openalex.org/W24747223,"We have studied recently the surface hydrophobic properties of several calmodulin (CaM) target enzymes and found that a certain amphipathic domain(s) of the enzyme was exposed in response to a H+ increase within the neutral pH range. The exposed domain appeared to be related to their CaM-binding domains and associated with their activation by CaM (Huang, S., Carlson, G. M., and Cheung, W. Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 7631-7638). In this paper, the involvement of H+ in the activation of calcineurin (CaN), one of the CaM target enzymes, was further studied. Using dansylated CaM to monitor its conformational change, we found that the binding of Ca2+ to CaM occurred at a lower range of Ca2+ concentrations (pCa from 7 to 6) than the formation of CaM.CaN complex (pCa from 6 to 5). However, addition of H+ within the neutral pH range shifted the formation of CaM.CaN complex to the lower range of Ca2+ concentrations. Similarly, the addition of H+ shifted the Ca2+ requirement for enzyme activation to a lower Ca2+ range. These results show that the interaction of CaM with CaN could be initiated either by Ca2+ or by H+ in the presence of suboptimal Ca2+, suggesting a positive cooperative effect between Ca2+ and H+. The CaM-stimulated activity of CaN was accompanied by a time-dependent autoinactivation. Kinetic analysis showed that the autoinactivation initiated by Ca2+ or by H+ was biphasic and that the decay rate constants were comparable. In heavy water (D2O), the Ca(2+)-induced formation of CaM.CaN complex as well as the activity of CaN were decreased, indicating a solvent deuterium isotope effect. The same solvent isotope effect was observed in the H(+)-induced formation of CaM.CaN complex and in the H(+)-induced enzyme activity. When the enzyme was rendered CaM-independent by limited proteolysis, the isotope effect was abolished, suggesting that H+ was involved in the CaM-dependent and not the CaM-independent activity. Collectively, these data suggest that the interaction of CaM with CaN depends on the two cations: Ca2+ exposes an amphipathic domain on CaM, and H+ exposes the CaM-binding domain on the target enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1594866681,"Monoclonal antibodies that recognize skeletal muscle dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel subunits were used to identify similar proteins in neuronal and small cell carcinoma cell lines. alpha 1-related proteins were detected by FACS analysis on the surface of human neuroblastoma (IMR 32) and small cell carcinoma (DMS 273 and DMS 114) cell lines. alpha 1-like polypeptides from these cells were isolated and partially characterized. The polypeptides exhibit an M(r) similar to that of the L-type channel alpha 1 subunit and are recognized by two distinct anti-alpha 1 mAbs. The data provide biochemical evidence for structural similarities between the alpha 1 subunit of small cell carcinoma and neuronal cell lines. Similarly, an alpha 2-like protein was characterized from these cells. Because alpha 2 is a subunit shared by many subtypes of calcium channels, these data suggest that subunits other than the pore-forming alpha 1 subunit may play an important role in the etiology of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. We demonstrate directly that small cell carcinoma and a cell line derived from peripheral neurons share L-type calcium channel-related proteins and a protein common to many voltage-gated calcium channel subtypes. These data support a model that proposes that cross-reactivity of anti-tumor cell antibodies with presynaptic elements, possibly calcium channels, plays a role in the development of Lambert-Eaton syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1522083180,"alpha 1-Antitrypsin is a major plasma proteinase inhibitor whose primary function is to control the proteolytic activity of neutrophil elastase that hydrolyzes structural proteins. This protein, in rabbit is expressed as three isoforms designated as F, S-1, and S-2. An inducible form of this protein has been cloned from an acute-phase cDNA library of rabbit liver. Structural study has revealed that the cloned cDNA is the S-2 isoform previously identified by partial peptide sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence of the reactive center of the S-2 form is not conserved and thus can be categorized as of unorthodox type. mRNA analysis has indicated that the transcription of the S-2 isoform which is normally present at a very low concentration increases more than 100-fold under inflammatory conditions while the expression of the F and S-1 isoforms changes about 1.5-fold under similar conditions. The S-2 isoform is biologically active and capable of inhibiting both elastase and chymotrypsin. The high level of induction of this active isoform of alpha 1-antitrypsin under inflammatory conditions and its apparent resistance to oxidation-mediated inactivation, common to the orthodox forms of alpha 1-antitrypsin, make the S-2 isoform suitable for gene therapy in diseases associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1530413508,"Specific labeling of both the mature (mAspAT) and precursor (pmAspAT) forms of rat liver mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase with three different spectroscopic probes (monobromotrimethylammoniobimane, N-(iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide) was used to assess the possible conformational consequences of the interaction of a mitochondrial precursor protein with lipid membranes by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. The three probes react with the same cysteine residue causing a partial loss of catalytic activity whose extent depends on the nature of the probe introduced. The fluorescence intensity of the attached probes decreases upon addition of substrates or substrate analogues, indicating that the modified enzymes can undergo the open-closed conformational transitions that accompany catalysis. Both unmodified and labeled precursor proteins bind to negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, whereas the mature enzyme is unable to bind. Binding to liposomes does not affect the fluorescent properties of the attached probes. However, addition of the pseudosubstrate alpha-methylaspartate to liposome-bound precursor fails to induce the characteristic conformational changes observed with the protein free in solution. Furthermore, upon binding to liposomes the precursor protein loses enzymatic activity, and the reactive cysteine residue becomes inaccessible to reaction with thiol reagents. In contrast, the presence of liposomes has no effect on the activity, cysteine reactivity, or syncatalytic conformational transitions of the mature enzyme. It appears that interaction of pmAspAT with negatively charged phospholipids prevents the protein from undergoing the conformational transitions required for catalysis, freezing the enzyme in a sterically hindered but open-like conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1591476035,"Although RAG-1 and RAG-2 have been shown to be indispensible for V(D)J recombination, their exact role in this reaction remains unclear. Co-transfecting RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression vectors into NIH3T3 fibroblasts confers V(D)J recombination activity to these otherwise recombinationally inactive cells. In this report we have found that in transient transfections of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts with RAG-1 and RAG-2 and the appropriate recombination substrates, one RAG-1 expression vector, pRAG-1A, is capable of yielding both signal joints and coding joints, while another RAG-1 expression vector, pRAG-1B, yields only signal joints. The RAG-1 open reading frame for these two expression vectors is interchangeable, indicating that the inability to resolve coding joints is due to the 45-base pair difference found in the 5'-untranslated regions of these constructs. Differences in this region result in a 15-fold difference in gene expression when the luciferase coding region is substituted for the RAG-1 cDNA. This report provides evidence that RAG-1 may have a role in both the initiation of V(D)J recombination as well as the resolution of coding ends. The data also suggest that these RAG-1 activities may be dependent on different levels of RAG-1 expression."
