N-Glycans are the major form of mannoprotein modification and consist of a core structure, common to all eukaryotes, that is further elaborated in the Golgi to form the highly branched outer chain that is characteristic of fungi. In yeasts, outer chain branching is initiated by the action of the α1,6-mannosyltransferase Och1p; therefore, we disrupted the C. albicans OCH1 homolog to determine the importance of outer chain N-glycans on the host-fungal interaction. Loss of CaOCH1 resulted in a temperature-sensitive growth defect and cellular aggregation. Outer chain elongation of N-glycans was absent in the null mutant, demonstrated by the lack of the α1,6-linked polymannose backbone and the underglycosylation of N-acetylglucosaminidase. A null mutant lacking OCH1 was hypersensitive to a range of cell wall perturbing agents and had a constitutively activated cell wall integrity pathway. These mutants had near normal growth rates in vitro but were attenuated in virulence in a murine model of systemic infection. However, tissue burdens for the Caoch1Δ null mutant were similar to control strains with normal N-glycosylation, suggesting the host-fungal interaction was altered such that high burdens were tolerated. This demonstrates the importance of N-glycan outer chain epitopes to the host-fungal interaction and virulence.

Candida albicans is a commensal organism carried by a significant proportion of healthy individuals. It is the most common opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans causing superficial infections of the mucosa and in the immunocompromised host life-threatening systemic infections (1Pappas P.G.

The cell wall is the immediate point of contact between fungus and host and plays an important role in adherence, antigenicity, and the modulation of the host immune response (5Calderone R.

The study of glycosylation in C. albicans therefore has its own relevance in identifying the carbohydrate epitopes involved in pathogenesis. Cell surface mannoproteins contain both O- and N-linked oligosaccharides. The O-linked oligosaccharides, attached to serine or threonine, consist of a linear chain of one to five α1,2-linked mannose residues (12Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J. Odds F.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The process of N-glycosylation has been studied extensively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. N-Linked glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum with the transfer of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide precursor to the protein target (15Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 16Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide precursor is then processed by endoplasmic reticulum-resident glucosidases and a mannosidase to yield the mature triantennary Man8GlcNAc2 core (17Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Outer chain branching is initiated through the addition of a single α1,6-linked mannose residue to the Man8GlcNAc2 core by Och1p as the protein passes through the Golgi. Subsequently the α1,6-mannose backbone is extended by the sequential action of the mannan polymerase I and mannan polymerase II enzyme complexes. The linear α1,6-linked polymannose backbone is then branched by the action of further mannosyltransferases (18Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Munro S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These side chains in C. albicans consist of α1,2- and α1,3-linked mannose residues (20Kobayashi H. Shibata N. Osaka T. Miyagawa Y. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi H. Tanaka S. Suzuki J. Kiuchi Y. Shibata N. Suzuki S. Okawa Y. FEMS Microbiol.

Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The side chains and positions within the core are also modified by the addition of phosphomannan, consisting of a chain of β1,2-linked mannose residues attached via a phosphodiester bond (24Trinel P.A. Lepage G. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous studies in C. albicans have demonstrated the overall importance of glycosylation for cellular viability and virulence (25Nishikawa A. Poster J.B. Jigami Y. Dean N. J.

Analysis of the PMT and MNT gene families required for O-glycosylation has demonstrated its relative importance in the host-fungal interaction and virulence (12Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B.

Immun. 2005; 73: 4571-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phosphomannan has been implicated in the interaction with phagocytic leukocytes; however, deletion of MNN4, required for phosphomannan production, demonstrated that it was not required for macrophage interaction or virulence (32Hobson R.P. Munro C.A. Bates S. MacCallum D.M. Cutler J.E. Heinsbroek S.E. Brown G.D. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39628-39635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae OCH1 encodes the specific α1,6-mannosyltransferase that initiates outer chain branching through its action on the Man8GlcNAc2 core (33Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 34Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck A. Kopetzki E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ScOch1p is unusual among mannosyltransferases because it displays a narrow acceptor specificity requiring the whole Man8GlcNAc2 core for efficient recognition (34Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck A. Kopetzki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Nakayama K. Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Tanaka A. Haga-Toda Y. Jigami Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking the OCH1 gene in S. cerevisiae are viable but display temperature-sensitive growth (33Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The Scoch1Δ mutant has a severe N-glycosylation defect, with a complete loss of the α1,6-linked polymannose backbone. N-Glycans isolated from the Scoch1Δ mutant consist of only Man8–10GlcNAc2, where the Man8GlcNAc2 core is modified by the addition of α1,3-linked mannose residues to antennae of the core (35Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation och1Δ mutants have also been characterized for Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Pichia pastoris (37Yoko-o T. Tsukahara K. Watanabe T. Hata-Sugi N. Yoshimatsu K. Nagasu T. Jigami Y.

To assess the importance of outer chain N-glycosylation in virulence and host-fungal interactions, we disrupted the C. albicans OCH1 homolog. The Caoch1Δ null mutant had a severe defect in N-glycosylation, displaying loss of the α1,6-linked polymannose backbone, although the core was further modified by the addition of α1,2-mannose residues. The Caoch1Δ null mutant displayed cell wall defects and was attenuated in virulence in a murine model of systemic infection despite being able to colonize organs to almost wild type levels. This work demonstrates the importance of epitopes carried on branched outer chain N-glycans for the host-fungal interaction and for virulence. Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—The strains constructed and used in this work are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown at 30 °C in YEPD (2% (w/v) mycological peptone, 1% yeast extract (w/v), 2% glucose (w/v)) or SD (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 2% glucose) with uridine (50 μg/ml) as required. To repress expression of the tetracycline-regulatable promoter, doxycycline was added to the medium at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. To induce β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (HexNAcase), 3The abbreviations used are: HexNAcaseβ-N-acetylhexosaminidaseES-MSelectrospray-mass spectrometryMS/MStandem mass spectrometrycfucolony-forming unitsEndo Hendoglycosidase HMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase. activity strains were grown in SC + GlcNAc (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 0.077% complete supplement mixture, 25 mm N-acetylglucosamine). Hyphae were induced in 20% fetal calf serum, RPMI 1640, and Lee's medium, pH 6.5 (40Lee K.L. Buckley H.R. Campbell C.C. Sabouraudia. 1975; 13: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), at 37 °C or Spider medium (41Liu H. Kohler J. Fink G.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) at 30 °C. Strains were grown in NGY medium (0.1% neopeptone, 0.4% glucose, 0.1% yeast extract) at 30 °C prior to virulence testing. To disperse cellular aggregates, strains were grown in NGY medium containing 2 units/ml chitinase.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainParent strainGenotypeSourceCAI-4ura3Δ::imm434/ura3Δ::imm43442NGY152CAI-4As CAI-4 but RPS1/rps1Δ::CIp1044NGY202CAI-4As CAI-4 but OCH1/och1Δ::hisG-URA3-hisGThis studyNGY203NGY202As CAI-4 but OCH1/och1Δ::hisGThis studyNGY204NGY203As CAI-4 but och1Δ::hisG/och1Δ::hisG-URA3-hisGThis studyNGY205NGY204As CAI-4 but och1Δ::hisG/och1Δ::hisGThis studyNGY357NGY205As CAI-4 but och1Δ::hisG/och1Δ::hisG, RPS1/rps1Δ::CIp10This studyNGY358NGY205As CAI-4 but och1Δ::hisG/och1Δ::hisG, RPS1/rps1Δ::CIp10-OCH1This studyTHE1ura3Δ::imm434/ura3Δ::imm434 ade2Δ::hisG/ade2Δ::hisG ENO1/eno1::ENO1-tetR-ScHAP4AD-3xHA-ADE245NGY359THE1As THE1 but OCH1/och1Δ::dpl200-URA3-dpl200This studyNGY360NGY359As THE1 but OCH1/och1Δ::dpl200This studyNGY361NGY360As THE1 but och1Δ::dpl200/99t-OCH1-URA3This studyNGY355As CAI-4 but pmr1Δ::hisG/pmr1Δ::hisG, RPS1/rps1Δ::CIp1027 Open table in a new tab β-N-acetylhexosaminidase electrospray-mass spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry colony-forming units endoglycosidase H mitogen-activated protein kinase. Construction of Caoch1 Null Mutant, Re-integrant, and Conditional Mutant Strains—The CaOCH1 gene was disrupted by the ura-blaster method (42Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ regions of homology were amplified by PCR (5′ primer pair 5′-CTAGAGCTCATGCTACAACTAAGAGAACCCC-3′ and 5′-GATGATGATAGATCTCGATTTCGGCATGATTCTATAAGCTTTAGC-3′; the SacI and BglII restriction sites are underlined, respectively; 3′ primer pair 5′-CTACTAGTCGACCGATCTGGACTTGTAGTTGGT-3′ and 5′-GATGCATGCGGGTGTGTACACAAGGGGTT-3′; the SalI and SphI restriction sites are underlined, respectively) and cloned into the relevant sites in pMB-7. The ura-blaster cassette was released by digestion with SacI and SphI and was flanked by 505-bp upstream and 521-bp downstream sequences complementary to CaOCH1. CaOCH1 was disrupted in strain CAI-4 by sequential gene replacement and recycling of the URA3 marker by selection on SD plus 5-fluoroorotic acid (1 mg/ml) and uridine (50 μg/ml). The Ura– Caoch1Δ null mutant was transformed with the StuI-digested CIp10 plasmid so that URA3 was expressed from the neutral RPS1 locus (43Murad A.M. Lee P.R. Broadbent I.D. Barelle C.J. Brown A.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 325-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Brand A. MacCallum D.M. Brown A.J. Gow N.A. Odds F.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As a control, a re-integrant strain was also constructed in which a wild type copy of CaOCH1 was transformed into the null mutant. The CaOCH1 open reading frame plus 969 bp of its own promoter and 425 bp of its terminator sequences were amplified by PCR (primer pair 5′-CAGACTGTGGGCCCGATTTAATTTGGATTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-TAATGCGTGGTTCTCATGTC-3′), and the product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK). The plasmid insert was subcloned into the NotI site of CIp10. The resulting plasmid was then linearized with StuI before transformation into the Caoch1Δ null mutant. A conditional mutant was also constructed in which CaOCH1 was placed under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter (45Nakayama H. Mio T. Nagahashi S. Kokado M. Arisawa M. Aoki Y. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6712-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in strain THE1 that expresses the tetracycline transactivator (a fusion protein of Escherichia coli TetR and the activation domain of S. cerevisiae HAP4). The first allele of CaOCH1 was disrupted by means of the URA3 recyclable PCR-directed gene disruption system (46Wilson R.B. Davis D. Enloe B.M. Mitchell A.P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The recyclable URA3 cassette was amplified from pDDB57 (primer pair 5′-GAAACAGACACGAGACCTTTACTATAACTGATACTTTTGTTTCCATTTTCTTTTCCAATTATTGGGAATAAATATTTCATGTGAAATTGTGAGCGGATA-3′ and 5′-GGTAATTTAGTTTACAAAATCGGTTATAAATAGAAAATATGTGCATTTAAATATATATGGGTGTGTACTCAAGGGGTTAGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTT-3′; the region of homology to pDDB57 is underlined) and transformed into THE1 to generate a heterozygous strain. The URA3 marker was then recycled by selection on SD plus 5-fluoroorotic acid (1 mg/ml) and uridine (50 μg/ml). The promoter replacement cassette was produced by a modification of the published system in order to utilize PCR-directed targeting. The URA3-TR promoter cassette was amplified from p99-CAU1 (primer pair 5′-GAAACAGACACGAGACCTTTACTATAACTGATACTTTTGTTTCCATTTTCTTTTCCAATTATTGGGAATAAATATTTCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and 5′-TATGACTACTATTCCTAAAACGGCTAGTTTTAGATGTTTATGAACCATTTGGGGTTCTCTTAGTTGTAGCATGGGGTCTAGTTTTCTGAGATAAAGCTG-3′; the region of homology to p99CAU1 is underlined) and transformed into the heterozygous mutant in the THE1 strain background. Mannosyltransferase Activity Assay—Mixed membrane fractions were prepared from exponentially growing cells as described previously (47Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5732-5739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mannosyltransferase activity assays, 200 μg of mixed membrane protein preparation was incubated for 1 h at 30°C in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.6% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin, GDP-[14C]mannose (956 Bq, specific activity 296 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 0.06 mm Man8GlcNAc2 (Oligomannose-8D1D3, Dextra Laboratories, Reading, UK) as the acceptor. Assays were carried out in triplicate, and unincorporated GDP-mannose was removed by passage through 0.6 ml of QAE-Sephadex. Neutral products were eluted with water, and radioactivity was counted. Specific activities were calculated and expressed as nanomoles transferred/mg/min. Labeling of Glycans and TLC—For the analysis of acid-labile and O-linked glycans, the strains were labeled with d-[2-3H]mannose. Cells growing in 2 ml of SC + GlcNAc were incubated with 1.85 MBq of d-[2-3H]mannose (555 GBq mmol–1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were then collected and washed twice with water before O-linked glycans were released by β-elimination with 100 mm NaOH for 24 h at room temperature. Cells were then pelleted, and the supernatant containing O-glycans was retained for TLC analysis. The cells were washed twice in water and then boiled in 10 mm HCl for 1 h to release acid-labile glycans. The remaining cellular material was pelleted, and the supernatant was retained for TLC analysis. For TLC the samples were spotted and dried onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Whatman). The plates were eluted twice in the solvent (3:4:2.5:4 ethyl acetate/butan-1-ol/acetic acid/water). For detection of labeled carbohydrates, the plates were sprayed with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and visualized by autofluorography (Kodak BioMax XLS). In Situ N-Acetylglucosaminidase Activity Staining—Strains were grown for 16 h in SC + GlcNAc to induce HexNAcase expression. Cells were washed and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then disrupted with glass beads in a FastPrep machine (Qbiogene, Cambridge, UK). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 21,500 × g for 10 min. For endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment, the native sample was treated with 25 milliunits of Endo H (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Samples were mixed with native loading dye (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 15% glycerol) and run on a 3–8% Tris acetate-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 150 V under nondenaturing conditions. The gel was washed in 0.1 m citrate/KOH buffer, pH 4, for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated in the substrate solution (0.18 mm naphthyl-GlcNAc (Glycosynth Ltd., Warrington, UK) in 0.1 m citrate/KOH buffer, pH 4) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally the reaction was visualized by incubation in the substrate solution plus 0.7 mm Fast Blue at 60 °C until the color developed. Cell Wall Analysis and Sensitivity Testing—Alcian blue binding was assayed essentially as described previously (27Bates S. MacCallum D.M. Bertram G. Munro C.A. Hughes H.B. Buurman E.T. Brown A.J.

A suspension of ∼1 × 107 stationary phase yeast cells was washed and resuspended in 1 ml of 30 μg/ml Alcian blue in 0.02 m HCl. Cells were incubated in Alcian blue at room temperature for 10 min and then spun down, and the A620 of the supernatant was determined. Alcian blue concentration was calculated by reference to a standard curve. From these data the level of Alcian blue bound to cells was determined (μg of Alcian blue bound per A600 unit of cell suspension). Cell wall carbohydrate composition was analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography as described previously (48Munro C.A. Whitton R.K. Hughes H.B. Rella M. Selvaggini S. Gow N.A.

Strains were tested for sensitivity to cell wall stressing agents by microdilution testing as described previously (27Bates S. MacCallum D.M. Bertram G. Munro C.A. Hughes H.B. Buurman E.T. Brown A.J.

The cells were washed with water and resuspended at an A600 = 1. These cells were then inoculated into YEPD at an A600 = 0.01 and 95 μl dispensed into 96-well plates. Cell wall stressing agents were added in a 5-μl volume across a range of doubling dilutions. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h, and the A600 was determined. The agents tested were as follows: Calcofluor White (100 μg/ml), Congo Red (100 μg/ml), SDS (0.1%), hygromycin B (500 μg/ml), NaCl2 (1 m), KCl (1 m), caffeine (50 mm), vanadate (80 mm), and tunicamycin (100 μg/ml). The concentrations listed are the maximum concentration tested for each agent. Preparation of Total N-Glycan—Total N-linked glycans were released from cell walls by enzymatic digest with peptide-N-glycosidase F. Cell walls were prepared by a method modified from de Groot et al. (50de Groot P.W. de Boer A.D. Cunningham J. Dekker H.L. de Jong L. Hellingwerf K.J. de Koster C. Klis F.M. Eukaryotic Cell. 2004; 3: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cells from a stationary phase culture (100 ml) were washed three times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to a total volume of 5 ml, and disrupted by three passes through a French press at 15.5 MPa. Cell walls were washed extensively in 1 m NaCl followed by water and extracted twice with 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, at 100 °C for 5 min to remove noncovalently bound proteins. SDS-extracted cell walls were then washed extensively in water. Phosphodiester-linked glycans were removed from the cell wall preparations by mild hydrolysis with 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 10 min. The cell walls were washed three times with water, resuspended in 250 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min to denature cell wall proteins. The suspension was adjusted to 2.5 ml of 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, and N-glycans were released by treatment with 3750 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) at 37 °C and shaken for 16 h (51Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Cell wall material was pelleted, and the supernatants containing N-glycans were retained and adjusted to pH 8.8 with 1 m NaOH. Phosphate groups present on the N-glycans were removed by treatment with 400 units of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 16 h. SDS was removed by precipitation with potassium acetate (final concentration 20 mm) overnight on ice, and Triton X-100 was removed by extensive extraction with toluene (52Atrih A. Richardson J.M. Prescott A.R. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 865-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The N-glycans were desalted on columns of 2.5 ml of AG-50-H+ over 1 ml AG-4 OH–, eluted fully in water, and lyophilized. The N-glycans were further desalted by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P2 column (25 × 1.5 cm) and eluted with water at 12 ml h–1. Fractions were collected and glycans detected by spotting onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates and staining with orcinol. Fractions containing glycans were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in water. Methylation Linkage Analysis—Methylation linkage analysis was performed on N-glycans isolated from the wild type and Caoch1Δ null mutant. Glycans were converted to their component monosaccharides in the form of partially methylated alditol acetates and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on a Supelco SP2380 column as described previously (53Ferguson M.A.J Hooper N.W.

Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Permethylated N-Glycans—Samples of permethylated glycans in 80% acetonitrile containing 0.5 mm sodium acetate were loaded into nanospray tips (Micromass type F) for ES-MS and ES-MS/MS. Samples were analyzed in positive ion mode with capillary and cone voltages of 0.9 kV and 40 V using a Micromass Q-ToF2 orthogonal quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK).

In later years, it was shown that cancer cells exhibit multiple alterations in mitochondrial content, structure, function, and activity. We have stably overexpressed the Friedreich ataxia-associated protein frataxin in several colon cancer cell lines. These cells have increased oxidative metabolism, as shown by concurrent increases in aconitase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular respiration, and ATP content. Consistent with Warburg's hypothesis, we found that frataxin-overexpressing cells also have decreased growth rates and increased population doubling times, show inhibited colony formation capacity in soft agar assays, and exhibit a reduced capacity for tumor formation when injected into nude mice. Furthermore, overexpression of frataxin leads to an increased phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, as well as decreased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Taken together, these results support the view that an increase in oxidative metabolism induced by mitochondrial frataxin may inhibit cancer growth in mammals.

Furthermore, disruption of the frataxin homologue in yeast has been shown to cause increased sensitivity to oxidants and promote oxidative damage to both nuclear (17Karthikeyan G. Lewis L.K.

In parallel to these latter findings in rodents, we questioned whether frataxin might conversely suppress cancer growth when stably overexpressed in previously transformed cells. Here we show that cancer cells overexpressing frataxin have increased oxidative metabolism, decreased growth rates and population doubling times, show inhibited colony formation capacity in soft agar assays, and exhibit a reduced capacity for tumor formation when injected into nude mice, paralleled by increased phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p38 MAP kinase and decreased phosphorylation of ERK. Hence, increased oxidative metabolism may suppress malignant growth in mammals, and frataxin may function as a metabolically active mitochondrial tumor suppressor protein. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection of Colon Cancer Cells—Transfection experiments were performed as described previously (6Ristow M. Pfister M.F. Yee A.J. Schubert M. Michael L. Zhang C.Y. Ueki K.

Overexpression and detection of hemagglutinin-tagged human frataxin was performed as described previously (16Shoichet S.A. Bäumer A.T. Stamenkovic D. Sauer H. Pfeiffer A.F. Kahn C.R.

Metabolic and Enzymatic Assays—Aconitase activity was determined spectrometrically in mitochondria-enriched fractions as described previously (21Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gerard B. Rotig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) by monitoring the formation of NADPH at 340 nm. The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.4 mm NADP+, and 4 units of NADP+ isocitrate dehydrogenase for a final volume of 1 ml. An appropriate volume of cell extract was brought up to 150 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl and loaded into one well of a 96-well plate. To start the reaction, 150 μl of assay mixture were added, and the absorbance change at 340 nm was measured for 60 min at 37 °C. The aconitase activity was calculated from the slope of the linear portion. For subcellular fractionation,∼70 × 106 cells were scraped from the plates, suspended in 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of MSH buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm K+-Hepes, pH 7.5), homogenized on ice in a Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, sonicated, and treated with 0,1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After a further centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the mitochondria-enriched fraction (supernatant) was achieved, and aconitase activity was immediately measured.

Using standard calcium phosphate transfection techniques, we have stably overexpressed human frataxin carrying a hemagglutinin tag at the C terminus in different human colon carcinoma cell lines, including MIP101, DLD2, and HT29, as shown by immunoblotting against the hemagglutinin tag solely detecting the overexpressed protein (Fig. 1, A–C), as well as against amino acids corresponding to exon 4 of the frataxin gene, detecting both endogenously expressed as well as overexpressed human frataxin protein (Fig. 1, D–F). Although colon carcinoma cells completely lacked endogenous expression of frataxin (Fig. 1, D–F), it should be noted that non-transformed cell lines, including primary human fibroblasts, expressed detectable levels of endogenous frataxin (data not shown). To investigate whether overexpression of frataxin in cancer cells leads to metabolic alterations similar to those found in non-transformed fibroblasts subsequent to frataxin overexpression (6Ristow M. Pfister M.F. Yee A.J. Schubert M. Michael L. Zhang C.Y. Ueki K. Michael II, M.D. Lowell B.B. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consistent with previously published findings in frataxin-deficient states (9Rötig A. de Lonlay P. Chretien D. Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), overexpression of frataxin in colon carcinoma cells led to a significant increase in activity aconitase (Fig. 2A, p < 0.0000001) (DLD2, p < 0.005; HT29, p < 0.00005; data not shown), an enzyme that is dependent on Fe/S clusters (24Rouault T.A.

We therefore questioned whether overexpression of frataxin in colon carcinoma cells might alter ROS accumulation, which was not the case. Neither in the basal state (p = 0.423) (Fig. 2E, left pair of bars) nor after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (p = 0.150) (Figs. 2E, right pair of bars) were significant differences in intracellular ROS accumulation observed. Taken together, the findings so far suggest that colon carcinoma cell lines lack endogenous frataxin protein, and that overexpression of frataxin increases oxidative metabolism, whereas ROS accumulation remains unaffected by frataxin. These findings lend some support to recently published findings in frataxin knock-out mice questioning the link between frataxin deficiency and ROS accumulation (25Seznec H. Simon D. Bouton C. Reutenauer L. Hertzog A. Golik P. Procaccio V. Patel M. Drapier J.C. Koenig M. Puccio H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Following stable transfection with frataxin, colon carcinoma cells showed significantly reduced growth rates when compared with mock-transfected cells (p < 0.01 after 134 h) (Fig. 3A) (DLD2, p < 0.001 after 134 h, data not shown). Accordingly, population doubling times in cancer cells overexpressing frataxin were significantly increased (Fig 3B, p < 0.0001) (DLD2, p < 0.0001; data not shown). To further test whether frataxin overexpression also affected anchorage-independent growth, soft agar assays were performed; a pronounced reduction in colony-forming capacity and colony size was observed in the case of frataxin-overexpressing cells (p < 0.000001) (Fig. 3, C and D) (DLD2, p < 0.000001, data not shown). Lastly, we tested whether tumor formation in nude mice would be similarly affected. Indeed, tumors derived from colon cancer cells with an enhanced oxidative metabolism due to overexpression of frataxin were significantly smaller than those derived from mock-transfected control cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3, E and F) (DLD2, p < 0.05; HT29, p = 0.066, data not shown), thus suggesting that increased oxidative metabolism following overexpression of frataxin efficiently inhibits expansion of cancer cells in vivo. Hepatic disruption of frataxin in mice causes liver tumors and impairs phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p38 MAP kinase, whereas other MAP kinases, including ERK and SAPK, remain unaffected.4 Hence we questioned whether overexpression of frataxin would conversely promote activation of p38 MAP kinase. Indeed, although basal expression of p38 was unaffected in frataxin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4A), phosphorylation of p38 was found to be increased in cells overexpressing frataxin (Fig. 4B), thereby potentially explaining reduced growth rates and diminished tumorigenesis of these cells (26Awad M.M.

Although expression levels and phosphorylation of SAPK remained unaffected (Fig. 4, C and D), we observed reduced phosphorylation of ERK in frataxin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4, E and F), also consistent with reduced growth rates and diminished tumorigenesis of these cells (31Fang J.Y. Richardson B.C. Lancet Oncol. 2005; 6: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Taken together, overexpression of frataxin significantly impairs growth and tumorigenesis of various colon cancer cell lines by induction of oxidative metabolism paralleled by altered expression and phosphorylation patterns of MAP kinases, p38, and ERK. More than 80 years ago, Otto Warburg suggested that malignant growth might be caused by a decrease in mitochondrial energy metabolism paralleled by increased glycolytic flux (32Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar, 33Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has never been unambiguously confirmed, although increasing evidence suggests a close link between metabolic and genetic changes observed during malignant growth (reviewed in Ref. 34Ramanathan A. Wang C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We here have shown that overexpression of mitochondrial frataxin in transformed cells reduces malignant growth and inhibits their tumorigenic capacity by induction of oxidative metabolism. Although Warburg hypothesized that an increase in glycolysis might be the primary cause of malignant growth (32Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar, 33Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar), our current findings rather suggest that the efficiency of mitochondrial energy conversion might be the key metabolic factor. Whether the availability of oxygen is correlated with growth of such cells (as tentatively suggested by the findings depicted in Fig. 3) remains to be investigated. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein found to be reduced in Friedreich ataxia. Although the primary function of frataxin is still a matter of debate (8Isaya G. O'Neill H.A. Gakh O. Park S. Mantcheva R. Mooney S.M. Acta. Paediatr. 2004; : 68-71Google Scholar), there is no doubt as to its involvement in the control of oxidative metabolism. Although reduced expression of frataxin causes impaired oxidative phosphorylation in rodents and humans (4Lodi R. Cooper J.M. Bradley J.L. Manners D. Styles P. Taylor D.J. Schapira A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11492-11495Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Vorgerd M. Schöls L. Hardt C. Ristow M. Epplen J.T. Zange J. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2000; 10: 430-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), overexpression of frataxin in non-transformed fibroblasts has been previously linked to increased oxidative metabolism (6Ristow M. Pfister M.F. Yee A.J. Schubert M. Michael L. Zhang C.Y. Ueki K. Michael II, M.D. Lowell B.B. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12239-12243Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We here provide evidence that three different colon cancer cell lines (MIP101, DLD2, and HT29) lack endogenous expression of frataxin, whereas non-transformed cell lines, including primary human fibroblasts, express detectable levels of endogenous frataxin. 5M. Ristow and T. J. Schulz, unpublished results. Although it is known that most metabolically active non-transformed cells express significant levels of frataxin (35Jiralerspong S. Liu Y. Montermini L. Stifani S. Pandolfo M. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), further studies are required to test whether lack of frataxin is a common trait of transformed cell lines and/or cancer tissues in general. Because overexpression of frataxin in non-transformed fibroblasts was shown to increase oxidative phosphorylation previously (6Ristow M. Pfister M.F. Yee A.J. Schubert M. Michael L. Zhang C.Y. Ueki K. Michael II, M.D. Lowell B.B. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12239-12243Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Gonzalez-Cabo P. Vazquez-Manrique R.P. Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Sanz P. Palau F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that overexpression of this protein in cancer cells induces oxidative metabolism as well, as shown in the present study. Hence, frataxin can be used as a molecular tool to specifically enhance mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Such enhancement efficiently impairs malignant growth and reduces the tumorigenic capacity of previously transformed cells, providing evidence for a close link between oxidative metabolism and cancer growth. Several groups have previously shown that frataxin may influence the formation and accumulation of ROS in yeast, cultured mammalian cells, rodents, and finally humans (13Wong A. Yang J. Cavadini P.

Nevertheless, recent findings question the primary relevance of ROS formation in frataxin deficiency (25Seznec H. Simon D. Bouton C. Reutenauer L. Hertzog A. Golik P. Procaccio V. Patel M. Drapier J.C. Koenig M. Puccio H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether overexpression of frataxin in colon cancer cells might influence the endogenous production of ROS, intracellular oxidation of dihydro-dichloro-fluorescein was quantified and found unaltered. The subsequent addition of hydrogen peroxide did not reveal any differences in the accumulation of exogenous ROS. Hence, a putative effect of ROS on cell division or anchorage-independent growth appears unlikely in the specific experimental setting employed. Targeted disruption of frataxin in murine hepatocytes causes multiple liver tumors and specifically impairs phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p38 MAP kinase, whereas other members of the MAP kinase family remain unaffected.4 Based on these findings, we quantified the basal expression and phosphorylation status of three main MAP kinases. Phosphorylation of p38 was found to be increased following the overexpression of frataxin, consistent with findings in frataxin knock-out animals. Although ERK and SAPK were found unaltered in frataxin knock-out animals, we here observed reduced activation of ERK following overexpression of frataxin. Because ERK is known to be activated by oncogenic ras and raf, impaired activation might be considered consistent with impaired malignant growth (31Fang J.Y. Richardson B.C. Lancet Oncol. 2005; 6: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Taken together, overexpression of frataxin may exert its anti-proliferative activity by induction of oxidative metabolism leading to increased phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p38 and impaired phosphorylation of pro-proliferative MAP kinases, namely ERK. Numerous cancer specimens exhibit mtDNA deletions, reduced mitochondrial content, altered mitochondrial morphology, and impaired oxidative capacity (36Cuezva J.M. Krajewska M. de Heredia M.L.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), as well as an increase in glycolytic rate and lactate production (32Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar, 33Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar). These observations have been corroborated in numerous subsequent studies during the past decades (reviewed in Ref. 34Ramanathan A. Wang C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent publication on clonal cell lines expressing an increasing number of oncogenes suggested that transforming events may lead to a metabolic state similar to that proposed by Warburg in 1924 (34Ramanathan A. Wang C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that Ramanathan et al. (34Ramanathan A. Wang C. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) found specific metabolites, including ATP, regulated differently from our current findings for reasons that remain to be evaluated. Nevertheless, both studies come to the conclusion that impaired mitochondrial metabolism, and specifically reduced Krebs cycle activity, may promote malignant growth. Consistently, disorders of the respiratory chain predispose to hepatocellular carcinoma in humans (39Scheers I. Bachy V. Stephenne X. Sokal E.M. J. Pediatr. 2005; 146: 414-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and rare inherited deficiencies of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunits or mitochondrial fumarate hydratase can cause tumors in humans (40Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 352-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ingestion of fructose causes depletion of ATP in rodents (41Mäenpää P.H. Raivio K.O. Kekomaki M.P. Science. 1968; 161: 1253-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and humans (42Terrier F. Vock P. Cotting J. Ladebeck R. Reichen J. Hentschel D. Radiology. 1989; 171: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). If ATP depletion is a relevant factor in the promotion of tumor growth, as suggested by our current findings, increased consumption of fructose should be associated with tumor formation in rodents and humans. Indeed, chronic ingestion of fructose has been shown to promote growth of chemically induced liver tumors in rats (43Enzmann H. Ohlhauser D. Dettler T. Bannasch P. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and has been found to be associated with several cancers in humans in a dose-dependent manner (44Michaud D.S. Liu S.

Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistently, type 2 diabetes has been associated with the increased prevalence of numerous types of cancers in humans (49Mori M. Saitoh S. Takagi S. Obara F. Ohnishi H. Akasaka H. Izumi H. Sakauchi F. Sonoda T. Nagata Y. Shimamoto K. Asian Pac J. Cancer Prev. 2000; 1: 269-276PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that induction of oxidative metabolism efficiently suppresses malignant growth in vitro and in vivo, as previously hypothesized (32Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar, 33Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar). Although further studies are required and warranted, induction of mitochondrial energy conversion, rather than suppression of glycolysis (32Warburg O. Posener K. Negelein E. Biochemische Zeitschrift. 1924; 152: 319-344Google Scholar, 33Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9809) Google Scholar), might be worth considering in efficiently preventing cancer growth in mammals."

It is unknown whether cell population contributes to repair disordered kidney. We attempted to identify and isolate highly proliferative cells from a single cell. We dissected a single nephron from adult rat kidney. Isolated nephrons were separated into segments and cultured. Outgrowing cells were replated after limiting dilution so that each well contained a single cell. One of cell line which was the most potent to grow was designated as rKS56. rKS56 cells showed cobblestone appearance and expressed immature cell markers relating to kidney development and mature tubular cell markers. rKS56 cells grew exponentially and could be maintained for 300 days without transformation. In different culture conditions, rKS56 cells differentiated into mature tubular cells defined by aquaporin-1, 2 expression, and responsiveness to parathyroid hormone or vasopressin. Engrafted to kidney in rat ischemic reperfusion model, rKS56 cells replaced in injured tubules in part after implantation and improved renal function. These results suggest rKS56 cells possess character such as self-renewal, multi-plasticity and capability of tissue repair. rKS56 may possibly contribute to the future development of cell therapy for renal regeneration."

Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar)) have been reported, and some abnormal behavioral or pathological phenotypes have been documented in a subset of these animal models. However, an ideal model in which deposition of α-synuclein in dopamine neurons, the most vulnerable subset of neurons in PD, causes behavioral phenotypes that are inherent to the functions of dopamine neurons, has not been established yet. Here we describe a transgenic C. elegans model in which human α-synuclein overexpressed specifically in dopamine neurons causes an abnormal phenotype in food-sensing behavior that has been attributed to the function of C. elegans dopamine neurons (25Sawin E.R. Ranganathan R. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 619-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), in a manner dependent on FPD-linked mutations, through reduction of neuronal dopamine.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—A dat-1 promoter (Pdat-1) was cloned by PCR amplification of the upstream 719-bp region containing the initiation codon ATG from genomic DNA of N2 worms, as previously reported (26Nass R. Hall D.H. Miller III, D.M. Blakely R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3264-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The following PCR primers were used: sense primer containing BamHI site, 5′-CCCGGATCCATGAAATGGAACTTGA-3′; antisense primer containing NotI site, 5′-GGGGCGGCCGCGCATGGCTAAAAATTGT-3′. The PCR product was subsequently inserted into the BamHI/NotI site of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) vector pFXneEGFP to create Pdat-1::EGFP. Full-length cDNAs encoding human α-or β-synuclein were kindly provided by Dr. T. Nakajo. The A53T and A30P mutant α-synuclein cDNAs were generated by the overlapping PCR mutagenesis strategy. To create the Pdat-1::synuclein constructs, EGFP sequence in the Pdat-1::EGFP construct was removed by NotI/BglII digestion and then replaced with the NotI/BglII fragments containing human α-or β-synuclein. All constructs were sequenced using Thermo Sequenase™ mersham Biosciences) on an automated sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincolin, NE).C. elegans Protocols—Nematodes were handled by standard methods (27Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N2 Bristol is the wild-type strain. The cat-2 (e1112) strain (28Sulston J. Dew M. Brenner S. J Comp Neurol. 1975; 163: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). For generation of transgenic C. elegans (TG worms), plasmid DNAs encoding Pdat-1::synuclein were mixed with Pges-1::red fluorescent protein (each 200 μg/ml), and the mixtures were co-injected into the gonads of young adult hermaphrodite N2 worms. Transgenic progeny carrying α-synuclein and red fluorescent protein transgenes inherited as extrachromosomal arrays were selected on the basis of red fluorescent protein fluorescence expressed in the intestines. Transgenes were integrated into chromosomes by ultraviolet irradiation as described previously (29Mitani S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 551-557Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and each isolated animal was out-crossed for two to four times. Multiple independent lines for each transgene were isolated and analyzed. For generation of transgenic animals carrying Pcat-1::EYFP, mixture of plasmid DNAs encoding Pcat-1::EYFP and pRF4 (rol-6) (200 μg/ml each) was co-injected, and transgenic progeny was selected based on the roller phenotype attributed to rol-6. Isolated transgenic worms were integrated and out-crossed in the same manner. Double transgenic lines carrying both Pdat-1::synuclein and Pcat-1::EYFP were obtained by mating each Pdat-1::synuclein line with a Pcat-1::EYFP line, and subsequently selection of the worms carrying both EYFP and roller markers.Fluorescence Microscopy—Animals were anesthetized by placing in a 10-μl drop of 50 mm sodium azide in M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4/22 mm Na2HPO4/85 mm NaCl/1 mm MgSO4), which is put on the solidified pads of 5% agarose laid on the slides. After mounting in a coverslip, animals were examined with Fluoview FV300 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblotting—Animals were sedimented, washed three times by M9 buffer, and then fixed overnight at 4 ° C with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 μm thick. Sections were first blocked with 10% calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and sequentially reacted with primary and secondary antibodies (biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or horse anti-mouse IgG, Vector Laboratories; Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-linked goat anti-rabbit or horse anti-mouse IgG). Biotin-labeled antibodies were enhanced with Vectastain ABC elite kit (Vector Laboratories) to form avidin-biotin complex conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized with diaminobenzidine, followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Human α-synuclein was detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies LB509, SYN211, or a rabbit polyclonal antibody number 259 (10Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar, 18Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), and α-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 was detected by a rabbit affinity-purified antibody anti-PSer129 (30Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Human β-synuclein was detected with antibody SYN102 that cross-reacts with both α- and β-synucleins at the C terminus. EGFP or EYFP was detected with an anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). For immunoblot analysis of the transfected human α-synuclein, worms in ∼40-μl suspension were sedimented and ultrasonicated in the presence of equal amount of Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.6). Thus prepared lysates were ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatants were collected. Approximately 40 μg of proteins were loaded on each lane, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with LB509 as previously described (10Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar).Preembedding Immunoelectron Microscopy—Worms were pelleted and fixed overnight at 4 ° C with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then cryoprotected in 20 and 25% sucrose. After freezing by liquid nitrogen, the pellets were cut at 20 μm on a cryostat and then reacted with LB509 and then anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with 1 nm of colloidal gold. After postfixation in 1% glutaraldehyde, the specimen was silver-intensified as described (31Kowa H. Sakakura T. Matsuura Y. Wakabayashi T. Mann D.M.A Duff K. Tsuji S. Hashimoto T. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 273-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), postfixed in 2% OsO4, and dehydrated, embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed on JEOL1200EXII as described.Food-sensing Behavior Assay—The food-sensing behavior assay was performed to assess the function of C. elegans dopaminergic neurons using a previously described method (25Sawin E.R. Ranganathan R. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 619-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, well fed, synchronized young adult animals (3-day old) were washed with M9 buffer and then transferred to the center of an assay plate with or without bacterial lawn in a drop of M9 buffer. Five minutes after transfer, the locomotory rate of each worm was counted in 20-s intervals. Assay plates were prepared by spreading the Escherichia coli strain HB101 overnight at 37 ° C in a ring with an inner diameter of 1 cm and an outer diameter of 8 cm on NGM agar (27Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 9-cm, large diameter Petri plates, to prevent the worms from reaching the edge of the plate during the trial. The slowing rate was calculated as the percentage of the locomotory rate in bacteria (+) lawn as compared with that in bacteria (–) lawn. The average slowing rate among five animals was defined as the result of each trial. In all assays, plates were coded so that the experimenter was blind to the genotype of the animal.Dopamine pretreatment was conducted as described (25Sawin E.R. Ranganathan R. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 619-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Dopamine hydrochloride (Aldrich) was prepared fresh in M9 buffer, and 300 μlof solution was added to each 6-cm agar plate with bacteria to obtain final concentration of 2 mm. The plates were allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature, and then the animals were transferred to the plate. After incubation for 6 h at 20°C, the locomotory rate of each animal was measured as described above.Measurement of Dopamine Level—The dopamine levels in animals of each genotype were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis coupled to chemiluminescence reaction detection as described previously (32Tsunoda M. Takezawa K. Santa T. Imai K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Animals were washed three times with M9 buffer, and then worm pellets were temporarily frozen at –80 ° C. Extracts were prepared by resuspending frozen worm pellets in buffer A (0.2 m perchloric acid, 0.002 m EDTA:2Na, 0.002 m sodium metabisulfate) and sonicating. The sonicates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were subjected to HPLC analysis.RESULTSGeneration and Characterization by Immunohistochemistry and Immunoblotting of α-Synuclein Transgenic C. elegans—We constructed transgenes comprised of a promotor sequence of dat-1, a dopamine transporter of C. elegans, fused to wild-type (wt) or A30P or A53T familial Parkinson mutant (mt) human α-synuclein, or to wt human β-synuclein or EGFP as controls, and injected them into the gonads of C. elegans.We screened worms that express transgenes extrachromosomally (extrachromosomal lines) by detection of fluorescence of Pges-1::RFP that was co-injected as a marker plasmid and expressed in intestine. We then obtained integrant lines by inserting the transgenes into chromosomes by UV irradiation. The Pdat-1::EGFP fluorescence was correctly detected in the eight dopamine neurons (six in the head, i.e. CEP and ADE neurons, and two in the posterior regions, i.e. PDE neurons, respectively) as well as their anterior dendritic protrusions, suggesting the successful gene expression in dopamine neurons (Fig. 1A).We then characterized the expression of human α-synuclein proteins in the dopamine neurons by immunohistochemistry using paraffin-embedded sections. Accumulation of human α-synuclein in the cell bodies and neurites of dopamine neurons was detected by two anti-human α-synuclein-specific antibodies, LB509 and Syn211, in an identical pattern. Positive immunoreactions within the neuronal cell bodies were often observed diffusely within the cytoplasm of dopamine neurons, but they sometimes exhibited multiple, irregularly shaped or round clumps that occupy restricted areas of the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, B–D), compared with the widespread positive reaction of EYFP throughout the cell bodies (Fig. 1, F and G). Dopamine neurons in N2 (non-transgenic) lines did not show any positive immunoreactions upon staining with anti-α-synuclein antibodies, confirming the specificity of the α-synuclein reactivities (supplemental Fig. S1). Human β-synuclein also showed a similar staining pattern in dopamine neurons (Fig. 1E). In addition, α-synuclein positive structures in neurites, that extend in anterior direction from the CEP neurons (CEP dendrite), often exhibited a spherical or dot-like appearance, in contrast to the linear EYFP fluorescence within the neurites (Fig. 1H; also see B–D). These characteristics were similar between TG worms overexpressing wt and FPD-mt (A30P or A53T) α-synuclein (Fig. 1, B–D, F, and G). We next examined whether phosphorylation of α-synuclein at Ser-129, which is characteristic of α-synuclein deposited in Lewy bodies and other synucleinopathy lesions in human (30Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) as well as in transgenic mice (33Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Muller V. Jacobsen H. Spooren W. Fuss B. Mallon B. Macklin W.B. Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Iwatsubo T. Kretzschmar H.A. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 34Neumann M. Kahle P.J. Giasson B.I. Ozmen L. Borroni E.

Investig. 2002; 110: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) brains, occurs in the dopamine neurons of transgenic C. elegans. No dopamine neurons were positive for anti-PSer129 in 3- or 9-day-old worms, whereas a subfraction of dopamine neurons (1.90, 2.26, and 7.09% of dopamine neurons in TG worms expressing wt, A30P, and A53T mt α-synuclein, respectively; n = 105–141) showed positive reaction in 15-day-old worms, which was most prominent in TG worms expressing A53T FPD mt α-synuclein (Fig. 1I). These positive reactions for phosphorylated α-synuclein were similarly observed with another Ser(P)-129-specific monoclonal antibody (PSyn#64), and were not observed in 15-day-old N2 worms (supplemental Fig. S1). We further examined the ultrastructure of the α-synuclein accumulated within the cell bodies and dendrites of dopamine neurons by immunoelectron microscopy. α-Synuclein immunoreactivities detected by LB509 were diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm of dopamine neurons without formation of abnormal fibrils or aggregates (Fig. 1J), as well as in dendritic cytoplasm where they were detected between microtubular arrays (Fig. 1K, arrows). We finally compared the levels of α-synuclein protein expression by immunoblotting of the Tris-soluble fractions of TG worms and confirmed that all six lines expressing wt or FPD-mt α-synuclein express comparable levels of human α-synuclein detected by LB509 at ∼15 kDa (Fig. 1L).To examine whether accumulation of wt or FPD-mutant α-synuclein caused neuronal loss, we then counted densities of CEP dopamine neurons in 3- and 15-day-old worms and compared them with those expressing wt or FPD-mutant α-synuclein and EGFP as a control, on immunostained sections with anti-α-synuclein or EGFP antibodies (Fig. 2). We found that the average number of dopamine neurons observed per worm was at similar levels (∼1.4 at 3-day-old and ∼1.1 at 15-day-old) in lines expressing wt or FPD-mutant α-synuclein or EGFP (Fig. 2). We invariably detected four EGFP-positive CEP neurons (of which up to two are visible in tissue sections) by fluorescence observation of whole-mounted worms at 3- and 15-days old (data not shown), suggesting that the relative decrease in neuronal densities on sections of EGFP TG worms reflects the growth of bodies of worm relative to neurons but not decrease in neuronal numbers. Thus, we concluded that TG worms expressing wt or FPD-mutant α-synuclein do not develop neuronal loss beyond that normally observed, at least when aged to 15 days.FIGURE 2Lack of loss of cell bodies of CEP dopamine neurons. The numbers of α-synuclein or EGFP-immunopositive cell bodies of CEP dopamine neurons in 3- or 15-day-old TG worms overexpressing EGFP or wt (synWT) or FPD-mt (A53T, A30P) α-synuclein (±S.E.) were counted on 3-μm thick paraffin-embedded, immunostained sections. Mean ± S.E. in ∼100–130 (3-day-old) or ∼50–70 (15-day-old) worms (for each transgene) are shown. Note the lack of significant reduction in dopamine neuron densities in α-synuclein TG worms compared with those in control worms expressing EGFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)However, we observed a constant decrease in EYFP labeling of the CEP dendrites, which was co-expressed by a monoamine neuron-specific promoter, cat-1, in 3-day-old TG worms expressing A30P (∼90% decrease) or A53T (∼80% decrease) FPD mutant α-synuclein, compared with the complete preservation of this labeling in worms expressing β-synuclein, and moderate decrease in worms expressing wt α-synuclein (∼35% decrease), despite similar intensities of labeling for EYFP or α-synuclein in the cell bodies (Fig. 3). These results suggest the occurrence of some abnormality in dendrites of dopamine neurons expressing FPD mutant α-synuclein.FIGURE 3Fluorescence visualization of CEP dopamine neurons, serotonin neurons, and their dendrites in 3-day-old worms co-expressing α-synuclein and EYFP. EYFP was expressed under the control of a monoaminergic neuron specific promoter, Pcat-1.A, preservation of EYFP fluorescence in dendrites of dopamine neurons (arrowheads) and serotonergic neurons (arrows) in TG worms expressing human β-synuclein as a control.

Dew M. Brenner S. J Comp Neurol. 1975; 163: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and show a specific failure in food-sensing behavior (25Sawin E.R. Ranganathan R. Horvitz H.R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 619-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). C. elegans transport themselves by bending movement of the bodies, and the frequency determines the speed of movement. When worms come across food (i.e. bacteria), they slow down to feed themselves more effectively, by decreasing the bending frequency. However, cat-2 (e1112) worms show failure in this decremental response upon perception of bacteria. Thus, one of the functions of dopamine neurotransmission in C. elegans is related to this adaptive behavior in food-sensing. We examined whether overexpression of wt- or FPD mt α-synuclein in DA neurons of C. elegans causes abnormality in this function in 3-day-old TG worms that were synchronized for age (Fig. 4). Non-TG, wt worms (N2) showed an ∼35% decrease in bending frequency upon exposure to bacteria. Transgenic worms that overexpress EGFP, human β-synuclein or wt human α-synucle"

We find that srb4ts Mediator is defective for the stimulation of basal RNA polymerase II transcription at the restrictive temperature in vitro. Taken together, these findings lead to the suggestion that Mediator is required for basal RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo. On this basis, Mediator is identified as a general transcription factor, comparable in importance to RNA polymerase II and other general factors for the initiation of transcription. The possibility that Mediator serves as an anti-inhibitor, opposing the effects of global negative regulators, is largely excluded.

The occurrence in Mediator of certain subunits, implicated by genetic screens in the negative regulation of transcription, revealed yet another Mediator activity, its function as a co-repressor (4Li Y.

Mediator-pol II interaction may also underlie the stimulation of basal transcription. Genetic studies, however, have lent credence to an alternative mechanism. Temperature-sensitive mutants in two Mediator subunits, Srb4 and Srb6, exhibit a remarkable phenotype at a restrictive temperature, the rapid cessation of transcription of all genes tested (30Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This finding has been extended by microarray analysis to 5361 yeast genes, all but two of which showed as great an effect of the srb4ts mutant on transcription as that of a mutation in pol II itself (31Holstege F.C.

These complexes are believed to be inhibitors of transcription, raising the possibility that Mediator serves as an anti-inhibitor. Mediator might stimulate basal transcription by relieving repression due to global negative regulatory factors. We report here on a study of the srb4ts mutant Mediator in vitro. The results are informative about the mutant phenotype and the role of Mediator in vivo. They provide a test of the anti-inhibitor idea and illuminate the Mediator mechanism, especially in regard to the stimulation of basal transcription. Reversion of srb4ts Mutations and Phenotypic Analysis—The yeast shuttle vector pCT181, carrying the srb4–138 mutant allele, was recovered from yeast strain Z628 (30Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The shuttle vector pCT127, carrying the wild type SRB4 gene, was recovered from the isogenic yeast strain Z579. The mutations in pCT181 were reverted one at the time by QuikChange (Qiagen), and the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Then the shuttle vectors were introduced into yeast strain Z572 by plasmid shuffling. For controls, the wild type vector, pCT127, and the mutant, pCT181 were also introduced into yeast strain Z572. The isolated yeast strains were grown in YPD (2% (w/v) Bacto Peptone, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) glucose) overnight. The cells (3 μlof culture diluted to an A600 of 1) were streaked on YPD plates and grown at 30 or 37 °C. Expression Vectors—The open reading frames of yeast SRB6, ROX3, and MED3 genes were amplified by PCR and cloned between BamHI and XhoI sites, EcoRI and XhoI sites, and SmaI and XhoI sites of pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Bioscience), respectively, yielding the expression vectors, pTK006(GST-Srb6), pTK009(GST-Rox3), and pTK067 (GST-Med3). The open reading frames of yeast SRB2, SRB5, and MED11 genes were amplified by PCR and cloned between NdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagen), yielding the expression vectors pTK021(10His-Srb2), pTK029(10His-Srb5), and pTK038(10His-Med11), respectively. Recombinant Mediator Subunits—Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins GST-Srb6, GST-Rox3, and GST-Med3 were performed as described (34Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43897-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with one minor modification; instead of eluting with glutathione-containing buffer, the recombinant Srb6 was released from the column by cleavage of GST-Srb6 protein with PreScission protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Bioscience). 10His-Srb2, 10His-Srb5, and 10His-Med11 were expressed and cell lysates were made by essentially the same procedure except the lysis buffer was phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mix. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min and supernatants were loaded on a 1 ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. For 10His-Srb2 and 10His-Srb5 proteins, after washing with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Imidazole (pH 8.0), proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole (pH, 8.0). 10His-Med11 was eluted with lysis buffer containing 8 m urea and 300 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Antibody Production and Immunoblot Analysis—About 1 mg of each of the recombinant proteins Srb6, GST-Rox3, 10His-Srb2, and 10His-Srb5 inoculated in rabbits (Covance). GST-Med3 and 10His-Med11 were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and revealed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The GST-Med3 and 10His-Med11 protein bands were excised and inoculated in rabbits (Covance). Antibodies against Srb4 and Rgr1 proteins were made by inoculating rabbits with the peptides, DNDKNLKFLKNKDSLV (Srb4 amino acids 72–87) and CMEIHNILKVDSNSSSS (cysteine plus Rgr1 amino acids 1067–1081), conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Covance). Anti-Sin4 antibody was gift from D. Stillman (University of Utah). Anti-Med1 was a gift from S. Bjorklund (Umea University, Umea, Sweden). Anti-Med2, Med4/5, Med6, Med7 and Med8 antibodies were as described (Myers et al. (6Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)). Anti-Med9 and Med10 were gifts from C. Gustafsson (Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden). Anti-Not1, Not3, Not5 and Caf40 were gifts from C. Denis (Universtiy of New Hampshire). Anti-Mot1 was a gift from D. Auble (University of Virginia). Anti-NC2 antibodies were a gift from M. Collart (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described (34Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Construction of Yeast HA-tagging Vector—The HA-tagging vector pYT006 was created by modifying the vector pU6H3HA (35De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as follows. The six-histidine tag was disabled by mutating the first four histine residues to glycines, yielding pYT005, followed by introducing the sequence of the PreScission protease site (LEVLFQGP) before the three copies of the HA epitope by QuikChange (Strategene), yielding pYT006. The BamHI fragment from the vector pDp-U URA (36Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), containing the URA3 gene, was blunted and subcloned into the blunted ApaI and Hin-dIII sites of pBS1479 (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), yielding the URA3 marker-containing vector pYT0(A). The tabacco etch potyvirus protease cleavage site was replaced by a PreScission protease site (LEVLFQGP) by subcloning the corresponding DNA sequences into NheI and SacI sites of pYT0(A), yielding the yeast tagging vector pYT001(A). Construction of Tagged Yeast Strains—A 10-histidine tag was introduced at the N termini of wild type and mutant srb4 genes in pCT127 and pCT181 by QuikChange (Strategene), yielding pCT127(10His-Srb4) and pCT181(10His-srb4ts) respectively. Three copies of the HA epitope were introduced at the C terminus of Med8 in both wild type and srb4 mutant yeast strains by PCR from pYT006 with primer sets targeting the Med8 genomic locus as described (35De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PCR products were used to transform yeast strain Z572 (MATa his32^00 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 srb42^:HIS3 [CEN, URA3, SRB4], Med8:Med8-PreScission-3×HA-Kan), yielding yeast strain YT108. Finally, pCT127(10His-Srb4) and pCT181(10His-srb4ts) were transformed into YT108 by plasmid shuffling, yielding the yeast strains YT110(10His-Srb4, Med8-PreSci-3×HA) and YT111(10His-srb4ts, Med8-PreSci-3×HA), respectively. Following the published protocol (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), PCR was performed with pYT1(A) as template and with primer sets targeting Not1 genomic locus. The PCR products were used to transform yeast strain Z579 [MATa his32^00 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 srb42^:HIS3/pCT181(AMP,CEN,LEU), Not1:Not1-mTAP-URA3], yielding the yeast strain YT022(NotI-mTAP). Purification of Wild Type and srb4ts Mediators—Yeast strain YT110(wt:Med8-PreSci-3×HA) or YT111(srb4ts:Med8-PreSci-3×HA) was grown in 20 liters of 2× YPD (4% (w/v) Bacto Peptone, 2% (w/v) yeast extract, 4% (w/v) glucose) to an A600 value of 8–9. Frozen cells (1.2 kg) were broken in liquid nitrogen as described (34Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43897-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in a 2-liter Waring blender at high speed for 10 min with constant addition of liquid nitrogen. A portion of broken cells (350 g) were thawed at 4 °C and 500 ml of 0.27 m Tris acetate (pH 7.6), 0.95 m potassium acetate, 1.8 mm EDTA, 18% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mix was added. The mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 13,000 rpm for 20 min and then in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 42,000 rpm for 90 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against the buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 3 h, adjusted to a conductivity of buffer A containing 100 mm potassium acetate (“buffer A+100”), with the buffer A, and applied to a 500 ml of BioRex 70. Step elution was performed with buffer A+300, +600, and +1200 as described (3Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The buffer A+600 eluates from three portions of broken cells processed in this way were combined and dialyzed against the buffer B (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h, adjusted to the conductivity of the buffer B containing 100 mm potassium acetate (“buffer B+100”) with the buffer B, and then applied to a 100-ml DEAE-Sephacel column pre-equilibrated with buffer B+100. The column was washed with 1 column volume of buffer B+100 and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 mm to 550 mm potassium acetate over 10 column volumes. The peak free Mediator fractions eluted at ∼400 mm potassium acetate. DEAE-Sephacel fractions containing free Mediator (∼160 ml) were concentrated by centrifugation with a PL-10 (Amicon) to 10 ml, 7.55 mg/ml (wild type Mediator) or 7 ml, 12.8 mg/ml (srb4ts Mediator). (It proved to be essential to concentrate the DEAE fractions before loading onto an HA affinity column.) Half of the concentrated DEAE fraction was loaded on a 0.8-ml anti-HA antibody column (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with buffer A+300 containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. After 2 h at 4 °C, the column was washed with 80 ml of buffer A+300 containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. (To maintain the integrity of srb4ts Mediator, it was essential to use potassium acetate at a concentration no higher than 300 mm. Use of ammonium sulfate or a higher ionic strength resulted in a loss of subunits.) The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and eluted by incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature in the same buffer containing PreScission protease (8 units/ml) and 2× HA peptide CPDYAGYPYDVPDYAGYPYDV (0.2 mg/ml). The combination of 2× HA peptide and protease digestion was necessary to obtain an elution efficiency of greater than 90%. Use of only one eluant resulted not only in a poor yield but also in loss of subunits from srb4ts Mediator. The elute was dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 150 mm KOAc, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h, and 5–10 μl was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Transcription and C-terminal Domain (CTD) Phosphorylation Assays—Whole cell extracts of wild type (Z579) and srb4–138 (Z628) strains (30Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were prepared and used for transcription as described (38Woontner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transcription reconstituted with purified proteins was performed as described (3Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Nucleotide mix (ATP, CTP, UTP) and magnesium acetate were added only following a preincubation period. The final concentration of cold UTP was 10 μm instead of 25 μm. Where Sarkosyl was added, the final concentration was 0.2%. For quantitation of transcripts on an absolute rather than relative basis, 1 nCi of [α-32P]UTP was applied to the gel, 5 min before the end of the run. Quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The CTD phosphorylation assay was performed as described (3Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Purification of NOT Complex—The preparation from the Not1-mTAP tagged yeast strain YT022 was performed as described (34Takagi Y. Komori H. Chang W.H. Hudmon A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43897-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1 m potassium acetate was used instead of ammonium sulfate in the lysis buffer. After the centrifugation at 100,000 × g, for 90 min, the extract was dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 150 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol overnight, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and loaded on a 1-ml IgG-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer A containing 600 mm potassium acetate at 4 °C. After loading, the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A+600 containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors and 100 ml of buffer A+150 mm containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and eluted by incubation overnight in the same buffer containing PreScission protease (8 units/ml) at 4 °C. IgG elutes were further purified on a 0.5-ml calmodulin column as described (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) except that both calmodulin binding buffer and elution buffer contained 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 5% glycerol. The calmodulin column elute was dialyzed as described above. Expression and Purification of Yeast NC2—Bur6–6His and 6His-Ydr1 were overexpressed as described above. The expression vectors for NC2, pGP288, and pGP415 were a gift from G. Prelich (39Xie J. Collart M. Lemaire M. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the pellet containing the inclusion bodies was resuspended in 20 ml of denaturation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 6 m guanidine-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), clarified by centrifugation, and loaded on a 2-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid pre-equilibrated with denaturation buffer. The column was washed with 50 ml of denaturation buffer and 50 ml of denaturation buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and was eluted with denaturation buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. For reconstitution of NC2, equal amounts of both nickel column elutes were mixed, diluted 1:5 with renaturation buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 50 μm zinc acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10%glycerol), placed on ice for 90 min, dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm potassium acetate, 50 μm zinc acetate, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and loaded on a 1-ml Hitrap Q column pre-equilibrated with buffer A+100. The recombinant NC2 was eluted by a linear gradient of 100 mm to 1 m potassium acetate. The peak fraction was dialyzed as described above. Transcription by srb4ts Mutant Cell Extract Correlates with the Mutant Phenotype, Implying a Role for Mediator in Basal Transcription in Vivo—Whole cell extracts were prepared from wild type and srb4ts yeast strains as described. The extracts were nearly identical in total protein concentration, in concentrations of general transcription factors and Mediator (including Srb4 protein; all concentrations measured by immunoblot analysis), and in nonspecific pol II activity. Assayed at a permissive temperature of 24 °C, the extracts supported comparable levels of promoter-dependent transcription from a commonly used template, the CYC1 promoter fused to a G-less cassette (Fig. 1). At a restrictive temperature of 30 °C, transcription by the srb4ts extract was 23 times less than that by the wild type extract. The inhibition of transcription in the mutant extract was reversible; upon warming to 30 °C or even 37 °C and then cooling to 24 °C, transcription was restored to the wild type level (data not shown). Inhibition was therefore not a consequence of degradation or the like (important to rule out, as a previous observation regarding transcription of an immobilized template by srb4ts extract (40Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of loss of Srb4 protein in the mutant in vivo; this observation may be attributed to washing of the immobilized preinitiation complex prior to transcription, resulting in loss of Srb4 protein, due to instability of the mutant Mediator in vitro described below). Similar results were obtained with a variety of transcription templates (supplemental figure). Transcription by the mutant extract was temperature-sensitive, regardless of the promoter (CYC1 or adenoviral major late) or the UAS (Gal4-binding, Gcn4-binding, or none) used. As no activator protein was added, and no UAS was required, the stimulation of basal transcription by Mediator was evidently affected. From the correlation of this biochemical behavior with the mutant phenotype, we conclude that Mediator performs a fundamental role in transcription in vivo. It is important not only for regulated transcription but, apparently, for any transcription at all. Mediator Performs a Unique Role in the Initiation of Transcription—Addition of purified wild type Mediator to srb4ts extract restored transcription activity at 30 °C (Fig. 2). In contrast, addition of general transcription factors and pol II, individually or in various combinations, at levels greater than those in the extract, was without effect. We conclude the loss of activity in the srb4ts extract at 30 °C was directly attributable to the loss of Mediator function and not due indirectly to an influence of the mutant Mediator upon the expression of another factor. We further conclude the role of Mediator in basal transcription is distinct from the roles of the other transcription proteins. We could exploit the restoration of activity by wild type Mediator to determine when Mediator acts on the transcription pathway. Mediator was added to srb4ts extract at 30 °C at various times before or after the addition of NTPs. Sarkosyl was added 2 min after NTPs to prevent further initiation and allow only RNA chain elongation (Fig. 3). The results were clear-cut; addition of Mediator 5 min or longer before NTPs gave full transcription activity, whereas addition at the same time as NTPs or any time after gave no transcription at all. We conclude that Mediator functions in the initiation of transcription. In other experiments, the temperature was raised from 24 to 30 °C at various times before or after transcription the addition of NTPs to srb4ts extract (Fig. 4). Temperature increase 20 min or more before NTP addition resulted in no transcription at all. A temperature increase between 10 min before and 10 min after NTP addition yielded a level of transcription comparable with that following Sarkosyl addition at 2 min of reaction in wild type extract, indicative of a single round of initiation and transcript elongation (data not shown). Temperature increase at later times permitted multiple rounds of transcription. This provided further evidence for a role of Mediator in initiation, and demonstrated a lack of involvement of Mediator in transcript elongation. It furthermore demonstrated a requirement for Mediator for multiple rounds of transcription. Genetic and Biochemical Characterization of srb4ts Mediator Supports a Direct, Positive Role in Transcription, as Opposed to Inhibition at Restrictive Temperatures and Anti-inhibition at Permissive Temperatures—Sequencing the srb4ts allele revealed eight amino acid differences from wild type (Fig. 5A). To determine which difference(s) was responsible for the temperature-sensitive phenotype, the mutant residue was reverted to wild type at each of the eight positions individually, in pairs, and in"
https://openalex.org/W1982684477,"Transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-beta) are secreted as latent complexes consisting of the TGF-beta dimer, the TGF-beta propeptide dimer, and the latent TGF-beta binding protein (LTBP). Although the bonds between TGF-beta and its propeptide are cleaved intracellulary, the propeptide associates with TGF-beta by electrostatic interactions, thereby conferring latency to the complex. We reported that a specific sequence of LTBP-1 is required for latent TGF-beta activation by the integrin alphavbeta6. Here we describe a 24 amino acid sequence from the hinge domain required for activation. The LTBP-1 polypeptide rL1N, which includes the hinge, associates with fibronectin in binding assays. We present evidence that fibronectin null cells minimally activate latent TGF-beta and poorly incorporate the active hinge sequence into their matrix. In addition, cells missing the fibronectin receptor alpha5beta1 exhibit defective activation of latent TGF-beta by alphavbeta6 and decreased matrix incorporation. The results indicate specificity for integrin-mediated latent TGF-beta activation that include unique sequences in LTBP-1 and an appropriate matrix molecule."

There is a wide variation in P2X7 receptor function between subjects, explained in part by four loss-of-function polymorphisms (R307Q, E496A, I568N, and a 5′-intronic splice site polymorphism), as well as rare mutations. In this study, we report the allele frequencies of 11 non-synonymous P2X7 polymorphisms and describe a fifth loss-of-function polymorphism in the gene (1096C → G), which changes Thr357 to Ser (T357S) with an allele frequency of 0.08 in the Caucasian population. P2X7 function was measured by ATP-induced ethidium+ influx into peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes and, when compared with wild-type subjects, was reduced to 10–65% in heterozygotes, 1–18% in homozygotes, and 0–10% in compound heterozygotes carrying T357S and a second loss-of-function polymorphism. Overexpression of the T357S mutant P2X7 in either HEK-293 cells or Xenopus oocytes gave P2X7 function of ∼50% that of wild-type constructs. Differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, which also up-regulates P2X7, restored P2X7 function to near normal in cells heterozygous for T357S and to a value 50–65% of wild-type in cells homozygous for T357S or compound heterozygous for T357S/E496A. However, macrophages from subjects that are compound heterozygous for either T357S/R307Q or T357S/stop codon had near-to-absent P2X7 function. These functional deficits induced by T357S were paralleled by impaired ATP-induced apoptosis and mycobacteria killing in macrophages from these subjects. Lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages from subjects homozygous for T357S or compound heterozygous for T357S and a second loss-of-function allele have reduced or absent P2X7 receptor function.

The P2X7 receptor and its genetic variants have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including the killing of intracellular pathogens by macrophages (1Fairbairn I.P.

P2X7 receptors are highly expressed on cells of hemopoietic origin, including cells of the monocytic-macrophage series, dendritic cells, mast cells, and lymphoid cells of all subtypes, which collectively lead to the concept of P2X7 as a proinflammatory receptor (11Di Virgilio F.

Prolonged exposure to ATP induces a second permeability state (dilated channel or pore), which allows the influx of larger cations such as ethidium+ (314 Da) or YO-PRO-12+ (375 Da) (12Nuttle L.C.

It is currently unclear whether the two permeability states are an intrinsic property of the P2X7 receptor or whether the second permeability pathway depends on recruitment of an unidentified protein to the surface of the host cell (17Jiang L.H.

The P2X7 receptor has intracellular amino and carboxyl termini with two hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, separated by a long glycosylated extracellular loop containing the proposed ATP-binding sites (29Rassendren F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31287-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor forms trimeric complexes of identical subunits in the plasma membrane and is unable to oligomerize with other P2X receptors (33Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It also differs from other P2X receptors in having a longer carboxyl terminus measuring 240 amino acids from the inner membrane face. The integral role of the carboxyl terminus in ATP-induced pore function has been confirmed, because truncation of this domain abrogates influx of the fluorescent dyes ethidium+ or YO-PRO-12+ (13Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 34Smart M.L. Gu B.J. Panchal R.G. Wiley J.S. Cromer B. Williams D.A. Petrou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8853-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have identified two polymorphisms in the carboxyl terminus causing loss-of-function of the receptor, Glu496 to Ala (1513A → C) and Ile568 to Asn (1729T → A) with the former affecting receptor function and the latter affecting receptor trafficking (35Gu B.J.

Work from our group has identified a third loss-of-function polymorphism in the ATP-binding site of the extracellular loop of the receptor that changes Arg307 to Gln (946G → A) so that ATP can no longer bind to the receptor (32Gu B.J. Sluyter R. Skarratt K.K. Shemon A.N. Dao-Ung L.P. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Clarke A.L. Petrou S. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31287-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Two other genetic variations give loss-of-function of the P2RX7 gene. The first is an intronic polymorphism at the 5′-donor splice site at the exon 1-intron 1 boundary (151+1g → t), which results in a null allele in 1–2% of Caucasian subjects (37Skarratt K.K. Fuller S.J. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung L.P. Gu B.J. Wiley J.S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2675-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas in one subject an exonic mutation (699C → T) introduces a stop codon in exon 7 of the P2RX7 gene (4Fernando S.L. Saunders B.M. Sluyter R. Skarratt K.K. Wiley J.S. Britton W.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These polymorphisms and mutations, however, do not account for all observed cases of variation in P2X7 function in humans. In this study we report a fifth polymorphism within the human P2RX7 gene. This polymorphism (1096C → G) changes Thr357 to Ser (T357S) in a region of the carboxyl terminus that has been proposed as a β-arrestin-2 binding motif on the receptor (38Feng Y.H. Wang L. Wang Q. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1342-C1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated lymphocytes and monocytes from subjects heterozygous for this polymorphism have ∼50% P2X7 function compared with wild-type subjects, whereas lymphocytes and monocytes from subjects homozygous for T357S or compound heterozygous for T357S and a second loss-of-function polymorphism have near-to-absent P2X7 function.

Selection of Subjects—Blood was collected from 841 adult subjects of whom 712 were analyzed at nucleotide position 1096. Of the 712 subjects 554 were Caucasian, 94 were Asian, 49 were Indian sub-continental, and 15 were of other ethnicity. Of the 554 Caucasian subjects, 218 were normal, whereas the remainder were patients with either chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 110), lymphoma (n = 47), other lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 26), various infectious (n = 52), or autoimmune (n = 26) diseases. The remainder of the Caucasian subjects (n = 75) had a range of disorders, including non-hematological cancers and allergies. Studies were conducted with informed, written consent and approval from local human ethics committees. Preparation of Leukocytes—Peripheral venous blood from adult subjects was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with RPMI 1640 medium or phosphate-buffered saline. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque, washed once in RPMI 1640 medium or phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in NaCl medium (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mmd-glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 5 μg/ml gentamicin (complete RPMI 1640 medium). For the generation of macrophages, PBMCs suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium were incubated for 2 h in plastic flasks and then gently washed to remove non-adherent cells. The adherent monocytes were differentiated to macrophages by culturing for 7 days at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 in complete RPMI 1640 medium. In the final 24 h of culture macrophages were activated by adding 100 units/ml IFN-γ. DNA Extraction—Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood as previously described (32Gu B.J. Sluyter R. Skarratt K.K. Shemon A.N. Dao-Ung L.P. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Clarke A.L. Petrou S. Wiley J.S. J. Biol.

Plasmid DNA was extracted from XL1-Blue supercompetent cells transformed with wild-type or mutant P2X7 cDNA using either the Mini-prep Plasmid DNA Extraction or HiSpeed™ plasmid purification kits according to manufacturers' protocols. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Detection—Twelve primers were used to amplify the 13 exons of the human P2RX7 gene from genomic DNA (GenBank™ accession number NT_009775.8), and the PCR products were sequenced as described (32Gu B.J. Sluyter R. Skarratt K.K. Shemon A.N. Dao-Ung L.P. Fuller S.J. Barden J.A. Clarke A.L. Petrou S. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31287-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For detection of the 1096C → G polymorphism in a large number of samples, genomic DNA was analyzed using the high throughput TaqMan assay using an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) at the SUPAMAC Facility (Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) using the following primer and probe set (5′→3′): forward primer: GGGAGCGACAGCAGTTACTG; reverse primer: CAGCGCTTGTCTGCATTCTC; Probe: VIC CTCATCGACACTTACTC MGB NFQ; Probe: FAM TCATCGACAGTTACTC MGB NFQ. The identification of the 1096C → G polymorphism was verified by conventional sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The C terminus of P2X7 was tagged with EGFP by sub-cloning the human P2X7 receptor into the NheI/NotI cloning sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector as described previously (41Smart M.L. Panchal R.G. Bowser D.N. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C77-C84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The single amino acid change at 1096C → G (Thr357 to Ser) was introduced using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit with the wild-type human P2X7 in the pEGFP vector as the template. The point mutation was constructed using a pair of complimentary mutagenic primers described below consisting of a mutagenic codon flanked by sequences homologous to the wild-type strand of the template. After digestion by DpnI, intact mutation-containing DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Purified mutagenic oligonucleotides (PROLIGO, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) were as follows (base changes are in boldface type and underlined): Thr357 to Ser forward: GACTTCCTCATCGACAGTTACTCCAGTAACTGC; Thr357 to Ser reverse: GCAGTTACTGGAGTAACTGTCGATGAGGAAGTC. Transfection of HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Empty pEGFP vector cDNA, wild-type P2X7-EGFP cDNA, and mutant P2X7-EGFP cDNA were incubated in serum free Opti-MEM® I medium for 5 min followed by incubation with Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent for 20 min at room temperature. The solution was added to a sub-confluent monolayer of HEK-293 cells (4 × 106 in 3 ml of Opti-MEM® I medium containing 5% fetal calf serum but no antibiotics) and transfected for 2 days at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2. Cells were harvested by mechanical scraping and washed in HEPES-buffered NaCl medium. Immunofluorescent Staining and Flow Cytometry—PBMCs or transfected HEK-293 cells were labeled with fluorochrome-conjugated mAb, washed, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Surface P2X7 expression (FITC labeling) on subsets of PBMCs was measured by gating on CD19+ and CD3+ lymphocytes and on CD14+ monocytes. Dead cells were excluded using 7-amino-actinomycin D staining. For HEK-293 cells, EGFP expression was used to determine the total P2X7 expression, whereas surface P2X7 expression (Alexa-647 labeling) was measured by gating on EGFP-positive HEK-293 cells. Negative control values were subtracted for each subset to determine the mean channel of fluorescence intensity or the percentage of cells positive for surface P2X7 expression. Ethidium+ Influx Measurements—ATP-induced ethidium+ influx into PBMCs, macrophages, and EGFP-positive HEK-293 cells in KCl medium (150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm d-glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) was measured using time-resolved flow cytometry as described (32Gu B.J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411 (J.): 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and plated in 96-well plates. cDNA encoding wild-type P2X7-EGFP or mutant P2X7-EGFP (∼0.7 μg/μl) was injected (20 nl) into the nuclei of Stage 5 or 6 oocytes using the Roboocyte Robot (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) and stored at 18 °C for 2 days prior to experimentation. Oocytes were studied with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique using the Roboocyte Robot. Oocytes were impaled with two glass electrodes containing 1.5 m potassium acetate and 0.5 m KCl and held at a membrane potential of –70 mV. Oocytes were continually perfused with a ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) using a Gilson 222 XL Liquid Handler and Gilson Minipulse 3 Peristaltic Pump (Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI). ATP (200 μm) dissolved in bath solution was applied to the oocytes for 20 s. Following ATP (200 μm) application, the oocytes were again perfused with bath solution for 2 min to allow for the full recovery of the current to baseline levels. Mycobacterial Killing and Macrophage Apoptosis—IFN-γ activated macrophages were infected with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-GFP (43Triccas J.A. Berthet F.X. Pelicic V. Gicquel B. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) for 4 h at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1 (day 0) then washed twice to remove extracellular bacteria. On day 2, cells were pulsed with 3 mm ATP in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 20 min, washed, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2. On day 3, half the wells were lysed with 0.1% Triton-X for 30 min to release viable bacilli. Serial dilutions of cell lysates were plated onto 7H11 agar and incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 weeks to determine the load of viable mycobacteria. The remaining wells were stained for phycoerythrin-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide to measure apoptosis as per manufacturer's protocol and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (3Saunders B.M. Fernando S.L. Sluyter R. Britton W.J. Wiley J.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5442-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells included both early apoptotic (Annexin V+/propidium iodide–) and late stage apoptotic (Annexin V+/propidium iodide+) cells.

For validation a number of isogenic strains with defined mutations were used. By considering metabolic reactions as well as signal transduction processes influencing the relevant pathways, we were able to describe quantitatively the phenomenon of catabolite repression in E. coli. We verified model predictions by measuring time courses of several extra- and intracellular components such as glycolytic intermediates, EII-ACrr phosphorylation level, both LacZ and PtsG concentrations, and total cAMP concentrations under various growth conditions. The entire data base consists of 18 experiments performed with nine different strains. The model describes the expression of 17 key enzymes, 38 enzymatic reactions, and the dynamic behavior of more than 50 metabolites. The different phenomena affecting the phosphorylation level of EIIACrr, the key regulation molecule for inducer exclusion and catabolite repression in enteric bacteria, can now be explained quantitatively.

The different phenomena affecting the phosphorylation level of EIIACrr, the key regulation molecule for inducer exclusion and catabolite repression in enteric bacteria, can now be explained quantitatively. Catabolite repression in Escherichia coli designates the observation that if different carbohydrates are present in a medium under unlimited conditions, one of them is usually taken up preferentially. Although the fundamental biochemical principles of the regulatory network have been revealed, a quantitative description of this growth behavior is still missing. The center of the regulatory network is formed by the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 4The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PTS, phosphotransferase system; Hpr, histidine-containing protein, cAMP-CRP, receptor protein. 4The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PTS, phosphotransferase system; Hpr, histidine-containing protein, cAMP-CRP, receptor protein.:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS). These systems are involved in both transport and phosphorylation of a large number of carbohydrates, in movement toward these carbon sources (chemotaxis), and in regulation of a number of metabolic pathways (1Plumbridge J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Zeppenfeld T. Larisch C. Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4443-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The PTS in E. coli consist of two common cytoplasmatic proteins, EI (enzyme I) and HPr (histidine-containing protein), as well as an array of carbohydrate-specific EII (enzyme II) complexes. Because all components of the PTS, depending on their phosphorylation status, can interact with various key regulator proteins, the output of the PTS is represented by the degree of phosphorylation of the proteins involved in phosphoryl group transfer, e.g. unphosphorylated EIIACrr inhibits the uptake of other non-PTS carbohydrates by a process called inducer exclusion. Phosphorylated EIIACrr activates the adenylate cyclase (CyaA) and leads to an increase in the intracellular cAMP level.Understanding the regulation of carbohydrate uptake requires a quantitative description of the PTS. In this context it is important that the degree of phosphorylation of EIIACrr is proportional to the PEP/pyruvate ratio, when no carbohydrates are transported (4Hogema B.M. Arents J.C. Bader R. Eijkemanns K. Yoshida H. Takahashi H. Aiba H. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and the respective equilibrium constant is an upper boundary when the PTS is active (5Kremling A. Fischer S. Sauter T. Bettenbrock K. Gilles E.D. BioSystems. 2004; 73: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PTS should therefore not be regarded as a measure for the transport of PTS substrates but more as a general measure for carbohydrate availability. One feature of our contribution in this study is the dynamic simulation of uptake and degradation of several carbohydrates using a single set of parameters and the validation of the model with measurements including the degree of phosphorylation of EIIACrr.Previously, a detailed mathematical model describing diauxic growth behavior of E. coli on a mixture of glucose and lactose has been presented (6Kremling A. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It describes the dynamics of a number of important metabolic components and enzymes, including gene expression. In the present study, using a number of isogenic strains with defined mutations we have extended the model to include the uptake of additional carbohydrates (glycerol, sucrose, and galactose). By combining these carbohydrate pathways with the signal transduction processes, it was possible to set up a comprehensive mathematical model of catabolite repression in E. coli. Fig. 1 sketches the metabolic pathways and regulatory interactions considered in the model.The intention of this contribution is to model a well known biological system in a detailed, realistic, and quantitative manner, to demonstrate the use of appropriate tools and methods, and to show how the iterative process of experimental verification and model adaptations can lead to a deeper understanding of biological systems as well as the formulation of new biological problems. This is in contrast to other models of inducer exclusion, which describe the system simply as a switch between different steady states (8Covert M.W. Palsson B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28058-28064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), exclude the dynamics of the regulatory network (9Chassagnole C. Noisommit-Rizzi N. Schmid J.W. Mauch K. Reuss M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 79: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), or describe only small parts of the system (10Setty Y. Mayo A.E. Surette M.G. Alon U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 7702-7707Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Wong P. Gladney S. Keasling J.D. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).The overall strategy for experimental model verification comprises three ideas: (i) stimulating the system in different time frames by slow or fast changes of the environmental situation; (ii) providing conditions that allow growth under carbohydrate limited and unlimited conditions, respectively; and (iii) constructing a set of isogenic mutant strains with defined mutations in genes involved in the pathway of interest. Model predictions were verified by measuring several extra- and intracellular components, i.e. glycolytic intermediates, EIIACrr phosphorylation levels, protein concentrations of both LacZ and PtsG, and total cAMP concentrations under various growth conditions. The entire data base consists of 18 experiments performed with nine different strains.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, Media, and Growth Conditions—All strains used were isogenic derivatives of LJ110, constructed by standard P1kc transduction techniques (7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Strains and the relevant mutations are listed in Table 1. The glk::cat mutation of BL2 was taken from strain DM1000 (12Meyer D. Schneider-Fresenius C. Horlacher R. Peist R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dgsA::Tn10kan mutation was taken from strain KM563, kindly provided by W. Boos (University of Konstanz). The sucrose positive derivative of LJ110, named LJ210, was constructed essentially as follows. The 9.2-kb EcoRV/HindIII fragment from pJoe637 (13Schmid K. Ebner R. Altenbuchner J. Schmitt R. Lengeler J.W. Mol. Mocrobiol. 1988; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) carrying the genes for the PTS-dependent transport and metabolism of sucrose was cloned between the inverted repeat regions of the transposon Tn1721 yielding plasmid pKJL710. This plasmid with the artificial mini-Tn1721::scr+, which lacks the tnpA gene for a transposase, was used to transform strain CSH28 F′lac (14Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The tnpA gene was introduced into this strain by transformation of plasmid pPSO110 tnpA+ (3Zeppenfeld T. Larisch C. Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4443-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To select for transposition of the mini-Tn1721::scr+ onto the F′lac, strain CSH28/F′lac/pPSO110/pKJL710 was crossed with the prototrophic Scr-negative strain PS5 (15Hochhut B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Schmid K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard minimal medium plates with 0.2% sucrose as sole carbon source were used for the selection of PS5/F′lac::mini-Tn1721::scr+ transconjugants. A P1kc lysate was generated from one of the transconjugants and used to transfer the mini-Tn1721::scr+ into the chromosome of LJ110. Using standard Hfr and P1 mapping techniques the insertion of the mini-Tn1721::scr+ into the E. coli chromosome was located at 6 min (corresponding to position zag). All other strains and mutations and the construction of the plasmid F′8gal::ϕ(ptsGop-lacZ) have been described earlier (7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D.

Lerner S.A. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Carbohydrates were sterilized by filtration and added to the concentrations indicated in the figures. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. They were performed either in shaker flasks with volumes at least 5 times higher than the culture volume under vigorous shaking or in a Biostad B reactor (B. Braun, Biotech International). Cultures were stirred at 400 rpm and aerated with 1 liter of air/l culture volume/min. Antibiotics were added to the precultures but were omitted from the experimental culture to avoid side effects. Tetracycline was added to 10 mg/liter, chloramphenicol to 25 mg/liter, and kanamycin to 25 mg/liter.Analytical Methods—The concentration of biomass was determined by measuring the absorbance (optical density) of the culture at either 420 or 560 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Extracellular carbohydrates and acetate were determined enzymatically with the respective test kits of r-Biopharm GmbH (Germany). cAMP was quantified with the cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit from Sigma-Aldrich. All tests were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Measurement of β-galactosidase activities was performed as described (17Pardee B. Prestige L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 49: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The analysis of the EIIACrr phosphorylation state was carried out by Western blotting essentially as described by Takahashi et al. (18Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Contrary to the protocol, proteins were precipitated at –80°C at least overnight. Detection was performed with polyclonal EIIACrr antibodies from rabbit. As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were used, and detection was carried out by using the SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and a cooled charge-coupled device camera system (Intas) or by exposure to films. The sum of the two EIIACrr-specific bands in each lane was set to 100%. Time courses of glycolytic metabolites (glucose 6-phosphate, fructose, fructose 6-phosphate, PEP, and pyruvate) were measured as described elsewhere (19Ishizuka H. Hanamura A. Kunimura T. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Bergmeyer H.U. Methoden der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim (Bergstr.), Germany1979Google Scholar, 21Sauter T. Gilles E.D. J. Biotechnol. 2004; 110: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Simulation Environment and Parameter Identification—To set up the equations and perform simulation studies, the ProMoT/Diva environment was used (22Ginkel M. Kremling A. Nutsch T. Rehner R. Gilles E.D. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Parameter estimation was also performed using the program Diva as described previously (7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).According to the reference model (7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) the specific growth rate, μ, is assumed to be dependent on all incoming substrate fluxes rsi, weighted with yield coefficients Ysi, which leads to the formula. μ=Ys1rs1+Ys2rs2+…+Ysnrsn(Eq. 1) One problem, however, is that the yield coefficients are not constant for different growth conditions. Thus, for some experiments it was not possible to simulate the time course of biomass simultaneously with the time courses of sugar uptake. Because sugar uptake is proportional to biomass concentration and, additionally, the balances for the enzymes and proteins, rates of synthesis, degradation, and dilution term are in the same order of magnitude, incorrect predictions of the growth rate lead to large deviations in a number of state variables. To overcome this problem the following strategy has been used here. Based on the experimental data, the specific growth rate was determined as a piecewise constant function or as a spline function for each experiment and, finally, was used as an input into the system.RESULTSModel Formulation and Validation—To extend and validate the reference model (7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), additional experiments with differing carbon sources, conditions, and isogenic mutants were performed. Additional intracellular and extracellular states (extracellular acetate, galactose, sucrose, and glycerol, degree of phosphorylation of EIIACrr, concentration of EIICBGlc) were measured. Thus the PTS and its interactions with several uptake systems were observed under varying conditions. Metabolic pathways for sucrose, glycerol, and galactose were included in the model. Furthermore, a new biochemical scheme for induction of ptsG (23Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was incorporated. The mathematical model is composed of ordinary differential and algebraic equations (DAE system). A detailed documentation of the model is included in supplement 1.Although many kinetic parameters have been published in the past by other groups, the use of different strains and conditions in those studies made it necessary to repeat a number of experiments with a defined wild-type strain and isogenic mutant strains. The experiments provide an excellent basis for parameter estimation and model validation. Batch experiments with single growth substrates as well as with mixtures of two substrates were conducted. To analyze the influence of starting conditions, the same experiment was performed with varying preculture conditions. Pulse and fed batch experiments provided information about fast processes. Additionally, continuous cultures were used to study the behavior of the bacterial culture under limited carbohydrate conditions as well as the transition from saturating to limited carbohydrate supply. To summarize, the results from 18 different experiments were applied in the modeling process. Figures showing measurements and simulations of these experiments are shown in supplement 2. On the basis of these experiments and by application of the ProMoT/Diva environment (22Ginkel M. Kremling A. Nutsch T. Rehner R. Gilles E.D. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with sophisticated methods for sensitivity analysis and parameter analysis and estimation, 55 parameters could be estimated, which represents about 32% of all the parameters. The following sections of this article will demonstrate some of the results and discuss some alterations regarding the initial model.Regulation of pts Operon and ptsG Expression by cAMP ·CRP and Mlc—The glucose-specific PTS in E. coli consists of the cytoplasmic protein EIIACrr, encoded by the crr gene (part of the ptsHIcrr operon) and the membrane-bound protein EIICBGlc (gene ptsG), which transport and concomitantly phosphorylate glucose. The phosphoryl groups are transferred from PEP via successive phosphorelay reactions involving EI, HPr, EIIACrr, and EIICBGlc to the substrate. The regulation of the ptsG gene and of pts operon expression is very complex. Among others, two major regulators, the cAMP ·CRP complex and the repressor Mlc (also called DgsA, gene dgsA) (3Zeppenfeld T. Larisch C. Lengeler J.W. Jahreis K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4443-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Roehl R.A. Vinopal R.T. J.

It was demonstrated that unphosphorylated EIICBGlc can relieve the repression of ptsG gene expression by sequestering Mlc from its binding sites through a direct protein-protein interaction in response to glucose (3Zeppenfeld T.

Because intracellular cAMP levels are low during growth on glucose, these two antagonistic regulatory mechanisms guarantee a precise adjustment of ptsG expression levels under various growth conditions.Regulation of the ptsG gene by Mlc was incorporated into the model in order to analyze its effect on overall growth behavior. This is realized in the model as follows. For the glucose phosphorylation step of PTS, an irreversible bi-bi mechanism for the two substrates, extracellular and intracellular glucose, was applied (see Ref. 7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Either glucose or phosphorylated EIIACrr bind to EIICBGlc at first. This means that the following conformations of the PTS transporter occur: free EIICBGlc, the unphosphorylated complexes EIICBGlc·Glcex and EIICBGlc·Glcin and the phosphorylated complexes EIICBGlc·EIIAP, EIICBGlc·Glcex·EIIAP, and EIICBGlc·Glcin·EIIAP. All unphosphorylated conformations are now able to bind to Mlc but with different affinities. As a result of the parameter fitting, affinities of unphosphorylated complexes with glucose were much stronger than affinity of free EIICBGlc. This corresponds qualitatively to experimental results. 5K Jahreis, unpublished data. Using strains LZ110 and LJT172 (both dgsA+) and the dgsA-negative strain LJT171 (see Table 1), ptsG-lacZ expression as an indicator for the amount of EIICBGlc was monitored by measuring the β-galactosidase activity. Bacteria were pre-grown on glycerol or glucose and inoculated on glucose, glycerol, or a mixture of glucose and glycerol, respectively. These experiments were used to estimate parameters for ptsG expression.A basal activity of ptsG expression can be detected if cells are grown with glycerol alone (Fig. 2F, dash-dotted line). In cultures of strain LZ110 growing on glucose and glycerol, induction effects could be observed during the first (glucose) phase. EIICBGlc accumulated until the supply of glucose had been exhausted. During this growth phase, uptake of glycerol was prevented by inducer exclusion and low cAMP values. After depletion of glucose, Mlc became active and prevented further synthesis of EIICBGlc. By dilution through growth, the amount of EIICBGlc was now diminished (Fig. 2F, dashed line). In the dgsA mutant strain LJT171, during growth with glucose EIICBGlc was synthesized in approximately the same amounts as in LZ110. Differences became obvious during the second (glycerol) growth phase. Although in LZ110 ptsG is repressed during growth with glycerol, in LJT171 it is induced even more strongly. This can be attributed to the lack of inhibition by Mlc and to higher intracellular cAMP levels during growth with glycerol. Extracellular cAMP accumulated in large amounts in the medium (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Diauxic growth on glucose and glycerol (preculture glucose) of strain LJT171 (dgsA–) (plots A–F), LZ110 (plot F), and LJT172 (plot F).

Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3827-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the weak effect of regulation by Mlc and cAMP ·CRP on pts operon expression, it was neglected in the previous model (7Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the PTS proteins were set to be constant. This model variant allowed the simulation of a number of experiments, but interestingly, one type of experiment, the so-called “disturbed” batch, could not be reproduced. In these experiments the cells are grown on a single carbon source and glucose is pulsed in the midlog phase of growth. The feeding of glucose results in dramatic changes of the phosphorylation level of EIIACrr. Disturbed batch experiments with glycerol and lactose were performed (Fig. 3).The glucose uptake rate after the pulse was drastically reduced (to less than one-third of that during growth on glucose). Two phenomena might be responsible for this effect. First, it has been verified experimentally for Salmonella typhimurium (33Rohwer J.M. Bader R. Westerhoff H.V. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that PTS velocity and activity are reduced by EIIACrr binding to LacY and GlpK. These interactions are considered in the model. As a second possibility, the concentrations of PTS enzymes could be reduced down to rate-limiting conditions.FIGURE 3Disturbed batch experiment with glucose pulse on culture of LJ110 (wild type) growing exponentially on glycerol (preculture glycerol). Time courses are as follows. A, concentrations of biomass (dashed line, x) and extracellular glycerol (solid line, open circles). B, concentration of extracellular glucose.

It was not possible to fit the curve by modulating the GlpK interaction with EIIACrr or by using different fixed concentrations of the PTS proteins. Therefore regulation of the pts operon expression by Mlc and by cAMP ·CRP was introduced into the model. Mlc activity was modeled as described and validated for ptsG expression. The slow uptake of glucose during disturbed batch experiments could then be described. Fig. 3B presents the results of different model variants (with and without regulated expression of EIICBGlc, HPr, and EI).It can now be stated that although the expression of the pts operon varies only by a factor of 2–3, this variation is important for the activity of the PTS under certain growth conditions. It may be that this is most obvious when cells are shifted quickly from poor substrates like glycerol to good (PTS) substrates. Al"

This mechanism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and bacterial enteritis. The sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT-1) is responsible for active glucose uptake in enterocytes. The aim was to investigate the effects of SGLT-1 glucose uptake on enterocyte apoptosis and barrier defects induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SGLT-1-transfected Caco-2 cells were treated with LPS (50 mug/mL) in low (5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose media. LPS in low glucose induced caspase-3 cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and increased paracellular permeability to dextran in epithelial cells. These phenomena were significantly attenuated in high glucose. LPS increased SGLT-1 activity in high, but not low glucose media. Addition of phloridzin, which competitively binds to SGLT-1, inhibited the cytoprotection mediated by high glucose. Western blot showed that LPS in high glucose increased the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L,) and did not change proapoptotic Bax. Differential extraction of membranous vs. cytosolic cell components demonstrated that high glucose inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c translocation to cytosol. Collectively, SGLT-1-mediated glucose uptake increases anti-apoptotic proteins, and protects enterocytes from LPS-induced apoptosis and barrier defects. The understanding of this novel glucose-mediated rescue mechanism may lead to therapeutic interventions for various enteric diseases."

Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) are known to act as a MAP3K in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the p38 MAPK cascades (2Deacon K.

NF-κB is a family of transcription factors involved in inflammation and innate immunity (9Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through an interaction with a family of inhibitory proteins, IκB. In response to extracellular stimuli, the IκB proteins are phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, then ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded, which leads to the nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB (10Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4591) Google Scholar, 11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). One of the most potent NF-κB activators is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a major proinflammatory cytokine. TNF-α functions through two distinct surface receptors, a 55-kDa receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and a 75-kDa receptor 2 (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 plays the predominant role in induction of cellular responses by soluble TNF-α (12Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The binding of TNF-α to TNF-R1 leads to the recruitment of TNF-R1-associated death domain (TRADD), and TRADD further recruits TNF-receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar) and Receptor-interacting protein (RIP) (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). RIP interacts directly with TRADD via its death domain (14Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that TRAF2 plays an essential role in IKK recruitment to the TNF-R1 complex (16Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), but IKK activation requires the presence of RIP in the same complex (16Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 17Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). However, the kinase activity of RIP is not required for RIP to mediate TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (15Ting A.T. Pimentel M.F. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that IKK activation requires its phosphorylation by an upstream kinase(s) other than RIP. Indeed, genetic studies using murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient in MEKK3 demonstrate that TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation is severely impaired in these cells (6Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that MEKK3, but not its homolog MEKK2, connects RIP to IKK complex and a direct recruitment of MEKK3 to TNF-R1 is sufficient to restore NF-κB activation in the absence of RIP (18Blonska M. You Y. Geleziunas R. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, published data (7Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

However, the mechanism by which TAK1 is involved in TNF-α signaling pathway remains to be determined. Therefore, we hypothesized that MEKK3 and TAK1 link RIP to IKK in TNF-α signaling. In this study, we found that TAK1 was recruited into TNF-R1 in a RIP-dependent manner. Moreover, TAK1 physically interacted with MEKK3 and modulated MEKK3 phosphorylation in a TAB1-dependent manner. Activation of both TAK1 and MEKK3 was necessary for NF-κB activation. Reagents and Plasmids—Antibodies specific for Myc (A14) or FLAG (M2) epitope tags and for TAK1 (C-9), TAB1 (N-19), IKKβ (H-470), and β-tubulin (D-10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-IκBα monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-MEKK2/3 antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with phospho-MEKK2 peptide (CSGTGMK(P)SVTGTPYW) (34Zhang D. Facchinetti V. Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. EMBO J. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Antibodies specifically recognizing the Thr-187 phosphorylated form of TAK1 were described previously (21Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Saiki I.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin B was purchased from Sigma. The coding sequences of TAK1, TAK1 (1–299), TAK1 (301–579), and RIP death domain (558–671) were amplified from previously constructed plasmids by PCR (3Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J.

A kinase-deficient form of TAK1 was generated by replacing the active-site lysine at position 63 with alanine. The plasmids encoding Myc-TAK1, Myc-TAK1(K63A), and the deletion mutant of TAK1 were constructed by inserting the BamHI/EcoRI fragments into corresponding sites of the pRK-Myc vector. For TAK1-DD, the XbaI/EcoRI fragment of TAK1 followed by a EcoRI/BamHI fragment of the death domain of RIP were inserted into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA3.1(-) vector in frame with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. All expression plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids encoding FLAG-MEKK3, Myc-MEKK3, Myc-MEKK2, Myc-MEKK2(K395M), Myc-Cot, and Myc-Cot(K167M) were described previously (18Blonska M.

The target sequence for TAK1 gene silencing was: GUAGAUCCAUCCAAGACUUUU (sense sequence) and 5′-PAAGUCUUGGAUGGAUCUACUU (antisense sequence). Cell Cultures and Transfection—RIP-deficient Jurkat T cells (RIP-) were kindly provided by B. Seed (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) (15Ting A.T. Pimentel M.F. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Wild type and RIP- cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryo kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics described above. Cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passed every 3 days. Stable transfection of RIP- cells was established by electroporation using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V, 950 microfarads. Plasmid (10 μg) encoding FLAG-TAK1-DD or FLAG-RIP WT was transfected into 1 × 107 RIP- cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and than treated with G418 (1 mg/ml) for 2 weeks. The clones that were resistant to G418 were collected and examined for the presence of a fusion protein or FLAG-RIP. HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (1–4 μg DNA per 7 × 105 cells). Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Jurkat, RIP-, and RIP- WT cells were used to examine the recruitment of TNF-R1 and TAK1 into the aggregated lipid raft after TNF-R1 cross-linking. Briefly, one-million cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin B (8 μg/ml) to label lipid rafts at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed and treated with 2 μg/ml goat anti-TNF-R1 agonistic antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 4 °C for 60 min. Unbound antibody was removed by washing twice. To show the capping of TNF-R1, cells were incubated with Alexa 594 conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies at 1:100 dilution at 4 °C for 60 min. Capping was induced by warming cells to 37 °C for 10 min. Next, cells were harvested and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated glasses by cytospin. To show a localization of TAK1, the cells treated with anti-goat secondary antibodies as a cross-linker were permeabilized and stained with anti-TAK1 antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor® 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Unstimulated controls were sequentially exposed to TNF-R1 antibodies and secondary antibody at 4 °C only. Fluorescence was detected using an Olympus FluoView FV300 confocal laser scanning biological microscope. Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected with different vectors and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot or immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 (or anti-c-Myc)-agarose affinity gel (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer 4 times and eluted with 2 × SDS loading buffer. After boiling (4 min), the samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells (3 × 105 in 12-well plate) were transfected with reporter plasmid encoding 5xNF-κB-luc (60 ng) and pEF-Renilla-luc (10 ng) together with plasmids encoding the desired genes using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Twenty hours later, the transfected cells were either untreated or stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured with dual-luciferase assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). NF-κB activities were determined by normalization of NF-κB-dependent Firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat wild type or mutant cells after various stimulations. Cells (2 × 107) were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The nuclei were pelleted, and the cytoplasmic proteins were carefully removed. The nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). After vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min), and the nuclear proteins in the supernatant were collected. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Nuclear extract (10 μg) was incubated with a 32P-labeled, double-stranded, NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide probe or Oct-1 probe as a control (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation, samples were fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were performed in yeast strain AH109 transformed by a standard lithium acetate method. Yeast plasmids were generated by inserting sequence encoding TAK1 downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBK-T7 vector and truncated forms of MEKK3 (1–367, MEKK3rd; 354–626, MEKK3kd) downstream of the Gal4 activation domain in the pGAD-T7 vector (Clontech). TAK1 Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB Activation—A previous study (7Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) suggests that TAK1 is involved in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. To verify this finding, we performed a siRNA experiment. HEK293 cells were transfected with TAK1 siRNA, which resulted in the effective knock-down of TAK1 (Fig. 1A) and co-transfected with a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with TNF-α, and luciferase activity was determined. Consistent with previous findings, TAK1 knock-down resulted in a significant reduction of NF-κB activation in TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Critical Role of RIP in TAK1 Recruitment to the TNF-R1 Complex—It has been shown that RIP is required for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (16Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 17Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Our previous studies also showed that direct recruitment of the IKK complex to the TNF-R1 complex was not sufficient to bypass the requirement of RIP (18Blonska M. You Y. Geleziunas R. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the role of RIP is to recruit a downstream kinase that will, in turn, activate the IKK complex. To determine whether a recruitment of TAK1 to the TNF-R1 complex is dependent on RIP we performed a localization experiment using a confocal microscopy technique. Consistent with previous observations (23Leger D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), TNF-R1 was recruited to lipid raft in Jurkat T cells upon stimulation with anti-TNF-R1 agonistic antibodies (Fig. 2, left top panels). Although TAK1 was translocated to the lipid raft in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2, left bottom panels), it failed to do so in RIP- cells (Fig. 2, middle bottom panels). In contrast, the translocation of TNF-R1 (Fig. 2, middle top panels) and TRAF2 (data not shown) was not affected. Moreover, reconstitution of RIP- cells with WT RIP restored TAK1 recruitment to the lipid raft (Fig. 2, right bottom panels). These results suggest that RIP plays a critical role in the recruitment of TAK1 to the TNF-R1 complex. TAK1-DD Fusion Protein Restores TNF-α-induced NF-κB Activation in RIP-deficient Cells—Our previous studies (18Blonska M. You Y. Geleziunas R. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that a direct recruitment of MEKK3 to the TNF-R1 complex by a fusion protein of MEKK3 and the death domain (DD) of RIP (MEKK3-DD) effectively restored TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in RIP-deficient cells. To examine whether the direct recruitment of TAK1 to the TNF-R1 complex can also bypass the requirement of RIP, we used the same strategy by constructing a fusion protein containing TAK1 and the death domain of RIP (TAK1-DD) and reconstituted RIP- cells with TAK1-DD (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of fusion protein did not alter the expression levels of endogenous TAK1 in TAK1-DD stable cell line. To confirm that TAK1-DD could be recruited into the TNF-R1 complex in a signal-dependent manner, the cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with TNF-α, and TNF-R1 complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF-R1 antibody-conjugated beads. We found that TAK1-DD fusion protein was recruited into TNF-R1 complexes following TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3C). Next, TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Indeed, we found that the expression of TAK1-DD in RIP-deficient cells fully restored TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in the absence of RIP (Fig. 3D). Consistent with these results, IκBα was phosphorylated in the TNF-α-treated TAK1-DD cells (Fig. 3E). These data indicate that RIP-dependent recruitment of TAK1 is sufficient for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, which further support the hypothesis that the major role of RIP is to recruit the downstream kinases such as TAK1. TAK1 Regulates the Activity of MEKK3—Since both TAK1-DD (Fig. 3) and MEKK3-DD (18Blonska M. You Y. Geleziunas R. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) can effectively restore TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in RIP-deficient cells, and both TAK1 (7Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 20Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) and MEKK3 (6Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) are required for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, we postulated that TAK1 and MEKK3 might functionally interact. It has been shown that transient transfection of MEKK3 constitutively activates this kinase and results in MEKK3 phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism. This phosphorylation of MEKK3 is correlated with the activation of downstream MAPKs and NF-κB. To examine whether TAK1 regulates the function of MEKK3, we ectopically expressed MEKK3 and TAK1 in HEK293 cells. Expression of MEKK3 alone resulted in an autophosphorylation of MEKK3 (Fig. 4A, lane 2) and NF-κB activation (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, co-transfected TAK1 or its kinase-deficient mutant, TAK1(K63A), together with MEKK3 prevented MEKK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 6) and inhibited MEKK3-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4B). These effects were dose-dependent (Fig. 4C) and specific for TAK1, since co-expression of other MAP3Ks, such as Cot, MEKK2, and their kinase-defective mutants, did not affect the phosphorylation of MEKK3 (Fig. 4D). Consistent with previous observations that TAK1 did not exhibit kinase activity when expressed alone (4Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the ectopic expression of TAK1 did not lead to the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the ectopically expressed TAK1 is in its inactive form. Thus, our results suggest that the inactive TAK1 inhibits the function of MEKK3. It has been shown that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) (24Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and this interaction is required for phosphorylation-dependent TAK1 activation (25Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An overexpression study demonstrated that TAK1 was phosphorylated and activated when co-transfected with TAB1 and the TAB1-TAK1 complex mediated NF-κB activation (4Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether co-expression of TAK1 with TAB1 affected MEKK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). We found that MEKK3 phosphorylation was inhibited by expression of TAK1 alone (Fig. 5A, lane 7), but importantly, this inhibition was reverted in the presence of TAB1 (Fig. 5A, lane 8). However, TAB1 could not restore TAK1(K63A)-mediated inhibition of MEKK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lane 12). In contrast, the expression of MEKK3 did not affect a TAB1-dependent phosphorylation of TAK1 (Fig. 5A, lane 8). The phosphorylation of MEKK3 and TAK1 was correlated with NF-κB activation (Fig. 5B), since NF-κB activation was observed when either MEKK3 or TAK1 was phosphorylated (Fig. 5A, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 8). Together, these results suggest that TAK1 regulates the activity of MEKK3, and this regulation is dependent on the kinase activity of TAK1. To further determine how TAK1-TAB1 regulates MEKK3 phosphorylation, we constructed two truncated forms of TAK1: TAK1kd, which contains the N-terminal kinase domain, and TAK1rd, which contains the C-terminal regulatory domain (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, expression of both TAK1kd and TAK1rd inhibited MEKK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 7). In contrast to the full-length TAK1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 3), TAK1kd- and TAK1rd-mediated inhibition of MEKK3 phosphorylation could not be restored by expression of TAB1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 6 and 8). These results indicate that both kinase domain and regulatory domain of TAK1 are important for the regulation of MEKK3 phosphorylation. TAK1 Associates with MEKK3—Since TAK1 functionally regulates MEKK3, we next examined whether TAK1 and MEKK3 could form a functional complex. HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged MEKK3 in the presence or absence of FLAG-tagged TAK1 or its kinase-defective mutant, TAK1(K63A). As shown in Fig. 7, MEKK3 was effectively co-precipitated with TAK1 and TAK1(K63A) (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 6 of the top panel). To examine whether TAK1 and MEKK3 directly interact, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interaction assay. We found that TAK1 directly associated with the N-terminal regulatory domain of MEKK3 (Fig. 6B). Together, these results suggest that the complex of TAK1 and MEKK3 may be involved in TNF-α-mediated activation of NF-κB. The Effect of TAB1 on MEKK3-TAK1 Association—Since TAK1 associates with MEKK3 and co-expression of TAB1 reverted TAK1-mediated inhibition of MEKK3 activity (Fig. 5), we next determined whether the observed TAB1 effects on TAK1-mediated inhibition of MEKK3 phosphorylation was due to that TAB1 competitively associated with the MEKK3-binding site in TAK1. To address this question, we examined the effect of TAB1 on MEKK3-TAK1 association. We co-transfected HEK293 cells with Myc-MEKK3 and Flag-TAK1 or TAK1(K63A) in the presence or absence of HA-TAB1. The resulted complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. We found that expression of MEKK3 effectively co-precipitatied TAK1 and TAK1(K63A) (Fig. 7C, lanes 3 and 5 of the top panel). Although TAB1 associated with TAK1 when co-expressed (Fig. 7C, lanes 4 and 6 of the middle panels), it did not prevent the association of TAK1 and MEKK3 (Fig. 7C, lanes 4 and 6 of the top panel). However, we were not able to detect a phosphorylated form of TAK1 in the MEKK3 complexes. These results suggest that a portion of TAK1 that is phosphorylated in the presence of TAB1 can dissociate from MEKK3. This dissociation may be required for MEKK3 phosphorylation and subsequent activation of NF-κB. TAK1 Functions Upstream of MEKK3 and Downstream of RIP—Since TAK1-DD restores TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in RIP-deficient cells and TAK1 modulates MEKK3 phosphorylation, it is conceivable that TAK1 functions upstream of MEKK3 and downstream of RIP. If this model is correct, we would expect that deleting TAK1 will only affect RIP-induced, but not MEKK3-induced, NF-κB activation. To test this hypothesis, we performed a siRNA experiment. HEK293 cells were transfected with TAK1 siRNA or control siRNA. Western blot analysis indicated that TAK1 siRNA, but not the control, significantly reduced TAK1 protein levels (Fig. 8A and B). These cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding RIP or MEKK3 and a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter. We found that the knock-down of endogenous TAK1 significantly blocked NF-κB activation induced by RIP (Fig. 8A). In contrast, activation of NF-κB by overexpressed MEKK3 was comparable in cells transfected with mock and TAK1 siRNA (Fig. 8B). Together, these results suggest that TAK1 indeed acts downstream of RIP but upstream of MEKK3 in TNF-α signaling pathway. The results of this and previous studies (6Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 7Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B.

Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrate that both TAK1 and MEKK3 are critical mediators of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. To date, it is not clear why both of these kinases mediate cytokine-induced IKK activation. Genetic studies using MEKK3-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrate that TNF-α induced NF-κB activation is almost completely abolished in these cells (6Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). On the other hand a knock-down of endogenous TAK1 by siRNAs also significantly impairs NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α treatment (Ref. 7Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 of this study). Furthermore, several studies confirmed that TAK1 mediates IL-1-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway (26Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 27Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 28Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), but a more recent study has demonstrated that MEKK3-/- MEF cell line is also defective in NF-κB activation upon IL-1 treatment (8Huang Q. Yang J. Lin Y. Walker C. Cheng J. Liu Z.G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During a reviewing process of our manuscript, Sato et al. (20Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) published the first genetic evidence that TAK1 was required for TNF-α and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. They generated MEF expressing nonfunctional form of TAK1 and demonstrated that these cells were defective in TNF-α, IL-1R, and LPS signaling (20Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that both TAK1 and MEKK3 may play an essential and nonredundant role in TNF-α- and IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. Our results demonstrate that TAK1 functions downstream of RIP (Fig. 8A), which is consistent with a recent report showing that TAK1 constitutively forms a complex with its adaptor protein TAB2 (3Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 19: 346-351Crossref Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), and TAB2 is capable to bind to polyubiquitinated RIP following TNF-α stimulation (30Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.-K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.-H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In this study, we also demonstrated that TAK1 was recruited to the TNF-R1 complex in a RIP-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Moreover, we constructed a fusion protein composed of full-length TAK1 and death domain of RIP (TAK1-DD) and found that this fusion protein fully restored NF-κB activation in RIP-deficient (RIP-) cells (Fig. 3), suggesting the major role of RIP is to recruit downstream kinases to the TNF-R1 complex. Using the same strategy, recently we also found that MEKK3-DD fusion protein could fully restore NF-κB activation in RIP- cells (18Blonska M. You Y. Geleziunas R. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data suggest that RIP-dependent recruitment of TAK1, as well as MEKK3, is required for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Since TAK1-DD and MEKK3-DD can bypass the requirement of RIP, we postulate that both kinases function downstream of RIP. However, how TAK1 and MEKK3 are activated after being recruited to the TNF-R1 complex remains unknown. To date, upstream regulators of MEKK3 have not been identified, and little is known about the phosphorylation of MEKK3 in cells under physiological conditions. Transient transfection of MEKK3 constitutively activates this kinase and results in MEKK3 phosphorylation by an unknown mechanism. The results of this study suggest that TAK1 can modulate phosphorylation of MEKK3. Expression of TAK1 or kinase-defective mutant, TAK1(K63A), specifically blocked phosphorylation of MEKK3 and subsequent NF-κB activation (Fig. 4). These effects were reverted by co-expression of TAB1 together with TAK1, but not with TAK1(K63A) (Fig. 5), indicating that the kinase activity of TAK1 is involved in this regulation. Since TAB1 is essential for TAK1 kinase activity (25Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Mizukami J. Sugita T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is likely that the activated TAK1-TAB1 complex is responsible for MEKK3 phosphorylation. This result suggests that TAK1 could function as a kinase that directly or indirectly regulates MEKK3 by phosphorylation. To test this possibility we performed a kinase assay using a kinase-inactive mutant of MEKK3, MEKK3(K391A), as a substrate for activated TAK1 or constitutively active TAK1-TAB1 fusion protein described earlier (31Sakurai H. Nishi A. Sato N. Mizukami J. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 11: 1277-1281Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we did not observed phosphorylation of MEKK3 by TAK1 (data not shown), suggesting that MEKK3 is not a direct substrate for TAK1. Another potential mechanism to explain the effect of TAK1 on MEKK3 activation is that the activated TAK1 promotes an oligomerization of MEKK3, which could induce a kinase activity of MEKK3 leading to its autophosphorylation. Indeed, it has been reported that MEKK3 is able to form dimers, which lead to their self-phosphorylation and activation (32Cheng J. Yu L. Zhang D. Huang Q. Spencer D. Su B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13477-13482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We speculate that in resting cells, MEKK3 may be associated with a specific inhibitor that prevents a MEKK3 dimerization. A similar inhibitor has been described for MEKK2 (33Cheng J. Zhang D. Kim K. Zhao Y. Zhao Y. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5955-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of cells, the activated TAK1 could phosphorylate a hypothetical inhibitor resulting in MEKK3 activation. We will test this hypothesis in the future studies. Our results demonstrate that TAK1 and MEKK3 form a functional complex (Fig. 7). Moreover, TAK1-MEKK3 interaction is not affected by overexpressed TAB1, but TAB1 is required for TAK1 activation and subsequent MEKK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the expression of MEKK3 did not affect TAB1-dependent phosphorylation of TAK1 (Fig. 5A), but inactive TAK1 inhibited the function of MEKK3 (Fig. 4 and 5), suggesting that TAK1 acts upstream of MEKK3. To confirm this important finding, we performed a siRNA experiment to knock-down TAK1 in cells. We found that activation of NF-κB by overexpressed MEKK3 was comparable in cells transfected with mock and TAK1 siRNA. In contrary, TAK1-knockdown resulted in significant reduction of RIP-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 8). These results suggest that TAK1 may function upstream of MEKK3 and downstream of RIP. However, overexpression of TAK1-TAB1 can still activate NF-κB in MEKK3-deficient MEF cells (data not shown). One explanation is that the overexpressed TAK1-TAB1 may activate other kinase such as NIK leading to activation of NF-κB as shown previously (26Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Therefore, the exact mechanism by which TAK1 and MEKK3 cooperate to activate NF-κB will need to be further investigated. In summary, our data show that both TAK1 and MEKK3 are critically involved in RIP-dependent NF-κB activation in the TNF-α signaling pathway. Moreover, we show that TAK1 physically interacts with MEKK3 and modulates MEKK3 phosphorylation. Further study is required to determine the exact mechanisms by which TAK1 regulates MEKK3.

Molecular events that accompany these changes were investigated in brain microvessels extracted using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to a 20 min transient global cerebral ischemia followed by 1, 6, or 24 h reperfusion. Proteins extracted from approximately 300 LCM captured microvessels (20-100 microm) were ICAT-labeled and analyzed by nanoLC-MS. In-house software was used to identify paired ICAT peaks, which were then sequenced by nanoLC-MS/MS. Pattern analyses using k-means clustering method classified 57 differentially expressed proteins in 7 distinct dynamic patterns. Protein function was assigned using Panther Classification system. Early reperfusion (1 h) was characterized by down-regulation of ion pumps, nutrient transporters, and cell structure/motility proteins, and up-regulation of transcription factors, signal transduction molecules and proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and proteins involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling and anti-oxidative defense was observed in late reperfusion (6-24 h). The up-regulation of IL-1beta and TGF-1beta in ischemic brain vessels was confirmed by ELISA, quantitative PCR, and/or immunohistochemistry. A biphasic postischemic (1 and 24 h) BBB opening for (3)H-sucrose was evident in the same model. Differentially expressed proteins identified in brain vessels during reperfusion are likely involved in orchestrating functional vascular responses to ischemia, including the observed BBB disruption."

Polypeptides emerging from ribosomes must fold into stable three-dimensional structures maintained for the life span of the protein. Unfolded proteins lack functionality and have a high probability of aggregating and/or interacting non-specifically with other cellular components, both of which pose a serious danger to cells. Organisms have evolved protective mechanisms to enable their cells to safely handle unfolded proteins. Molecular chaperones recognize common features of non-native polypeptides and promote folding. Proteins that cannot be rescued are degraded, typically via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6880) Google Scholar). The two systems can work cooperatively as Hsc70 and other molecular chaperones are known to recruit the ubiquitylation apparatus to facilitate the degradation of their clients (2McDonough H. Patterson C. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, much remains to be learned regarding the mechanism of “molecular triaging,” the cellular decision to persist in attempting to fold unruly substrates or target them for destruction (3Wickner S.

The use of cell-permeant proteasome inhibitors in short pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments revealed that a quarter or more of newly synthesized proteins in both cultured cells and cells immediately removed from animals are degraded by proteasomes within 30 min of their synthesis (4Princiotta M.F.

In the cells of vertebrate organisms, the oligopeptide degradation products of RDPs appear to be the major source of cellular and viral peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules to the immune system (6Schubert U.

We previously defined defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) as polypeptides that fail to attain a stable conformation due to errors in transcription, mRNA processing, translation, folding, post-translational modification, localization, or inability to find a stabilizing partner (8Yewdell J.W. Schubert U. Bennink J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 845-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increasing number of studies incriminate DRiPs as the principal source of antigenic peptides from apparently stable proteins (9Yewdell J.W. Immunol.

Given the sheer abundance of RDPs, their involvement in antigen presentation, and their potential contribution to disease processes in the event of faulty triaging, it is important to understand their nature and manner of degradation. In the present study we characterize RDPs by quantitative biochemical analysis and precise temporal kinetic analysis of antigen presentation at the level of individual cells. Cells and Viruses—HeLa, L-Kb, and 293-Kb cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. ts20 and E36 cells were cultured at 32 °C. Recombinant adenoviruses (rAdVs) expressing Hsc70(WT) or Hsc70(K71M) and tTA-expressing HeLa cells have been described, and recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing SIINFEKL-containing proteins have been described (4Princiotta M.F.

Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 20 min at 37 °C in balanced salt solution/bovine serum albumin and then incubated at 37 °C in complete growth medium for the remainder of the assay. Plasmids, Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and Transfection—Plasmid pZsProSensor-1 was purchased from Clontech, Palo Alto, CA. To generate small interfering RNA for HuS4, a dsRNA (target sequence, AACAUGCACCGUCCAUCGUGU) was synthesized (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). Transfection with plasmids or dsRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Biochemical Procedures—Metabolic labeling and detergent fractionation procedures have been described in detail (10Qian S.B. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 271-281PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed by standard chemiluminescence methodology. Anti-Hsc70 antibody was purchased from Stressgen (Vancouver, Canada), and anti-hemagglutinin epitope antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal antibodies against HuS4, HuS6, and the α subunit of proteasome were purchased from Affiniti Research Products, Ltd. (Exeter, England). Cytofluorography—Levels of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were determined on viable cells by flow cytometry as described (4Princiotta M.F. Finzi D. Qian S.B. Gibbs J.

Biochemical Characterization of RDPs—We measured the degradation of nascent HeLa cell proteins by radiolabeling cells for 5 min with [35S]Met and chasing for up to 4 h with unlabeled Met. Protein degradation was determined by measuring radioactivity present in trichloroacetic acid precipitates of whole cell lysates and culture media. Proteasomal involvement in protein degradation was determined by incubating cells with the cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor MG132, first added to cells at the time of radiolabeling to minimize the downstream effects of proteasome inhibition on other cellular processes. Under these conditions HeLa cells demonstrate a distinct biphasic degradation of newly synthesized proteins (Fig. 1A). At least 20% of proteins are degraded by proteasomes within 30 min of their synthesis (this is a minimal estimate since MG132 exhibits a lag period before attaining maximal inhibition, whereas the Vmax of [35S]Met incorporation is reached within seconds of adding it to cells). The half-lives of the short- and long-lived proteins differ nearly by 2 log numbers (Fig. 1B); notably the t1/2 of RDPs is less than the reported t1/2 of the most rapidly degraded proteins in mammalian cells. Nearly identical results were obtained after labeling with [3H]Leu (data not shown). To better understand the nature of RDPs, we used the mild detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100) to separate proteins into “soluble” and “insoluble” fractions. In the absence of MG132, the soluble fraction contained ∼80% of 5-min-pulsed radiolabeled proteins and demonstrated the biphasic decay kinetics observed for unfractionated cells (Fig. 1, C and D). The remaining ∼20% of labeled proteins fractionated into the insoluble fraction and remained nearly constant throughout the chase period. Treating cells with MG132 reduced the loss of radiolabeled proteins from the soluble fraction in the first 50 min and concomitantly increased the amount of proteins recovered from the insoluble fraction over the same period to a level accounting for ∼25% of RDPs (in absolute terms). By contrast, proteasome inhibitors had no significant effect on the detergent solubility of stable proteins identified by 12-h radiolabeling and 4-h chase (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, the dichotomy in nascent proteasome substrate solubility is not due to global effects of proteasome inhibitors on cellular physiology but, rather, reflects the distinct physical properties of the substrate pools. Similar results were obtained using other cell lines (HEK293, L929, Raji) or with lactacystin, a more specific proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). Differential Effects of Wild Type and Dominant-interfering Hsc70 on RDPs—Hsc70 appears to be the principal molecular chaperone involved in cytosolic protein biogenesis (11Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Since Hsc70 is abundant, modulating its effects requires a robust expression system. This has been elegantly achieved using rAdVs that expresses wild type Hsc70 or a dominant interfering mutant Hsc70(K71M) that sequesters and functionally inactivates endogenous Hsc70 (12Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Expression of rAdV-mediated Hsc70 expression is controlled by the “tetracycline-off” promoter, which enables the use of parallel control cells that precisely mimic the effects of rAdV infection on cellular physiology in the absence of transgene expression (12Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each protein has a hemagglutinin-epitope tag to enable discrimination from cellular Hsc70. Overnight rAdV infection of HeLa cells bearing the tTA transgene results in high expression of recombinant Hsc70 as detected using anti-hemagglutinin or anti-Hsc70 antibodies (Fig. 2A). Incubation of cells with doxycycline (Dox, a tetracycline analog) completely suppressed rAdV-mediated Hsc70 expression (Fig. 2A). To determine the effects of Hsc70 on the degradation of nascent proteins, we performed our standard pulse-chase/fractionation protocol using rAdV-infected cells cultured with and without doxycycline. rAdV expression of wild type Hsc70 decreased nascent protein degradation, whereas expression of Hsc70(K71M) had the opposite effect (Fig. 2, B and C). The addition of MG132 revealed that modulating Hsc70 activity strictly affected TX-100-soluble substrates. These data indicate that the fate of many soluble RDPs is dependent on the level of molecular chaperone activity in cells. By contrast, TX-100-insoluble substrates are largely unaffected by modulating functional levels of Hsc70. These substrates may represent polypeptides that are so severely misfolded that they cannot be rescued by molecular chaperones. Conversely, the failure of Hsc70(K71M) to increase the size of the insoluble fraction suggests that substrates that normally interact with Hsc70 possess sufficient native structure to resist loss of solubility and aggregation in its absence. Ubiquitin-independent Degradation of RDPs—Hsc70 in known through its interaction with CHIP to promote the destruction of misfolded proteins by cooperating with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (2McDonough H. Patterson C. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The failure of Hsc70 interference to decrease the degradation of TX-100-insoluble RDPs raises the question of the ubiquitin dependence of this process. We investigated this question using cells harboring thermolabile E1 (ts20) and parental cells expressing wild type E1 (E36) (13Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Science. 1993; 363: 552-554Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 41 °C for 2 h to inactivate E1. Further incubation at 37 °C in the presence of MG132 showed dramatic reduction in the amount of polyubiquitylated species in ts20 relative to E36 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the majority of E1 activity was impaired in these cells under this condition. Pretreated at 41 °C for 2 h followed by 37 °C incubation (hyperthermia) had only minor effects on both the amount and solubility of nascent proteasome substrates recovered from E36 cells after proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3, B and C). By contrast, ts20 cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in soluble RDPs after thermal inactivation of E1. Remarkably, E1 inactivation had little effect on the degradation of insoluble RDPs, as revealed by their similar accumulation after MG132 incubation in 41 °C or 32 °C pretreated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). The effects of E1 inactivation on RDP degradation suggest that as expected, soluble RDPs are predominantly degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Surprisingly, insoluble RDPs appear to be degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. To further explore this possibility, we measured the generation of major histocompatibility complex class I binding peptides from a metabolically stable protein using an antibody specific for major histocompatibility complex class I molecules bearing a defined antigenic peptide (4Princiotta M.F. Finzi D. Qian S.B. Gibbs J. Schuchmann S. Buttgereit F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2003; 18: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we can accurately and quantitatively assess DRiP degradation. We chose a well characterized substrate NP-S-GFP, a chimeric protein consisting of influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) genetically fused at its COOH terminus to a H-2Kb-binding peptide (SIINFEK(L)) and enhanced GFP. The mature folded protein is extremely stable, as measured either by pulse-chase analysis or by flow cytometry of GFP after protein synthesis inhibition (4Princiotta M.F. Finzi D. Qian S.B. Gibbs J. Schuchmann S. Buttgereit F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2003; 18: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). We also included (R)NP-S-GFP as a control, a classic “N-end rule” substrate with a NH2-terminal Ub and the first Met of NP replaced by Arg, that is degraded, with a t1/2 of ∼10 min (4Princiotta M.F. Finzi D. Qian S.B. Gibbs J. Schuchmann S. Buttgereit F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2003; 18: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Using the 25-D1.16 monoclonal antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 647, we quantitated Kb-SIINFEKL complexes on the surface of ts20 and E36 cells after infection with recombinant vaccinia virus. To examine the general effects of 41 °C pretreatment (“hyperthermia”) on the assembly and transport of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes, we infected cells with a rVV expressing the MSIINFEKL peptide as a minigene product and measured Kb-SIINFEKL complex formation by 25-D1.16 staining (the higher level of 25-D1.16 staining in E36-Kb reflects higher overall expression of Kb molecules). Hyperthermia slightly impaired Kb-SIINFEKL presentation on both parental and mutant cells (Fig. 4A). We next assessed E1 function in antigen processing from N-end rule substrate under these conditions by infecting cells with rVV/(R)NP-S-GFP (Fig. 4B). After exposure to 41 °C, ts20-Kb cells demonstrated higher levels of (R)NP-S-GFP as measured by GFP fluorescence. This effect is more impressive when considering the decreased NP-S-GFP expression exhibited by E36-Kb cells under the same conditions. Hyperthermia reduced Kb-SIINFEKL generation from (R)NP-S-GFP in nearly 10-fold in ts20-Kb cells while exerting only a slight effect in E36-Kb cells, consistent with the reduction in viral gene expression. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of E1 inactivation since the degradation of (R)NP-S-GFP is known to be ubiquitin-dependent. Despite the effectiveness of E1 inactivation in ts20 cells, it does not significantly affect Kb-SIINFEKL generation from NP-S-GFP (Fig. 4C). It is likely that thermal inactivation of E1 is incomplete in ts20 cells (15Cox J.H. Galardy P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that E1 exhibits any preference in associating with different E2s. Thus, whatever residual E1 activity is present after treatment at 41 °C should contribute equally to the degradation of different substrates. The insignificant effect of E1 inactivation on the generation of SIINFEKL from NP-S-GFP strongly suggests that the degradation of its DRiPs occurs mainly in a ubiquitin-independent manner. 19 S Regulator-independent Degradation of RDPs—A steadily increasing number of substrates has been described to be degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner, surprisingly by 20 S proteasomes in the absence of 19 S regulators (16Orlowski M. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-independent degradation of RDPs prompted us to examine the possible involvement of free 20 S proteasomes in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that the 26 S proteasome undergoes constant disassembly in vivo into 19 S and 20 S subunits, with the core 20 S protease being a stable structure (17Babbitt S.E. Kiss A. Deffenbaugh A.E. Chang Y.H. Bailly E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Buranda T. Sklar L.A. Baumler J. Gogol E. Skowyra D. Cell. 2005; 121: 553-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to interrupt the assembly of 26 S proteasomes in vivo using RNA interference to inhibit 19 S subunit gene expression, as has been achieved in Drosophila cells (18Wojcik C. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6188-6197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Transfecting 293-Kb cells with dsRNA specific for HuS4/Rpt2 (but not control dsRNA) reduced steady-state levels of the HuS4 subunit (Fig. 5A) and retarded cellular proliferation (data not shown). Reducing HuS4 levels did not affect the levels of another 19 S ATPase subunit but increased the levels of a 20 S proteasome α-subunit (Fig. 5A), consistent with findings in the Drosophila study (18Wojcik C. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6188-6197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We measured the functional integrity of 26 S proteasomes using an in situ native gel assay with the fluorogenic proteasome substrate succinyl-LLVY-amidomethylcoumarin (19Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates from HuS4 dsRNA-transfected cells demonstrated greatly reduced 26 S proteasome activity relative to control dsRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). Importantly, this finding argues against the compensatory formation of other large proteasome complexes with different regulatory particles, like PA28. We confirmed the effect of HuS4 dsRNA on 26 S proteasome activity in vivo by co-transfecting cells with pZsProSensor-1 plasmid that expresses the ZsGreen autofluorescent protein bearing a degradation motif at its COOH terminus. After 24 h of HuS4 dsRNA transfection, overall fluorescence intensity was increased ∼7 fold relative to control dsRNA transfection (Fig. 5C), demonstrating the effectiveness of RNA interference in knocking down 26 S proteasome activity. We next examined the effect of 19 S subunit knock-down on overall degradation of newly synthesized proteins in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5, D and E). HuS4 dsRNA-transfected cells showed a dramatic reduction in the level of soluble RDPs, consistent with the idea that these substrates are degraded by 26 S proteasomes. At the same time, HuS4 dsRNA had only a minor effect on the degradation of insoluble RDPs. These data suggest that there are two distinct populations of RDPs. The majority (∼75%) are degraded by 26 S proteasomes in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, whereas the remainder are largely degraded by 20 S proteasomes without ubiquitinylation. We next investigated the contribution of 20 S proteasomes to the generation of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes using rVVs to express SIINFEKL-containing gene products in cells previously transfected with pZsProSensor-1 and HuS4 dsRNA (Fig. 5F). To attain maximal inhibition of 26 S proteasomes by dsRNA, we gated on cells expressing the highest levels of ZsGreen using non-fluorescent cells (ZsGreen-) as a poorly transfected/non-transfected internal control group. After infection with the minigene product expressing rVV, there was only a slight difference in the generation of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes in ZsGreen+ versus ZsGreen- cells. By contrast, complex generation was greatly compromised from a misfolded form of NP (NP(KEKE)-S) that is known to be degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (20Anton L.C. Schubert U. Bacik I. Princiotta M.F. Wearsch P.A. Gibbs J. Day P.M. Realini C. Rechsteiner M.C. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), demonstrating the effectiveness of 26 S knockdown in the same cohort of cells (note that we could not use the GFP fusion proteins described above due to the prior expression of ZsGreen). Importantly HuS4 knockdown had only a marginal effect on antigen presentation from the stable protein NP-SIINFEKL. These data support the idea that NP-S-GFP DRiPs are principally degraded in a ubiquitin and 19 S regulator-independent manner. Characterization of Rapidly Degraded Forms of GFP—Although investigating the biochemical properties of the total cellular RDP pool is critical to understanding the general features of RDPs, it is also necessary to study the biochemical properties of individual gene products to understand how and why RDPs arise during protein synthesis. For this purpose we chose GFP, a highly stable, compact, single domain protein whose function can be directly measured by fluorometry. GFP was expressed by plasmid transfection of HeLa cells. Immunoblots using polyclonal antibodies specific for the COOH-terminal portion of GFP revealed a protein of the expected mobility in both TX-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 6A). Treating cells for 12 h with MG132 greatly increased the amount of insoluble GFP and slightly increased soluble GFP levels. The fluorescence of the GFP, however, was barely altered in either fraction, indicating that full-length GFP rescued by MG132 is misfolded and mostly insoluble. Given the high metabolic stability of fluorescent GFP in cells (4Princiotta M.F. Finzi D. Qian S.B. Gibbs J. Schuchmann S. Buttgereit F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 2003; 18: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), it is likely that this misfolded GFP is derived from DRiPs. In addition to the expected full-length GFP species, immunoblotting revealed another GFP antibody-reactive species of ∼22 kDa, which we term GFP(f1). Additional experiments with other GFP-containing chimeric proteins establish that it represents a COOH-terminal fragment of GFP that is probably generated by endoproteolytic cleavage and not internal initiation on downstream Met residues, since its levels are not affected by placing the GFP COOH-terminal to NP or other proteins (data not shown). GFP(f1) rescued by MG132 principally accumulates in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 6A). The enhanced recovery of GFP(f1) requires that cells are incubated with MG132 and is not achieved by adding MG132 to lysis buffer (data not shown), demonstrating that it is a genuine biosynthetic product with the characteristics of a bona fide DRiP and is not generated as a post-lysis artifact. To better understand the behavior and properties of GFP(f1), we studied it in parallel with a GFP-based proteasome substrate consisting of COOH-terminal GFP genetically fused to ubiquitin (21Qian S.B. Ott D.E. Schubert U. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38818-38826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whose cleavage from GFP is compromised (but not completely abrogated) by alteration of Gly76 to Val (22Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The degradation of this fusion protein (termed Ub-GFP) is mediated by polyubiquitylation via the NH2-terminal ubiquitin moiety (21Qian S.B. Ott D.E. Schubert U. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38818-38826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). As expected, Ub-GFP is rapidly degraded by transfected cells (Fig. 6A). MG132 treatment greatly increased the recovery of full-length Ub-GFP, liberated GFP, and GFP(f1). As with GFP-transfected cells, most GFP(f1) was recovered from the insoluble fraction, which exhibited little fluorescence. To determine the kinetics of the biogenesis and altered solubilities of GFP-based proteasome substrates, we generated a rAdV to attain sufficiently high expression of Ub-GFP to enable direct detection via SDS-PAGE of both Ub-GFP and GFP(f1) species among [35S]Met-labeled cellular proteins (Fig. 6B). This method provides the most quantitative measure of protein behavior since it avoids artifacts associated with variable antibody reactivity and protein recovery inherent to immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. In the absence of MG132, both Ub-GFP and GFP(f1) were degraded, with a t1/2 of ∼10 min (Fig. 6B). In the presence of MG132, most Ub-GFP remained in the soluble fraction during a 1 - chase, whereas GFP(f1) progressively accumulated in the insoluble fraction. Importantly, the total amount of GFP(f1) did not increase during the chase, indicating that GFP(f1) is generated either during or very shortly after translation of Ub-GFP. We next used AdV-Ub-GFP-infected ts20 cells to investigate the ubiquitin dependence of GFP(f1) and Ub-GFP degradation. After a 2-h incubation at 41 or 32 °C, cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]Met and chased for up to 60 min at 37 °C. We monitored degradation of Ub-GFP and GFP(f1) by direct SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates. Without prior 41 °C exposure of cells, degradation of both substrates was similar in E36 and ts20 cells (Fig. 6C). Two hours of 41 °C treatment slightly reduced Ub-GFP degradation in E36 cells but profoundly inhibited its degradation in ts20 cells, again demonstrating the effectiveness of E1 inactivation by thermal treatment (Fig. 6D). Remarkably, degradation of GFP(f1) by 41 °C-treated ts20 cells continued unimpeded, demonstrating that this specific substrate is degraded by proteasomes in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Finally, we examined the effect of 19 S knockdown on GFP(f1) degradation in AdV-Ub-GFP"

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the lipoprotein cyclophilin, SlrA, can catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline containing tetrapeptides and that SlrA contributes to pneumococcal colonization. The substrate specificity of SlrA is typical for prokaryotic and eukaryotic cyclophilins, with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (pNA) being the most rapidly catalyzed substrate. In a mouse pneumonia model the slrA knock-out D39ΔslrA did not cause significant differences in the survival times of mice compared with the isogenic wild-type strain. In contrast, a detailed analysis of bacterial outgrowth over time in the nasopharynx, airways, lungs, blood, and spleen showed a rapid elimination of slrA mutants from the upper airways but did not reveal significant differences in the lungs, blood, and spleen. These results suggested that SlrA is involved in colonization but does not contribute significantly to invasive pneumococcal disease. In cell culture infection experiments, the absence of SlrA impaired adherence to pneumococcal disease-specific epithelial and endothelial non-professional cell lines. Adherence of the slrA mutant could not be restored by exogenously added SlrA. Strikingly, deficiency in SlrA did not reduce binding activity to host target proteins, but resulted in enhanced uptake by professional phagocytes. In conclusion, SlrA is a functional, cyclophilin-type PPIase and contributes to pneumococcal virulence in the first stage of infection, namely, colonization of the upper airways, most likely by modulating the biological function of important virulence proteins.

There are three distinct families within the enzyme class of PPIases (EC 5.2.1.8): the cyclophilins, which bind the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, the FK506-binding proteins, and the parvulins. The classical PPIase such as rotamase A of Escherichia coli is a member of the cyclophilin family (1Ke H.M. Zydowsky L.D. Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9483-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2Mikol V. Kallen J. Pflugl G. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The FK506-binding proteins all have high affinity for the immunosuppressant drug FK506 (3Michnick S.W. Rosen M.K. Wandless T.J. Karplus M. Schreiber S.L.

Toews G.B. Engleberg N.C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) belong to the FK506-binding proteins. The parvulin family resembles enzymes such as parvulin, SurA, and PrsA. The E. coli parvulin 10 with its 92 amino acids is one of the smallest known PPIase enzymes and represents the prototype of this family (8Rahfeld J.U. Rucknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SurA contributes to the assembly of outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria (9Rouviere P.E. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3170-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). PrsA is considered to be involved in enzyme secretion and activation in Gram-positive bacteria (10Jacobs M.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a frequent colonizer of the human host. During colonization, the bacterium adheres to the nasopharyngeal epithelium, a dynamic process that requires various adhesion molecules such as the major pneumococcal adhesin, which interacts in a human specific manner with the secretory component of the polymeric Ig receptor (13Hammerschmidt S. Talay S.R. Brandtzaeg P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 14Hammerschmidt S. Tillig M.P. Wolff S. Vaerman J.P. Chhatwal G.S. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 102: 827-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Besides colonization, the pneumococcus is a major cause of both invasive diseases such as meningitis, septicemia, and pneumonia, and non-invasive diseases such as otitis media and sinusitis (16Austrian R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1986; 18: 35-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Musher D.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 18Tuomanen E.I. Austrian R. Masure H.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To cause disease, the pneumococcus has to migrate from the nasopharynx and disseminate into other parts of the human host, such as the lungs, blood, or meninges. The contents of the bacterial surface play an important role in the different disease processes. Data mining of sequenced S. pneumoniae genomes identified four putative PPIases, a cytoplasmic cyclophilin homologue, trigger factor, the ubiquitous bacterial FK506-binding proteins, and two lipoproteins, which resembled homology with distinct families of PPIases. Of the lipoproteins, the putative proteinase maturation protein A (PpmA) was homologous with the parvulin family (19Overweg K. Kerr A. Sluijter M. Jackson M.H. Mitchell T.J. de Jong A.P. de Groot R. Hermans P.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Overweg K. Pericone C.D. Verhoef G.G. Weiser J.N. Meiring H.D. de Jong A.P. de Groot R. Hermans P.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4604-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the streptococcal lipoprotein rotamase A (SlrA) shared homology with the cyclophilins (21Adrian P.V. Bogaert D. Oprins M. Rapola S. Lahdenkari M. Kilpi T. de Groot R. Kayhty H. Hermans P.W. Vaccine. 2004; 22: 2737-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There has been growing evidence that PPIases contribute to bacterial virulence. For example, the Mip protein of L. pneumophila is involved in entry of host cells and intracellular replication (22Cianciotto N.P. Fields B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5188-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 23Cianciotto N.P. Stamos J.K. Kamp D.W. Curr. Microbiol. 1995; 30: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Fischer G. Bang H. Ludwig B. Mann K. Hacker J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Wintermeyer E. Ludwig B. Steinert M. Schmidt B. Fischer G. Hacker J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4576-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the trigger factor of Streptococcus pyogenes is considered to be responsible for secretion of several virulence factors (26Lyon W.R. Gibson C.M. Caparon M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6263-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether PPIases of S. pneumoniae, in particular those that are surface-located, contribute to bacterial virulence. In this study, the protease-coupled PPIase assay indicated PPIase activity and substrate specificity for SlrA. More importantly, the contribution of SlrA to virulence was demonstrated in vivo using a murine model for pneumococcal pneumonia. Cell culture infection experiments indicated that SlrA expression interferes with non-tissue specific cellular adhesion but probably not invasion. Finally, expression of SlrA is involved in protection of pneumococci against phagocytosis. Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Protein Purification—S. pneumoniae were cultured on blood agar plates (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) at 37 °C and 5% CO2, or cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to mid-log phase. Strain validation involved Optochin sensitivity (Difco, Detroit, MI) and the Quellung reaction. D39 (Cps+serotype 2), which in vitro shows only low levels of adherence (27Hammerschmidt S. Wolff S. Hocke A. Rosseau S. Muller E. Rohde M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4653-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), was employed in mouse infection experiments, whereas the NCTC10319 (Cps+serotype 35A) was used in cell culture-based infection experiments. The non-mouse virulent NCTC10319 adheres efficiently to host cells, and with respect to the genetic background, virulence factors such as pneumolysin, choline-binding proteins, and PavA are identically expressed compared with D39 (28Elm C. Braathen R. Bergmann S. Frank R. Vaerman J.P. Kaetzel C.S. Chhatwal G.S. Johansen F.E. Hammerschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6296-6304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Pracht D. Elm C. Gerber J. Bergmann S. Rohde M. Seiler M. Kim K.S. Jenkinson H.F. Nau R. Hammerschmidt S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). During co-infection colonization studies, the rpsL gene encoding a streptomycin-resistant mutant of the ribosomal protein S12 was used to transform D39. Streptomycin-resistant D39 transformants (D39::rpsL) were selected in THY broth containing 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin, and a single transformant clone was invariably used in our animal experiments. To maintain virulence, bacteria were animal passaged prior to use in infections, as described previously (30Alexander J.E. Lock R.A. Peeters C.C. Poolman J.T. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5683-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isogenic mutants lacking the genes encoding slrA and ppmA were selected on blood agar with 1 μg ml-1 of erythromycin and 20 μg ml-1 of trimethoprim, respectively. Functional activity of the pneumolysin was assessed using the hemolysis assay (31Benton K.A. Paton J.C. Briles D.E. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 23: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) was used as the host strain for recombinant SlrA and PpmA expression, and cultured at 30 °C on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or LB broth containing 100 μg ml-1 of ampicillin and 50 μg ml-1 of kanamycin. Construction of Pneumococcal Mutants—The genes encoding slrA (accession number spr0679) and ppmA (accession number spr0884) were deleted from the parental strains D39 and NCTC10319 by inframe insertion deletion mutagenesis using the resistance cassettes ermAM (32Trieu-Cuot P. Poyart-Salmeron C. Carlier C. Courvalin P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and dfr13 (33Adrian P.V. Thomson C.J. Klugman K.P. Amyes S.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), encoding resistance to erythromycin and trimethoprim, respectively. SlrA and ppmA with 1000 bp of upstream and downstream flanking sequences were amplified from chromosomal DNA from the D39 strain. The PCR products were cloned into pBlue-Script KS+ and transformed to E. coli DH5α (Stratagene). The gene regions of slrA and ppmA were deleted from their respective plasmids by performing an inverse PCR with primers that amplify the flanking sequences and pBlueScript KS+. These amplicons were ligated with the PCR-amplified ermAM and dfr13, respectively, and transformed to E. coli DH5α (Stratagene). The primers covering the 5′-flanking sequence of slrA and ppmA were designed to include NdeI restriction sites that overlap the start codons of these genes. Similarly, ermAM and dfr13 were amplified with NdeI sites at the start codon, to ensure that resistance cassettes were cloned in the correct orientation, and were transcribed from the host promoters, starting from the ATG start codon. These erythromycin- and trimethoprim-resistant knock-out constructs were used as template DNA to generate linear PCR fragments containing the flanking regions of slrA and ppmA, and resistance genes ermAM and dfr13, respectively. The amplified DNA was used to delete the slrA and ppmA genes in strains D39 (serotype 2) and NCTC10319 (serotype 35A) by natural transformation as described previously (19Overweg K. Kerr A. Sluijter M. Jackson M.H. Mitchell T.J. de Jong A.P. de Groot R. Hermans P.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The slrA and ppmA fragments that were removed were of equal length to the inserted cassettes to eliminate the possibility of any polar effects. Furthermore, analysis of the flanking sequences of slrA and ppmA indicated that these genes had their own promoters, and were not part of an operon that could be affected by these gene modifications. Transcription profiling using genomic microarrays of the wild-type and mutant strains grown to mid-log phase, in THY broth, indicated that with the exception of the mutant alleles, no other significant transcriptional changes were observed (data not shown). Protease-coupled PPIase Assay—The PPIase activity and substrate specificity of SlrA and PpmA were determined using the protease-coupled assay as published previously (34Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cis to trans isomerization of various substrates with the consensus sequence Suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Phe-pNA (20 mg ml-1 in Me2SO) was followed at 10 °C and a wavelength of 390 nm by the trans-specific proteolytic cleavage of the Phe-pNA bond. Xaa represents the varied amino acid residues analyzed at this position of the substrate. A reference signal recorded at 510 nm is expected not to show a signal change during the measurements. To analyze the inhibition by CsA or specific antisera recognizing SlrA or PpmA, respectively, the proteins were preincubated in buffer and with the inhibitor for 5 min, and the measurements were started by addition of substrate and protease (chymotrypsin). The inhibition constant Ki was calculated with SigmaPlot software using the formula for slow tight binding inhibitors. The enzymatic activity kenz was calculated by subtracting the uncatalyzed reaction from the observed reaction within the measurement (36Cavarec L. Kamphausen T. Dubourg B. Callebaut I. Lemeunier F.

Fischer G. Sanchez J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mouse Pneumonia Model—To study survival times of mice in a mouse pneumonia model, pneumococcal cultures of A600 = 0.3 were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 106 colony-forming units/50 μl. Nine-week-old CD-1 mice (Harlan, Horst, Netherlands) were lightly anesthetized with 2.5% (v/v) isoflurane over oxygen (1.5 liter min-1), administered with a calibrated vaporizer, and anesthesia was confirmed by observing no pinch reflex reaction. Once anesthetized the animals were scuffed, with the nose held upright, and 50 μl of pneumococci or pneumococcal mutants were introduced intranasally by adding a series of small droplets of the inoculum into the nostril for the mice to involuntarily inhale. After inoculation, mice were held upright for 20 s, and then laid on their backs until recovery. Signs of disease were closely monitored until the animals were deemed moribund (38Kerr A.R. Irvine J.J. Search J.J. Gingles N.A. Kadioglu A. Andrew P.W. McPheat W.L. Booth C.G. Mitchell T.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) when they were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Mice displaying no signs of illness by 336 h were considered to have survived the infection. To study bacterial outgrowth during infection, mice were inoculated, as described above, and sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge (5 animals per time point). Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture. The nasopharynx was washed using a modified method of Wu et al. (39Wu H.Y. Virolainen A. Mathews B. King J. Russell M.W. Briles D.E. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 23: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The trachea was exposed and clamped and 2 ml of sterile PBS was passed through the nasopharynx via a 16-gauge non-pyrogenic angiocath (F. Baker Scientific, Runcorn, UK). Bronchi alveolar lavage, lung, and spleen tissue sampling were then carried out as previously described (38Kerr A.R. Irvine J.J. Search J.J. Gingles N.A. Kadioglu A. Andrew P.W. McPheat W.L. Booth C.G. Mitchell T.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Bacterial loads were determined by plating out 10-fold dilutions onto blood agar plates. For bacterial co-infection experiments with streptomycin-resistant D39 (D39: rpsL) and D39ΔslrA, mice were inoculated as described above, with 5 × 105 colony-forming units of each bacterial strain in 50 μl of PBS. Sampling occurred as described above, and bacterial loads were counted on blood agar containing either 1 μg ml-1 of erythromycin or 100 μgml-1 of streptomycin. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the regulations laid out by the Dutch animal ethics committee. Recombinant Proteins and Antiserum—The slrA gene (accession number spr0679) was amplified by PCR from S. pneumoniae D39 with primers 5′-TTTACTGCATATGCACCATCACCATCACCATAGCAGCGTCCAACGCAGT-3′ and 5′-CATTAGGATCCAATCGCTGGGGAAGTG-3′, which incorporated flanking NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, and a N-terminal His6 tag. The ppmA gene (accession number spr0884) was amplified by PCR from S. pneumoniae D39 with primers 5′-CCATGGCTAGCCACCATCACCATCACCATTCGAAAGGGTCAGAAGGTGC-3′ and 5′-TCATGGATCCGGACTATTCGTTTGATGTAC-3′, which incorporated flanking NheI and BamHI restriction sites, and a N-terminal His6 tag. The amplified DNAs were cloned into a similarly digested pET11a expression vector (Stratagene) and electrotransformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant proteins were purified by Ni+ affinity chromatography with the HisTrap Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The purified recombinant protein was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, freeze dried, and stored at -20 °C. The integrity of the DNA inserts was verified by sequence analysis using ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Polyclonal anti-PpmA and anti-SlrA antiserum was raised in rabbits by routine immunogenic procedures (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Prior to its use in cell infection inhibition experiments, anti-PpmA-, anti-SlrA-, and preimmune serum were protein A purified using Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Concentrations of the antibodies were 1.5 mg ml-1 for anti-SlrA IgG and 2.0 mg ml-1 for preimmune IgG, respectively. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The human lung alveolar carcinoma epithelial cell line A549 (ATCC CCL-185; type II pneumocytes) and the murine J774A.1 macrophage-like cell line (ATCC TIB 67) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin G (100 IU ml-1), and streptomycin (100 μg ml-1) (all from PAA Laboratories, Coelbe, Germany). The human nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line Detroit 562 (human pharynx carcinoma; ATCC CCL 138) was cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (Cambrex) were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium 2 (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) in the presence of the SupplementMix (PromoCell). All cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Adherence and Internalization Assays—For adherence and phagocytosis experiments, 5 × 104 cells per well were seeded in antibiotic-free medium on 24-well tissue culture plates (Greiner, Germany) and incubated for 48 h. For immunofluorescence studies cells were seeded on glass coverslips (diameter, 12 mm) at a cell density of 5 × 104 per well. Confluent cell layers with ∼2 × 105 cells were washed prior to infection with medium and the cells were infected with pneumococci in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with HEPES (once; PAA Laboratories) and 1% fetal calf serum per well with a multiplicity of infection of 100 pneumococci per cell at 37 °C under 5% CO2. In complementation or blocking experiments, infections were either carried out in the presence of different amounts of rSlrA (1 μg/well to 20 μg/well), or 5 × 106 wild-type pneumococci or isogenic slrA mutants were preincubated with 5 or 10 μg of polyclonal anti-SlrA IgG or preimmune IgG antibodies in a total volume of 100 μl prior to infection. The polyclonal anti-SlrA IgG (2, 5, or 10% (w/v)) did not affect growth cultures as indicated by identical growth curves in the presence or absence of anti-SlrA IgG (data not shown). The number of viable intracellular pneumococci after phagocytosis by macrophages or invasion of epithelial as well as endothelial cells was quantified by the antibiotic protection assay as described previously (29Pracht D. Elm C. Gerber J. Bergmann S. Rohde M. Seiler M. Kim K.S. Jenkinson H.F. Nau R. Hammerschmidt S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the infected cell monolayers were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with HEPES to remove unbound pneumococci and incubated with 1 ml/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with HEPES containing 100 μg of gentamicin and 100 units of penicillin G to kill extracellular bacteria. The cells were washed again and release of intracellular pneumococci was conducted by a saponin-mediated lysis (1% w/v) of the cells. The released intracellular pneumococci per well were enumerated by plating serial dilutions on blood-agar plates. Determination of Adherence by Double Immunofluorescence—Infected cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound bacteria and the cells and bacteria were fixed for 20 min on glass coverslips with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The fixed samples were washed with PBS and nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 30 min with 10% fetal calf serum. The blocking buffer was removed and samples were incubated for 45 min with a rabbit anti-pneumococcal antiserum (1:100), followed by a 30-min incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) to stain extracellular pneumococci. The reactivity of the anti-pneumococcal antiserum was described previously (28Elm C. Braathen R. Bergmann S. Frank R. Vaerman J.P. Kaetzel C.S. Chhatwal G.S. Johansen F.E. Hammerschmidt S. J. Biol.

Hammerschmidt S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In some experiments the intracellular bacteria were enumerated by double immunofluorescence. Therefore, the samples were washed with PBS and the cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. Thereafter, the samples were incubated with anti-pneumococcal antibody, washed, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (MoBiTec) to stain intra- and extracellular bacteria. After he final washing steps with PBS, the coverslips were embedded “upside down” in Moviol, sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4 °C. All antibody incubations were performed at room temperature in PBS. Numbers of extracellular pneumococci were determined using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop) and image acquisition was carried out using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and the CLSM software (Zeiss). Each experiment was repeated at least three times and results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Binding of Pneumococci to Immobilized Host Proteins and Extracellular Matrix—96-Well microtiter plates (polystyrene surface) were coated with human proteins (2.5 μg) such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, type IV collagen IV, secretory component, and lactoferrin, as well as reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel®; BD Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. The proteins were purchased from commercial suppliers (Calbiochem, Sigma, and Roche). The surface of the wells was subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for at least 3 h at room temperature. Labeling of the bacteria with fluorescein isothiocyanate was performed as described (40Bergmann S. Wild D. Diekmann O. Frank R. Bracht D. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Extensively washed fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled wild-type or slrA-deficient pneumococci (2.5 × 107) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C to allow binding. Fluorescence was measured at 485/538 nm (excitation/emission) using a Fluoroskan Ascent (ThermoLabsystems). Statistical Analysis—Survival times were compared using Mann-Whitney U analysis. Results from bacteriology time courses were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Scheffe's post-hoc test. Bacteriology results below the detection limits for the viable counting assay (log 1.92 per ml of blood or log 0.92 per ml of lung or nasopharyngeal samples) were ascribed a value just below the detection limit (log 1.91 or 0.91). Comparisons of bacterial loads between bacterial strains were carried out using multiple unpaired Student's t tests with Bonferroni correction. In D39:rpsL and D39ΔslrA co-infection studies in vitro and in vivo the data were mathematically corrected to account for the differences in count in the initial inoculum. Virulence data were expressed as mean ± S.E., whereas adherence and invasion data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences in virulence, adherence, and invasion were analyzed by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. In all analyzes, a p value of <0.05 was"

The sulfation patterns of the polysaccharide are essential for the biological activities. In this study, we report an enzymatic method for the sulfation of multimilligram amounts of heparan sulfate with specific functions using immobilized sulfotransferases combined with a 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate regeneration system. By selecting appropriate enzymatic modification steps, an inactive precursor has been converted to the heparan sulfate having three distinct biological activities, associated with binding to antithrombin, fibroblast growth factor-2, and herpes simplex virus envelope glycoprotein D. Because the recombinant sulfotransferases are expressed in bacteria, and the method uses a low cost sulfo donor, it can be readily utilized to synthesize large quantities of anticoagulant heparin drug or other biologically active heparan sulfates.

By selecting appropriate enzymatic modification steps, an inactive precursor has been converted to the heparan sulfate having three distinct biological activities, associated with binding to antithrombin, fibroblast growth factor-2, and herpes simplex virus envelope glycoprotein D. Because the recombinant sulfotransferases are expressed in bacteria, and the method uses a low cost sulfo donor, it can be readily utilized to synthesize large quantities of anticoagulant heparin drug or other biologically active heparan sulfates.

It regulates a wide range of physiologic and pathophysiologic functions, including embryonic development and blood coagulation and can facilitate viral infection (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 2Liu J. Thorp S.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HS exerts its biological effects by interacting with the specific proteins involved in a given process (3Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 390-412Crossref Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). HS is a highly charged polysaccharide consisting of 1 → 4-linked glucosamine and glucuronic/iduronic acid units that contain both N- and O-sulfo groups. Unique saccharide sequences within HS determine the specificity of the binding of HS to its target proteins (4Linhardt R.J. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2551-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Heparin, a specialized form of HS, is a commonly used anticoagulant drug. Thus, new methods for the synthesis of heparin and HS attract considerable interest for those developing anticoagulant drugs having improved pharmacological effects. heparan sulfate(s) reversed-phase ion pairing-high performance liquid chromatography N-sulfoglucosamine l-iduronic acid ST, 2-, 3-, and 6-O-sulfotransferase, respectively fibroblast growth factor chemically desulfated N-sulfated heparin maltose-binding protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid glycoprotein D surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy interleukin Antithrombin. heparan sulfate(s) reversed-phase ion pairing-high performance liquid chromatography N-sulfoglucosamine l-iduronic acid ST, 2-, 3-, and 6-O-sulfotransferase, respectively fibroblast growth factor chemically desulfated N-sulfated heparin maltose-binding protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid glycoprotein D surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy interleukin Antithrombin. Chemical synthesis has been the major route to obtain structurally defined heparin and HS oligosaccharides (5Petitou M. van Boeckel C.A.A Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004; 43: 3118-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The most important example involves the structure antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide. A synthetic pentasaccharide, based on this structure, has been marketed in the United States under the trade name Arixtra. Arixtra is a specific factor Xa inhibitor that is used clinically to prevent venous thromboembolic incidents during surgery. Unfortunately, the total synthesis of heparin and HS oligosaccharides, larger than pentasaccharides, is extremely difficult. HS analogues with 14 saccharide units inhibit the activity of thrombin, but these synthetic analogues are simplified hybrid molecules of HS oligosaccharides and highly sulfated glucose units (6Petitou M. Herault L.-P. Bernat A. Driguez P.-A. Duchaussoy P. Lormeau J.-C. Herbert J.-M. Nature. 1999; 398: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7Dementiev A. Petitou M. Herbert J.-M. Gettins P.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 11: 863-867Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and are not the naturally occurring structures. Although our laboratory and others continue to pursue the synthesis of heparin and HS oligosaccharides (8Avci F.Y. Karst N.A. Linhardt R.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2323-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it has become clear that chemical synthesis alone is currently incapable of generating most larger oligosaccharide structures. The application of HS biosynthetic enzymes for generating large heparin and HS oligosaccharides with desired biological activities offers a promising alternative approach. Six classes of enzymes are involved in the HS biosynthesis. HS is initially synthesized as a copolymer of d-glucuronic acid and GlcNAc through the action of d-glucuronyl and N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase (9Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Next, a series of modifications take place, including N-deacetylation and N-sulfation (carried out by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase) of the glucosamine residue to form N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS), C5 epimerization of glucuronic acid (carried out by epimerase) to form l-iduronic acid (IdoUA), 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA (carried out by 2-O-sulfotransferase (2-OST)), 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine (carried out by 6-O-sulfotransferase (6-OST)), and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine (carried out by 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST)) (10Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The reactions catalyzed by 2-OST, 6-OST, and 3-OST are shown in Fig. 1A. The enzymes responsible for HS biosynthesis have been cloned and expressed and were employed in the synthesis of HS polysaccharides. Kuberan and Rosenberg (11Balagurunathan K. Lech M.Z. Beeler D.L. Wu Z.L. Rosenberg R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Lawrence R. Lech M. Rosenberg R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12424-12425Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Balagurunathan K. Beeler D.L. Lech M. Wu Z.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52613-52621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) utilized these enzymes to synthesize the HS containing antithrombin binding sites with anticoagulant activity. Although this approach demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of enzymatic synthesis of HS, approximately 1 μg of product was generated, making extensive structural characterization and biological studies impossible. Recently, Lindahl and colleagues reported an alternative chemoenzymatic approach for the synthesis of anticoagulant heparin from heparosan, the E. coli K5 capsular polysaccharide (14Lindahl U. Li J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Salmivirta M. Alaranta S. Veromaa T. Emies J. Roberts I. Taylor C. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Naggi A. Torri G. Casu B. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This method utilized the C5 epimerase to convert d-glucuronic acid to IdoUA, followed by the chemical persulfation and finally selective desulfation. Although this approach afforded approximately 5 g of a heparin-like polysaccharide with anticoagulant activity, unnatural saccharide units, such as 3-O-sulfo-d-glucuronic acid, were present in their product, suggesting a limitation in the selectivity of chemical sulfation/desulfation in HS synthesis. Thus, developing an effective and highly selective approach for O-sulfation of polysaccharides remains a challenge for the large scale synthesis of HS. In this work, we describe an enzymatic approach to synthesize HS polysaccharides. Only two or three enzymatic steps are required for the synthesis of HS having three biological activities (Fig. 1). Two major advances have permitted the large scale synthesis of HS. First, large amounts of all the required HS sulfotransferases have been successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. Second, a PAPS regeneration system, developed by Burkhart and colleagues (15Burkart M.D. Izumi M. Chapman E. Lin C. Wong C. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 5565-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), has been coupled to the enzymatic synthesis reactions. We synthesized HS having specific biological activities including anticoagulant heparin, herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD)-binding HS, and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-binding HS. Each of these products had activities comparable with the heparin and HS. Furthermore, the amount of synthesized HS was sufficient to permit not only disaccharide analysis but also analysis using 1H NMR spectroscopy, resulting in the determination of the product structure with a high degree of confidence. The results from our study suggest that this is a general method for the large scale synthesis of a wide range of HS with specific activity required. In addition, this method provides a model system to better understand the biosynthesis of HS. Preparation of Chemically Desulfated N-Sulfated Heparin (CDSNS Heparin)—Treatment of heparin with a dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol mixture (9:1, v/v) at 80 °C for 24 h resulted in nearly complete N,O-desulfation with <5% of the solvolytically resistant O-sulfo groups remaining. Chemical N-sulfation with sulfur trioxide-pyridine afforded CDSNS heparin, which was characterized by disaccharide analysis and 1H and two-dimensional COSY NMR. Expression and Purification of 2-OST and 6-OST—The catalytic domains of 2-OST of Chinese hamster ovary (Arg51–Asn356) and mouse 6-OST-1 (His53–Trp401) were cloned into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England BioLabs) using the BamHI and HindIII sites to generate maltose-binding protein (MBP)-2-OST and MBP-6-OST fusion proteins. The full-length cDNAs of 2-OST and 6-OST-1 were gifts from Dr. Rosenberg (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) and Dr. Kimata (Aichi University, Japan), respectively. Expression of 2-OST and 6-OST was achieved in Rosetta-gami B (DE3) cells (Novagen) using a standard procedure. Briefly, cells containing the plasmid expressing 2-OST or 6-OST were grown in LB medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml glucose, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 15 μg/ml kenamycin, 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.6–0.8, Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and the cells were shaken overnight at 22 °C. The bacteria were harvested, and the proteins were purified by following a protocol from the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The purified proteins migrated at 75 kDa on 12% SDS-PAGE with the purity greater than 80%. Preparation of Immobilized HS Sulfotransferases—Dialyzed sulfotransferases (3 ml, 4 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 138 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) were mixed with 1 ml of Aminolink® plus beads (Pierce) following a protocol from the manufacturer. Immobilized enzyme was washed with 50 mm MES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7.0, and stored at 4 °C. Measurement of Enzymatic Activities of Immobilized Proteins—To determine the activity of 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-3, HS from bovine kidney (ICN Biomedicals) was used as a substrate; to determine the activity of 6-OST and 2-OST, CDSNS heparin was used as a substrate. Immobilized proteins (100 μl, ∼300 μg of immobilized enzyme) with 100 μg of substrate (HS for 3-OST and CDSNS heparin for 2-OST or 6-OST) and 200 μm [35S]PAPS (1000 cpm/pmol) in 1 ml of 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2. After rotating at room temperature for 1 h, the supernatant was collected, and the beads were washed with 3 × 200 μl of 1 m NaCl in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). The supernatant and washes were combined, diluted with 2 ml of water, and subjected to DEAE chromatography to determine the amount of [35S]HS product used to determine the activities of the various HS O-STs. PAPS Regeneration System—The reactions involved in the PAPS regeneration system are shown in Fig. 1B. N-terminal His6-tagged AST-IV was expressed in E. coli and purified as described by Burkat and colleagues (15Burkart M.D. Izumi M. Chapman E. Lin C. Wong C. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 5565-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) at a yield of ∼50 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The full-length cDNA of rabbit AST-IV was a generous gift of Dr. Michael Duffel (University of Iowa) (16Sheng J.J. Saxena A. Duffel M.W. Drug Metabol. Dispos. 2004; 32: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Modification of Polysaccharides—All enzymatic modifications, including those catalyzed by 2-OST, 6-OST, 3-OST-1, and 3-OST-3 followed the same protocol. Briefly, 20 mg of purified AST-IV was incubated with 40 μm PAP and 1 mm PNPS in 20 ml of 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2 at 25 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was mixed with 4 ml of immobilized sulfotransferase, 2 mg of a polysaccharide substrate was added, and the mixture was rotated at 25 °C for 24 h. The supernatant was recovered, and the polysaccharide that bound to the beads was eluted by washing three times with 8 ml of 1 m NaCl in 25 mm MOPS. Both the supernatant and wash were combined and the product was precipitated by adding ethanol (3 volumes). After incubating overnight at 4 °C, polysaccharide was recovered by centrifugation. Estimation of the Modification Level—The completion of 2-OST modification was monitored by incubating 10 μg of polysaccharide (2) with 20 μg of soluble 2-OST in the presence of 100 μm of [35S]PAPS at 37 °C for 30 min. In a control experiment, 10 μg of compound 1 replaced the previously modified polysaccharide in the otherwise identical reaction mixture. By comparing the amount of 35S incorporation, we could estimate the extent of the original 2-O-sulfation reaction. For monitoring the completion of 6-OST, compound 1 or 2 was used as a substrate; for 3-OST-1, compound 4 was used. Using [35S]PAPS as a Sulfate Donor—Antithrombin (AT)-binding and gD-binding experiments utilized 35S-labeled polysaccharides prepared using [35S]PAPS. In a typical reaction, 2 mg of HS substrate was incubated with 4 ml of beads with immobilized sulfotransferase (∼12 mg of immobilized enzyme) at 25 °C in 20 ml of 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2, 200 μm [35S]PAPS (1000 cpm/pmol) for 1 h. The resultant polysaccharide was recovered using DEAE chromatography. Disaccharide Analysis—Synthesized polysaccharides (100 μg) were degraded by a mixture of heparin lyases as previously described (17Moon A. Edavettal S.C. Krahn J.X. Munoz E.M. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45185-45193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and desalted on BioGel P-2 column (0.5 × 200 cm) in 0.1 m NH4HCO3. Disaccharides were analyzed by a C18 reversed phase column (0.45 × 25 cm; Vydac) with UV 232 detection and identified by coelution with appropriate standards (18Chen J. Duncan M.B. Carrick K. Pope M. Liu J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The overall recovery yield of the disaccharide analysis was estimated by using 2-O-[35S]heparin (100,000 cpm/70 ng; compound 2) as an internal control. NMR Analysis—Polysaccharide sample (1–2 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 2H2O (99.9%), freeze dried to remove exchangeable protons, redissolved in 75 μl of 2H2O (100.00%), and transferred to a Shigemi NMR microtubes. NMR spectra were referenced relative to the HO2H at 4.80 ppm, and in COSY water was suppressed by presaturation of the HO2H resonance. Determination of the Binding to AT and FGF2 Using Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR)—Heparin and the synthesized polysaccharides were biotinylated following the published procedure (19Hernaiz M. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A solution of the biotinylated polysaccharides (0.1 mg/ml) in Hepes (10 mm), 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20 (HBS-EP) was flowed over the cells of the streptavidin chip at 5 μl/min. To determine the KD values, different concentrations (25–1600 nm in HBS-EP buffer) of FGF2 and AT were individually injected at 30 μl/min (running buffer: HBS-EP). Kinetic injection was used, leading the protein to flow for 180 s and dissociated for the next 180 s, and the surface was regenerated by a 60-s injection of 30 μl of 2 m NaCl. Response units were monitored as a function of time to afford sensorgrams. The SPR curves for FGF2 fit well at individual concentrations, but the global fit suggested significant binding heterogeneity. Thus, the equilibrium response unit RU(eq) values from the sensorgrams of FGF2 binding to polysaccharide-containing surfaces were used to construct Scatchard plots, RU(eq)/C versus RU(eq), where C is the free protein concentration, resulting in linear, first degree polynomial functions confirming the one-to-one binding of FGF-polysaccharide and to estimate binding affinity. A two-state reaction model was applied to the AT-polysaccharide interactions measured by SPR using curve fitting to estimate the association and dissociation rate constants and affinity constant. FGF2/FGFR1C-mediated Proliferation Assay—The BaF3 cells ectopically expressing FGFR1C have been previously described (20Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The BaF3-FGFR1c cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ng/ml interleukin (IL)-3 (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (50 IU/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For mitogenic assays, BaF3 FGFR1c cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium to remove IL-3 and resuspended in the growth medium lacking IL-3. About 30,000 cells were plated per well in a 96-well plate in medium containing 1 μg/ml heparin, compound 1, 2, 3, 4a, or 4b, and 2 nm FGF-2 (PeproTech) in a total volume of 200 μl. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 h. To each well, an additional 50 μl of growth medium containing 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added. Cells were harvested after 4–5 h by filtration through glass fiber paper. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA was determined by scintillation counting. Determination of the Binding of Compounds 5–8 to AT—Approximately 1 × 105 cpm of 35S-labeled compound was incubated with 5 μg of human AT (Cutter Biological) in 50 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 10 μm dextran sulfate, 0.0004% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide for 30 min at room temperature. Concanavalin A-Sepharose (Sigma; 50 μl of 1:1 slurry) was then added, and the reaction was shaken at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were then washed by 3 × 1 ml of binding buffer, and the bound polysaccharide was eluted with 1 m NaCl. Inhibition Effect of the Polysaccharides on the Activities of Factor Xa and Thrombin—Assays were based on two previous methods (21Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Lawrence R. Lech M. Liu J. Davis J.C. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42311-42321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Duncan M.B. Chen J. Krise J.P. Liu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1671: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and thrombin (Sigma) were diluted to 20 and 8 units/ml with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, respectively. AT was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to give a stock solution at the concentration of 27 μm. The chromogenic substrates, S-2765 (for factor Xa assay) and S-2238 (for thrombin assay) were from Diapharma and made up at 1 mm with 1 mg/ml Polybrene in water. The synthesized polysaccharide (compounds 5, 7, and 8) or heparin was dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 7.5 mm Na2EDTA, 175 mm NaCl at various concentrations (1–10,000 ng/ml). The reaction mixture, which consisted of 25 μl of AT stock solution and 25 μl of the solution containing polysaccharide, was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Factor Xa (25 μl) or thrombin (25 μl) was added. After incubating 37 °C for 4 min, 25 μlof S-2765 or S-2238 was added. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 405 nm continuously for 10 min. The absorbance values were plotted against the reaction time. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 405 nm continuously for 10 min. The initial reaction rates as a function of concentration were used to calculate the IC50 values. The concentrations of the synthesized polysaccharides were determined using Alcian blue as described by Bjornsson (23Bjornsson S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and quantitative disaccharide analysis as described above. The Binding to Herpes Simplex Virus gD—The assay for determining binding of 35S-labeled polysaccharides (compounds 5 and 6) to gD was carried out by an immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-gD monoclonal antibody (DL6) (24Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Expression of HS Sulfotransferases in E. coli—Our goal is to develop an approach to synthesize FGF-binding HS (compound 4, including 4a and 4b) AT-binding HS (compound 5), and herpes simplex virus gD-binding HS (compound 6). Four enzymes, including 2-OST, 6-OST, 3-OST-1, and 3-OST-3, were required for the syntheses of these targets. We recently demonstrated that bacterial expressed 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-3 exhibit substrate specificity and specific enzymatic activity comparable with those of their counterparts expressed in insect cells (17Moon A. Edavettal S.C. Krahn J.X. Munoz E.M. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45185-45193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25789-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression of the catalytic domains of 2-OST and 6-OST was also achieved in relatively high yield by preparing a fusion protein with MBP and 2-OST or 6-OST in Rosetta-gami B cells. Because 2-OST and 6-OST fusion proteins were enzymatically active and highly soluble, we decided to retain the MBP domain in the current study. Immobilized Enzymes Are Reusable—2-OST, 6-OST, 3-OST-1, and 3-OST-3 were immobilized on agarose to be reusable and to enhance the thermal stability. We incubated immobilized enzymes with polysaccharide substrate and PAPS for 1 h at room temperature. The sulfated polysaccharide product was separated from the immobilized enzyme by washing the beads with 1 m NaCl followed by centrifugation, making the immobilized enzymes ready for the next synthetic cycle. The cycle was repeated 10 times, after which each of the immobilized enzymes were assayed and showed >80% of their catalytic activity (Fig. 2). We have also found that the immobilized enzymes also maintained >65% of their catalytic activity after 2 months of storage at 8 °C (data not shown). Introduction of PAPS Regeneration System—PAP inhibits sulfotransferase-catalyzed reactions. A PAPS regeneration system can be used to convert PAP to PAPS by relying on AST-IV to catalyze the transfer of the sulfo group from PNPS to PAP, as illustrated in Fig. 1B (15Burkart M.D. Izumi M. Chapman E. Lin C. Wong C. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 5565-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We observed that the PAPS regeneration system performed very well with 2-OST, 6-OST, and 3-OST-1. Complete modification of the substrate could be demonstrated by the low susceptibility of polysaccharide product to undergo additional sulfation using [35S]PAPS with soluble enzymes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under the standard conditions, 2-OST, 6-OST, and 3-OST-1 afforded 98, 97, and 98% complete modification, respectively, using the PAPS regeneration system. These results demonstrate that the PAPS regeneration system functioned properly, providing sufficient PAPS for the complete sulfotransferase-catalyzed modification of polysaccharide substrates. This conclusion was further supported by characterizing the structures of the newly synthesized polysaccharide products 2, 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 (described below). In a parallel experiment, we used [35S]PAPS as the sulfo donor to sulfate the polysaccharides in order to estimate the number of sulfo groups that were incorporated into the product. Six 2-O-sulfo and 6-O-sulfo groups and three 3-O-sulfo groups were estimated to be transferred to one polysaccharide molecule, respectively, assuming that the length of the polysaccharide is 25 disaccharide units. Approximately 1.5 mg of anticoagulant HS (5) was synthesized from 10 mg of CDSNS heparin (1) using immobilized sulfotransferases and the PAPS regeneration system. Disaccharide Analysis of the Polysaccharides—Synthesized polysaccharide intermediates were digested with a mixture of heparin lyases, and the resulting disaccharides were analyzed using RPIP-HPLC (Fig. 3). As expected, analysis of compound 1 showed a disaccharide component of the structure of ΔUA-GlcNS (disaccharide 2), residual unsulfated disaccharide, ΔUA-GlcNAc (disaccharide 1), and small amounts of sulfated disaccharides (disaccharides 3–5) due to incomplete chemical desulfation (Fig. 3A and TABLE ONE). The modification by 2-OST elevated the level of ΔUA2S-GlcNS (disaccharide 4) by about 5-fold (Fig. 3B and TABLE ONE), confirming the structure of compound 2. Analysis of compound 3 afforded a 7-fold increase in the level of the disaccharide ΔUA-GlcNS6S (disaccharide 3) compared with compound 1, consistent with 6-OST-catalyzed modification (Fig. 3C and TABLE ONE). The level of trisulfodisaccharide, ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S (disaccharide 5), in compounds 4a and 4b was increased by about 10-fold compared with that of compound 1 (Fig. 3, D and E, and TABLE ONE). The results from the disaccharide analysis clearly establish that the expected enzymatic modifications took place at each step. It is interesting to note that 6-O-sulfation occurs at N-sulfoglucosamine, consistent with the substrate specificity of 6-OST in vitro (26Smeds E. Habuchi H. Do A.-T. Hjertson E. Grundberg H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 371-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-O-sulfation predominantly occurs at the uronic acid with an N-sulfoglucosamine residue at the reducing end. We also note that substantial amounts of ΔUA-GlcNS (disaccharide 2) remain in compounds 4a and 4b. This observation is not unexpected, since the HS from various tissues also afford a ΔUA-GlcNS disaccharide unit, suggesting that the structures of compounds 4a and 4b are similar to HS from natural sources (27Ledin J.

https://openalex.org/W2003612099,"Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) catalyzes the initial step in long chain fatty acid metabolism. Of the five mammalian ACSL isoforms cloned and characterized, ACSL5 is the only isoform found to be located, in part, on mitochondria and thus was hypothesized to be involved in fatty acid oxidation. To elucidate the specific roles of ACSL5 in fatty acid metabolism, we used adenoviral-mediated overexpression of ACSL5 (Ad-ACSL5) in rat hepatoma McArdle-RH7777 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that Ad-ACSL5 colocalized to both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. When compared with cells infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-ACSL5-infected cells at 24 h after infection had 2-fold higher acyl-CoA synthetase activities and 30% higher rates of fatty acid uptake when incubated with 500 μm [1-14C]oleic acid. Metabolism of [1-14C]oleic acid to cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) increased 42% in Ad-ACSL5-infected cells, but when compared with control cells, metabolism to acid-soluble metabolites, phospholipids, and medium TAG did not differ substantially. The incorporation of [1-14C]oleate and [1,2,3-3H]glycerol into TAG was similar in Ad-ACSL5-infected cells, thus indicating that Ad-ACSL5 increased TAG synthesis through both de novo and reacylation pathways. However, [1-14C]acetic acid incorporation into cellular lipids showed that, when compared with control cells, Ad-ACSL5-infected cells did not increase the metabolism of fatty acids that were derived from de novo synthesis. These results suggest that uptake of fatty acids into cells is regulated by metabolism and that overexpressed ACSL5 partitions exogenously derived fatty acids toward TAG synthesis and storage.

Acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the initial step in mammalian fatty acid metabolism. In this reaction, fatty acid, CoA, and ATP are used to form acyl-CoA and AMP. Acyl-CoAs have diverse metabolic fates within the cell and can be used to acylate proteins or be metabolized through catabolic pathways such as β-oxidation or anabolic pathways such as de novo synthesis and reacylation of triacylglycerol (TAG), 2The abbreviations used are: TAGtriacylglycerolDAGdiacylglycerolACSLlong chain acyl-CoA synthetaseACSVLvery long chain acyl-CoA synthetaseASMacid-soluble metabolitesGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGrp7878-kDa glucose regulated proteinSREBP-1csterol regulatory element binding proteinVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 2The abbreviations used are: TAGtriacylglycerolDAGdiacylglycerolACSLlong chain acyl-CoA synthetaseACSVLvery long chain acyl-CoA synthetaseASMacid-soluble metabolitesGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGrp7878-kDa glucose regulated proteinSREBP-1csterol regulatory element binding proteinVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. phospholipids, and cholesterol esters. triacylglycerol diacylglycerol long chain acyl-CoA synthetase very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase acid-soluble metabolites green fluorescent protein 78-kDa glucose regulated protein sterol regulatory element binding protein voltage-dependent anion channel phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. triacylglycerol diacylglycerol long chain acyl-CoA synthetase very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase acid-soluble metabolites green fluorescent protein 78-kDa glucose regulated protein sterol regulatory element binding protein voltage-dependent anion channel phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. To date, five isoforms of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase have been cloned and shown to possess activity toward long chain fatty acids. The unique pattern of tissue expression, subcellular localization, and differences in substrate preference among the isoforms suggests that individual isoforms have distinct functions. ACSL1, ACSL4, and ACSL5 appear to be the predominant isoforms in rat liver (1Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), an endoplasmic reticulum fraction possibly involved in lipoprotein synthesis (7Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ACSL4 is also present on peroxisomes and has a marked preference for C20:4 and C20:5 (2Kang M.J. Fujino T. Sasano H. Minekura H. Yabuki N. Nagura H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ACSL5 is the only isoform found in both mitochondrial membranes and endoplasmic reticulum (6Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and, similar to ACSL1, has its highest preference for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of 16-20 carbons (1Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because ACSL5 is the only ACSL isoform known to be located on mitochondria, it is logical to speculate that it has a role in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. In support of this hypothesis, rat liver mitochondrial protein content of ACSL5 increases following a 48-h fast but declines when rats are refed a high sucrose diet for 24 h (6Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To date, the most direct studies that focus on ACSL used triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4 but not ACSL5 or ACSL6 (8Kim J.H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Van Horn C.G. Caviglia J.M. Li L.O. Wang S. Granger D.A. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes obtained from fed rats, triacsin C decreases [1-14C]oleic acid incorporation into TAG by 70% (10Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Wiedmer P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, triacsin C decreases the metabolism of [1-14C]oleic acid to phospholipids by 34% and to ASM by 33%. Therefore, inhibiting ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4 decreases fatty acid incorporation into TAG more than into phospholipids or into pathways of fatty acid oxidation. Because hepatocytes express little ACSL6 (4Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), ACSL5 could account for the triacsin C-resistant activity in hepatocytes and might activate fatty acids destined for β-oxidation. Despite its putative role in fatty acid oxidation, several lines of evidence do not support a catabolic role for ACSL5. Tissue expression of ACSL5 mRNA is highest in intestinal mucosa (1Oikawa E. Iijima H. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Sato H. Kamataki A. Nagura H. Kang M.J. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and brown adipose tissue (11Yu X.X. Lewin D.A. Forrest W. Adams S.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although brown adipose tissue is characterized by high levels of fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis, both intestinal mucosa and brown adipose tissue have a high capacity for TAG synthesis (12Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Darnley A.C. Carpenter C.A. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, regulation of ACSL5 mRNA does not support a role in fatty acid β-oxidation. Hepatic ACSL5 message abundance does not change in response to peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α agonists (14Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Krisans S.K. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but increases nearly 4-fold in SREBP-1c transgenic mice and is reduced 40% in SREBP cleavage-activating protein knock-out mice (15Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Administration of leptin to C57BL/6J obese ob/ob mice causes a 1.5-fold decrease in ACSL5 mRNA expression together with down-regulation of lipogenic genes and increased expression of numerous oxidative genes (16Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, hepatic ACSL5 message level increases 1.6-fold in zinc-deficient mice with fatty livers (17tom Dieck H. Doring F. Fuchs D. Roth H.P. Daniel H. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and decreases 1.5-fold in estrogen-related receptor knock-out mice, which exhibit a reduction in lipogenic gene expression and reduced total body fat (18Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.A. Richard D. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Taken together, there are many discrepancies in the literature between regulation of ACSL5 mRNA and protein abundance and the effects of triacsin C on fatty acid channeling. Therefore, our goal was to use a direct approach to elucidate the function of ACSL5. We ectopically overexpressed ACSL5 in rat hepatoma McArdle-RH7777 cells to determine its role in fatty acid activation and partitioning. Materials—Silica gel G plates were from Whatman. [1-14C]Oleic acid, [1,2,3-3H]glycerol, and [1-14C]acetic acid were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture dishes were from Corning, and media were obtained from Invitrogen. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Construction of Recombinant GFP and ACSL5-FLAG Adenovirus—ACSL5 cDNA was cloned from rat liver total RNA and amplified using primers designed to include the entire open reading frame (8Kim J.H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The amplification product was ligated into the pET-FLAG vector containing a T7 promoter and a C-terminal FLAG epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK) to form pET-ACSL5F. A 2091-bp construct was amplified from the pET-ACSL5F vector, including the initiator AUG codon, the entire ACSL5 coding region, a 24-bp FLAG epitope sequence at the 3′ end, and the TGA stop codon. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI and ligated into the 9.2-kb pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector between the cytomegalovirus promoter and the polyadenylation site. This vector contains a GFP gene driven by a second cytomegalovirus promoter, which allows direct observation of the efficiency of infection by fluorescence microscopy. The pAdTrack/ACSL5F construct was sequenced at the University of North Carolina (UNC) DNA Sequencing Facility. The UNC Vector Core Laboratory produced recombinant adenovirus (Ad-ACSL5) by homologous recombination of the shuttle vector and the pAdEasy-1 adenoviral plasmid (19He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). An identical pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector without the ACSL5 insert was used to produce a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-GFP) for control infections. McArdle-RH7777 Cell Culture and Adenoviral Infection—McArdle-RH7777 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin on collagen-coated dishes. Cells were trypsinized the day before adenoviral infection, and 1.2 × 106 cells were plated per 6-cm dish. Cells at 60-80% confluence were infected with 10 multiplicity of infection of either Ad-GFP or Ad-ACSL5. After 2 h, the media were changed. Cell Radiolabeling, Lipid Extraction, and Measurement of Radioactive Lipid Products and Fatty Acid Uptake Assays—Radiolabeling media contained 1.0 μCi of [1-14C]oleic acid bound to bovine serum albumin in a 3:1 molar ratio. The concentration of oleic acid in media was 20, 100, or 500 μm. In some experiments, 250 μm [1,2,3-3H]glycerol or 2.5 mm [1-14C]acetic acid was used. Additionally, 10 μm triacsin C in Me2SO was added to the radiolabeling media in some experiments to inhibit ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4. Untreated cells were incubated with the same volume of Me2SO (0.2% of the medium). Radiolabeled media were added 24 h after adenoviral infection. After 3 h, aliquots of the radiolabeling media were removed and used to measure ASM or extracted (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) to measure radiolabel incorporation into media lipids. Residual radiolabel was removed by washing the cells once with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. Cellular lipids were extracted (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and separated on silica gel G plates in hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1; v/v). Known standards (Avanti) were used to identify lipids that were then visualized by iodine vapor. The Bioscan 200 system was used to quantify radiolabeled lipids. Initial rates of fatty acid uptake were measured as described (21Pei Z. Fraisl P. Berger J. Jia Z. Forss-Petter S. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54454-54462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that 35-mm culture dishes were used and the radiolabeling medium contained 3.0 μCi of [1-14C]oleic acid. Cell Homogenate Preparations for ACSL Activity and Protein Assays—McArdle-RH7777 cells were washed with PBS, scraped in cold Medium I (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and homogenized on ice with 10 up-and-down strokes in a Teflon glass motor-driven homogenizing vessel, and aliquots were stored at -80 °C. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured in the presence of 175 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 250μm CoA, and 50 μm [1-14C]palmitic acid (22Banis R.J. Tove S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Only initial rates were measured. Protein was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—McArdle-RH7777 cells were plated on 8-well chamber slides (Nunc) and infected with Ad-ACSL5 as described above. After 24 h, cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Following several PBS washes at room temperature, cells were permeabilized with buffer A (10 μg/μl digitonin, 300 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then incubated with 1.5% goat serum containing a 1/500 dilution of mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), 1/125 dilution of rabbit anti-VDAC, 1/500 dilution of rabbit anti-Grp78, or a combination of anti-FLAG with the organelle markers for 1 h at room temperature. Following several PBS washes, cells were incubated in 1.5% goat serum anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 633 or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing with PBS, Gel/Mount (Biomedia) was added to the cells, and coverslips were applied. Confocal microscopy was performed on an Olympus FV500 laser scanning microscope. TRITC and CY5 filters were used to visualize the Alexa Fluor 546 and 633, respectively. Image J software (National Institutes of Health) was used for image analysis. Quantitative Real-time-PCR—Livers from Sprague-Dawley rats (∼130 g) were homogenized with a rotor stator homogenizer, and RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Forward and reverse primers for rat ACSL5 were 5′-GGCCAAACAGAATGCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGTCCCAACATGACCTG-3′. The FAM probe corresponding to the ACSL5 amplicon was 5′-TGTCCAGTCCCCAGGTGATGTAAT-3′. The rat β-actin forward primer was 5′-TGCCTGACGGTCAGGTCA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAG-3′. The probe corresponding to the β-actin amplicon was 5′-CACTATCGGCAATGAGCGGTTCCG-3′. Samples were analyzed on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using the relative standard curve method as described in User Bulletin Number 2 in the product manual. Statistics—Data were analyzed by Student's t test, and significance was declared at p < 0.05. Ad-ACSL5 Increases Total and Triacsin C-resistant Activity—To determine the function of ACSL5, we infected McArdle-RH7777 cells, a rat hepatoma cell line, with an adenoviral construct containing FLAG-tagged ACSL5 and GFP. Infection efficiency monitored by fluorescent microscopy was close to 100% for most infections and was always greater than 90%. Ad-ACSL5 infection of McArdle-RH7777 cells increased total ACSL activity 2-fold when compared with Ad-GFP-infected cells (Fig. 1A). Since ACSL5 is only one of five known ACSL isoforms involved in long chain fatty acid activation, we used triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4, to better gauge the increase in activity due to ACSL5 overexpression. In the presence of 20 μm triacsin C, ACSL activity in Ad-ACSL5-infected cells was 17-fold higher than the Ad-GFP-infected controls. Previous quantitative real-time-PCR analysis revealed that ACSL6, the only other known ACSL not inhibited by triacsin C, is not expressed in McArdle-RH7777 cells. If we assume that ACSL5 is solely responsible for the triacsin C-resistant activity, it accounts for ∼6% of total ACSL activity in Ad-GFP-infected cells and 40% in Ad-ACSL5-infected cells. ACSL5 Colocalizes with Mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum—Our previous studies that used cell fractionation techniques have shown that ACSL5 is present in both microsomes and mitochondria in rat hepatocytes (6Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We employed confocal microscopy to identify the subcellular location of FLAG-tagged Ad-ACSL5 in McArdle-RH7777 cells (Fig. 1B). The FLAG localization pattern showed substantial colocalization with the anti-Grp78 antibody, an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Similarly, FLAG also colocalized with the anti-VDAC antibody, a mitochondria marker. Immunofluorescence did not show the FLAG marker on the cell surface or the nuclear membrane. Therefore, overexpression of FLAG-tagged ACLS5 followed a localization pattern similar to that of endogenous ACSL5. Ad-ACSL5 Increases Fatty Acid Uptake and Partitioning to Cellular TAG—To determine the effects of Ad-ACSL5 on fatty acid metabolism, we incubated McArdle-RH7777 cells with 20, 100, or 500 μm oleic acid for 3 h and measured [1-14C]oleic acid incorporation into cellular and medium lipids and oxidation products. When compared with Ad-GFP-infected controls, Ad-ACSL5 did not affect total oleic acid metabolism, as measured by incorporation into cell lipids and medium TAG and ASM, at 20 or 100 μm but increased metabolism 28% at 500 μm oleic acid (Fig. 2A), a physiological concentration during short term fasts or a preprandial state (23Bortz W.M. Steele L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Fuller R.W. Diller E.R. Metabolism. 1970; 19: 226-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To verify these results, we measured initial rates of fatty acid uptake (Fig. 1C). In close agreement with the increased fatty acid metabolism, we observed a 30% increase in rates of fatty acid uptake when cells were incubated with 500 μm oleic acid. Cellular TAG represents the predominant storage form of exogenous fatty acids in most cell types. Incorporation of [1-14C]oleic acid into cellular TAG increased 22 and 21% at 20 and 100 μm oleic acid, respectively, in both Ad-GFP- and Ad-ACSL5-infected cells (Fig. 2B). However, with 500 μm oleic acid in the medium, 42% more [1-14C]oleic acid was incorporated in TAG in the Ad-ACSL5-infected cells when compared with control cells. Similar to cell TAG, medium TAG increased with increasing oleic acid concentrations in the media, but there were no differences between Ad-GFP- and Ad-ACSL5-infected cells at any fatty acid concentration (Fig. 2C). Although with 500 μm oleic acid, Ad-ACSL5 significantly increased [1-14C]oleic acid incorporation into medium ASM (Fig. 2D), an indicator of ketone body production, the 13% increase is minor when compared with the increases in fatty acid uptake and partitioning to TAG, thus disproving our original hypothesis that ACSL5 activates fatty acids destined for β-oxidation. There were no differences in incorporation of [1-14C]oleic acid into cellular phospholipids, fatty acids, or cholesterol esters, but Ad-ACSL5 increased [1-14C]oleic acid incorporation into cellular DAG 2-fold when compared with Ad-GFP-infected cells (Fig. 3A). To further substantiate the role of ACSL5 in TAG synthesis, we incubated cells with triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4, but not ACSL5. Previous data in hepatocytes and fibroblasts showed that triacsin c inhibits TAG synthesis more than ASM production (10Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Wiedmer P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In Ad-GFP-treated cells, triacsin C decreased TAG and ASM synthesis similarly (Fig. 3B). However, Ad-ACSL5 infection blocked triacsin C-mediated inhibition of TAG synthesis and attenuated ASM synthesis. Therefore, when other ACSL isoforms are inhibited, overexpressed ACSL5 can fully compensate for impaired TAG synthesis but can only partially restore ASM production. Ad-ACSL5 Increases TAG Synthesis through Both de Novo and Reacylation Pathways—With the changes in partitioning of fatty acids, we considered whether the increase of oleic acid incorporation into cellular TAG in Ad-ACSL5-infected cells was due to de novo synthesis or to reacylation pathways. We labeled cells with 250 μm [1,2,3-3H]glycerol plus 500 μm [1-14C]oleic acid to elucidate the mechanism of enhanced TAG synthesis. Ad-ACSL5-infected cells incorporated 35% more [14C]oleic acid and 28% more [3H]glycerol into cellular TAG relative to Ad-GFP controls (Fig. 4A). The ratio of [14C]oleic acid to [3H]glycerol incorporation was also similar between Ad-GFP (4.6) and Ad-ACSL5 (4.8) groups. In phospholipids, [1-14C]oleic acid incorporation did not differ between treatment groups, but [1,2,3-3H]glycerol incorporation into phospholipids was suppressed 22% in the Ad-ACSL5-infected cells. This led to an increase in the [14C]oleic acid to [3H]glycerol ratio (3.1 for Ad-GFP versus 3.8 for Ad-ACSL5), suggesting that overexpression of ACSL5 suppresses de novo phospholipid synthesis more than reacylation. The de novo synthesis of fatty acids can make a major contribution to cellular fatty acid pools. To determine whether ACSL5 activates fatty acids derived from de novo synthesis, we followed the incorporation of 2.5 mm [1-14C]acetic acid into cellular lipids. Although the metabolic fate of acetic acid differed greatly from exogenous oleic acid, we observed no differences between Ad-GFP- and Ad-ACSL5-infected cells in the metabolism of acetic acid to any cellular lipid (Fig. 4B). Thus, it appears that ACSL5 exclusively activates fatty acids from exogenous sources and does not use fatty acids that are produced endogenously. ACSL5 mRNA Abundance Changes in Response to Fasting and Refeeding Support an Anabolic Role—Our in vitro data obtained from overexpressing ACSL5 in McArdle-RH7777 cells suggest that ACSL5 partitions fatty acids to TAG synthesis. To gain insight into the in vivo regulation of ACSL5, we measured changes in ACSL5 mRNA levels in rats that were chow-fed, fasted for 48 h, or fasted for 48 h and refed a 70% sucrose diet for 24 h. Abundance of ACSL5 mRNA decreased 54% in response to a 48-h fast, but when rats were refed a high sucrose diet after the fast, ACSL5 mRNA increased 26% above chow-fed levels (Fig. 5). These in vivo changes in ACSL5 mRNA abundance further support the in vitro data showing that ACSL5 functions in an anabolic capacity. ACSL is the first enzyme required for fatty acid activation in almost all known pathways of fatty acid metabolism. Given that five isoforms have been identified in the ACSL family, as well as splice variants of several of the isoforms, we suggest that there are distinct roles for the individual isoforms and variants (26Mashek D.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Coleman R.A. Berger J. Bernlohr D.A. Black P. DiRusso C.C. Farber S.A. Guo W. Hashimoto N. Khodiyar V. Kuypers F.A. Maltais L.J. Nebert D.W. Renieri A. Schaffer J.E. Stahl A. Watkins P.A. Vasiliou V. Yamamoto T.T. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1958-1961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have advanced our understanding of the kinetic properties, tissue distribution and, to some degree, intracellular localization of the ACSL isoforms, but they have not directly shown that each isoform has a specific role in lipid metabolism. The current study was designed to directly test the effect of an individual ACSL isoform, ACSL5, on the partitioning of fatty acids in the rat hepatoma McArdle-RH7777 cell line. These cells are useful because their fatty acid metabolism is similar to that of hepatocytes and, unlike many hepatoma cell lines, McArdle-RH7777 cells secrete TAG in lipoprotein-containing particles (27Hansson P.K. Asztely A.K. Clapham J.C. Schreyer S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have shown that overexpression of ACSL5 increases fatty acid metabolism and primarily partitions exogenous fatty acids to TAG that is destined for intracellular storage but not secretion. This increase in TAG synthesis was only observed at a high fatty acid concentration (500 μm) that would be typical of preprandial concentrations or a short term fast (23Bortz W.M. Steele L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Fuller R.W. Diller E.R. Metabolism. 1970; 19: 226-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that at lower fatty acid concentrations, sufficient endogenous ACSL activity is present to metabolize exogenous fatty acids to acyl-CoAs. However, when higher concentrations of fatty acids are present in the medium, cellular ACSL activity may become limiting, thus hindering fatty acid uptake. By overexpressing ACSL5 and increasing total cellular ACSL activity 2-fold, intracellular fatty acid can be metabolized more rapidly, and fatty acid uptake increases. To date, most studies monitoring fatty acid uptake have focused on plasma membrane proteins such as fatty acid translocase/CD36 or fatty acid transport proteins. Although these proteins undoubtedly enhance fatty acid uptake, the exact mechanism is not clear. If overexpressing an intracellular enzyme involved in activating fatty acids can increase the flux of fatty acids through a given pathway, this would suggest that uptake might be regulated by intracellular concentrations of fatty acids. Pownall and Hamilton (28Pownall H.J. Hamilton J.A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) propose that increased intracellular conversion of fatty acids to acyl-CoAs and their subsequent metabolism may “pull” fatty acids into the cell by altering the fatty acid gradient across the plasma membrane. In support of this hypothesis, 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase overexpression increases oleic acid uptake in both adipocytes and myotubes (29Ruan H. Pownall H.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although plasma membrane proteins may catalyze part of the transport process, metabolism of the incoming fatty acids may be more critical in regulation. The 40% increase in fatty acid incorporation into TAG, without substantial increases in any other lipid besides DAG, gives credence to the hypothesis that individual ACSL isoforms partition fatty acids toward distinct pathways. Surprisingly, the increase in fatty acid incorporation into cellular TAG did not coincide with increased TAG secretion. Since medium TAG increased proportionately with increasing amounts of fatty acid added to the medium, we can eliminate the possibility that the capacity for very low density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion was limiting. Therefore, fatty acids activated by ACSL5 may be destined for an intracellular TAG pool with a low turnover rate. It is not known whether DAG synthesized via enzymes located on mitochondria is more or less prone to intracellular storage or secretion when compared with endoplasmic reticulum-located enzymes, which include the terminal enzyme in TAG synthesis, diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Overexpressing mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase increases cellular TAG without increasing very low density lipoprotein secretion in rat primary hepatocytes and thus argues that initiating the TAG synthetic pathway in mitochondria predisposes the resulting TAG to storage (30Lewin T.M. Wang S. Nagle C.A. Van Horn C.G. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E835-E844Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In agreement with the cell radiolabel studies, rat liver ACSL5 mRNA decreased following a 48-h fast and increased upon refeeding a high sucrose diet for 24 h. This pattern of ACSL5 message abundance suggests that it encodes an enzyme involved in a TAG synthetic pathway. Additional studies have also shown that ACSL5 mRNA is regulated in a manner concordant with an anabolic pathway. Hepatic ACSL5 message abundance increases in SREBP-1c transgenic mice (15Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) and in zinc-deficient mice that have fatty livers (17tom Dieck H. Doring F. Fuchs D. Roth H.P. Daniel H. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, hepatic ACSL5 mRNA levels do not respond to peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α agonists (14Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Krisans S.K. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 404: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and decrease in models with suppressed lipogenic gene expression such as SREBP cleavage-activating protein knock-out mice (15Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), estrogen-related receptor knock-out mice (18Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.A. Richard D. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and C57BL/6J obese ob/ob mice following leptin administration (16Liang C.P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49066-49076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast to mRNA changes, rat hepatic mitochondrial ACSL5 protein increases after a 48-h fast and decreases when rats are refed a high sucrose diet (6Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Discordant regulation of ACSL5 mRNA and protein or ACSL5 abundance on mitochondria and microsomes may occur. Studies using triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4 but not ACSL5, have shown more pronounced decreases in glycerolipid synthesis than in fatty acid β-oxidation (10Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Wiedmer P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Based on these data, ACSL5 was hypothesized to activate fatty acids for β-oxidation. Therefore, it was surprising that Ad-ACSL5-infected cells did not substantially alter ASM synthesis. It is possible that ACSL5 activates fatty acids for both anabolic and catabolic pathways and that the supply of acyl-CoAs derived from ACSL5 may be rate-limiting for TAG synthesis but not for ASM synthesis. This rationale could explain the observed increase in cellular TAG without a corresponding change in ASM synthesis. To further explore this hypothesis, we inhibited ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4, the other known ACSL isoforms in McArdle-RH7777 cells with triacsin C. Interestingly, overexpression of ACSL5 conferred resistance to the suppressive effects of triacsin C on cellular TAG synthesis and the total amount of fatty acid metabolized. However, in Ad-ACSL5-infected cells treated with triacsin C, ASM synthesis decreased 21%. It should be noted that this decrease was attenuated when compared with the 66% decrease in ASM synthesis in Ad-GFP-infected cells treated with triacsin C. Thus, some of the acyl-CoAs derived from ACSL5 were likely used for ASM synthesis when the other ACSL isoforms were inhibited. Although we hypothesize that ACSL isoforms have unique roles in partitioning fatty acids, it is unlikely that an individual isoform activates fatty acids exclusively for a given pathway. More likely, a given ACSL isoform may activate fatty acids that are predominantly metabolized into a specific pathway. Some acyl-CoAs, however, may “escape” and be metabolized by alternate pathways. In contrast to the effects of triacsin C in primary hepatocytes and fibroblasts, in Ad-GFP-infected McArdle-RH7777 cells, triacsin C had similar inhibitory effects on both TAG and ASM synthesis. Although the triacsin C data further substantiate a major role for ACSL5 in TAG synthesis, there are many caveats when using triacsin C. Many of the ACSL isoforms have splice variants, most of which have not been tested for triacsin C sensitivity. Very long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSVL) also possess some activity toward long chain fatty acids. Similar to the ACSL splice variants, triacsin C sensitivity has not been tested in many of the ACSVL isoforms. Additional research is needed to further characterize other ACSL variants or ACSVL isoforms, their splice variants, subcellular locations, and sensitivity to triacsin C. In summary, adenoviral overexpression of ACSL5 in McArdle-RH7777 cells increased fatty acid uptake into cells that were exposed to fatty acid concentrations typical of a short term fast or preprandial state. Although high fatty acid concentrations were needed to observe the increase in fatty acid uptake, fatty acid incorporation into cellular TAG was increased at all fatty acid concentrations tested. Despite the increase in cellular TAG synthesis, Ad-ACSL5-infected cells did not increase the amount of TAG secreted into the medium and did not use endogenously synthesized fatty acids. Taken together with changes in hepatic mRNA levels in response to fasting and refeeding, we showed that, in contrast to our original hypothesis, ACSL5 is predominantly involved in synthetic rather than catabolic pathways. Although it is possible that the function of overexpressed ACSL5 may differ from that of the endogenous enzyme, these data suggest a unique role for ACSL5 in fatty acid and TAG metabolism in McArdle-RH7777 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2029537608,"The transcription factor Egr-1 regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in differentiation, growth, and in response to environmental signals. Egr-1 activity is modulated in part through the binding of corepressors Nab1 and Nab2. Nab2 appears crucial for controlling Egr-1-mediated transactivation because it is a delayed early response gene, induced by the same stimuli that induce the immediate early gene Egr-1. To identify important elements regulating Nab2 expression, we cloned the human Nab2 gene and investigated the 5′-region. The TATA- and initiator-less Nab2 promoter, located from –679 to –74 bp, contains a total of 11 Egr binding sites, including a cluster of multiple overlapping Egr/Sp1 sites between –329 and –260 bp. This region is critical for basal promoter activity as well as for maximum induction by phorbol esters. Electromobility shifts show that Sp1 binds to this region in normal and stimulated cells, whereas stimulation induces binding of Egr-1. In addition Egr-1 activates the Nab2 promoter in a pattern similar to phorbol esters, suggesting that Egr-1 is a major inducer of protein kinase C-mediated Nab2 induction. Depletion of Egr-1 by each of two distinct Egr-1 short-interfering RNAs reduces Nab2 expression and inducibility, confirming that Egr-1 is an important regulator of Nab2 expression. Transfection experiments show that Egr-1-induced Nab2 promoter activity is itself repressed by Nab2. These results indicate that Egr-1 mediates the induction of its own repressor, thereby preventing a permanent transactivation of Egr-1 target genes and a damaging overreaction in response to environmental signals.

Although Egr-1 expression is low or undetectable in resting cells, it is rapidly and transiently induced by a wide variety of environmental signals including growth factors, cytokines, and toxic substances (1Thiel G. Cibelli G. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 193: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Egr-1 in turn activates the transcription of numerous target genes including growth factors that themselves induce Egr-1, as e.g. platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), thereby establishing a positive autocrine feedback loop. Egr-1 activity is tightly regulated, in part through the function of two proteins, NGFI-A-binding protein (Nab)1 and Nab2, which prevents the permanent activation of Egr-1 target genes and signaling pathways such as those for PDGF (2Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which could lead to cellular transformation. Nab proteins were first identified as Egr-1-binding proteins in a two-hybrid assay (3Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol.

Nab2, which is also known as mader (melanoma-associated delayed early response gene), was independently identified as a nuclear protein overexpressed in human malignant melanoma (5Kirsch K.H. Korradi Y. Johnson J.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 963-971PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Nab1 and Nab2 to Egr-1 through interaction between the NCD1 (Nab conserved domain 1) and the R1 domain of Egr-1 has been shown to inhibit Egr-1 activity. early growth response NGFI-A binding protein activator protein 2 Nab conserved domain short-interfering RNA phorbol myristate acetate electrophoretic mobility shift assay pleckstrin homology-like domain A-1 reverse transcription PCR glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. early growth response NGFI-A binding protein activator protein 2 Nab conserved domain short-interfering RNA phorbol myristate acetate electrophoretic mobility shift assay pleckstrin homology-like domain A-1 reverse transcription PCR glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Although Nab1 is constitutively expressed in most cells, Nab2 is a delayed early response gene and is induced by the same environmental signals that lead to Egr-1 expression. This suggests that Nab2 is the more important Egr-1 regulator, crucial for controlling Egr-1-mediated activation of transcription. Although this indicates the importance of understanding how the expression of Nab2 is regulated, little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of the Nab2 gene. In the study presented here we show that Egr-1 has a significant influence on the regulation of the expression of its repressor protein Nab2. Depletion of Egr-1 by transfection of each of two distinct short-interfering (si)RNAs directed against Egr-1 reduced Nab2 expression. In addition the Nab2 promoter was shown to contain multiple putative Egr binding sites and a regulatory region, containing a cluster of multiple overlapping Egr/Sp1 sites, which is required for basal promoter activity and maximum phorbol ester-mediated induction. Although Sp1 was shown to bind to this region both in normal and phorbol ester-stimulated cells, stimulation with phorbol ester induced Egr-1 expression and Egr-1 binding to the Nab2 promoter. In addition Egr-1 activates the Nab2 promoter in a manner similar to that of phorbol ester. The Egr-1-mediated activation of Nab2 transcription was repressed by Nab2 in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the existence of an Egr-1-Nab2 negative feedback mechanism. Cell Lines and Materials—Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), established in our laboratory or obtained through exchange. The human melanoma cell lines Mel 888 and Mel Ei, the human colon carcinoma cell lines Colo 320DM and LoVo and the human cervix carcinoma HeLa L cell line were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Inserts of all constructs were validated by sequencing. Jetstar 2.0 plasmid kit (Genomed, Löhne, Germany) was used for DNA preparation. Isolation and Characterization of the Nab2 Genomic Sequence— 2.5 × 105 independent clones of a lambda-Gem-11 human leukocyte genomic library (Promega) were screened with a 463-bp Nab2 cDNA fragment corresponding to base pairs 223–685 of the GenBank sequence NM_005967. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) by random priming and hybridization was performed as described (8Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Purified DNA from two positive clones (m1, m4) was digested with restriction endonucleases and analyzed by Southern blotting for hybridization with the screening probe. Positive fragments were subcloned into pBluescriptII vectors for further analysis. The Nab2 genomic sequence was deposited with GenBank (AF268380). Identification of the potential promoter region and transcription factor binding sites was conducted using the Genomatix suite of programs (9Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Production of Nab2 5′-Region Deletion Reporter Constructs—All constructs were generated by PCR amplification using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) with antisense primer Nab2-21 containing HindIII restriction site 5′-CGAAAGCTTGCTGCCCTTCTCGGTGCC-3′ plus the following sense primers containing KpnI restriction site: Nab2-872, 5′-CAAGGTACCCTGCAGAGCCCCACGC-3′; Nab2-679, 5′-CAAGGTACCGTCCGTGCGCTTCTGTG-3′; Nab2-558 5′-CAAGGTACCAAGAGGGCCGGCTGTG-3′; Nab2-468 5′-CACGGTACCTCGGTCACCTCGGTCCC-3′; Nab2-379 5′-CGAGGTACCTCTCCCAGTCTCTAAGC-3′; Nab2-263 5′-CAAGGTACCGGCAGCCAGCGCAGCTC-3′; Nab2-195, 5′-CAAGGTACCGCAAGCGCAGCCGGGG-3′; Nab2-74 5′-CAAGGTACCGGAAGAGGGCAGCAC-3′. Amplified fragments were subcloned into KpnI/HindIII-digested pGL3-basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) and validated by sequencing. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Each cell line was seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well (in 96-well plates) and cultured for 48 h prior to transfection. For each transfection 2–60 ng of empty and/or expression vector along with 60 or 100 ng of Nab2 promoter luciferase construct were transfected using MATra-A reagent (IBA, Goettingen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In one case cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well (in a 6-well plate) and incubated for 24 h before transfection. Forty-eight hours or as indicated after transfection, cells were lysed with cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) for 30 min on a shaker at room temperature. Luciferase activity was measured in extracts from triplicate samples using a luciferase assay kit from Promega and normalized to protein concentration using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) based on the Bradford method. Each experiment was performed at least twice using different DNA preparations of each construct. siRNA Transfections—HeLa L cells were transfected with 50 μm siRNA using siPORT NeoFX (Ambion, Austin, Texas) according to the manufacturer's recommendations in 12-well plates and incubated for 48 h. After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. siRNAs directed against Egr-1 (siRNA ID number 115234 and ID number 146223) and negative control (catalog number 4706) were purchased from Ambion. The two distinct siRNAs specific for Egr-1 that do not interfere with RNAs of other members of the Egr family were Egr-1-1 (ID number 115234), 5′-GCAGACAAAAGUGUUGUGGtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACAACACUUUUGUCUGCtt-3′ (antisense); Egr-1-2 (ID number 146223), 5′-CGACAGCAGUCCCAUUUACtt-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUAAAUGGGACUGCUGUCGtt-3′ (antisense). RT-PCR—Adherent cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the culture flask on ice. RNA was extracted using RNAeasy kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR primers, which were designed to amplify cDNA and not genomic DNA, were human Egr-1, 5′-TCAGGCGGACACGGGCGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCGCAGCTCAGGGGTGGGC-3′ (reverse), human Nab2, 5′-GACCCTGCAGCCCAGACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAGGCAGTGGTGATAGCTTC-3′ (reverse) and human GAPDH, 5′-AATTCCATGGCACCGTCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTT-3′ (reverse). To check for linear amplification each PCR was performed with 1 μl of undiluted cDNA and serial dilutions of 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. Linear amplification for each PCR was achieved with 1 μl of 1:10 diluted cDNA. Therefore, each PCR was performed using 1 μl of 1:10 diluted cDNA in a 20-μl PCR with the use of Taq polymerase and buffer Y from Peqlab (Erlangen, Germany). Products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose gel. To control for the integrity and uniformity of the sample preparations, GAPDH mRNA was amplified. Densitometric analysis was performed using SigmaGel software (SPSS science). Nuclear Extract Preparation—Mel 888 cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 3 h with PMA. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 5 × 107 cells using the high salt extraction as described (10Leung S. McCracken S. Ghysdael J. Miyamoto N.G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 989-997PubMed Google Scholar). EMSAs—Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Nuclear extracts (12 μg of protein) were incubated for 40 min on ice with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 15 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). For oligonucleotide competitions and antibody supershift/blocking experiments, the gel shift mixture was preincubated on ice for 30 min with 40 ng of oligonucleotide competitor or 2 μg of antibody. Preincubation with Egr-1 antibody was performed at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate EDTA at 125V for 3 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens at –80 °C. Antibodies against Egr-1 (sc-110 X) and Sp1 (sc-59 X) as well as oligonucleotides for consensus and mutant DNA-binding domains of Egr-1 (sc-2529/sc-2530) and Sp1 (sc-2502/sc-2503) were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) Rabbit control serum (X903) was obtained from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). Isolation of the Nab2 Genomic Sequence—The full-length Nab2 gene was isolated from a human leukocyte genomic library screened with a 463-bp probe from the 5′-region of the cDNA. Two phage clones, m1 and m4, were obtained. A 7.4-kb BamHI fragment (4B7) from m1 and a 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment (1E10) from m4 were subcloned and sequenced. Clone 4B7 was found to contain the entire Nab2 gene as well as an 1845-bp region 5′ to the first ATG (Fig. 1). As previously reported the Nab2 gene consists of 7 exons (3Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). All 6 introns fulfill the GT-AG rule. Comparison of the exon sequence with the sequence of the drop8 variant cDNA (GenBank AJ011081), which was isolated from a human melanoma cell line, showed that this is a splice variant lacking exon 6 (Fig. 1). Identification of Nab2 Promoter Region—The Nab2 expression is driven by a promoter with high GC content, which contains no typical core promoter elements such as TATA box, initiator sequence, or CAAT box. In silico analysis indicated a CpG island at bp –876 to +82, a putative promoter region at bp –705 to –82 relative to translation start site and several putative Egr, Sp1, NFκB, and AP2 transcription factor binding sites as well as a cAMP-responsive element (Fig. 2). To identify promoter elements that control Nab2 transcription, the 5′-region of Nab2 was used to drive a promoterless firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. This construct as well as serially 5′-truncated fragments were assessed for activity by transient transfection in Nab2 expressing Colo 320DM and Mel 888 cells (Fig. 2). The activity of the luciferase reporter maluc-679 was comparable with that of maluc-872 and a construct containing the 5′-full-length genomic DNA of Nab2 (data not shown), whereas the activity of maluc-558, lacking two Egr sites, one Sp1, and one AP2 binding site, was reduced by 20–30%. These findings indicate that maluc-679 includes the complete Nab2 promoter. The removal of an additional 90 bp, including one Egr and one Egr/Sp1 binding site, up to nucleotide –468 reduced the activity by another 20%, whereas further deletion up to bp –379 had no influence on the luciferase activity. This indicates that the Egr/Sp1 binding site at bp –422 has no important function in basal expression. Further 5′-truncation of the Nab2 promoter to nucleotide –263 resulted in a loss of luciferase activity of 72% in Mel 888 and 60% in Colo 320DM, compared with maluc-379, suggesting the presence of a major regulatory element in the promoter region between bp –379 to –263. This region contains multiple overlapping Egr/Sp1 sites and one AP2 binding site (see Fig. 6A). The activity of maluc-195, lacking one Egr/Sp1 binding site and a cAMP-responsive element compared with maluc-263, declined by a further 60%. Further truncation of an additional 121 nucleotides, comprising one Egr binding site, up to bp –74 essentially abolished transcriptional activity.FIGURE 6Members of the Egr family bind to the Nab2 promoter.

This region includes four Egr, three overlapping Egr/Sp1 binding sites, one Sp1, one AP2 site, a cAMP-responsive element, and one cluster of multiple Egr/Sp1 binding sites. Analysis of the deletion constructs indicate a major regulatory element at –329 to –260 bp, which contains multiple Egr/Sp1 sites and a single AP2 site (see Fig. 6A). The correlation of the activity with the number of Sp1 sites in the deletion constructs points to a role for the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 in basal promoter activity. The Nab2 Promoter Is Activated by Egr-1—The Nab2 promoter contains several putative Egr or overlapping Egr/Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 2), suggesting that members of the Egr transcription factor family are major regulators of Nab2 expression. Egr-1 has been shown to induce Nab2 mRNA expression when transfected into murine neuroblastoma cells (11Ehrengruber M.U. Muhlebach S.G. Sohrman S. Leutenegger C.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 258: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and was identified as a Egr-1 target gene by Affymetrix microarray (12Fu M. Zhu X. Zhang J. Liang J. Lin Y. Zhao L. Ehrengruber M.U. Chen Y.E. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3A transfection of Egr-1 leads to Nab2 gene expression in human colon carcinoma cells. Colo 320DM cells were transfected with human Egr-1 or control vector and RT-PCR was performed 48 h later. Nab2 mRNA was increased after Egr-1 transfection, but remained unaffected after transfection of the control protein Phlda-1. To determine whether Egr-1 influences the Nab2 promoter activity, human Egr-1 was transfected together with the human Nab2 promoter reporter construct. Sixty ng of the reporter construct maluc-872, which contains the complete Nab2 promoter, were transfected into Colo 320DM, LoVo, Mel 888, and Mel Ei cells together with 40 ng of Egr-1 or Phlda-1 as control. In all cell lines, Egr-1 increased Nab2 promoter activity compared with Phlda-1 (Fig. 3B). Induction was higher in melanoma cell lines (4–5-fold) than in colon carcinoma cell lines (2–3-fold). Additional experiments indicated that activation of the Nab2 promoter by Egr-1 is dose-dependent, reaching a plateau at 20 ng of Egr-1 (Fig. 3C). Transfection of Phlda-1 did not influence the Nab2 promoter activity. These results indicate that Egr-1 induces the expression of its own corepressor by stimulating Nab2 promoter activity. Depletion of Egr-1 Reduces the Inducibility of Nab2 in Response to Phorbol Ester—To examine the significance of Egr-1 in the regulation of Nab2 expression two distinct siRNAs specific for Egr-1 (Egr-1-1 and Egr-1-2) and a negative control siRNA, with no similarity to human gene sequences, were transfected into HeLa L cells. After 48 h the cells were stimulated with PMA, and RT-PCR analysis of Egr-1 and Nab2 expression was performed at 20 min and 1 h. As can be seen from Fig. 4 this cell line expresses both Egr-1 and Nab2 under normal growth conditions. Transfection of control siRNA did not influence the typical mRNA expression patterns of either Egr-1 or Nab2. A 3-fold Egr-1 induction in response to PMA was observed after 20 min, which increased to 4-fold after 1 h, whereas a 2-fold induction of Nab2 expression was first seen 1 h after PMA treatment. Transfection of two siRNAs directed against Egr-1 (Egr-1-1 and Egr-1-2) resulted in a decrease of basal Egr-1 mRNA expression of 40% (Egr-1-2) and 70% (Egr-1-1), respectively (Fig. 4B). Although PMA stimulation induced Egr-1 expression after 20 min in Egr-1 siRNA-treated cells, the Egr-1 mRNA levels were reduced by 60% in Egr-1-1 and 70% in Egr-1-2-transfected cells compared with control cells. In contrast to control siRNA-treated cells, no further increase in Egr-1 expression was detectable after 1 h. Depletion of Egr-1 influenced Nab2 expression as well. Transfection of Egr-1 siRNAs reduced basal Nab2 mRNA levels by 65% (Egr-1-2) and 80% (Egr-1-1) (Fig. 4C). Stimulation with PMA increased Nab2 mRNA levels at 1 h, but this was reduced by 70% compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Transfection of each of the two siRNAs directed against Egr-1 inhibited not only Egr-1 expression but also resulted in a decrease of Nab2 expression, confirming that endogenous Egr-1 has a significant influence on the regulation of Nab2 expression. Identification of Elements Mediating the Nab2 Induction—Nab2 is a delayed early response gene and can be induced by exposure to growth factors and mitogens as well as by stimulation with phorbol esters such as PMA. To identify elements in the Nab2 promoter mediating induction by phorbol esters the 5′-truncated fragments were transfected into Colo 320DM and Mel 888 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of PMA for 24 h (Fig. 5A). In Colo 320DM cells truncation of the Nab2 complete promoter to bp –379 relative to translation start site had no influence on luciferase activity in response to PMA. Further deletion up to bp –263 reduced luciferase activity by 80%. A 4–5-fold stimulation in response to PMA is still observed with maluc-263, and this is reduced to 2–3-fold in maluc-195. These results indicate an important element between bp –379 and –263, which is necessary for maximum activation of the Nab2 promoter in response to PMA in Colo 320DM cells, as well as responsive elements between bp –263 and –74. The region between bp –379 and –263 has already been shown to be important for basal promoter activity and contains a complex cluster of binding sites, including several Egr/Sp1 motifs (Fig. 6A). An additional Egr/Sp1 binding site, a cAMP-responsive element, and a single Egr binding site are located between bp –263 and –74. The importance of the region between bp –379 and –263 in mediating PMA induction is also observed in Mel 888 cells. However, in these cells additional elements located further upstream contribute significantly to PMA induction. In Mel 888 cells luciferase activity of maluc-872, containing the full Nab2 promoter, was 2.5-fold higher than that of maluc-379 and maluc-468 after PMA treatment. This region contains additional four Egr binding sites, one Egr/Sp1 site, one AP2, and a single NFκB binding motif. This implies that a cluster of multiple Egr/Sp1 binding sites and one AP2 binding site located at bp –329 to –260, present in maluc-379 but not in maluc-263, is the major regulatory element in the Nab2 promoter for induction of transcription after PMA stimulation. Identification of Egr-1-responsive Elements in the Nab2 Promoter— The expression of transcription factors of the Egr family but not Sp1 (2Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

To investigate whether Egr-1 activates the Nab2 promoter deletion reporter constructs in the same manner as PMA, the 5′-truncated fragments were assessed for activity in Colo 320DM and Mel 888 cells after transfection with 40 ng of human Egr-1 or Phlda-1 DNA as control (Fig. 5B). In Colo 320DM cells the pattern of induction of the Nab2 promoter by Egr-1 was nearly identical to that after PMA stimulation, although the activation after PMA treatment was higher than after Egr-1 transfection. In addition the construct maluc-195 responds to PMA, whereas it does not respond to Egr-1 transfection in Colo 320DM cells. These results indicate the involvement of additional transcription factors in response to PMA in this cell line. Corresponding to the results obtained after PMA stimulation, the cluster of multiple Egr/Sp1 sites and one AP2 binding motif, located between bp –379 and –263, was necessary for maximum Egr-1-mediated activation of the Nab2 promoter in Colo 320DM cells. These results indicated that in this cell line the same promoter regulatory elements that respond to PMA are also responsive to Egr-1, suggesting that Egr-1 binding sites mediate the PMA stimulation. In Mel 888 cells both the pattern and strength of induction after Egr-1 transfection coincides with that observed after PMA stimulation. The region between bp –379 and –260 is also of major importance in response to E"
https://openalex.org/W2064196866,"The relationship between NF-kappaB and resistance to radiation treatment in many tumor cell types has been generally well recognized. However, which members of the NF-kappaB family contribute to radiation resistance is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that RelB plays an important radioprotective role in aggressive prostate cancer cells, in part by the induction of antioxidant and antiapoptotic manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene. RelB is both constitutively present and is inducible by radiation in aggressive prostate cancer cells. Using ectopically expressed dominant negative inhibitor, p100 mutant, and the siRNA approach, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of RelB significantly decreases the levels of MnSOD resulting in a significant increase in the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to radiation treatment. These results demonstrate that RelB plays an important role in redox regulation of the cell and protects aggressive prostate cancer cells against radiation-induced cell death. Thus, inhibition of RelB could be a novel mechanism to radiosensitize prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021955903,"The structure and dynamics of the enzyme-substrate complex of Bacillus 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase, one of the most active glycoside hydrolases, is investigated by means of Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations (CPMD) combined with force field molecular dynamics (QM/MM CPMD). It is found that the substrate sugar ring located at the –1 subsite adopts a distorted 1S3 skew-boat conformation upon binding to the enzyme. With respect to the undistorted 4C1 chair conformation, the 1S3 skew-boat conformation is characterized by: (a) an increase of charge at the anomeric carbon (C1), (b) an increase of the distance between C1 and the leaving group, and (c) a decrease of the intraring O5-C1 distance. Therefore, our results clearly show that the distorted conformation resembles both structurally and electronically the transition state of the reaction in which the substrate acquires oxocarbenium ion character, and the glycosidic bond is partially broken. Together with analysis of the substrate conformational dynamics, it is concluded that the main determinants of substrate distortion have a structural origin. To fit into the binding pocket, it is necessary that the aglycon leaving group is oriented toward the β region, and the skew-boat conformation naturally fulfills this premise. Only when the aglycon is removed from the calculation the substrate recovers the all-chair conformation, in agreement with the recent determination of the enzyme product structure. The QM/MM protocol developed here is able to predict the conformational distortion of substrate binding in glycoside hydrolases because it accounts for polarization and charge reorganization at the –1 sugar ring.

The reaction mechanism, a classical textbook example of enzymatic reaction, has attracted much interest because genetically inherited disorders of glycoside hydrolysis often occur and because inhibitors of these enzymes can act as new therapeutic agents for the treatment of viral infections (1Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 2Hurtley S. Service R. Szuromi P. Science. 291. 2001: 2263-2502Google Scholar). Despite the large number of GHs known, classified into more than 90 families (1Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar), the catalytic mechanism is similar. They typically operate by means of acid/base catalysis with retention or inversion of the anomeric configuration, although a different mechanism has recently been proposed for the GH family 4 (3Yip V.L.Y.

The acid/base reaction is assisted by two essential residues: a proton donor and a nucleophile or general base residue (4White A. Rose D.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Inverting enzymes operate by a single nucleophilic substitution, whereas retaining glycosidases follow a double displacement mechanism via formation and hydrolysis of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Both steps involve oxocarbenium ion-like transition states (Fig. 1). A current issue in the understanding of GH mechanisms is the conformational itinerary that the substrate follows during the reaction (5Davies G.J. Ducros V.M.-A. Varrot A. Zechel D.L. Biochem. Soc.

These enzymes act on linear β-glucans containing β-1,3 and β-1,4 linkages such as cereal β-glucans and lichenan, with a strict cleavage specificity for β-1,4 glycosidic bonds on 3-O-substituted glucosyl residues.

The Michaelis complex of neither 1,3–1,4-β-glucanases nor another member of the GH 16 enzymes has yet to be characterized. However, during the last decade a growing number of crystallographic studies on retaining β-glycoside hydrolases have shown that the substrate binds to the enzyme in a distorted conformation (5Davies G.J. Ducros V.M.-A. Varrot A. Zechel D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the saccharide unit binding at subsite 3Subsite is defined as the group of amino acid residues in the enzyme binding site that interacts with a single monosaccharyl unit of the oligo or polysaccharide substrate. The scissile glycosidic bond is in-between subsites –1 and +1, and subsites are numbered –1, –2, ···, –n towards the non-reducing end of the bound saccharide, and +1, +2, ···, +n on the reducing end site (20Davies G.J.

Recent crystallographic studies on Thermobifida fusca endoglucanase Cel6A show a significant decrease in activity upon mutation of the closest Tyr residue, a feature, which has been attributed to a conformation change of the substrate in subsite –1 from skew-boat to chair (24Zhou W.L.

It is also worth noting that a 4C1-2S0 equilibrium has been recently detected in the binding of glycosylaminoglycans to polypeptides by NMR techniques (26Canales A. Angulo J. Ojeda R. Bruix M. Fayos R. Lozano R. Giménez-Gallego G. Martín-Lomas M. Nieto P.M. Jiménez-Barbero J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5778-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This kind of saccharide ring distortion has favorable mechanistic consequences in glycoside hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 2b, the 1S3 distortion places the glycosidic oxygen near the acid/base residue. It also reduces the steric interaction between the hydrogen at the anomeric carbon and the nucleophile, and places the aglycon (i.e. the leaving group) in a pseudo-axial position that facilitates nucleophile attack on the anomeric carbon (27Kirby A.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1984; 17: 305-311Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These distortions in the Michaelis complex are therefore in the pathway to reach the transition state of the reaction. The fact that all β-glycoside hydrolase enzyme-substrate complexes so far characterized by x-ray crystallography bear a distorted substrate suggests that substrate distortion is a general feature of β-glycoside hydrolases. However, in most cases these distortions are encountered in inhibitor-enzyme complexes (i.e. modified forms of the substrate) or in complexes with inactive enzyme mutants, which also raises the question whether the inhibitor or the mutant could affect the substrate conformation (28García-Herrero A. Montero E. Munñoz J.J. Espinosa J.F. Vián A. García J.L. Asensio J.L. Canñada F.J. Jiménez-Barbero J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 4804-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Theoretical calculations can be very helpful to solve these issues, as they can be performed directly on the “native” substrate-bound enzyme. Classical molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the boat conformation at subsite –1 is critical in the mechanism of family 18 chitinases (29Brameld K.A. Goddard W.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3571-3580Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent studies confirmed that the –1 sugar moiety of the substrate in cellulase Cel6A from Trichoderma reesei, an inverting glycosidase, adopts a skew-boat conformation (2S0) (30André G. Kanchanawong P. Palma R. Cho H. Deng X. Irwin D. Himmel M.E. Wilson D.B. Brady J.W. Protein Eng. 1. 2003; 6: 125-134Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, modeling studies of β-galactosidase and xylanases provided evidence of substrate distortion (15Espinosa J.F. Montero E. Vian A. García J.L. Dietrich H. Schmidt R.R. Martín-Lomas M. Imberty A. Canñada F.J. Jiménez-Barbero J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 1309-1318Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Kankainen M. Laitinen T. Peräkylä Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 5074-5080Crossref Google Scholar). All these studies rely on parametrized expressions (force fields) to describe the interaction among atoms, and thus the interplay of electronic/structural factors on the substrate conformation cannot be analyzed. To overcome these limitations, we have taken a step forward in accuracy and predictive power by using first principles methods, thus taking into account electronic effects and charge rearrangements in the active site. In the framework of our structure/function studies of bacterial 1,3–1,4-β-glucanases (7Planas A. Biochim. Biochim. Acta. 2000; 1543: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 32Faijes M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16092-16104Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we investigate here the conformation of the substrate in the Michaelis complex of Bacillus 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase by means of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations (35Wharshel A. Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar). In this approach, the atoms of the QM region evolve in time under the effect of the quantum mechanical forces, computed using density functional theory (DFT), and the electronic cloud adapts instantaneously to the chemical environment, whereas the forces on the MM region are ruled by a force field. The effect of the enzyme on the properties of the substrate is analyzed, providing insight on the factors leading to the substrate conformation we predict for this enzyme. The substrate chosen for the analysis is the 4-methylumbelliferyl tetrasaccharide shown in Fig. 3, which is a good substrate extensively used in enzyme kinetics (32Faijes M. Pérez X. Pérez O. Planas A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13304-13318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Planas A. Nieto J. Abel M. Segade A. Biocatal.

To the best of our knowledge, the conformational itinerary of the substrate in GHs has not yet been investigated by the first principles methods. Enzyme-Substrate Initial Structure—The only structures available for 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase, a family GH16 enzyme, are that of the native enzyme (36Keitel T. Simon O. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 37Hahn M. Pons J. Planas A. Querol E. Heinemann U. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and that of the covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex with an epoxybutyl saccharide (36Keitel T. Simon O. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of the enzyme product complex has been recently characterized (PDB accession code 1U0A) (69Gaiser O.J. Piotukh K. Ponnuswamy M.N. Planas A. Borriss R. Heinemann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). This structure was used to build the initial structure of the Michaelis complex. For this purpose, the missing methylumbelliferyl aglycon (MU in Fig. 3) was inserted manually to generate the enzyme-substrate complex. This structure was submitted to a preliminary molecular dynamics simulation (33Planas A. Nieto J. Abel M. Segade A. Biocatal. Biotransfor. 2003; 21: 223-231Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) using the Cornell et al. force field (38Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar), as implemented in the HYPERCHEM package, 4www.hyper.com. with the restraint that only the atoms 6 Å from the anomeric carbon were allowed to move. During this procedure the substrate maintained the original chair conformation (4C1) in the four sugar rings. To force a structure similar to that of an oxocarbenium ion, the charge on the anomeric carbon was increased by 0.6 electrons. After this replacement, the sugar ring adopted a distorted 1S3 conformation. For the sake of simplification, hereafter we will use the notations 4C1-substrate and 1S3-substrate to refer to the substrate isomer in which the sugar ring of the –1 subsite adopts either 4C1 or 1S3 conformation, respectively. These two structures were used for the subsequent calculations. First Principles Molecular Dynamics Simulations—First principles molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the dynamics of the isolated substrate and that of the substrate in the presence of the catalytic residues (Glu109 and Glu105). The calculations were performed using the Car-Parrinello method (CP) (40Car R. Parrinello M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1985; 55: 2471-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9385) Google Scholar, 41Marx D. Hutter J.

Both DFT and the CP method have already been employed with success in a number of investigations of biological processes (see for instance Refs. 42Rovira C. Schulze B. Eichinger M. Evanseck J.D.

Burke K. Ernzerhof M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 3865-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (139895) Google ScholarErratum Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997; 78: 1396Google Scholar), was used. The choice of this functional is based on its reliability in the description of hydrogen bonds (60Ireta J. Neugebauer J. Sheffler M. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2004; 108: 5692-5698Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We employed ab initio pseudopotentials, generated within the Troullier-Martins scheme (61Troullier M. Martins J.L. Phys. Rev. B. 1991; 43: 1993-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (14770) Google Scholar). The Kohn-Sham orbitals (62Koch W. Holthausen M.C. A Chemist's Guide to Density Functional Theory. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2000: 41-64Google Scholar) are expanded in a plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cutoff of 70 Ry. Structural optimizations were performed by means of molecular dynamics with annealing of the atomic velocities, using a time step of 0.12 fs, and the fictitious mass of the electrons was set at 1200 a.u. With this setup the total energy and the fictitious kinetic energy of the electrons were conserved within 1.01 · 10–6 a.u./ps·atom and 3.6 · 10–5 a.u./ps·atom, respectively. The Nosé-Hoover thermostat for the nuclear degrees of freedom was used to maintain the temperature as constant as possible (63Nosé S. Mol. Phys. 1984; 52: 255-268Crossref Scopus (7356) Google Scholar). The systems were enclosed in super-cells of size 17.5 × 12.5 × 12.5 Å3 (isolated substrate) and 15.8 × 13.2 × 17.0 Å3 (substrate + catalytic residues). The calculations were performed with the CPMD program, 5CPMD program, Copyright IBM Corp. 1990–2003, Copyright MPI für Festkörperforschung, Stuttgart 1997–2001. URL: www.cpmd.org. and structure analysis was performed with VMD (65Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). Atomic charges were computed from the electrostatic potential (ESP). Interaction energies between the substrate and each of the catalytic residues were obtained by subtracting the energy of the complex from the energy of the isolated fragments in their corresponding optimized structure. The energy of the 4H3 transition conformation (the transition state for a conversion between the 1S3 and 4C1 conformers) was obtained by fixing the dihedral angle defined by the C2, C1, O5, and C5 ring atoms (hereafter referred as ϕ angle, shown in Fig. 3a) to zero degrees and optimizing all other degrees of freedom. Similarly, the 1S3 conformation (which is not a local minimum for the isolated substrate) was optimized by fixing the C2-O5-C5-C4 dihedral angle. Hybrid QM/MM Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Hybrid QM/MM simulations on the complete protein were performed for each of the two substrate conformations described above (4C1-substrate and 1S3-substrate). Before starting the QM/MM simulations, a classical molecular dynamics simulation was performed to equilibrate the protein and allow the substrate to accommodate in the binding cavity. The following parameters were used in the classical simulations. The Cornell et al. force field (38Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar), as implemented in the AMBER 7.0 program (66Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar), and the GLYCAM parameter set (67Woods R.J. Dwek R.A. Fraserreid B. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 3832-3846Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar) were used for the protein residues and for the substrate, respectively. The MU aglycon was parameterized using the antechamber module. The atomic charges of the substrate were obtained from a first principles (Car-Parrinello) calculation of the isolated substrate. All His residues (located in the protein surface) were taken as protonated (i.e. positive charge), and all Asp and Glu residues were taken as deprotonated (i.e. negative charge) except Glu109 (the acid-base residue) and Asp107, which is hydrogen-bonded to the nucleophile Glu105. Six chlorine atoms were added to achieve neutrality of the protein structure. The system was enveloped in a 52 Å × 40 Å × 66 Å box of equilibrated TIP3P water molecules and was equilibrated in several steps. First, all water molecules were relaxed with a gradient minimizer and then equilibrated for 20 ps at 150 K (protein constrained). Next, the whole system was minimized and subsequently equilibrated for 20 ps at 300 K. During equilibration, the system was coupled to a heat bath to achieve the desired temperature of 300 K. The simulation was continued for 20 ps at constant pressure, allowing the cell volume to evolve until equilibration. Analysis of the trajectories was carried out by using standard tools of AMBER. Several scenarios were tested for the initial protonation state of the acid/base (Glu109) and the Asp107 residues. The configuration that better maintained the interaction of the catalytic residues with the substrate upon a short test MD run was chosen for the production runs. In this configuration, the OH group of Glu109 interacts with Ogly and the OH group of Asp107 interacts with Glu105. Two separate classical simulations were performed, one with the substrate in the chair conformation (4C1-substrate) and another one with the substrate in the distorted skew-boat conformation (1S3-substrate). While the chair conformer was found to be stable, the skew-boat conformer evolved toward the chair one during the optimization process, unless a larger atomic charge for the anomeric carbon is used. For this reason, the simulation of the skew-boat conformer was performed by using a different charge in C1 (see above). Once the system was equilibrated and the relative position of the substrate and the enzyme did not change (i.e. the root mean-square deviation variations were stabilized), QM/MM simulations were initiated. The method developed by Laio et al. (68Laio A. VandeVondele J. Rothlisberger U. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 116: 6941-6947Crossref Scopus (557) Google Scholar) was used. This method combines the first principles molecular dynamics method of Car and Parrinello (CPMD) (40Car R. Parrinello M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1985; 55: 2471-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9385) Google Scholar) with a force field molecular dynamics methodology (i.e QM/MM CPMD). In this approach, the system is partitioned into a QM fragment and an MM fragment. The dynamics of the atoms on the QM fragment depends on the electronic density, ρ(r), computed with DFT, whereas that of the atoms on the MM fragment is ruled by an empirical force field. The QM-MM interface is modeled"

All of these stimuli are potent inducers of endothelial cell apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the role of CatD in endothelial cell apoptosis and determined the underlying mechanisms. Incubation with 100–500 μm H2O2 for 12 h induced apoptosis in endothelial cells. To determine a role for CatD, we co-incubated endothelial cells with the CatD inhibitor pepstatin A. Pepstatin A as well as genetic knock down of CatD abolished H2O2-induced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of CatD wild type but not a catalytically inactive mutant of CatD (CatDD295N) induced apoptosis under basal conditions. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the effect of CatD on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Indeed, knocking down CatD expression reduced H2O2-induced ROS formation and apoptosis. The major redox regulator in endothelial cells is thioredoxin-1 (Trx), which plays a crucial role in apoptosis inhibition. Thus, we hypothesized that CatD may alter Trx protein levels and thereby promote formation of ROS and apoptosis. Incubation with 100 μm H2O2 for 6 h decreased Trx protein levels, whereas Trx mRNA was not altered. H2O2-induced Trx degradation was inhibited by pepstatin A and genetic knock down of CatD but not by other protease inhibitors. Incubation of unstimulated cell lysates with recombinant CatD significantly reduced Trx protein levels in vitro, which was completely blocked by pepstatin A pre-incubation. Overexpression of CatD reduced Trx protein in cells. Moreover, H2O2 incubation led to a translocation of Trx to the lysosomes prior to the induction of apoptosis. Taken together, CatD induces apoptosis via degradation of Trx protein, which is an essential anti-apoptotic and reactive oxygen species scavenging protein in endothelial cells.

Lysosomes contain a variety of enzymes for the degradation of proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and lipids. Among them is the family of the proteolytic enzymes, the cathepsins (1Barrett A.J. Curr. Opin Drug. Discovery Dev. 2004; 7: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar). Cathepsins are subdivided into three classes based on the active site amino acid. Cathepsins are widely distributed in normal tissues (2Reid W.A. Valler M.J. Kay J. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1986; 39: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and involved in different physiological processes (1Barrett A.J. Curr. Opin Drug. Discovery Dev. 2004; 7: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that cathepsins are involved in the signaling pathways leading to cell death (3Leist M. Jaattela M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Salvesen G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 21-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the cathepsins, cathepsin D (CatD) 2The abbreviations used are: CatDcathepsin DROSreactive oxygen speciesTrxthioredoxin-1HUVEChuman umbilical venous endothelial cellsHEKhuman embryonic kidneyFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter.2The abbreviations used are: CatDcathepsin DROSreactive oxygen speciesTrxthioredoxin-1HUVEChuman umbilical venous endothelial cellsHEKhuman embryonic kidneyFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter. seems to have a pivotal role as a cell death mediator (5Jaattela M.

Furthermore, microinjection of CatD induces caspase-dependent apoptosis and staurosporine-mediated apoptotic cell death by CatD-triggered cytochrome c release (8Roberg K. Kagedal K. Ollinger K. Am.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, induce different cellular effects depending on the concentration and cell type. Several studies have documented the involvement of oxidative stress in apoptosis induction. Upon production of high levels of ROS from exogenous or endogenous sources, the redox balance is perturbed, and cells are shifted into a state of oxidative stress (10Parman T. Wiley M.J. Wells P.G. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These excessively high concentrations of ROS directly cause oxidative damage of DNA, lipids, and proteins and may impair cellular functions, which can result in apoptosis induction in severely damaged cells (11Inoue M. Sato E.F. Nishikawa M. Hiramoto K. Kashiwagi A. Utsumi K. Redox. Rep. 2004; 9: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Andersen J.K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S18-S25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). CatD has been implicated to be involved in oxidative stress-induced apoptotic pathways. Lysosomes, and specifically CatD, have been identified as modulators of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in alveolar type II cells (6Yin L. Stearns R. Gonzalez-Flecha B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, stabilization of lysosomes by imidazoline protected astrocytes from oxidative stress-mediated damage (13Choi S.H. Choi D.H. Lee J.J. Park M.S. Chun B.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To protect themselves from oxidative stress, cells possess a set of antioxidative enzymes, which maintain the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at appropriate levels. Among these antioxidative enzymes are superoxide dismutase and catalase (14Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two other major intracellular redox systems are the thioredoxin and glutathione systems (15Holmgren A.

The thioredoxin family includes three proteins, thioredoxin-1 (Trx), thioredoxin-2, and Sp-thioredoxin (17Taniguchi Y. Taniguchi-Ueda Y. Mori K. Yodoi J.

Recently, we demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic function of physiological concentrations of ROS is dependent on Trx expression in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) (22Haendeler J. Tischler V. Hoffmann J. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Trx inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in different cell types, including HUVEC (23Andoh T. Chock P.B. Chiueh C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9655-9660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Shioji K. Kishimoto C. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yuan Z. Oka S. Yodoi J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the functional role of CatD on apoptosis in HUVEC and the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that H2O2 induced ROS and apoptosis in HUVEC, which was completely blocked by pepstatin A, a CatD inhibitor, as well as by genetic knock-down of CatD. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the effects of H2O2 on Trx expression. H2O2 reduced Trx protein expression prior to the onset of apoptosis. Trx protein was degraded by CatD in vitro and in cells. Thus, Trx degradation may contribute to CatD- and H2O2-induced apoptosis. Cell Culture—HUVEC were cultured in endothelial basal medium supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (12 μg/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (EBM complete). After detachment with trypsin, cells were grown for at least 18 h (26Haendeler J. Weiland U. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Rippmann V. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's basal medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Plasmids—CatD was cloned out of endothelial cell-derived cDNA using the following primers: sense, 5′-GGAATTCGCCATGCAGCCCTCCAGCCTTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CGAAGCTTGAACAAGAGGCGGGCAGCCTCG-3′ incorporating EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The amplified PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(–) vector containing a Myc tag (Invitrogen). The catalytically inactive mutant of CatD (CatDD295N) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of CatD. Transfection—HUVEC or HEK293 were transfected with CatD plasmid using Superfect (Qiagen) as previously described (25Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Phosphorothiolated sense or antisense oligonucleotides (5 μg) corresponding to the CatD sequence (sense, 5′-ATGCAGCCCTCCAGCCTTCTGCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGCAGAAGGCTGGAGGGCTGCAT-3′) were transfected into HUVEC using 5 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 5 h, EBM complete was added to the cells, and 2 h later, the cells were incubated with H2O2 for another 18 h. Isolation of RNA and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was isolated using the triazole reagent (Invitrogen). Trx mRNA and GAPDH mRNA were quantified using the Qiagen SYBR Green kit according to the manufacturer's instructions in a light cycler (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblot—After stimulation, HUVEC were scraped off the plates and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). After removing cell debris (15 min, 4 °C, 20,000 × g), 60 μg of protein/slot were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection of protein expression, membranes were incubated with antibodies against Trx, anti-CatD, anti-actin, or anti-tubulin. After incubation for 2 h with the corresponding secondary antibody tagged with horseradish peroxidase, signals were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After permeabilization and blocking (permeabilization solution: 3% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline), the cells were incubated with anti-Trx antibody (1:50, BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch), the cells were incubated with an antibody against CatD (rabbit, 1:50, overnight, 4 °C, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and with rhodamine red-conjugated Fab fragment anti-rabbit (1:300, 1 h, room temperature, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.). For nuclear staining, cells were incubated with TO-PRO-3 iodide after digestion with RNase A for 15 min (1:4000, 5 min, Molecular Probes). The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss, LSM 510 META; objective, Plan-Apochromat 63×, 1.4 oil). Morphological Detection of Cell Death—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-phenylindole (0.2 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, HUVEC were co-transfected with 2.25 μg of plasmid and 0.75 μg of pcDNA3.1 vector encoding for lacZ, and apoptosis was detected by counting the morphological changes of the transfected β-galactosidase-positive cells as described previously (28Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Galle J. Zeiher A.M. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Detection of Cell Death by FACS—Detection of cell death was performed by FACS analysis using annexin V-APC binding and 7-aminoactinomycin staining (Pharmingen) as previously described (25Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Annexin V is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that has a high affinity to phosphatidylserine, which is exposed on the cell surface of apoptotic cells. In contrast, 7-amino-actinomycin is only cell-permeable when the cell membranes are damaged, indicative of necrotic cell death. Therefore, apoptotic cells are defined as annexin V-positive, 7-amino-actinomycin-negative cells. Detection of Intracellular ROS Formation—Living cells were incubated for dye uptake with 20 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) for 30 min (Molecular Probes), and ROS formation was measured by analyzing the area under the curve representing the amount of ROS formation in the cells, as previously described (25Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Measurement of CatD Activity—CatD activity was measured in HUVEC using a commercially available kit (Oncogene) and detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 405 nm. In Vitro Degradation of Trx by CatD—HUVEC were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. 100 μg of lysate was incubated with recombinant CatD in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.3) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped using SDS sample dye, and the samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, human Trx and CatD protein were detected as described above. For specificity of the in vitro assay, recombinant CatD was incubated with HUVEC lysates in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), which did not result in Trx degradation as expected. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by modified LSD (Bonferroni) test (SPSS Software). Role of CatD in Apoptosis and Endogenous ROS Formation—To address whether CatD plays a role in endothelial cell apoptosis, HUVEC were incubated with 100 and 200 μm H2O2 for 6, 12, and 18 h. H2O2 induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, starting at 12 h (Fig. 1A). Pre-incubation with the cell-permeable CatD inhibitor pepstatin A (10 μg/ml) inhibited H2O2- and serum deprivation-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In contrast, incubation with the proteasome complex inhibitor MG132 or with a broad spectrum cysteine inhibitor, E64c, had no protective effect on H2O2-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Next, we cloned and overexpressed either CatD wild type or a catalytically inactive mutant of CatD (CatDD295N) in HUVEC to determine the effect of CatD on basal apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1C, CatD induced basal apoptosis in HUVEC compared with empty vector, whereas CatDD295N had no effect on apoptosis (Fig. 1D), suggesting that CatD activity is required for apoptosis induction and supporting the concept that CatD is indeed involved in the regulation of endothelial cell apoptosis. Next, we examined whether H2O2 activates CatD. Incubation with H2O2 led to a 1.7-fold increase in CatD activity in HUVEC as early as 6 h (Fig. 1E). Increase in ROS has been discussed as an important prerequisite for cathepsin D/lysosomal-dependent apoptosis induction (29Raymond M.A. Mollica L. Vigneault N. Desormeaux A. Chan J.S. Filep J.G. Hebert M.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Yin et al. (6Yin L. Stearns R. Gonzalez-Flecha B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrate that incubation with H2O2 increases endogenous ROS formation in astrocytes, resulting in dysfunctional lysosomes and mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis induction. Because CatD overexpression enhanced apoptosis induction, we determined whether CatD plays a role in intracellular ROS formation. Indeed, knocking down CatD expression abrogated H2O2-induced intracellular ROS formation as measured by FACS analysis (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the H2O2-induced apoptosis was completely abolished in CatD antisense-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, knocking down CatD expression inhibited a disturbance of the redox balance and provided protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis.FIGURE 2Knocking down CatD expression reduced H2O2-induced ROS formation and apoptosis. HUVEC were transfected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides against CatD and incubated with 200μm H2O2 for 18 h. A, intracellular ROS was measured using FACS analysis. Data are means ± S.E., n = 7; *, p < 0.01 versus CatD sense; **, p < 0.05 versus CatD sense + H2O2. B, apoptosis was measured in HUVEC by FACS analysis. Data are means ± S.E., n = 5; p < 0.05 versus CatD sense + H2O2. DCF, dichlorofluorescein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oxidative Stress-induced Trx Degradation—One of the most important redox regulators in HUVEC is Trx, which scavenges H2O2 in cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of Trx inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVEC (25Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thus, one may speculate that activation of the protease CatD by H2O2 leads to a reduction in Trx protein. To test this hypothesis, HUVEC were incubated for 6 h with H2O2, which resulted in an increase in CatD activity (Fig. 1E). Next, we measured Trx protein levels. Indeed, H2O2 treatment for 6 h decreased Trx protein levels (Fig. 3A). To exclude the influence of H2O2 on Trx mRNA, we performed a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR after incubation with 100 and 200 μm H2O2.H2O2 did not alter TRX mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). To test the causal role of CatD in Trx degradation, we next examined whether CatD antisense treatment influenced H2O2-induced Trx degradation. Indeed, degradation of Trx was completely inhibited in CatD antisense-treated HUVEC (Fig. 3C). These results were confirmed by the addition of the cell-permeable CatD inhibitor, pepstatin A. Pepstatin A pre-incubation completely blocked H2O2-induced degradation of Trx protein (Fig. 4A). To exclude that other proteases are involved in Trx degradation, we incubated HUVEC with H2O2 in the presence of different protease inhibitors. However, using the broad spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor (EDTA, 5 mm), the cysteine protease inhibitor (cell-permeable E64c, 10 μg/ml), the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (cell-permeable benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD, 100 μm), the ubiquitin proteasome inhibitor (MG132, 40 μm), and the serine protease inhibitor (cell-permeable phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm)) did not inhibit H2O2-induced Trx degradation (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4A, pepstatin A inhibited H2O2-mediated Trx protein degradation. HUVEC were incubated for 6 h with 100 μm H2O2 and pepstatin A (pep A) as indicated. Immunoblotting with an anti-Trx antibody was performed. Membranes were reprobed with an anti-tubulin antibody. A representative immunoblot is shown (left panel). The Trx/tubulin ratio was quantified by scanning densitometry using the Scion Image program (right panel). Data are means ± S.E., n = 5; *, p < 0.05 versus H2O2. B, HUVEC were incubated with H2O2 and the indicated inhibitors (EDTA, E64c, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), MG132, and benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD (ZVAD)). The Trx/tubulin ratio was quantified by scanning densitometry using the Scion Image program. Data are means ± S.E., n = 3–8). C, recombinant CatD degrades Trx in unstimulated HUVEC lysates. Unstimulated HUVEC lysates were incubated with recombinant CatD, and immunoblotting with an anti-Trx antibody was performed. Membranes were reprobed with an anti-CatD antibody. Recombinant CatD was pre-incubated with pepstatin A (pep A). A representative immunoblot is shown. D, overexpression of CatD induced Trx protein degradation. HUVEC and HEK293 were transfected with empty vector (EV) or CatD as indicated, and immunoblotting was performed with an anti-Myc or anti-CatD antibody (upper panels) and an anti-Trx antibody (middle panels). Membranes were reprobed with an anti-tubulin or anti-actin antibody (lower panels), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To underscore the specific role for CatD in the process of Trx degradation, we incubated unstimulated HUVEC lysates with recombinant CatD in an acidic environment (pH 3.3) and performed immunoblots for Trx protein. Indeed, incubation of unstimulated HUVEC lysates with CatD significantly decreased Trx protein under acidic conditions (Fig. 4C; p < 0.01). Pre-incubation of recombinant CatD with pepstatin A completely reversed the degradation process (Fig. 4C). To further support the role of CatD in Trx protein degradation, we determined Trx protein levels in CatD overexpressing HUVEC. CatD overexpression resulted in a reduction of Trx protein (Fig. 4D), To further prove the effect of CatD on Trx protein expression, we used HEK293, which can be transfected with an efficiency of 95%. Indeed, CatD overexpression abrogated Trx protein expression also in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4D). Thus, the mechanism in H2O2- and CatD overexpression-induced apoptosis may require degradation of Trx. Because CatD is located in the lysosomes and Trx in the cytosol, we next sought to determine where the degradation of Trx takes place. Recent studies (5Jaattela M. Cande C. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 135-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 9Johansson A.C. Steen H. Ollinger K. Roberg K.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1592-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggest that CatD can be released from lysosomes when the lysosomal membrane potential is disturbed and, thereby, translocates to the cytosol and may influence apoptosis pathways. Therefore, we investigated the localization of CatD and Trx after incubation with H2O2 for 6 h, which is prior to the onset of apoptosis in HUVEC (Fig. 1A). After 6 h of H2O2 incubation, we did not detect a leakage of lysosomal CatD into cytosol (data not shown). In contrast, the cytosolic Trx protein translocated from the cytosol to the lysosomes, suggesting an uptake of Trx into the lysosomes (Fig. 5). The present study demonstrated that CatD degrades Trx in vitro and in cells, which seems to be required for CatD and H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVEC. For several years, functions of lysosomal proteases have been described as a nonspecific intracellular degradation machinery acting within the lysosomes. Likewise, lysosomes were suggested to be solely involved in necrotic and autophagic cell death and their role in apoptosis to be limited to the digestion of apoptotic bodies (31Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). However, the concept has been challenged by several reports. I-cell disease (mucolipidosis type II) fibroblasts, characterized by a general deficiency in lysosomal hydrolases, are partially resistant to apoptosis induced by stress agents, such as staurosporine, sphingosine, and tumor necrosis factor α (32Tardy C. Tyynela J. Hasilik A. Levade T. Andrieu-Abadie N. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Likewise, apoptosis induction is reduced in CatD-deficient fibroblasts compared with cells from their wild-type littermates (7Wu G.S. Saftig P. Peters C. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2177-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33Neuzil J. Zhao M. Ostermann G. Sticha M. Gellert N. Weber C. Eaton J.W. Brunk U.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This concept is further supported by our study, demonstrating that overexpression of CatD induced apoptosis, whereas knocking down CatD expression by an antisense approach inhibited H2O2-mediated apoptosis. An impressive body of evidence now underscores a key role for lysosomes in apoptosis signaling with functional relationships and/or cross-talks with caspases. However, it is not clear what determines the relative contribution of lysosomal enzymes and caspases in the initiation and execution of apoptosis. It has been suggested that ROS generation following mitochondrial damage could act as a feedback to the lysosomes, resulting in further activation of lysosomal enzymes and lysosomal breakdown (34Zhao M. Antunes F. Eaton J.W. Brunk U.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 35Cirman T. Oresic K. Mazovec G.D. Turk V. Reed J.C. Myers R.M. Salvesen G.S. Turk B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3578-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), leading to a positive feedback loop and, thereby, to an exacerbation of the caspase cascade. On the other hand short term blockade of intralysosomal digestion by lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents led to an increase in lysosomal pH, consequently a decrease in intralysosomal proteolysis and intracellular ROS formation (36Yu Z. Persson H.L. Eaton J.W. Brunk U.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with the data presented in this study that indicate reduced CatD expression and activity led to a decrease in ROS. Thus, one may speculate that increase in intracellular ROS may alter lysosomal activity prior to mitochondrial damage. Here, we demonstrated that one of the most important intracellular scavengers for H2O2, Trx, is translocated to the lysosomes and degraded by CatD upon exposure to H2O2 prior to the onset of apoptosis (Figs. 1A, 3A, and 5). Moreover, H2O2-induced Trx degradation occurs prior to the onset of ROS formation (6 h, 200 μm H2O2; 102 ± 11% ROS formation compared with the control). These results suggest that Trx degradation results in increased intracellular ROS formation and, thereby, may lead to lysosomal rupture, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis induction. An important question remains: what is the trigger leading to the translocation of Trx from the cytosol to the lysosomes? Haglund et al. (37Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a prerequisite for translocation of receptor tyrosine kinases from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes is monoubiquitination of the proteins. The process of monoubiquitination is independent of the ubiquitin-proteasome complex (38Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), which fits to our study presented here, demonstrating that the specific ubiquitin-proteasome complex inhibitor, MG132, did not block H2O2-mediated degradation of Trx and apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that translocation of Trx to the lysosomes and degradation of Trx by CatD is a prerequisite for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis induction. Moreover, lysosomal activity and, subsequently, ROS formation seem to precede caspase activation during H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVEC. We thank Carmen Schön for expert technical assistance."

https://openalex.org/W2006468304,"About 70–80% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α), and estrogens play important roles in the development and growth of hormone-dependent tumors. Together with lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and histological grade, ER status is considered as one of the prognostic factors in breast cancer, and an indicator for hormonal treatment. To investigate genes and pathways that are associated with ER status and epithelial cells in breast tumor, we applied laser capture microdissection (LCM) technology to capture epithelial tumor cells from 28 lymph node-negative breast tumor samples, in which 17 patients had ER-α+ tumors, and 11 patients have ER-α− tumors. Gene expression profiles were analysed on Affymetrix Hu133A GeneChip. Meanwhile, gene profiles using total RNA isolated from bulk tumors of the same 28 patients were also generated. In total, 146 genes and 112 genes with significant P-value and having significant differential expression between ER-α+ and ER-α− tumors were identified from the LCM data set and bulk tissue data set, respectively. A total of 61 genes were found to be common in both data sets, while 85 genes were unique to the LCM data set and 51 genes were present only in the bulk tumor data set. Pathway analysis with the 85 genes using Gene Ontology suggested that genes involved in endocytosis, ceramide generation, Ras/ERK/Ark cascade, and JAT-STAT pathways may play roles related to ER. The gene profiling with LCM-captured tumor cells provides a unique approach to study epithelial tumor cells and to gain an insight into signaling pathways associated with ER."

In this study, we examined cholesterol metabolism in a thyroid hormone receptor β (TR-β) mutant mouse model of resistance to thyroid hormone. Whereas studies of cholesterol metabolism have been reported in TR-β knock-out mice, generalized expression of a non-ligand binding TR-β protein in this knock-in model more fully recapitulates the hypothyroid state, because the hypothyroid effect of TRs is mediated by the unliganded receptor. In the hypothyroid state, a high cholesterol diet increased serum cholesterol levels in wild-type animals (WT) but either did not change or reduced levels in mutant (MUT) mice relative to hypothyroidism alone. 7α-Hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol metabolism and mRNA levels were undetectable in the hypothyroid state in all animals. triiodothyronine replacement restored CYP7A1 mRNA levels in WT mice but had minimal effect in MUT mice. In contrast, a high cholesterol diet markedly induced CYP7A1 levels in MUT but not WT mice in the hypothyroid state. Elevation of CYP7A1 mRNA levels and reduced hepatic cholesterol content in MUT animals are likely because of cross-talk between TR-β and liver X receptor α (LXR-α), which both bind to a direct repeat + 4(DR+4) element in the CYP7A1 promoter. In transfection studies, WT but not MUT TR-β antagonized induction of this promoter by LXR-α. Electromobility shift analysis revealed that LXR/RXR heterodimers bound to the DR+4 element in the presence of MUT but not WT TR-β.

A third pathway involves the elimination of cholesterol through the synthesis of bile acids; 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway (8Chiang J.Y. Stroup D. J. Biol.

Thyroid hormone is known to regulate each of these pathways at the transcriptional level, and the predominate thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoform in the liver is TR-β1 (9Myant N.B. Mitropoulos K.A.

Therefore, TR-β knock-out mice (–/–) have been analyzed in detail for changes in cholesterol metabolism (13Weiss R.E. Murata Y. Cua K. Hayashi Y. Seo H. Refetoff S.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that serum cholesterol levels did not increase in response to hypothyroidism nor decrease after triiodothyronine (T3) replacement in TR-β knock-out mice (–/–). Gullberg et al. (14Gullberg H. Rudling M. Forrest D. Angelin B. Vennstrom B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also reported that T3-deficient TR-β–/– mice showed an augmented CYP7A1 response to dietary cholesterol and did not develop hypercholesterolemia to the same extent as wild-type mice. Unfortunately, TR knock-out mice do not recapitulate the findings in either the hypothyroid state or in the syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance as other groups, including our own, have demonstrated that the TR possesses ligand-independent properties (15Hashimoto K. Curty F.H. Borges P.P. Lee C.E. Abel E.D. Elmquist J.K. Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3998-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Kaneshige M.

We studied, therefore, a mouse model of resistance to thyroid hormone where a point mutation in the ligand-binding domain of TR-β abolished its ability to bind to T3 (Δ337T, Ref. 15Hashimoto K. Curty F.H. Borges P.P. Lee C.E. Abel E.D. Elmquist J.K. Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3998-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize an interaction between liver X receptor (LXR) and TR, which bind to a similar DNA-response element, and show a unique role for the unliganded mutant TR-β in cholesterol metabolism. Animals—TR-β knock-in mice have a mutation that deletes three nucleotides in exon 6 of the TR-β gene, resulting in loss of a threonine residue in the receptor, which prevents ligand binding (17Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Four-week-old male mice were employed for the study. The number of mice for each study is indicated in the figure legends. All aspects of animal care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine (Maebashi, Gunma, Japan) and The University of Chicago (Chicago, IL). Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule (light on at 06:00 h) and fed laboratory chow as indicated and water ad libitum. A 2% cholesterol diet (21Noel-Suberville C. Pallet V.

Metabolism. 1998; 47: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was purchased from Oriental Bioservice (Tokyo, Japan). Mice were rendered hypothyroid by inclusion of 0.1% methimazole (MMI) in the drinking water and 1% (w/w) propylthiouracil (PTU) in chow for 21 days (22Theodossiou C. Skrepnik N. Robert E.G. Prasad C. Schapira D.V. Hunt J.D. Cancer. 1999; 86: 1596-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Wolf B. Aratan-Spire S. Czernichow P. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Then, the mice were injected daily with 5 μg/100 g body weight T3 for an additional 5-day period to render mice euthyroid. A high cholesterol diet was begun during induction of hypothyroidism with MMI and PTU and continued through the T3 dosing period. The total duration that animals were fed either chow or a 2% cholesterol diet was 2 weeks. Serum-free thyroxine and free T3 levels were determined by double antibody radioimmunoassay kits (Ortho Diagnostics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Mice were sacrificed in the morning to obtain either blood or tissue samples. Lipid Determination—Serum total cholesterol levels were measured with a Determiner TC555 kit (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan). Serum triglyceride levels were determined with an SRL kit (SRL, Tokyo, Japan). Whole livers were removed, weighed, and sections were taken (100 mg) for analysis. The liver samples were homogenized in a Polytron in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and lipid was extracted as previously described (24Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and analyzed for cholesterol content with a Determiner TC555 kit (Kyowa Medex). Measurement of Bile Acid Pool Size—Mice were fed a 2% cholesterol diet for 2 weeks. Pool size was determined as the total bile acid content of small intestine, gallbladder, and the liver, combined as described (25Turley S.D. Schwarz M. Spady D.K. Dietschy J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These organs were homogenized in 20 ml of ethanol (at 60 °C), the extract was filtered and a 1-ml aliquot dried with a centrifuge concentrator at room temperature. The residue was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol and subjected to an enzymatic assay for total bile acid content (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and 5–20 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis as indicated in the figure legends. A rat cDNA probe for rat 5′ deiodinase was a gift from Dr. C. N. Mariash. Rat cDNA templates for CYP7A1 (12Ness G.C. Pendleton L.C. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), HMG-CoA reductase (11Ness G.C. Lopez D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and LDL receptor (11Ness G.C. Lopez D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. G. C. Ness. For CYP7A1, HMG-CoA reductase, and LDL receptor, Northern blot analysis was performed with the use of [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes. The hybridization bands were quantitatively measured using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems Corp., San Jose, CA) and NIH Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and standardized against cyclophilin controls. RNA samples from at least five individual mice treated in the same way were obtained for each condition and genotype. All Northern blots were repeated at least three times, using individual RNA samples, with similar results. Representative Northern blots are shown. Cell Culture and Cotransfection Assays—Transient transfections in HepG2 cells were performed using a standard calcium phosphate method. The cells were maintained in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Receptor expression plasmids encoding mouse LXR-α, and human TR-β1, MUT TR-β1 (Δ337T), and WT RXR-α in pSG5 vectors were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3Luc) carrying mouse CYP7A1 promoter (–607 to +26 bp). CYP7A1 mutant promoter was generated with PCR mutagenesis as it has the mutant DR+4 site (LXRE). The LXRE in the mouse CYP7A1 promoter (–73 bp, TGGTCACCCAAGTTCA, –58 bp) was mutated (–73 bp, CTCGAGCCCACCATGG, –58 bp). 22(R)-Hydroxy(OH)cholesterol (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and added at a concentration of 10 mm to the cells after transfection in medium containing 10% resin charcoal double-stripped fetal bovine serum. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. arbitrary light units from three experiments, each performed in triplicate. Gel Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (26Cohen R.N. Cohen L.E. Botero D. Yu C. Sagar A. Jurkiewicz M. Radovick S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 4832-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mouse LXR-α, human WT TR-β1, human MUT TR-β1(Δ337T), and human WT RXR-α were synthesized from constructs in the pSG5 expression vector using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Binding reactions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 4 μl of each of the synthesized nuclear receptors. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (DR+4 mouse Cyp7A1, –78 bp 5′-TGCTCTGGTCACCCAAGTTCAAGTTA-3′–53 bp; mutant DR+4 mouse Cyp7A1: –78 bp 5′-TGCTCCTCGAGCCCACCATGGAGTTA-3′ –53 bp; DR+4 consensus: 5′-ACCTCAGGTCACAGGAGGTCAGACAA-3′) were labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min, and the protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed on liver extracts using previously described procedures (27Zhou X.Y. Shibusawa N. Naik K. Porras D. Temple K. Ou H. Kaihara K. Roe M.W. Brady M.J. Wondisford F.E. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A PCR primer set was designed to amplify a 417-bp fragment of the proximal CYP7A1 promoter, which contained the LXRE (forward primer: –391 bp, GGACAGCCAGTATTAAAGCCAGGATG, –366 bp; reverse primer: +25 bp, TGCTTAGCAAAGCAAGACGGTCCAGA, –1 bp). The following antibodies were used in the assay: mouse anti-TR-β1 antibody (sc-738, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), goat anti-LXR-α antibody (sc-1201, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-RXR-α antibody (sc-774, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and as a negative control, normal mouse IgG antibody (sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analyses—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. The significance of differences between mean values was evaluated using the unpaired Student's t test. Sample groups showing heterogeneity of variance were appropriately transformed before analysis. Serum Cholesterol Levels in the TR-β Knock-in Mice—To confirm the dominant negative effects of the mutant TR in the liver, we measured total cholesterol levels in wild-type (WT) and TRβ knock-in mice. Because TR-β mutant (MUT) animals have significantly higher TH levels, we considered that excess TH (Table 1) may overcome some of the dominant negative effects of the mutant TR-β. To eliminate this effect, TR-β WT and MUT mice were rendered hypothyroid with a MMI/PTU diet (22Theodossiou C. Skrepnik N. Robert E.G. Prasad C. Schapira D.V. Hunt J.D. Cancer. 1999; 86: 1596-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), then euthyroid by T3 administration. As shown in Table 1, TR-β heterozygous (WT/MUT) and especially homozygous (MUT/MUT) mutant mice have extremely high baseline thyroxine levels, which were reduced to hypothyroid levels by MMI/PTU treatment. A MMI/PTU diet followed by T3 administration returned free T3 levels in all mice to euthyroid levels (Table 2).TABLE 1Free thyroxine (ng/dl) at baseline (regular chow) and after induction of hypothyroidism (MMI/PTU chow)Mouse genotypeWT/WTMUT/WTMUT/MUTRegular chow2.5 ± 0.1 (20)10.1 ± 1.5 (20)32.2 ± 5.2 (20)MMI/PTU chow0.08 ± 0.072 (6)aStatistical differences between values obtained before treatment (regular chow) and induction of hypothyroidism, p < 0.001.

As shown in Fig. 2A, we found no significant differences in serum cholesterol levels in all genotypes in the hypothyroid state (first set of bars). When we administered a high cholesterol diet (2%) to hypothyroid animals (second set of bars), serum cholesterol levels were appropriately increased in WT animals. Paradoxically, serum cholesterol levels were decreased in MUT/MUT mice after cholesterol administration; WT/MUT mice had an intermediate value. This phenomenon was also observed when the animals were rendered euthyroid during a high cholesterol diet (third set of bars). Although euthyroid T3 administration (fourth set of bars) reduced serum cholesterol levels somewhat, these differences did not achieve statistical significance versus the hypothyroid state. Hepatic Cholesterol Levels in the TR-β Knock-in Mice—Hepatic cholesterol levels were then compared in WT and MUT animals after administration of a high cholesterol diet. Under hypothyroid conditions, hepatic cholesterol levels were significantly lower in WT/MUT and MUT/MUT versus WT mice after a high cholesterol diet (Fig. 2B, first set of bars). Correction of the hypothyroid state reduced hepatic cholesterol levels in WT animals but had no additional significant effect in MUT animals (Fig. 2B, second set of bars). In summary, we found a paradoxical reduction in both serum and hepatic cholesterol levels in mutant mice after administration of a high cholesterol diet. We also performed Oil Red O staining on liver sections from these mice. As shown in Fig. 2C, the liver histology of the WT animals showed increased hepatic Oil Red O staining versus the mutant animals. Measurement of bile acid pools in WT and MUT animals indicates that the decrease in hepatic cholesterol content and staining in MUT animals is associated with a significant increase in their bile acid pool (Fig. 2D). The Expression of Thyroid Hormone-regulated Genes Involved in Cholesterol Metabolism in the TR-β Knock-in Mice—To understand the molecular mechanism by which cholesterol metabolism is altered in MUT mice, the expression of thyroid hormone-regulated genes involved in cholesterol metabolism was surveyed in MUT animals (Fig. 3). The 5′ deiodinase type 1 (5′DI) gene is positively regulated by thyroid hormone in the liver (28Toyoda N. Zavacki A.M. Maia A.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5100-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and is a good indicator of thyroid status in mice. During hypothyroidism, 5′DI mRNA levels were undetectable in all genotypes regardless of whether the animals were fed a high cholesterol diet. However, 5′DI mRNA levels were induced by T3 in WT but induction was reduced in MUT animals. In fact, 5′DI induction was totally absent in homozygous mutant animals. These data indicate that the MUT TR-β has a significant dominant negative effect in the liver. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism to bile acids, is a central regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (29Ness G.C. Pendelton L.C. Zhao Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Crestani M. Karam W.G. Chiang J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is known that thyroid hormone increases CYP7A1 mRNA levels and that this effect is critically important for the hypocholesterolemic action of thyroid hormone (29Ness G.C. Pendelton L.C. Zhao Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Crestani M. Karam W.G. Chiang J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, mRNA levels for CYP7A1 were immeasurable in all genotypes during hypothyroidism. After T3 replacement, CYP7A1 mRNA levels were increased in WT mice; however, this was not the case in mutant mice, where the maximal induction of mRNA levels was 30% in MUT/MUT animals as compared with WT mice. In contrast, administration of a cholesterol diet had a minimal effect on CYP7A1 mRNA levels in WT animals, whereas a large induction of CYP7A1 levels was observed in MUT animals. For example, in MUT/MUT mice, CYP7A1 mRNA expression was dramatically induced by cholesterol administration (280% compared with 15% in WT mice). HMGC-R is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (31Ness G.C. Chambers C.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 224: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and its expression is increased by thyroid hormone. We noted that HMGC-R mRNA levels were increased in WT animals after T3 replacement (defined as 100%, after T3 administration in WT animals, see Fig. 3). In contrast, HMGC-R mRNA levels were reduced by cholesterol treatment in T3-treated WT animals as expected. Interestingly, HMGC-R mRNA levels were increased in the hypothyroid state in MUT animals compared with WT animals, suggesting that the unliganded mutant TR may activate expression of certain genes in the liver. HMGC-R mRNA levels did increase after T3 treatment in WT/MUT mice, but less so on a -fold basis (∼2-fold in WT/MUT versus 10-fold in WT mice) because of the increase in expression in the hypothyroid state. The effect of T3 treatment was further reduced in MUT/MUT animals (<1.5-fold increase versus the hypothyroid state). Like WT animals, cholesterol administration also decreased HMGC-R mRNA levels in MUT animals. Expression of LDLR is positively regulated by thyroid hormone (10Bakker O. Hudig F. Meijssen S. Wiersinga W.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Ness G.C. Lopez D. Arch. Biochem.

Commun. 1990; 172: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and this receptor promotes the uptake of LDL into the cell. As shown in Fig. 3, WT mice demonstrate a significant increase in LDLR mRNA levels from the hypothyroid to the T3 treated state (15–100%). Similar to HMGC-R mRNA levels, unliganded mutant TR increased expression of LDLR in the hypothyroid state. In addition, T3 treatment in mutant mice resulted in less stimulation from the hypothyroid state, especially in the MUT/MUT animals. Cholesterol administration to T3-treated animals reduced LDLR mRNA expression in all genotypes, similar to the results observed with HMGC-R. Finally, we measured LXR-α mRNA levels in these mice (Fig. 3). This receptor is essential for CYP7A1 expression and regulation by serum cholesterol levels (33Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). LXR-α mRNA levels in all genotypes displayed a similar pattern of gene expression. T3 treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in gene expression in both WT and MUT mice, suggesting a potential role for TRα or a non-TR mediated pathway in this process. Cholesterol treatment had no significant effect on gene expression. Cross-talk of TR-β and LXR-α on the DR+4 Element in the CYP7A1 Gene Promoter—We next determined whether high cholesterol treatment could induce CYP7A1 expression in the presence of WT and MUT TR-β. We employed a co-transfection study using HepG2 cells, a hepatocyte cell line. In rodents, the CYP7A1 gene promoter contains a single DR+4 element in the proximal promoter, which functions as a positive LXRE (34Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B.

We, therefore, investigated a possible interaction between LXR-α and TR-β1 on a mouse CYP7A1 gene as illustrated in the model (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, LXR-α co-transfection stimulated the mouse CYP7A1 reporter activity about 2-fold after treatment with its ligand, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (36Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of WT TR-β1, in contrast, reduced both basal and ligand-stimulated reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Co-transfection of the MUT TR-β, however, had no significant e"
https://openalex.org/W2080559151,"KiSS-1 has been shown to function as a tumor metastasis suppressor gene and reduce the number of metastases in different cancers. The expression of KiSS-1 or KiSS1, like other tumor suppressor, is commonly reduced or completely ablated in a variety of cancers via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the loss of KiSS-1 expression in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines correlates directly with the expression levels of two transcription factors, activator protein-2α (AP-2α) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which synergistically activate the transcriptional regulation of KiSS-1 in breast cancer cells. Although the KiSS-1 promoter contains multiple AP-2α binding elements, AP-2α-mediated regulation occurs indirectly through Sp1 sites, as determined by deletion and mutation analysis. Overexpression of AP-2α into highly metastatic breast cell lines did not alter KiSS-1 promoter-driven luciferase gene activity. However, co-transfection of AP-2α wild-type or the dominant negative form of AP-2 lacking its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, AP-2B, together with Sp1, increased KiSS-1 promoter activity dramatically, suggesting that AP-2α regulation of KiSS-1 transcription does not require direct binding to the KiSS-1 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AP-2α directly interacted with Sp1 to form transcription complexes at two tandem Sp1-binding sites of the promoter to activate KiSS-1 transcription. Together, our results indicate that AP-2α and Sp1 are strong transcriptional regulators of KiSS-1 and that loss or decreased expression of AP-2α in breast cancer may account for the loss of tumor metastasis suppressor KiSS-1 expression and thus increased cancer metastasis. KiSS-1 has been shown to function as a tumor metastasis suppressor gene and reduce the number of metastases in different cancers. The expression of KiSS-1 or KiSS1, like other tumor suppressor, is commonly reduced or completely ablated in a variety of cancers via an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the loss of KiSS-1 expression in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines correlates directly with the expression levels of two transcription factors, activator protein-2α (AP-2α) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which synergistically activate the transcriptional regulation of KiSS-1 in breast cancer cells. Although the KiSS-1 promoter contains multiple AP-2α binding elements, AP-2α-mediated regulation occurs indirectly through Sp1 sites, as determined by deletion and mutation analysis. Overexpression of AP-2α into highly metastatic breast cell lines did not alter KiSS-1 promoter-driven luciferase gene activity. However, co-transfection of AP-2α wild-type or the dominant negative form of AP-2 lacking its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, AP-2B, together with Sp1, increased KiSS-1 promoter activity dramatically, suggesting that AP-2α regulation of KiSS-1 transcription does not require direct binding to the KiSS-1 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AP-2α directly interacted with Sp1 to form transcription complexes at two tandem Sp1-binding sites of the promoter to activate KiSS-1 transcription. Together, our results indicate that AP-2α and Sp1 are strong transcriptional regulators of KiSS-1 and that loss or decreased expression of AP-2α in breast cancer may account for the loss of tumor metastasis suppressor KiSS-1 expression and thus increased cancer metastasis. The vast majority of breast cancer deaths results from complications caused by tumor cell metastasis rather than as a consequence of the original tumor growth. Once tumorigenic cells enter into the vascular and lymphatic systems, they travel to peripheral regions where they invade tissues and form neoplasms. Metastasis is a process requiring detachment of cancer cells from the primary site, survival of sheer forces encountered in the circulation, migration to other organs, attachment to and invasion of tissues, proliferation of these cells at the secondary site, and finally the capacity to enlist neighboring capillaries to supply the tumor with nutrients as it develops (1Pantel K. Brakenhoff R.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Interference at any one of these steps can block this metastatic cascade thereby preventing the formation of metastatic tumor growths. Consequently, there is a growing interest in researching the metastatic process to identify possible ways to inhibit its progression. Metastasis suppressor genes, which inhibit the spread of cancers to secondary sites, have become the target of mounting clinical and basic cancer research. One such gene, KiSS-1 or KiSS1, was originally identified as a metastasis suppressor by microcell-mediated transfer in melanoma lines, by which it was found to reduce tumor cell invasive and migratory properties without affecting their tumorigenicity (2Lee J.H. Welch D.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Since then, KiSS-1 has been shown to act as a potent anti-metastatic agent either by treatment using synthesized KiSS-1 peptide or upon ectopic expression in highly metastatic cells (2Lee J.H.

Together, these studies suggest that KiSS-1 is a human metastasis suppressor gene and that loss of KiSS-1 and its receptor may correlate with human tumor progression and metastasis.

However, while much has been learned about the possible physiological effects of KiSS-1 expression in cancer cells, the mechanism controlling KiSS-1 transcriptional regulation is still unknown as is the underlying reason for its loss during metastatic progression. As breast cancer cells become increasingly metastatic, expression levels of different genes contributing to cell cycle, tumor cell invasion, and migratory properties, are altered. Genes commonly found up-regulated in breast cancer, including cyclin D1, c-myc, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, mediate behavioral and proliferative changes that stimulate oncogenesis, whereas the loss of c-Kit or p53 may also encourage an increased metastatic phenotype, because they are no longer present to block formation of neoplasms (14Gillett C.

Here, we report that the expression of KiSS-1 metastasis suppressor gene in breast cancer cells is directly correlated with the expression of transcription factors AP-2α and Sp1, and that AP-2α and Sp1 synergistically activate the transcriptional regulation of KiSS-1 in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KiSS-1 expression is modulated by AP-2α through direct interaction with the transcription factor Sp1 at two tandem Sp1-binding sites rather than via interaction with the consensus AP-2-binding sites of KiSS-1 promoter. These results offer a mechanism for the loss of KiSS-1 gene expression commonly seen in metastatic breast cancers and provide another molecular mechanism by which AP-2α and Sp1 transcription complex modulates tumorigenesis and tumor progression.

Transfection of Breast Cells and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were cultured in 6- or 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 18–20 h when cells were ∼60% confluent, reporter gene constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). In brief, 1 μg of total DNA was transfected into each well of a 24-well plate using a Lipofectamine to DNA ratio of 2:1 for a period of 6 h. Empty vector was used to offset the difference in DNA concentrations in reactions in which fewer test plasmids were transfected. Transfection reagent was then removed from each well, and cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and luciferase activity of protein lysates was measured following the manufacturer's protocol (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). To normalize for differences in cell line transfection efficiencies, all cells were transfected with pRSV-β-gal control vector (Promega). β-Galactosidase levels were then measured following the manufacturer's protocol (Galacto-Light Plus, Bedford, MA). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells were harvested as described previously (38Abdelrahim M. Smith 3rd, R. Burghardt R. Safe S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6740-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Concentration of nuclear extracts was determined using BCA assay (Pierce). Aliquots of nuclear protein were frozen and stored at –80 °C until used. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Breast cell lines (2.0 × 107) were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes with 10 ml of complete medium and incubated overnight. The cells were then scraped off and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was then lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin). Soluble proteins were then separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined. Samples were then diluted into loading buffer at 1 mg/ml. Following heat denaturation, samples containing 10 μg of protein were loaded onto and separated on 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels as needed. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Corp., Pensacola, FL). After incubating the membranes in blocking solution, primary antibody was added at 1:1,000 dilution, followed by secondary antibody incubation at 1:10,000. Proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—KiSS-1 promoter-derived oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed, and 5 pmol was 5′-end-labeled using T4 Kinase and [γ32-P]ATP. A 30-μl EMSA reaction containing ∼100 mm potassium chloride, 3 μg of crude nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) with or without unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide, and 10 fmol of labeled probe was incubated on ice for 20 min. A Sp1-specific antibody was then incubated in appropriate reactions for 20 min on ice. A separate AP-2 antibody was used for gel-shift analysis (Active Motif, Montreal, Canada). DNA·protein complexes were then resolved on 5% PAGE gel at ∼120 V at room temperature for 2 h. Antibody·protein complexes were observed as supershifted or immunodepleted complexes. ChIP Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed following the protocol outlined by the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, MCF-7 cells transfected with both AP-2α and Sp1 (2 × 107 cells) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, scraped into conical tubes, pelleted, and lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. DNA was sheared to fragments of 200–500 bp by eight 10-s sonications. The chromatin was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The agarose beads were pelleted, and the precleared supernatant was incubated with antibodies to IgG, AP-2α, and Sp1 overnight at 4 °C. The region between –288 and –188 of the KiSS-1 promoter was amplified from the immunoprecipitated chromatin using the following primers: sense, 5′-ATAGCCCATTTCCACGTTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGCGGGACTTTCTCCTTC-3′. Following PCR, the 100-bp product was resolved on a 2.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Samples were visualized under UV light. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Binding of AP-2α and Sp1 in transfected MCF-7 cells was examined by immunoprecipitation (IP) and by Western blot analysis. Briefly, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin, followed by sonication with a 550 Sonic dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Anti-AP-2α and anti-Sp1 immunocomplexes were recovered by using protein A beads (Sigma). All immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After incubation in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/500 mm NaCl/0.02% Tween 20) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 5% dry milk powder for 2 h, the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies and visualized with the SuperSignal West Pico detection system (Pierce). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from breast cancer cell lines with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sequences used for detection of KiSS-1 transcripts were 5′-GCCCACCATGAACTCACTG-3′ and 5′-CTGC-CCCGCACCTGCG-3′. Amplified products were ∼400 bases in length. Additionally, primers for β-actin were 5′-GGCTCCGGCATGTGCAAGGC-3′ and 5′-AGATTTTCTCCATGTCGTCC-3′, which resulted in PCR products of ∼200 bases. Optimal PCR cycles required for linear amplification for each set was determined. β-Actin required 21–23 cycles per reaction, whereas KiSS-1 required 24–28 cycles. PCR products were separated using agarose gels of appropriate concentration, visualized by EtBr staining and quantitated using Alpha Imager software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Endogenous KiSS-1 Expression in Breast Cancer Cell Lines Correlates with AP-2α Expression Levels—We and other laboratories have reported that KiSS-1 expression is lost in highly metastatic breast cancer cells. To determine if loss of the transcription factor AP-2α and Sp1 was directly or inversely associated with loss of KiSS-1, the expression levels of AP-2α and Sp1 levels in both highly metastatic and non-metastatic breast cells were compared with the expression of KiSS-1 (Fig. 1A). Due to the lack of a specific and effective KiSS-1 antibody, KiSS-1 expression level in the breast cell lines was quantitated using RT-PCR and normalized to the β-actin level within each sample. The relatively non-metastatic breast cell line, MCF-7, showed dramatically higher -fold expression as compared with the more metastatic breast tumor cell lines (T47D, MDA-231, and MDA-435). Similarly, Western blot analysis demonstrated that AP-2α expression was lost or barely detectable in the metastatic cell lines, MDA-231 and MDA-435 (Fig. 1A). The expression levels of Sp1 were also examined in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1A"

Mutations in KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-encoding genes cause benign familiar neonatal convulsions (BFNCs), a rare autosomal-dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn. In the present study, we have investigated, by means of electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunocytochemical techniques in transiently transfected cells, the consequences prompted by a BFNC-causing 1-bp deletion (2043deltaT) in the KCNQ2 gene; this frameshift mutation caused the substitution of the last 163 amino acids of the KCNQ2 C terminus and the extension of the subunit by additional 56 residues. The 2043deltaT mutation abolished voltage-gated K+ currents produced upon homomeric expression of KCNQ2 subunits, dramatically reduced the steady-state cellular levels of KCNQ2 subunits, and prevented their delivery to the plasma membrane. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that mutant KCNQ2 subunits underwent faster degradation; 10-h treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (20 microm) at least partially reversed such enhanced degradation. Co-expression with KCNQ3 subunits reduced the degradation rate of mutant KCNQ2 subunits and led to their expression on the plasma membrane. Finally, co-expression of KCNQ2 2043deltaT together with KCNQ3 subunits generated functional voltage-gated K+ currents having pharmacological and biophysical properties of heteromeric channels. Collectively, the present results suggest that mutation-induced reduced stability of KCNQ2 subunits may cause epilepsy in neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2014198168,"Cobra cardiotoxins, a family of basic polypeptides having lipid- and heparin-binding capacities similar to the cell-penetrating peptides, induce severe tissue necrosis and systolic heart arrest in snakebite victims. Whereas cardiotoxins are specifically retained on the cell surface via heparan sulfate-mediated processes, their lipid binding ability appears to be responsible, at least in part, for cardiotoxin-induced membrane leakage and cell death. Although the exact role of lipids involved in toxin-mediated cytotoxicity remains largely unknown, monoclonal anti-sulfatide antibody O4 has recently been shown to inhibit the action of CTX A3, the major cardiotoxin from Taiwan cobra venom, on cardiomyocytes by preventing cardiotoxin-induced membrane leakage and CTX A3 internalization into mitochondria. Here, we show that anti-sulfatide acts by blocking the binding of CTX A3 to the sulfatides in the plasma membrane to prevent sulfatide-dependent CTX A3 membrane pore formation and internalization. We also describe the crystal structure of a CTX A3-sulfatide complex in a membrane-like environment at 2.3 Å resolution. The unexpected orientation of the sulfatide fatty chains in the structure allows prediction of the mode of toxin insertion into the plasma membrane. CTX A3 recognizes both the headgroup and the ceramide interfacial region of sulfatide to induce a lipid conformational change that may play a key role in CTX A3 oligomerization and cellular internalization. This proposed lipid-mediated toxin translocation mechanism may also shed light on the cellular uptake mechanism of the amphiphilic cell-penetrating peptides known to involve multiple internalization pathways.

CTXs are also recognized as cytotoxins, with the ability to induce a general lytic effect on human erythrocytes (21Chien K.Y. Huang W.N. Jean J.H. Wu W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3252-3259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), necrotic cell death in fetal rat cardiomyocytes (25Wang C.H. Monette R. Lee S.C. Morley P. Wu W.G.

Physiol. 2005; 32: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The major CTX from Taiwan cobra, CTX A3, targets the mitochondrial membrane after internalization and acts synergistically with a CTX-induced cytosolic calcium increase to disrupt the mitochondrial network (27Wang C.H. Wu W.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3169-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, by applying the monoclonal antibody O4, which is specific for the 3′-sulfated galactose moiety of sulfatides (28Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), CTX internalization and CTX-induced cytotoxicity of cardiomyocytes can be inhibited efficiently (25Wang C.H. Monette R. Lee S.C. Morley P. Wu W.G. Toxicon. 2005; 46: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results suggest that sulfatides in the plasma membrane may be a specific target of CTX action.Although the trivial name “sulfatides” is used as a generic term for a class of amphiphiles containing sulfate esters and carbohydrates (28Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the sulfatide used in this study is 3′-sulfated β1-d-galactosylceramide (SGC) and, as sphingolipids, is composed of an 18-carbon sphingosine base that is N-amide-linked to a fatty acid ranging in length from C14 to C24. In light of current interest in the role of glycosphingolipids in toxin internalization and lipid domain formation, it is important to examine whether direct interaction between CTX and SGC indeed triggers CTX-related toxicity. In addition, if antibody application can be useful for cobra snakebite victims, it is desirable to learn how an SGC-specific antibody exerts its inhibitory effect on CTX action. Here, we used a combined biochemical and confocal microscopic approach to show that anti-SGC blocks the binding of CTX A3 to SGC in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes. Electrophysiological and confocal microscopic investigations on H9C2 cardiomyoblast cells showed that CTX A3 molecules interact specifically with SGC at both the headgroup and the ceramide interfacial region to cause CTX A3-mediated membrane pore formation and internalization. This was further confirmed by the structure of a CTX A3·SGC complex determined in the presence of C10E6 (hexaethylene glycol monodecyl ether) detergent, which mimics the membrane environment. In sharp contrast to the effect of other glycosphingolipid binding proteins in forming water-soluble protein·lipid complexes, the CTX A3·SGC structure provides a prototype for understanding how membrane-soluble protein·lipid complexes can be formed. The results also illustrate an important role of glycosphingolipid conformation at the ceramide interfacial region (29Nyholm P.G. Pascher I. Sundell S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 52: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in triggering protein oligomerization and membrane insertion, and a lipid-mediated CTX translocation mechanism is therefore proposed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCTX A3 and Antibody Preparation—CTX A3 was purified from crude venom of Naja atra (purchased from Snake Education Farms, Taiwan) by a chromatographic method previously described (30Chien K.Y. Chiang C.M. Hseu Y.C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against CTX were purified from the antivenin of Bungarus multicinctus and N. atra (Center for Disease Control, Taiwan) by immunoprecipitation (27Wang C.H. Wu W.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3169-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The specificity of isolated CTX antibodies was verified by immunoblotting. Monoclonal anti-SGC IgM O4 (Chemicon) and anti-SGC IgG Sulf1 (provided by Dr. Pam Fredman, Sahlgrenska Academy at Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden) were used throughout the experiments.Cell Cultures—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from day 18 fetal Wistar rats. Hearts were immersed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) immediately after their removal. After thorough washing, the minced ventricles were placed in sterile HBSS containing 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min. To obtain purified cardiomyocytes, the dissociated cells were plated for 1 h, and the unattached cardiomyocytes were collected, counted, and seeded in culture medium (72% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 18% Medium 199, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin) on poly-l-lysine-coated plates or glass coverslips.H9C2 cardiomyoblast cells (ATCC number CRL-1446) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin. For image recording, H9C2 cells were cultured on coverslips at 104 cells cm-2. For internal CTX quantification, H9C2 cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 106 cells/plate.TLC Overlay—Lipid standards (Avanti Polar Lipids) or lipid extracts of plasma membrane fraction were loaded on silica 60 HPTLC plates (Merck). For separating phospholipids, SGC, and cholesterol, the solvent system was chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (26:5:3, v/v/v). For ganglioside mixtures and GM1 separation, the solvent system was chloroform, methanol, 0.02% CaCl2 in H2O (60:35:8, v/v/v). To visualize lipids, the plates were first developed by iodine vapor. Then they were discolored in vacuo, dipped in 0.4% polyisobutylmethacrylate, and dried for further overlaying with 5 μm CTX A3. CTX A3 bound to TLC plates was detected by immunostaining with anti-CTX (31Saito M. Kasai N. Yu R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Plasma Membrane Isolation—Cardiomyocytes or H9C2 Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped off of the plate and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized in 0.1 ml of STM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 220 × g for 5 min using an Eppendorf 5804R (Hamburg, Germany) centrifuge. The supernatant fraction was saved, and the pellet was rehomogenized in 0.1 ml of STM buffer with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was again centrifuged at 220 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The first and second supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h using a 70P-72 ultracentrifuge with an RPS 56T rotor (Hitachi, Japan). The resulting pellet was collected for use.Isolation of Detergent-resistant Membrane (DRM) Fraction—Cardiomyocyte plasma membrane was treated with 1% (v/v) ice-cold Triton X-100 and shaken gently at 4 °C for 30 min. DRM fraction of plasma membrane was floated to the top of a sucrose density step gradient of 0.1 ml of 40% (w/v, 1.37 m) sucrose, 0.6 ml of 30% (w/v, 1 m) sucrose, and 0.4 ml of 5% (w/v, 0.15 m) sucrose in MBS buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with centrifugation at 240,000 × g at 4 °C for 18 h (32Chamberlain L.H. Gould G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49750-49754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Amounts of individual lipids and proteins in each sucrose gradient fraction were assayed by TLC (33Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immunoblotting, respectively, and then quantitated by densitometry.Extraction of Plasma Membrane Lipids—The plasma membrane preparation was incubated and shaken with methanol/chloroform/phosphate-buffered saline (1:1:2, v/v/v) for 1 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min using an Eppendorf 5804R centrifuge. The resultant organic layer was collected and dried for use.Confocal Microscopy—Unless otherwise specified, fluorescent dyes were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-CTX A3 was prepared as described previously (25Wang C.H. Monette R. Lee S.C. Morley P. Wu W.G. Toxicon. 2005; 46: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Wang C.H. Wu W.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3169-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and dipyrromethene boron difluoride (BODIPY)-SGC was provided by Dr. Richard E. Pagano (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN). To monitor the internalization of CTX A3, 5 μm FITC-CTX A3 was applied to cardiomyocytes or H9C2 cells in the HBSS. Images were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a full-width half-maximum of 0.7 μm to set pinhole size. The amount of FITC-CTX A3 internalized was quantified by integrating the cytosolic FITC-CTX A3 intensity signal. CTX-induced intracellular calcium increase in the presence or absence of anti-SGC was monitored using a full-width half-maximum of 5 μm to set the pinhole size at the desired wavelengths of I515 and I590 for calcium indicator dyes Fluo-3AM and FuraRed-AM, respectively (25Wang C.H.

For BODIPY-SGC incorporation, H9C2 cells were incubated with 0.5 μg ml-1 BODIPY-SGC with 1% bovine serum albumin at 10 °C for 15 min and then washed twice with HBSS plus 1% bovine serum albumin and once with HBSS. After CTX A3 was applied, cells were kept at 37 °C for 5 min and then washed six times with 5% bovine serum albumin in HBSS for back-exchange (34Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Choudhury A. Peterson T.E.

MitoTracker Red was used as a marker for mitochondria in SGC internalization experiments.Mass Spectrometry—Mass analysis was performed with a triple quadrupole instrument (VG micromass model Quattro II). Samples were infused at a flow rate of 20 nl min-1 and detected in negative ion mode for characterization of the SGC standard or the SGC lipid extract from preparative TLC (35Marbois B.N. Faull K.F.

To degrade sulfated glycoconjugates, H9C2 cells were preincubated with the desired concentrations of sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1; Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Antibody staining with anti-SGC Sulf1 and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody was used to check the effectiveness of desulfation. To reduce heparan sulfate, H9C2 cells were preincubated with the desired concentrations of heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7; Sigma) or III (EC 4.2.2.8; Sigma) at 37 °C for 60 h. The efficiency of heparinase I and III treatment was evaluated by immunostaining with monoclonal anti-heparan sulfate (3G10 and 10E4; Seikagaku) (37Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G.

For specific lipid incorporation, H9C2 cells were incubated with 200 μm SGC (Avanti Polar Lipids) or SGE at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed twice with HBSS plus 1% bovine serum albumin and once with HBSS. SGE, the synthetic SGC analog without the ceramide structure, was synthesized and provided by Dr. Dennis Whitfield (Institute of Biological Science, National Research Council Canada). Efficiency of lipid incorporation was assessed by TLC of the plasma membrane fraction, which was isolated by a modified method (39Subasinghe S. Unabia S. Barrow C.J. Mok S.S. Aguilar M.I. Small D.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Cell Viability Assay—Cardiomyocytes or H9C2 cells were cultured in 96-well plates at 106 cells/plate. Cell survival after treatment with 5 μm CTX A3 for 1 h was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage (Sigma) or mitochondrial activity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay (25Wang C.H. Monette R. Lee S.C. Morley P. Wu W.G. Toxicon. 2005; 46: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The LDH leakage from cells was defined as the percentage of LDH activity in the culture medium to total LDH activity in the culture medium and the cell lysates. The cell viability was expressed as the percentage of MTT reduction, assuming the absorbance of control cells as 100%.Electrophysiological Studies—H9C2 cells were cultured on coverslips at 104 cells cm-2. The pipette used for patch membranes contained a solution of 140 mm CsCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The external solution for host cell membranes contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4, and 5 μm ouabain. CTX A3-induced extra conductance of H9C2 cells was recorded at room temperature by an Axopatch 200B amplifier under voltage clamp conditions and digitized by an analog-to-digital interface (Digidata 1322A; Molecular Devices). The patch electrodes had a resistance of 2–4 megaohms for whole-cell recording and 1.5–2.5 megaohms for outside-out patch. K+, Na+, or Ca2+ in the external and internal solutions was replaced with Li+, or NH4+ in an ion selectivity assay (data not shown). We did not test anion selectivity in either whole-cell recording or outside-out patch, because both sulfate and phosphate bind effectively to the anionic binding pocket of CTX A3 (40Sue S.C.

The hanging drops were formed by mixing 1 μl of the complex solution (10 mg ml-1 CTX A3, 13 mg ml-1 SGC (Sigma) in 0.5% (w/v) C10E6, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 1.8 m sodium malonate, 7.5% (v/v) tert-butanol, 7.5% (v/v) pentaerythritol ethoxylate (15:4 EO/OH), 0.08% (w/v) C10E6, 50 mm imidazole, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by cryodata collection on the ADSC Quantum 210 detector at Beamline 17B2 of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan. Diffraction data from a single crystal was processed to 2.3 Å using the HKL2000 package (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Using AMoRe (42Navaza J. Acta. Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), the initial solution containing two CTX A3 molecules in the asymmetric unit had an R-factor of 40.1%. Model building was performed using the program XtalView (43McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Starting coordinates and CNS parameter and topology files for SGC and C10E6 were obtained from the Dundee PRODRG2 Server (45Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta. Crystallogr. 2004; D60: 1355-1363Google Scholar) and verified manually. The final model had an R-factor/Rfree of 21.9%/22.2% for all reflections above 2σ between 26.5 and 2.3 Å resolution. The quality of the model was assessed with the program PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2124379990,"Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), a calcium-binding protein that either inserts into the plasma membrane or binds to genomic DNA in the nucleus, has been shown to contribute to the cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as well as antiviral activity of interferon (IFN). The expression of PLSCR1 protein is also known to be markedly increased in response to IFN and to some differentiation inducing agents such as all-trans retinoic acid, but the precise mechanisms of this response remain to be investigated. In this study, we show that the protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ)-specific inhibitor rottlerin and the dominant negative mutant of PKCδ significantly antagonized IFN-induced PLSCR1 expression. The influence of PKCδ on IFN-mediated induction of PLSCR1 was dependent upon the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727. Furthermore, PKCδ-mediated activation of STAT1 required the activation of JNK, as the inhibition of JNK activity by its specific inhibitor or transfection of its dominant negative mutant suppressed both serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and PLSCR1 expression but not the activation of PKCδ. In conclusion, our results suggest that the induction of PLSCR1 transcription through STAT1 depends upon sequential activation of PKCδ and JNK.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PLSCR1 protein is also phosphorylated by several tyrosine kinases such as c-Abl and c-Src, which participate in multiple growth factor receptor signaling pathways (3Sun J. Zhao J.

Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As an example, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by c-Src occurs in response to epidermal growth factor, resulting in the association of phosphorylated PLSCR1 with Shc and the activated epidermal growth factor receptor complex (6Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PLSCR1 was also reported to be a substrate of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), although this could not be confirmed in our recent experiments with recombinant PKCδ and apoptosis induction by Fas ligation in Jurkat cells (7Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When it fails to be palmitoylated, PLSCR1 can be imported into the nucleus where it binds to genomic DNA, suggesting a potential role for this protein in gene transcription (8Chen M.H. Ben-Efraim I.

These biochemical studies strongly indicate that PLSCR1 exerts wide biological effects. Whereas the role of PLSCR1 in remodeling plasma membrane phospholipids and in cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, which was originally identified (10Basse F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T.

As an example, proliferation and terminal differentiation of myeloid precursor cells in response to selective growth factors are impaired in PLSCR1–/– mice (12Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the suppression of PLSCR1 expression by small interfering RNA and antisense RNA inhibits the all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced leukemic cell differentiation (7Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Nakamaki T.

However, the mechanisms of regulation of PLSCR1 expression remain largely unknown thus far. Recently, we reported that PKCδ mediates ATRA and PMA-induced PLSCR1 expression (7Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PLSCR1 has also been shown to be among the most potently activated of the interferon (IFNs)-stimulated genes, suggesting that it possibly participates in cellular response to this important cytokine (14Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al-Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). As recently reported, gene deletion of PLSCR1 or suppression of PLSCR1 expression by small interfering RNA in wild type cells was found to markedly attenuate the antiviral activity of IFNs, which appeared to be related to diminished expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes with known antiviral activities in cells failing to up-regulate PLSCR1 (16Dong B. Zhou Q. Zhao J. Zhou A. Harty R.N. Bose S. Banerjee A. Slee R. Guenther J. Williams B.R. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Silverman R.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8983-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IFN induces PLSCR1 expression also remains unresolved. Because IFNs was also shown to activate PKCδ (17Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A. Majchrzak B. Rahman A.

Reagents and Cell Lines—IFNα2a was purchased from Roche Applied Science. PMA and all specific inhibitors, including Gö6976, SB203580, U0126, and SP600125, were from Calbiochem, except for rottlerin (from Biomol, Plymouth, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for p38, ERK, c-Jun, JNK, and their phosphoylated forms as well as phospho-PKCδ (Ser-643), phospho-STAT1 (Ser-727 and Tyr-701), and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), except for anti-phospho STAT1 (Ser-727) used in the experiments shown in Fig. 7 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-STAT1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), but anti-STAT1 antibody to detect transfection of mutant STAT1-S727A was purchased from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Ab-5) was from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA). Human monocytic leukemic cell line U937 (from Cell Bank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 (also called 2fTGH) and its STAT1–/– cell line U3A (18McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These plasmids were transfected into H1080 and U3A cells using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of transfected cDNAs was confirmed by Western blotting. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR for PLSCR1 mRNA—Total RNA was isolated by Trizol kit (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). Complementary DNA was synthesized by using the cDNA synthesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and fluorescence real-time RT-PCR was performed as we described previously (7Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q.

The -fold change is shown as means ± S.D. in three independent samples with the same treatment. Luciferase Reporter Assays —pRL-SV40 vector and human PLSCR1 promotor-primed (HPPP)-luciferase plasmid, which was a pGL3-basic-luciferase reporter vector (Promega) cloned with a 4.18-kb DNA fragment consisting of the 5′ flanking region (–1to –4120) and the first 60 bp of the first exon of the human PLSCR1 gene (GenBank™ AF153715) as described previously (14Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al-Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected into HT1080 cells with or without dominant negative JNK1 (DN-JNK1) or dominant negative PKCδ (DN-δ) using the Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, triplicate cultures were treated with IFNα2a in the presence or absence of rottlerin (10 μm) or Gö6976 (5 μm) for 18 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The measured luciferase activity was normalized against pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase activity for each sample, and luciferase activity was expressed as -fold over empty pGL3 vector luciferase activity normalized by pRL-SV40 Renilla activity. PKCδ Activity Assays—U937 cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ antibody, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 20 μm ATP) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of histone H1 as an exogenous substrate, to which 1–2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 15–30 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by autoradiography (22Kambhampati S. Li Y. Verma A. Sassano A. Majchrzak B. Deb D.K. Parmar S. Giafis N.

Western Blot—Cells were harvested and lysed with ice-cold phosphorylation lysis buffer as described above and an equal volume of 2×SDS sample buffer. Cell lysates were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After being blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-human PLSCR1 4D2 antibody (14Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al-Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other indicated antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence phototope-horseradish peroxidase kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling). Blots were stripped and reprobed with mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody to ascertain equal loading of protein. As necessary, the signal intensities of proteins tested were normalized against the indicated internal control using a densitometer (SmartView, version 5.0, software from Furi, Shanghai, China), and the -fold change was expressed compared with untreated cells. Statistical Analysis —Student's t test was used to compare the difference between two different groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. As reported previously (14Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al-Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar), IFNα2a highly induced PLSCR1 mRNA and protein in leukemic U937 cells as determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively (Fig. 1A). Prior to PLSCR1 expression, IFNα2a treatment rapidly and time-dependently resulted in an increase in PKCδ phosphorylation in intact cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, increased phosphorylated PKCδ began to appear at 5 min after IFN treatment and then became more significant. To determine the possible involvement of PKCδ in IFN induction of PLSCR1, leukemic U937 cells were treated with IFN-α2a in the absence and presence of the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin. Pretreatment with rottlerin for 1 h effectively inhibited IFN activation of PKCδ as evidenced by PKCδ phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) and the ability of immunoprecipitated PKCδ to phosphorylate histone H1 (Fig. 1D). It was noteworthy that in addition to PKCδ several other kinases, including p38, ERK, and Cdc2/Cdk1, could not be detected in such immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1E), indicating the specificity for in vitro kinase assays of PKCδ. More intriguingly, pretreatment with rottlerin prevented IFN induction of PLSCR1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1F, left panel). In contrast, Gö6976, an inhibitor of conventional PKCs, was ineffective to IFN-induced PLSCR1 expression (Fig. 1F, right panel). As reported previously, rottlerin directly uncouples mitochondrial respiration from oxidative phosphorylation and thus reduces cellular ATP levels that could block any number of ATP-dependent processes (23Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37986-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, rottlerin has also been shown to inhibit other kinases (24Leitges M. Elis W. Gimborn K. Huber M. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cihen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data gathered from using rottlerin should be evaluated cautiously. Considering this, we also tested the effect of a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ (DNδ), which selectively inhibited action of PKCδ (19Soh J.W. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34709-34716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For the convenience of transfection, the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was used. First, a plasmid containing the PLSCR1 promoter linked to luciferase cDNA (HPPP-luc) or the empty vector was transfected into HT1080 cells. As seen in Fig. 2A, IFN treatment resulted in an increase in the promoter activity, which was significantly suppressed by rottlerin but not by Gö6976 (data not shown). In agreement with the effects of rottlerin, transient transfection of DNδ inhibited IFN induction of PLSCR1 mRNA/protein (Fig. 2B) and the PLSCR1 promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 2C). All of these findings indicate that IFN activation of PKCδ precedes to and contributes to the subsequent induction of PLSCR1. Additionally, rottlerin and DNδ also slightly abrogated the basal level of PLSCR protein and its promoter activity, suggesting that basal activity of PKCδ possibly contributes to the constitutive expression of PLSCR1. Because PKCδ is known to phosphorylate STAT1 on Ser-727 in response to IFN, STAT1, Ser-727 phosphorylation, and PLSCR1 induction were monitored in HT1080 in comparison with its derivative, the STAT1-null U3A cell line (Fig. 3A) (18McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In response to IFN, STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation increased at 30 min of treatment (lower, Fig. 3B), which appeared after activation of PKCδ (Fig. 1B), whereas the induction of PLSCR1 mRNA and protein was not seen until after 3 and 6 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in U937 cells (data not shown). Consistent with our previous report (14Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al-Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, PLSCR1 was not induced by IFN in the STAT1-deficient U3A cells (Fig. 3A). We further determined the role of STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation in IFN-induced PLSCR1 expression. For this purpose, wild type STAT1 and mutant STAT1-S727A were transfected into U3A cells. Western blots showed the effectiveness of transfection of wild type STAT1 and mutant STAT1-S727A, the former but not the latter being phosphorylated on Ser-727 (Fig. 4). The results showed that ectopic expression of STAT1 but not STAT1-S727A increased PLSCR1 expression in U3A cells (Fig. 4). In the next phase of analysis, we extended our investigation to the potential relationship between PKCδ and STAT1 in the induction of PLSCR1. Toward this end, HT1080 cells were treated with IFNα2a in combination with either rottlerin or DNδ transfection (Fig. 5). The results showed that both rottlerin and DNδ transfection effectively inhibited IFNα2a-stimulated phosphorylation on STAT1 at Ser-727, suggesting that PKCδ contributes, directly or indirectly, to IFNα2a-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. Previous studies (26Platanias L.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Kalvakolanu D.V. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) showed that IFN treatment leads to activation of several serine-threonine kinases including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) besides PKCδ, although the mechanism(s) is incompletely understood. Indeed, several members of the MAPK family including ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, as well as the JNK substrate transcription factor c-Jun, were rapidly but transiently phosphorylated upon IFNα2a treatment (Fig. 6). Thus, we sought to determine whether any of these MAPKs contribute to PLSCR1 expression in response to IFNα2a treatment. U937 cells were pretreated for 1 h with MAPK inhibitors U0126 (28DeSilva D.R. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Jaffee B.D. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Scherle P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4175-4181PubMed Google Scholar), SB203580 (29Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and SP600125 (30Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). The results showed that SP600125, which inhibited phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK, blocked IFNα2a stimulation of STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation and PLSCR1 expression (Fig. 7A), but U0126 and SB203580 failed to do so. These two inhibitors diminished phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, respectively, after IFNα2a treatment (Fig. 7, B and C). These results indicate that JNK, but not ERK1/2 or p38, contributes to STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation and PLSCR1 expression induced by IFNα2a. Consistent with this fact, DN-JNK, a dominant negative mutant JNK, also reduced phosphorylation of STAT1 Ser-727 induced by IFNα2a and blocked IFN-α2a-induced expression of both the PLSCR1 promoter construct and endogenous PLSCR1 in HT1080 cells (Fig. 8).FIGURE 8Dominant negative JNK inhibits IFNα2a-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 STAT1 and PLSCR1 transcription. A, HT1080 cells were transfected with the dominant negative mutant of JNK (DN-JNK) or empty vector. Twenty-four hours later, IFNα2a was added for an additional 18 h.

Here we found that inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin reduced IFNα2a-induced activation of JNK in U937 cells, as determined by reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun. However, inhibition of JNK with SP600125 had no effect on the IFN stimulation of PKCδ activation (Fig. 9). In agreement with the effects of these inhibitors, transfection of DNδ could inhibit the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun, whereas DN-JNK failed to affect the activation of PKCδ in HT1080 cells (Fig. 10). These results indicate that PKCδ is upstream of and required for JNK activation and that both kinases are involved in IFN signaling to the PLSCR1 gene.FIGURE 10Inhibition of PKCδ could abrogate JNK activation induced by IFN. HT1080 cells were transfected with a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ (DNδ)(left) or dominant negative mutant of JNK (DN-JNK)(right). Twenty-four hours later, IFNα2a was added for an additional 4 h. Total cell lysates were used in Western blots for phosphorylation of PKCδ, JNK, and c-Jun and total PKCδ, JNK, and c-Jun.

Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this work, we continued to show that the inhibition of PKCδ activation by the chemical inhibitor rottlerin and transfection of the dominant negative mutant of PKCδ significantly inhibited IFNα2a-induced expression of PLSCR1 mRNA and protein, whereas such inhibition was not observed for Gö6976, an inhibitor of the conventional PKC. These data, combined with our previous report demonstrating that transfection of the catalytic fragment of PKCδ directly up-regulates PLSCR1 expression (7Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that PKCδ is a common mediator for PLSCR1 expression induced by IFNα2a, ATRA, or PMA. More recently, PLSCR1 expression has been shown to mediate the antiviral activity of IFNs (16Dong B. Zhou Q. Zhao J. Zhou A. Harty R.N. Bose S. Banerjee A. Slee R. Guenther J. Williams B.R. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Silverman R.H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8983-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our previous studies also showed that induced expression of PLSCR1 contributes to ATRA/PMA-induced leukemic cell differentiation (7Zhao K.W. Li X. Zhao Q. Huang Y. Li D. Peng Z.G. Shen W.Z. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Chen Z. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Chen G.Q. Blood. 2004; 104: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IFNα2a and ATRA act synergistically in the induction of cell differentiation and growth inhibition (22Kambhampati S. Li Y. Verma A. Sassano A. Majchrzak B. Deb D.K. Parmar S. Giafis N. Kalvakolanu D.V. Rahman A. Uddin S. Minucci S. Tallman M.S. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32544-32551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest that IFNα2a and ATRA both up-regulate PLSCR1 expression through PKCδ. It is well known that IFN-α/β binding to the type I IFN receptor initiates a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade involving JAK kinases (JAK1 and TYK2), resulting in the heterodimerization of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and 2. These phosphorylated STAT proteins are transported to the nucleus and, in a complex with IRF9, bind to IFN-stimulated response elements and activate the transcription of many different genes (31Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 32Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). However, an additional phosphorylation event on STAT1 Ser-727 is required for a full IFN-stimulated transcriptional response (34Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Previously, IFN-α2a was reported to activate expression of the human PLSCR1 gene at the transcriptional level through a single IFN-stimulated response element located in the first exon (14Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al-Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, IFN-α2a failed to induce PLSCR1 in STAT1-negative U3A cells. Here we showed that complementation with wild type STAT1, but not STAT1 mutant S727A, almost completely restored IFN-α2a-induced PLSCR1 expression. These findings support an essential role for Ser-727 of STAT1 in IFN-α2a-induced PLSCR1 expression. Prior studies demonstrating that PKCδ can phosphorylate STAT1 on Ser-727 indicated that a role for PKCδ in PLSCR1 expression is likely (35Kaur S. Parmar S. Smith J. Katsoulidis E. Li Y. Sassano A.

It has been proposed that PKCδ is activated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor and that such an activation of PKCδ appears critical for phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 (17Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A. Majchrzak B. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14408-14416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). DeVries et al. (36DeVries T.A. Kalkofen R.L. Matassa A.A. Reyland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45603-45612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also showed that PKCδ activates STAT1 through phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 in etoposide-induced apoptosis. We have shown here that the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin or a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ significantly antagonized IFNα2a-induced STAT1 phosphorylation on Ser-727. Therefore, our findings demonstrate a role for PKCδ in the Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 required for IFN induction of PLSCR1. How PKCδ activation leads to Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 is still unresolved. IFNα treatment results in phosphorylation of many different signaling proteins, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (37Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C.

A recent report demonstrated that genotoxic agents such as arabino-furanosylcytosine-induced JNK activation is attenuated by treatment with rottlerin, expression of a kinase-inactive PKCδ mutant, and down-regulation of PKCδ by small interfering RNA, proposing that PKCδ is required, in part, for induction of JNK (42Yoshida K. Miki Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48372-48378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that a JNK inhibitor, but not inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38, blocked both STAT1 serine727 phosphorylation and PLSCR1 expression following IFN treatment. More importantly, transfection of a dominant negative mutant of JNK also reduced IFN-initiated Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT1 and PLSCR1 expression. Our results indicated that JNK contributes to both STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation and an IFN transcriptional response as monitored by expression of PLSCR1. However, inhibition of JNK did not suppress IFNα2a-induced phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ. Therefore, JNK activation is downstream of PKCδ, whereas both of these kinases are required for maximal STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation. In summary, PKCδ inhibition suppressed IFN-initiated JNK activation, STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation, and expression of PLSCR1. Transcriptional induction of PLSCR1 through STAT1 that is induced by IFNα2a is dependent upon sequential activation of both PKCδ and JNK kinase. We thank Drs. Jae-Won Soh, Young-Mi Ham, and James Darnell for generously providing the plasmids. We are also grateful to Dr. George Stark, who kindly provided us with HT1080 and U3A cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2038531929,"Information processing in the brain requires adequate background neuronal activity. As Parkinson's disease progresses, patients typically become akinetic; the death of dopaminergic neurons leads to a dopamine-depleted state, which disrupts information processing related to movement in a brain area called the basal ganglia. Using agonists of dopamine receptors in the D1 and D2 families on rat brain slices, we show that dopamine receptors in these two families govern the firing pattern of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a crucial part of the basal ganglia. We propose a conceptual frame, based on specific properties of dopamine receptors, to account for the dominance of different background firing patterns in normal and dopamine-depleted states."

Here we propose an alternative domain-swapped trimeric prion (DSTP) model and show with molecular dynamics (MD) that the DSTP has more favorable intermonomer hydrogen bonding and proline dihedral strain energy than the BPT. This new structural proposal may be tested by lysine and N terminus fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) either directly on recombinant prion protein amyloid aggregates or on synthetic constructs that contain the proline/lysine-rich hinge region critical for domains to swap. In addition, the domain swapping may provide 1) intrinsic entanglement, which can contribute to the remarkable temperature stability of the infectious prion structure and help explain the absence of PrP(Sc) monomers, 2) insight into why specific prolines are potentially relevant to three inherited forms of prion disease, and 3) a simple explanation of prion strains assuming the strain is encoded in the monomer number of the oligomers."

The TSLL2 protein of 55 kDa is mainly expressed in the kidney, bladder, and prostate in addition to the brain. Here, we report the biological significance of TSLL2 in the urinary tissues. An immunohistochemical study reveals that TSLL2 is expressed at the cell-cell attachment sites in the renal tubules, the transitional epithelia of the bladder, and the glandular epithelia of the prostate. Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrates that TSLL2 is localized in the lateral membranes in polarized Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. TSLL2 forms homo-dimers and its overexpression induces aggregation of suspended MDCK cells in a Ca2+/Mg2+-independent manner, suggesting that it is involved in cell adhesion through homophilic trans-interaction. The TSLL2 gene is mapped on the chromosomal region 19q13.2, whose loss of heterozygosity has been frequently reported in prostate cancer. TSLL2 protein is lost in nine of nine primary prostate cancers and in a prostate cancer cell, PPC-1. Introduction of TSLL2 into PPC-1 strongly suppresses subcutaneous tumor formation in nude mice. These results suggest that TSLL2 is a new member of the Ig superfamily cell adhesion molecules and is a tumor-suppressor candidate in prostate cancer."

This is particularly critical for metal ions because of their toxic potential. We have identified the yeast homologue of the prokaryotic ArsA protein, the homodimeric ATPase Arr4p, as a protein that binds to the yeast intracellular CLC chloride-transport protein, Gef1p. We show that binding of Arr4p to the C terminus of Gef1p requires the presence of yeast cytosol and is sensitive to a highly specific copper chelator in vitro and in vivo. Copper alone can substitute for cytosol to support the interaction of Arr4p with the C terminus of Gef1p. The migration behavior of Arr4p in nonreducing gel electrophoresis correlates with cellular copper deficiency, repletion, or stress.

Δgef1 mutants show the following phenotypes: loss of high affinity iron uptake, reduced resistance to toxic cations (e.g. high sodium and hygromycin), and sensitivity to alkaline pH of the growth medium (6Gaxiola R.A.

High affinity iron uptake is lost because Fet3p (a multicopper oxidase involved in high affinity iron uptake at the cell surface) does not mature normally in Δgef1 strains (6Gaxiola R.A. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Copper loading to the active center of Fet3p in the lumen of the late secretory pathway requires Cl- ions that are thought to enter the compartment via Gef1p (13Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C.

This is consistent with the notion that copper and iron are the limiting factors for growth of S. cerevisiae in an alkaline environment (14Serrano R. Bernal D. Simon E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19698-19704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, a CLC-type chloride channel gene is required for the activity of the copper-containing enzyme laccase, a major virulence factor (15Zhu X. Williamson P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One of the most closely related mammalian counterparts of Gef1p, ClC-4, has been shown to stimulate the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin in hepatocytes (16Wang T. Weinman S.A. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast to cation channels, almost no accessory proteins involved in CLC protein function and subcellular localization are known. Employing the yeast two-hybrid system, we screened for proteins that interact with the cytosolic C terminus of Gef1p and identified the yeast homologue of the prokaryotic ArsA ATPase, Arr4p, as an interaction partner. Divergent from its function in Escherichia coli, the eukaryotic counterpart of this protein is sensitive to changes in the availability of copper in the cytosol and is required when copper and heat stress are combined. Yeast Strains and Media—Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Δarr4 deletions were obtained by transforming the strains with a linear DNA fragment containing 200 bp of the 5′ and 325 bp of the 3′ portion of the ARR4 open reading frame with the TRP1 marker inserted between them. Gene disruption was verified by PCR. Molecular Biology—Standard molecular biology protocols were adapted from Ref. 17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

For the expression of recombinant Arr4p as a maltose-binding protein fusion, the open reading frame of ARR4 was cloned into pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs).

Yeast Two-hybrid System—For the yeast two-hybrid system, constructs were cloned into vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (BD Biosciences/Clontech). The GEF1 bait construct was transformed into the yeast two-hybrid strain AH109 (BD Biosciences/Clontech), and large scale library transformations of a yeast genomic two-hybrid library (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in this bait strain were performed according to Ref. 23Yamada K. Wang J.C. Osawa H. Scott D.K. Granner D.K.

Positive colonies were streaked to SD medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine and subjected to a β-galactosidase plate assay (overlay of the plates with the following solution containing 0.5% agarose: 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 2% N,N-dimethylformamide, 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside).

Cleared extracts from lysed bacteria were passed over a column containing amylose resin, and the fusion protein was eluted using maltose according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Guinea pigs were injected with the purified fusion protein in phosphate-buffered saline (Peptide Specialty Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Total yeast extracts were prepared from 0.2 A600 units of log phase cells by alkaline lysis under nonreducing conditions and precipitation of total cellular protein by trichloroacetic acid. For co-immunoprecipitation, yeast cells were grown to an A600 of 0.5 in the appropriate dropout media containing 2% glucose as the carbon source. 150 A600 units were harvested and broken in 500 μl of breaking buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2× Complete protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) using glass beads. The resulting extract was diluted 1:1 with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, complemented with Complete protease inhibitor) and incubated with 5 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-HA (HA.11; Covance) or 10 μl of anti-Arr4p antiserum and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight, washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer and several times in phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer without reducing agent at 37 °C. Yeast extracts and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 7% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in TBS (2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% milk powder and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Primary antibodies (anti-HA mouse monoclonal HA.11 (Covance), 1 μg/ml; anti-PC mouse monoclonal HPC4 (Roche Applied Science), 0.25 μg/ml; anti-Arr4p, 1:2,500) and secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson), 1:4,000) were diluted in TBS-blocking solution. Washes were in TBS-blocking solution and then in TBS, 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Detection was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Binding Assays Employing Recombinant Proteins—Constructs used as bait in binding assays were expressed in an ompT protease-deficient strain of E. coli and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose or directly bound to IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; 20 μl of slurry/reaction; beads were prewashed in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2) in immobilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 200 mm NaCl). Beads were washed first in immobilization buffer and then in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm NaCl). Upon the addition of Arr4p (40 μg/ml), the binding reaction proceeded for 3 h at 4°C in binding buffer or cytosol with further additions as indicated in the text and figure legends. After four washes with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 m magnesium chloride and precipitated using isopropyl alcohol. Preparation of Bacterial and Yeast Cytosol—Yeast cultures grown in full medium were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase. The pellets were pressed through a syringe to obtain strings, which were frozen in liquid nitrogen and macerated in a mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The ground material was thawed in an equal volume of binding buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. Bacteria were disrupted by sonification, and the lysate was cleared by the same centrifugation step. Fractionation of yeast cytosol by centrifugation through a polyethersulfone membrane was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (membraPure). Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—Blue native PAGE analysis was performed as described by Schägger and von Jagow (24Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry—Trace mineral analysis was carried out by a commercial provider, Spurenanalytisches Laboratorium (Dr. Heinrich Baumann). Arr4p purified from E. coli was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 (titrated with Tris base). Homology Modeling of Arr4p—The detailed procedure for building the homology model is given as supplemental information. In search for proteins that would bind to the C terminus (CT) of Gef1p, we screened 6 million co-transformants of the bait plasmid and a yeast genomic two-hybrid library constructed in the prey plasmid (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two positive prey plasmids with inserts of different size contained the complete open reading frame of ARR4, the yeast homologue of the prokaryotic ArsA ATPase (Fig. 1A). In prokaryotes, ArsA is the ATPase subunit of a transporter involved in arsenite efflux (25Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 26Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In yeast, Arr4p has been characterized as a soluble cytosolic protein involved in heat and metal tolerance (27Shen J. Hsu C.M. Kang B.K. Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Biometals. 2003; 16: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cytosolic C terminus of most archeal and eukaryotic CLC proteins contains two copies of a conserved cystathione β-synthetase (CBS) domain (28Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 29Ponting C.P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The occurrence of such CBS domains in a number of functionally and structurally unrelated proteins has remained enigmatic. Because the CT of Gef1p contains two copies of the CBS domain, we assessed the specificity of the interaction with Arr4p and tested the ARR4 prey plasmid against a bait plasmid containing SNF4, a kinase subunit that contains four copies of the CBS domain. We detected no interaction between Arr4p and Snf4p, although Snf4p did interact with its partner subunit Snf1p (Fig. 1A). This pair of interaction partners serves as a well characterized positive control, since the two proteins were used to establish the yeast two-hybrid system (30Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 31Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). We conclude that Arr4p is not generally recruited to tandem CBS domains and interacts specifically with the CT of Gef1p. To investigate the interaction of the Arr4p ATPase with the full-length CLC protein independently from the two-hybrid system we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1, B and C). Detergent-solubilized extracts from yeast cells expressing the N-terminally HA-tagged Gef1p channel were immunoprecipitated using an antiserum that we raised against Arr4p. Whereas we were not able to detect the channel in our input control Western blots, the protein was strongly enriched in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B). The amount of Gef1p that we could co-precipitate with the anti-Arr4p serum depended on the amount of Arr4p present in the lysates (none, endogenous levels, overexpression). In the inverse experiment we were able to specifically co-immunoprecipitate a tagged form of Arr4p (Arr4p-4PC) with Gef1p (Fig. 1C). We conclude that Arr4p interacts with Gef1p. Next, we tried to reconstitute the interaction in vitro employing recombinant proteins. Arr4p N-terminally fused to a decahistidine tag was purified from E. coli by nickel chromatography. The CT of Gef1p was fused to two IgG binding Z domains of protein A and immobilized directly from bacterial lysates (Fig. 2A). We were unable to detect binding of recombinant Arr4p to the CT of Gef1p (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Interestingly, binding was observed in the presence of yeast cytosol (lane 4) but not bacterial cytosol (lane 3). Endogenous Arr4p present in the yeast cytosol did not mediate binding since cytosol from an Δarr4 mutant (lane 5) supported the reaction like cytosol from a protease-deficient strain (Δpep4, lane 4) and wild type cytosol (data not shown). We conclude that binding of recombinant Arr4p to the CT of Gef1p requires a factor present in yeast cytosol and set out to identify the factor. Fractionation of the cytosol by a 4-kDa cut-off filter and subsequent binding experiments demonstrated that the factor required for binding was either a peptide or a small molecule (Fig. 2C). CBS domains have been suggested to bind ATP, AMP, or S-adenosylmethionine (32Scott J.W. Hawley S.A. Green K.A. Anis M. Stewart G. Scullion G.A. Norman D.G. Hardie D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) but none of these compounds mediated binding (data not shown). Consistently, apyrase treatment of yeast cytosol to hydrolyze ATP did not impair its ability to support binding (Fig. 2D). We found that the activity persisted after boiling of the cytosol but was sensitive to the presence of EDTA in the binding reaction or to pretreatment with a metal chelating resin (data not shown). These observations suggested that metal ions are required to support the binding reaction. Because of its metal-chelating activity, the decahistidine tag was removed from Arr4p by TEV protease cleavage after purification. Next, we replaced the cytosol by a trace mineral mixture at the concentration normally present in yeast minimal media. This mixture was able to substitute for the yeast cytosol and mediated binding of Arr4p to the CT of Gef1p (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). To assess the identity of the required metal, we added different chelators to the binding reaction performed in cytosol (lanes 5–8) and observed that bathocuproine sulfonate (BCS), a Cu(I)-specific chelator (33Blair D. Diehl H. Talanta. 1961; 7: 163-174Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Mohindru A. Fisher J.M. Rabinovitz M. Nature. 1983; 303: 64-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as well as bathophenantroline sulfonate, a Fe(II) and Cu(II) chelator (35Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), abolished binding of Arr4p to the CT of Gef1p. Sensitivity of the binding reaction to BCS suggested that Cu(I) is required to support binding. Supplying Cu(I) by adding a mixture of CuSO4 and ascorbate allowed binding in the absence of cytosol (lanes 9 and 10). However, CuSO4 alone, and thus Cu(II), was able to support binding less efficiently (data not shown). These results and a second line of experiments raised the possibility that Arr4p is a metal-binding protein. In addition to the metal requirement for binding to the CT of Gef1p, we observed abnormal migration behavior of Arr4p when subjected to SDS-PAGE without SH-reducing reagents in the sample buffer (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the protein migrates as a doublet that is converted to one band in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Dithiothreitol, glutathione at physiological concentrations, or tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, a reducing agent that does not contain SH groups itself, has the same effect (data not shown). Whereas a change in running behavior upon the addition of SH-reducing agents might be indicative of intramolecular disulfide bond formation, disulfide-bonded proteins usually show slower mobility than their reduced counterparts. In the case of the co-chaperone dnaJ, 5M. P. Mayer, personal communication. migration as a doublet of faster mobility than the fully reduced protein is due to metal coordination by dnaJ (36Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although EDTA did not affect the running behavior of Arr4p (data not shown), we investigated the presence of a metal in recombinant Arr4p purified from E. coli by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The measurement revealed ∼1 mol of zinc/mol of protein. We exploited the correlation between the migration behavior of Arr4p in the absence of SH-reducing agents to ask whether the chelators tested in Fig. 3A converted the protein to the presumably metal-free form also observed in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3, B and C). BCS but not bathophenantroline sulfonate affected the migration behavior of the protein (Fig. 3C) when the protein was incubated with cytosol in the presence of the respective chelator. Thus, the Cu(I)-specific chelator BCS was specifically able to convert Arr4p to the presumably metal-free form. This result might suggest that copper can replace the zinc bound to the recombinant protein (Fig. 7). We were, however, unable to convert Arr4p into a copper-containing protein in vitro (data not shown). In conclusion, yeast cytosol can support the binding of Arr4p purified from E. coli to the CT of Gef1p, because it contains copper ions accessible to the proteins. Does the copper-dependent binding of Arr4p to the CT of Gef1p depend on copper availability in the yeast cytosol in vivo? To address this question, we repeated the two-hybrid assay in the presence of BCS (Fig. 4A), an approach that was previously used to demonstrate copper-dependent binding of the cytosolic copper chaperone Atx1p to the N terminus of the copper ATPase Ccc2p (37Pufahl R.A.

Using an in vivo screening method following the simultaneous randomization of the codons at positions 127 and 128 (two C-helix residues of the protein interacting with cAMP), we have isolated a series of novel constitutively active CRP variants. Sequence analysis showed that this group of variants commonly possesses leucine or methionine at position 127 with a β-branched amino acid at position 128. One specific variant, T127L/S128I CRP, showed extremely high cAMP-independent DNA binding affinity comparable with that of cAMP-bound wild-type CRP. Further biochemical analysis of this variant and others revealed that Leu127 and Ile128 have different roles in stabilizing the active conformation of CRP in the absence of cAMP. Leu127 contributes to an improved leucine zipper at the dimer interface, leading to an altered intersubunit interaction in the C-helix region. In contrast, Ile128 stabilizes the proper position of the β4/β5 loop by functionally communicating with Leu61. By analogy, the results suggest two direct local effects of cAMP binding in the course of activating wild-type CRP: (i) C-helix repositioning through direct interaction with Thr127 and Ser128 and (ii) the concomitant reorientation of the β4/β5 loop. Finally, we also report that elevated expression of T127L/S128I CRP markedly perturbed E. coli growth even in the absence of cAMP, which suggests why comparably active variants have not been described previously.

CRP was originally identified as a protein factor responsible for catabolite repression in E. coli (6Zubay G. Schwartz D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Emmer M. deCrombrugghe B. Pastan I. Perlman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and since then has been a paradigm for bacterial transcription activators. CRP is a homodimer, each subunit of which is composed of two distinct domains connected by a hinge region: an N-terminal effector-binding domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (see Fig. 1A) (8Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In the presence of its effector cAMP, CRP becomes competent to bind its target DNA and to recruit RNA polymerase to activate transcription (2Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 4Lawson C.L. Swigon D. Murakami K.S. Darst S.A. Berman H.M. Ebright R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).A number of methods have been used to demonstrate that this DNA binding ability is cAMP-dependent and accompanied by a conformational change. (i) Although CRP is protease-resistant, it becomes protease-sensitive in the presence of micromolar cAMP. Most common cleavage sites are located in the D-helix, and the protease data suggest that the N- and C-terminal domains of CRP communicate through the hinge (see Fig. 1A) (5Harman J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). (ii) Both NMR data (9Won H.S. Yamazaki T. Lee T.W. Yoon M.K. Park S.H. Kyogoku Y. Lee B.-J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13953-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and protein footprinting experiments (10Baichoo N Heyduk T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest a change of secondary structure around residues 127-139 (hinge region) and an increase in the solvent exposure of the DNA-binding F-helix upon cAMP binding. (iii) Constitutively active CRP variants have often been found to be altered in the proximity of the hinge region, particularly at Gly141 and Ala144 (11Kim J. Adhya S. Garges S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9700-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Garges S. Adhya S. Cell. 1985; 41: 745-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Harman J.G. McKenney K. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although evidence suggesting the importance of the hinge region in CRP activation is substantial, it is unlikely that cAMP directly affects this region because the bound cAMP and hinge are separated by >10 Å (8Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). We therefore still do not know the locally critical event(s) that trigger global conformational changes in CRP upon cAMP binding.In this regard, the repositioning of the long C-helices at the dimer interface upon cAMP binding is attractive as such a trigger because such a repositioning would necessarily change the environment of the hinge region. There are three lines of evidence in support of this model. First, the C-helices assume a coiled-coil interaction, which usually utilizes hydrophobic residues at the crucial a- and d-positions in the heptad repeat. As Passner et al. (14Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) pointed out, because each cAMP molecule interacts extensively with both C-helices, the C-helices would have a different orientation with respect to each other in the presence and absence of cAMP. Interestingly, Thr127, a non-optimal leucine zipper residue, occupies an important d-position in the coiled-coil structure and interacts with cAMP, as does the adjacent Ser128. More specifically, Thr127 forms a hydrogen bond with N-6 of the bound cAMP, and Ser128 forms a hydrogen bond with the cAMP bound to the other subunit (8Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). For this reason, CRP residues Thr127 and Ser128 have been the focus of considerable study, and their alteration has been reported to perturb a variety of properties such as substrate discrimination (15Lee E.J. Glasgow J. Leu S.F. Belduz A.O. Harman J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), cooperativity (16Shi Y. Wang S. Krueger S. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6946-6956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), protein structure (17Chu S.Y. Tordova M. Gilliland G.L. Gorshkova I. Shi Y. Wang S. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11230-11236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and CRP activity (15Lee E.J. Glasgow J. Leu S.F. Belduz A.O. Harman J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Dai J. Lin S.H. Kemmis C. Chin A.J. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8901-8910Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The T127L/S128A CRP variant has significant activity even in the absence of cAMP (19Moore J.L. Gorshkoya I.I. Brown J.W. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21273-21278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the cAMP-bound structure of the protein shows a modest C-helix bend at the altered positions relative to the wild-type (WT) cAMP-bound CRP structure (17Chu S.Y. Tordova M. Gilliland G.L. Gorshkova I. Shi Y. Wang S. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11230-11236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given these results, it is quite possible that the initial effect of cAMP binding is the repositioning of the C-helices through these residues.Second, studies of CooA, a member of the CRP family of transcription activators, provide additional insight concerning the local change in CRP structure induced by cAMP binding. The structure of inactive CooA has been determined, and the structural comparison of cAMP-bound CRP with effector-free CooA (20Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) reveals a modest repositioning of these two C-helices with respect to each other (see Fig. 1B). Although not an ideal comparison, this is consistent with the C-helix repositioning hypothesis as the trigger for the activation of each protein. The importance of the C-helix region as a signal pathway in CooA was further tested genetically. The CooA region homologous to CRP residues 125-130 on the C-helix was genetically randomized, and the resulting library of mutants was screened for those that activated CooA in the absence of the effector CO. Effector-independent CooA variants were readily found and uniformly possessed a consensus leucine zipper motif, consistent with the hypothesis (21Kerby R.L. Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In another line of study, a novel CooA variant that is able to respond to the non-natural effector imidazole has been found, and the molecular basis for this is most easily explained by invoking a similar, but locally different, C-helix repositioning (22Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45744-45752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Last, two structures of PrfA, a CRP homolog that regulates virulence in Listeria monocytogenes, have been recently reported (23Eiting M. Hageluken G. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar): that of WT PrfA and that of G145S PrfA, a hyperactive variant. Although the mutated site is not in the C-helices, the comparison of the two structures, which correlate with differences in activity, revealed a noticeable straightening of the C-helices in G145S PrfA (23Eiting M. Hageluken G. Schubert W.D. Heinz D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Such correlation between C-helix repositioning and DNA-binding activity further substantiates the possibility of C-helix repositioning in the activation of this family of proteins.The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that C-helix repositioning is a critical local event triggering CRP activation upon cAMP binding. For this purpose, we completely randomized the codons at Thr127 and Ser128 and screened for highly active CRP variants in the absence of cAMP, anticipating that certain mutations would mimic the effect of cAMP. By isolating a series of highly cAMP-independent CRP variants altered at these positions and characterizing these variants, we provide genetic evidence in support of the hypothesis. Furthermore, in the course of this study, we recognized that another local event must occur in addition to C-helix repositioning for complete CRP activation: movement of the β4/β5 loop. This loop is indicated in Fig. 1A, and the base of the loop comes into contact with the bound cAMP (14Passner J.M. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We propose that cAMP repositions the β4/β5 loop through its hydrophobic interactions with loop residues, including Leu61.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Recombinant DNA Methodology—The bacterial strains, plasmids, and promoter fragments used in this study are listed in Table 1. Standard methods for the isolation and manipulation of DNA fragments (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used throughout the study. Synthetic oligonucleotides used for sequencing, PCR amplification, and mutant construction were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Bacterial strains carrying different plasmids were propagated in LC medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) with 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 50 μg/ml ampicillin as appropriate.TABLE 1Bacterial strains, plasmids, and promoters used in this workBrief descriptionSource/Ref.Bacterial strainsHB101M182Δ (laclPOZY) × 74galK galU strARef. 46UQ3259F− his StrR relA1 ilv::Tn10 cya (SA2755)S.

Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Six histidine codons were subsequently added between the last codon and the stop codon of the crp gene for easy purification of the corresponding protein. Site-directed mutagenesis involved PCR amplification of crp-containing pEXT20 with primers designed to incorporate the desired nucleotide changes as described (25Chiang L.W. Kovari I. Howe M.M. PCR Methods Applications. 1993; 2: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The method used for codon randomization was essentially identical to that used for site-directed mutagenesis except that the primers contained randomized codons at the desired positions. For the screening of constitutively active CRP variants, we used strain UQ3811 (see Table 1 for details). The assay monitors the ability of the CRP variants to cause β-galactosidase accumulation in colonies on agar plates. Based on colony color, variants could be classified as active, weakly active, and inactive. The crp genes for selected variants were sequenced to determine the causative residue changes.Measurement of in Vivo β-Galactosidase Activity—Each cya crp strain harboring either a Class I- or II-type reporter system was constructed by introducing cya and crp mutant alleles sequentially into either strain UQ3740 (RLG4649) (26Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or UQ3741 (RLG4650) (27Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J. Thomas M.S. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using P1 transduction (see Table 1). For the in vivo β-galactosidase assay, cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LC medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to full growth. The next day, cells were diluted to A600 nm = 0.1 in fresh LC medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and different levels of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm. Cells at A600 nm = 1-1.5 were used for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity by a standard method (28Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar).Measurement of Growth Rates in Strains Containing WT CRP and Selected Variants—WT, T127L/S128A, and T127L/S128I CRP-containing cells in the UQ3588 background (see Table 1) were grown overnight at 37 °C in LC medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to full growth. The next day, each strain was diluted to A600 nm = 0.1 in fresh LC medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and different levels of IPTG were added with or without 2 mm cAMP. Each strain was grown using 10-ml culture volumes in 125- or 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C and 220 rpm, and A600 nm was monitored every hour.Purification of CRP Proteins—For biochemical analysis, each His-tagged CRP protein was purified as follows. Cultures of UQ3811 cells transformed with plasmids encoding appropriate CRP variants were grown aerobically at 220 rpm in 2× LC medium at 37 °C to A600 nm = 0.5, at which point, the synthesis of CRP was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. Cultures were grown for another 5 h before harvesting and storing at -80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm KCl, and broken using a French pressure system. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen). After washing with 50 mm imidazole, the CRP proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 500 mm KCl; precipitated with 42.5% ammonium sulfate; and stored at -80 °C until uses. All protein preparations were >95% homogeneous.Measurement of the in Vitro DNA-binding Activity of CRP Proteins—In vitro DNA binding assays were performed using the fluorescence polarization technique with a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization detector (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI). A fluorescent DNA probe was generated in which a 26-bp target DNA containing CCpmelR (5′-GTAAATGTGATGTACATCACATGGAT-3′) (29Gaston K. Bell A. Kolb A. Buc H. Busby S. Cell. 1990; 62: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was labeled with Texas Red on one end of the duplex. Binding assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The probe was used at a concentration of 5 nm in the presence of 6.4 μm salmon sperm DNA. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the binding data to an equation as described previously (30Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription Assays—Multiple-round in vitro transcription assays were performed as described by Savery et al. (27Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J. Thomas M.S. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reactions (25 μl-final volume) were performed with 5 nm RNA polymerase, 200 nm WT or T127L/S128I CRP, either 0.1 or 1 mm cAMP, 25 ng of supercoiled plasmid templates, 200 μm ATP, 200 μm CTP, 200 μm GTP, 10 μm UTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP in buffer containing 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. For DNA templates, we used pSR/CC(-41.5) (26Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Kainz M. Gaal T. Ross W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Busby S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3439-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and pSR/CC(-61.5) (27Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J. Thomas M.S. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which contain the λ OOP Rho factor-independent transcription terminator and which both produce a transcript of 123 nucleotides. The 108-nucleotide RNA I transcript served as a control (31Tomizawa J. Itoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6096-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The pSR/CC(-41.5) and pSR/CC(-61.5) plasmids were prepared using a Qiagen miniprep kit and further purified by phenol extraction. Reactions were started by the addition of RNA polymerase, and after 15 min at room temperature, products were loaded onto denaturing 7% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using a Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSGenetic Selection for Constitutively Active Residue 127 and 128 CRP Variants—As noted in the Introduction, it was our working hypothesis that CRP, like CooA, employs repositioning of the C-helices upon effector binding as a major element of signal transduction within the protein. Given the importance of C-helix residues Thr127 and Ser128 for CRP activation (15Lee E.J. Glasgow J. Leu S.F. Belduz A.O. Harman J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2894-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Moore J.L. Gorshkoya I.I. Brown J.W. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21273-21278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and of the d-position of Thr127 in the coiled-coil heptad repeat, we predicted that some substitutions at these positions might create a C-helix repositioning without cAMP that is similar to that caused by cAMP in WT CRP. If the hypothesis were correct, we predicted that such cAMP-independent variants would be found to contain residues more conducive to the formation of a consensus leucine zipper, as seen in the mutational analysis of CooA (21Kerby R.L. Youn H. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The codons at residues 127 and 128 were simultaneously randomized in a library of crp-expressing plasmids, and the resultant plasmid pool was transformed into UQ3811 (Table 1), a cya crp E. coli reporter strain that contains the lacZ gene under the control of the Class I CC(-61.5) promoter (27Savery N.J. Lloyd G.S. Busby S.J. Thomas M.S. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Expression of the mutated crp gene in the pEXT20 vector can be regulated by IPTG (32Dykxhoorn D.M. St. Pierre R. Linn T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Approximately 4000 colonies were screened at either 0 or 100 μm IPTG for those with activity in the absence of cAMP, as evidenced by their blue color.Without IPTG added, 2.3% of the colonies were light blue above a white background. Under the assay conditions used, no colony was dark blue. The crp regions of the light blue colonies were then sequenced, revealing that all the variants (eight of eight) contained exclusively a T127L/S128I substitution, although with different codons (Table 2). This result suggests that T127L/S128I CRP is a particularly active cAMP-independent variant.TABLE 2Screening results for constitutively active CRP variants randomly altered at Thr127 and Ser128Screened without IPTGScreened with 100 μm IPTGCRPPosition 127Position 128CRPPosition 127Position 128CRPPosition 127Position 128CodonAmino acidCodonAmino acidCodonAmino acidCodonAmino acidCodonAmino acidCodonAmino acidLB-1aLight blue (2.3% of the total population).TTALeuATAIleDB-1′bDark blue (3.4% of the total population).ATAIleATTIleLB-1′cLight blue (8.5% of the total population).ATGMetACAThrLB-2CTGLeuATTIleDB-2′ATGMetGTAValLB-2′TTGLeuCAAGlnLB-3CTGLeuATAIleDB-3′CTTLeuGTGValLB-3′TTGLeuCTALeuLB-4CTGLeuATTIleDB-4′TTGLeuGTCValLB-4′ACAThrATAIleLB-5TTGLeuATCIleDB-5′CTALeuGTGValLB-5′CTGLeuACTThrLB-6CTGLeuATAIleDB-6′CTTLeuGTGValLB-6′CTCLeuATGMetLB-7TTALeuATTIleDB-7′ATGMetGTAValLB-7′CTALeuACTThrLB-8TTALeuATAIleDB-8′CTALeuAAGLysLB-8′ATGMetATGMeta Light blue (2.3% of the total population).b Dark blue (3.4% of the total population).c Light blue (8.5% of the total population). Open table in a new tab With 100 μm IPTG added, 3.4% of the total colonies turned dark blue, and 8.5% turned light blue. Sequence analysis showed that most dark blue colonies had Leu or Met at position 127 (seven of eight) (Table 2). At position 128, β-branched amino acids such as Ile and Val were found (seven of eight), resulting in three T127L/S128V and one T127M/S128V independent CRP variants. In the variants with light blue color, a similar Leu or Met preference at position 127 was seen (seven of eight), whereas β-branched chain amino acids were less frequent at position 128 (four of eight). Surprisingly, T127L/S128I CRP, which was consistently found in the 0 μm IPTG screen, was not found with 100 μm IPTG. We believe that large amounts of a highly active CRP variant such as T127L/S128I CRP make E. coli cells sick, as will be detailed below. These randomization results suggest that Leu or Met at position 127 and a β-branched amino acid at position 128 can effectively shift the equilibrium of the protein into a highly active form even without the effector cAMP and that the specific mutants detected depend on IPTG (and therefore CRP expression) levels.An Improved Leucine Zipper Motif Centered at Position 127 Stabilizes the Active Conformation of CRP—To test systematically whether an improved leucine zipper motif at residues 127 and 128 stabilizes the active conformation of CRP, we created several CRP variants (T127L/S128(L/M/V) and T127(I/M/V)/S128I) that are similar to T127L/S128I CRP. We also created T127L/S128A CRP because it was the most active cAMP-independent variant characterized previously (16Shi Y. Wang S. Krueger S. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6946-6956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Chu S.Y. Tordova M. Gilliland G.L. Gorshkova I. Shi Y. Wang S. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11230-11236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Moore J.L. Gorshkoya I.I. Brown J.W. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21273-21278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).When we measured the in vivo β-galactosidase activities of these CRP variants at either a Class I or II promoter, we noticed that the in vivo activities were highly dependent upon protein expression and easily saturated at higher protein levels: with 100 μm IPTG, all the tested CRP variants, including T127L/S128A, showed significant in vivo activities, which were not distinguishable from one another (data not shown). To obtain meaningful activity values, we therefore analyzed activity only in the absence of IPTG (Table 3). As a group, all the CRP variants showed higher activities without cAMP than did WT CRP at both Class I and II promoters, although the pattern was more apparent at the Class II promoter (Table 3). It is also worth noting that, under conditions of low protein expression, all the new CRP variants were better than the well studied T127L/S128A CRP variant in terms of cAMP-independent activity. Among the variants, T127L/S128I CRP showed the highest cAMP-independent activity, confirming the validity of the screen. The effector-independent activity of T127L/S128I CRP was comparable with that of WT CRP in the presence of cAMP. However, in the presence of cAMP, most CRP variants (except T127L/S128I and T127M/S128I) showed poorer activities than did WT CRP. This might mean that either (i) those variants are not saturated by the externally supplied 2 mm cAMP or (ii) fully cAMP-bound forms of these variants are functionally different from that of WT CRP. In vitro DNA binding measurements were necessary to differentiate between these two possibilities and to rule out differential protein accumulation as another variable.TABLE 3In vivo β-galactosidase activities and in vitro DNA-binding activities of CRP proteins mutated at residues 127 and 128CRPβ-Galactosidase activityDNA-binding activity, KdClass I (CC(−61.5))Class II (CC(−41.5))−cAMP+cAMP−cAMP+cA"

We have explored the molecular basis for FliI/FliH interaction in the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. By using bioinformatic and biochemical analyses, we showed that residues 1–18 of FliI very likely form an amphipathic α-helix upon interaction with FliH, and that residues 21–91 of FliI resemble the N-terminal oligomerization domain of the F1-ATPase catalytic subunits. A truncated FliI-(2–91) protein was shown to be folded, although the N-terminal 18 residues were likely unstructured. Deletion and scanning mutagenesis showed that residues 1–18 of FliI were essential for the FliI/FliH interaction. Scanning mutation of amino acids in the N-terminal 10 residues of FliI indicated that a cluster of hydrophobic residues in this segment was critical for the interaction with FliH. The interaction between FliI and FliH has similarities to the interaction between the N-terminal α-helix of the F1-ATPase α-subunit and the globular domain of the F1-ATPase δ-subunit, respectively. This similarity suggests that FliH may function as a molecular stator. Bacterial flagellar protein export requires an ATPase, FliI, and presumptive inhibitor, FliH.

Salmonella FliI has also been shown to interact with FliH, a conserved flagellar export component that inhibits FliI enzymatic activity in vitro (24Minamino T. Tame J.R.H Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Mol.

Mutation of active site residues in the C-terminal domain of FliI are dominant negative for swarming motility (16Vogler A.P. Homma M. Irikura V.M. Macnab R.M. J.

Similar studies on the homologous InvC type III ATPase also demonstrated negative dominance of catalytic site mutations that were relieved on disruption of membrane localization of the ATPase (20Pozidis C.

The interaction of FliI with FliH, a conserved component of the flagellar and type III secretion systems that inhibits FliI ATPase activity in vitro, has been studied in Salmonella (24Minamino T. Tame J.R.H Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Minamino T. Macnab R.M. Mol.

Gonzalez-Pedrajo B. Oosawa K. Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An N-terminal FliI double mutant (R7C/L12P) was isolated from genetic screens that detected loss of swarming motility in vivo and acted in a recessive manner (26Minamino T. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1491-1503Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This double mutant also failed to interact with FliH in vitro (26Minamino T. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1491-1503Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting individual residues in this segment of FliI were required for interaction with one or more components of the export apparatus, including FliH. However, further experiments were not carried out to verify and substantiate this preliminary observation. Furthermore, the extreme nature of the R7C/L12P double mutant suggested this mutation very likely prevented the FliI N terminus from folding into a structure capable of interacting with FliH. Nevertheless, truncated versions of Salmonella FliI purified from limited proteolysis experiments and containing residues 7–456 or 26–456 did not interact with FliH as judged by gel filtration chromatography (24Minamino T. Tame J.R.H Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), indicating the N terminus of FliI is largely responsible for interactions with FliH. These studies also indicated that Salmonella FliI was sensitive to clostripain proteolysis at amino acids 7, 26, 93, and 97, but the extent of FliI proteolysis was reduced in the presence of Salmonella FliH (24Minamino T. Tame J.R.H Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). FliH itself was not sensitive to clostripain proteolysis. The domain structure of Salmonella FliH has been studied in some detail. Salmonella FliH forms an elongated dimeric structure in solution and a (FliH)2FliI complex forms with intact full-length FliI (27Minamino T. Gonzalez-Pedrajo B. Oosawa K. Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A scanning deletion analysis of Salmonella FliH showed that residues 100–235 were required for interactions with FliI; residues 101–141 were required for FliH dimerization (likely via a coiled-coil segment); residues 70–100 were important for inhibition of FliI ATPase activity, and N-terminal residues contributed to binding to the flagellar chaperone FliJ (28Gonzales-Pedrajo B. Fraser G.M. Minamino T. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 967-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, these studies do not suggest how FliH inhibits FliI ATPase activity, or what is the general role of FliH in flagellar protein secretion. Our laboratories are studying flagellar biogenesis in the human gastric pathogen H. pylori as a model for the assembly of a polar sheathed flagellum (10O'Toole P.W. Lane M.C. Porwollik S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Porwollik S. Noonan B. O'Toole P.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2060-2070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ryan K.A.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5742-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a novel component that interacts with RpoN and FliH that is essential for flagellum assembly (30Ryan K.A. Karim N. Worku M. Moore S.A. Penn C.W. O'Toole P.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 248: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We are also investigating individual flagellar components. The principal objective of this study was to extend our understanding of FliI structure and function based on analysis of the poorly characterized yet important N-terminal region of the molecule (residues 1–91 of H. pylori FliI). Furthermore, we hoped to gain insight into FliI function from analyzing the molecular details of the FliI/FliH interaction. A previously published Y2H partial interaction map of the H. pylori proteome demonstrated that a bait domain containing residues 1–258 of H. pylori FliH interacted with a prey domain containing residues 3–134 of H. pylori FliI (see Ref. 12Rain J.C. Selig L. De Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schachter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P. Nature. 2001; 409: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar and pimhybrigenics.com). However, these studies did not indicate what residues in this fragment of H. pylori FliI were responsible for the interaction with FliH and, as in the Salmonella studies, did not indicate the molecular nature or absolute residue requirements of the interaction. Hence, biochemical confirmation and elaboration of the H. pylori FliI/FliH Y2H interaction (12Rain J.C. Selig L. De Reuse H. Battaglia V. Reverdy C. Simon S. Lenzen G. Petel F. Wojcik J. Schachter V. Chemama Y. Labigne A. Legrain P. Nature. 2001; 409: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) were necessary. In addition, no obvious sequence similarity exists between amino acids 1–25 of Salmonella FliI (reported to be required for FliH interaction) and the same region of H. pylori FliI or other FliI sequences. Protein Sequence and Structure Analysis—PSI-BLAST searches (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

A selected group of FliI, type III ATPase, and F1-ATPase α- and β-subunit sequences uncovered with the PSI-BLAST search were then prepared as a multiple sequence alignments with T-Coffee (supplemental Fig. S1) (33Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar). In addition, three-dimensional structures are available for the bovine mitochondrial and Bacillus PS3 F1-ATPase α- and β-subunit sequences (34Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Therefore, alignment of the FliI/type III ATPase N-domains was verified by using the superimposed structures of the four homologous F1-ATPase subunit N-domains extracted from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) as calculated by LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite of programs (37Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

The most significant alignment to a known structure was to the α-subunit of Bacillus PS3 F1-ATPase (25.7% pairwise identity). The structures were visualized on a graphics work station using Turbo-Frodo (38Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO. Silicon Graphics Applications Directory, Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). An homology model of FliI was constructed using Turbo-Frodo, based on the derived alignment and using the F1-ATPase subunit atomic coordinates as templates. The resultant FliI atomic model was energy-minimized using CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Gene fragments corresponding to FliH-(2–258), FliH-(55–258), FliH-(94–258), FliH-(117–258), FliI-(2–91), and FliI-(19–91) were isolated by PCR amplification of H. pylori 26695 chromosomal DNA (1–5 ng) by using the appropriate oligodeoxynucleotide primers (supplemental Table S1) (200 nm) in Pfu buffer (Fermentas), 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas). Thermal cycling of the PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad MyCycler.

The supernatant was clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 × g twice for 30 min and then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 3 h at 25 °C. The GST affinity tag was removed by adding PreScission protease to the glutathione-Sepharose-bound fusion protein or by adding protease once reduced glutathione was used to release the fusion protein from the resin. For the FliH proteins, they were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on Source Q resin at pH 8.5 followed by gel filtration chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer using a Superdex 200 analytical gel filtration column. FliI-(19–91) was purified on Source S followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75. FliI-(2–91) and mutants thereof were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HiTrap phenyl-HP) and finally gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75. Molecular Mass Estimation of Purified Proteins—Analytical gel filtration chromatography was used to estimate the molecular masses and respective oligomerization states of purified truncated FliI and FliH proteins. Analytical grade Superdex 75 and Superdex 200 columns from Amersham Biosciences were calibrated with a set of molecular mass standards. The calibration curve plotted is as follows: Kav = (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0) versus the log10(molecular mass), where Ve is the sample elution volume; Vt is the total bed volume; and V0 is the column void volume. A line of best fit was fitted against the data points. The Superdex 75 column had a void volume of 7.84 ml determined from the elution of blue dextran, and the total bed volume was 24 ml. The Superdex 75 column was calibrated with the following standards: albumin (Mr = 67,000, Ve = 9.84 ml), ovalbumin (Mr = 43,000, Ve = 10.88 ml), chymotrypsinogen A (Mr = 25,000, Ve = 12.80 ml), ribonuclease A (Mr = 13,700, Ve = 13.80 ml), aprotinin (Mr = 6,500, Ve = 15.73 ml), and vitamin B12 (Mr = 1355, Ve = 19.15 ml). The Superdex 200 column had a void volume of 8.04 ml determined from the elution of blue dextran, and the total bed volume was 24 ml. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated with the following standards: ferritin (Mr 440,000, Ve = 9.12 ml), catalase (Mr = 232,000, Ve = 10.64 ml), aldolase (Mr = 158,0000, Ve = 12.40 ml), albumin (Mr = 67,000, Ve = 14.00 ml), ovalbumin (Mr = 43,000, Ve = 15.12 ml), chymotrypsinogen A (Mr = 25,000, Ve = 16.80 ml), and aprotinin (Mr = 6,500, Ve = 19.01 ml). GST Pulldown Assays—30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose was prepared by applying four washes of 3 volumes of PBS buffer and then mixing with 20 μg of GST-FliH-(2–258), GST-FliH-(55–258), GST-FliH-(94–258), GST-FliH-(117–258), or GST (all in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The protein-bound glutathione-Sepharose was then washed three times with 3 volumes of PBS. Then 4.8 μg of the purified FliI-(19–91), FliI-(2–91), or mutant FliI-(2–91) proteins was added to yield a 2:1 molar ratio of GST-FliH to FliI. The total volume was made to 200 μl with PBS. This mixture was allowed to incubate with gentle agitation for 30 min. The protein-bound glutathione-Sepharose was washed twice with 200 μl of PBS, separated by centrifugation, and boiled with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Each well of the pulldown gel contained 20 μg of GST-FliH and 4.8 μg of truncated N-FliI (residues 2–91 or 19–91). Each gel series was repeated in triplicate and shown to be reproducible. Control pulldowns for all of the mutant proteins were conducted but are only shown for GST-FliH-(55–258) (bait) and FliI-(2–91) (prey) (Fig. 5). After GST tag removal, none of the purified prey proteins bound significantly to glutathione-Sepharose. Equivalent protein concentrations were evaluated by measuring protein UV absorbance at 276 nm in PBS buffer for each of the purified proteins based on their aromatic amino acid content. Far-UV Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Pistar 180 spectrometer from Applied Photophysics. Spectra were recorded from 180 to 260 nm under a nitrogen atmosphere, and typically a total of 5 scans were recorded at 0.5 nm steps with entry and exit slits set at 4 nm. These scans were then averaged and smoothed to produce the spectra shown. Spectra were measured in 0.1-mm quartz cuvettes at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in PBS buffer. Limited Proteolysis of Proteins—Trypsin or chymotrypsin was dissolved to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 10% glycerol and PBS. Protease was added to 50 μg of the protein of interest (FliI-(2–91) or FliH-(2–258)) at a protease to target molar ratio of 1:1000, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 min at room temperature. 10 μg of protein were removed after 5, 10, 20, 40, or 60 min and quenched with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein was visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Bands corresponding to protease digestion products were electroblotted onto polydivinylidine fluoride membranes and then subjected to micro-sequencing. We typically sequenced at least five residues to determine the position of protease cleavage. We also micro-sequenced several of the purified proteins used in this study to verify that their N termini were intact. The N Terminus of H. pylori FliI Is Homologous to the F1-ATPase Oligomerization Domain—Previous studies have established significant amino acid sequence similarity between residues 100–430 of FliI and the catalytic domain of the F1-ATPase β-subunit, indicating that the catalytic segments of these proteins descended from a common ancestor, and have a similar three-dimensional structure (16Vogler A.P.

In vivo, mtGSH depletion in B16M-F10 cells was achieved by feeding mice (where the B16M-F10 grew as a solid tumor in the footpad) with an L-glutamine (L-Gln)-enriched diet, which promoted in the tumor cells an increase in glutaminase activity, accumulation of cytosolic L-glutamate, and competitive inhibition of GSH transport into mitochondria. L-Gln-adapted B16M-F10 cells, isolated using anti-Met-72 monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry-coupled cell sorting, were injected into the portal vein to produce hepatic metastases. In l-Gln-adapted invasive (iB16M-Gln+) cells, isolated from the liver by the same methodology and treated with TNF-alpha and an antisense Bcl-2 oligodeoxynucleotide, viability decreased to approximately 12%. iB16M-Gln+ cell death associated with increased generation of O2*- and H2O2, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, and release of proapoptotic molecular signals. Activation of cell death mechanisms was prevented by GSH ester-induced mtGSH replenishment. The oxidative stress-resistant survivors showed an adaptive response that includes overexpression of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and catalase activities. By treating iB16M-Gln+ cells with a double anti- antisense therapy (Bcl-2 and SOD2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides) and TNF-alpha, metastatic cell survival decreased to approximately 1%. Chemotherapy (taxol plus daunorubicin) easily removed this minimum percentage of survivors. This contribution identifies critical molecules that can be sequentially targeted to facilitate elimination of highly resistant metastatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120181859,"The p53 tumor-suppressor is a transcription factor that is stabilized in response to cellular stress leading to growth arrest or apoptosis. p21WAF1/CIP1 is a major transcriptional target of p53 and it plays a critical role in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. In this study, we identified multiple alternate human p21 transcripts that have their transcriptional start sites in the direct proximity of the distal p53 response element. These transcripts are upregulated as a result of DNA damage-induced p53 activation. Furthermore, the basal expression of these alternate transcripts is strongly regulated by p53 and they are undetectable in p53-knocked down cells. This is in contrast to classical p21 transcripts, which have reduced, albeit detectable expression levels in the absence of p53. The existence of the alternate transcripts underscores the complexity of the human p21 genomic locus and opens up new avenues for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2070971206,"Retinoic acid (RA) is a signaling molecule that plays a pivotal role in major cellular processes and vertebrate development. RA action is mediated by specialized transcription factors, the nuclear RA receptors (RARs), which regulate the transcription of genes containing a RA-responsive element (RARE). Here we demonstrate that the genes for the RA-receptor RARβ2 and the cytochrome P450 RA-specific hydrolase Cyp26a1 involved in RA catabolism are coordinately regulated by RA. We found that both RARβ2 and Cyp26a1 genes are epigenetically silenced in the absence of DNA methylation in RAC65, a P19 embryocarcinoma cell line derivative carrying a dominant-negative RARα mutant and resistant to the growth-inhibitory and differentiation effects of RA. In response to RA, RARβ2 transcription is epigenetically regulated by RARα. Similarly, we found that Cyp26a1 transcription is epigenetically regulated by RARβ2. Knocking down RARβ2 transcription by RNA interference in wild-type P19 cells, with an intact RARα, induced Cyp26a1 transcriptional repression in the absence of DNA methylation. Concomitantly, cells developed RA resistance and did not undergo RA-induced neuron differentiation. Apparently, RARα, RARβ2 and Cyp26a1 are components of a RA-regulated gene network. Factors affecting an upstream gene of the network can trigger repressive chromatin changes – which are propagated in a domino fashion – at downstream genes of the network. This study also shows that chromatin inactivity, and consequent transcriptional silencing, can be achieved in the absence of DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2064634789,"Cathepsin L, a cysteine protease, is overexpressed in human tumor cells and plays a major role in melanoma progression. Our aim was herein to identify molecular mechanisms, which contribute to its overexpression. We found that cathepsin L protein expression correlated with mRNA level in tumor cells. Therefore, we focused on mechanisms involved in cathepsin L mRNA regulation. CpG island was localized in the 5′ region of cathepsin L gene that encompassed regulatory regions identified as essential for promoter activity. CpG dinucleotides, not methylated in any melanoma cells analysed, were methylated in a B lymphoma cell line, which poorly express cathepsin L. Our data demonstrate that in lymphoma cells, cathepsin L silencing was methylation-dependent. Furthermore, gene amplification was involved in cathepsin L overexpression in one melanoma cell line, while transcriptional mechanisms but not mRNA stability are responsible of cathepsin L overexpression in others melanoma cells. In addition, NF-Y, Sp1, Sp2 and Sp3 transcription factors, essential to basal cathepsin L transcription, are not directly involved in overexpression. Thus, our data provides the first demonstration that cathepsin L expression in tumor cells is under the control of distinct molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1978571157,"SHP-2, a tyrosine phosphatase implicated in diverse signaling pathways induced by growth factors and cytokines, is also involved in DNA damage-triggered signaling and cellular responses. We previously demonstrated that SHP-2 played an important role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. In the present studies, we have provided evidence that SHP-2 functions in DNA damage apoptosis and G2/M arrest in catalytically dependent and independent manners, respectively. Mutant embryonic fibroblasts with the Exon 3 deletion mutation in SHP-2 showed decreased apoptosis and diminished G2/M arrest in response to cisplatin treatment. Wild type (WT), but not catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2 (SHP-2 C459S), rescued the apoptotic response of the mutant cells. Interestingly, both WT and SHP-2 C459S efficiently restored the G2/M arrest response. Furthermore, inhibition of the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 in WT cells by overexpression of SHP-2 C459S greatly decreased cell death but not G2/M arrest induced by cisplatin. Biochemical analyses revealed that activation of c-Abl kinase was decreased in SHP-2 C459S-overexpressing cells. However, DNA damage-induced translocation of Cdc25C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was fully restored in both WT and SHP-2 C459S “rescued” cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced cellular responses was independent of the tumor suppressor p53. Embryonic stem cells with the SHP-2 deletion mutation showed markedly decreased sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, attributed to impaired induction of p73 but not p53. In agreement with these results, DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest were also decreased in SHP-2/p53 double mutant embryonic fibroblasts.

However, ionizing radiation and DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin can also induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner (6Zamble D.B. Jacks T. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further investigations have demonstrated that p73 but not p53 is the downstream effector and target of the nuclear tyrosine kinase c-Abl (8Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

DNA damage stress also activates the cell cycle checkpoint that plays a vital role in maintenance of genetic stability (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells arrest at different points in the cell cycle. This regulatory mechanism inhibits cell cycle progression until the cell has adequately repaired the DNA damage. For instance, arrest in G1 and S phases prevents damaged DNA from replicating, and arrest in G2 phase prevents segregation of damaged chromosomes. Failures in cell cycle checkpoints can lead to the acquisition and accumulation of genetic alterations. These changes may result in the activation of oncogenes and/or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, both of which can ultimately lead to tumorigenesis.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42812-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As a result, loss of SHP-2 function diminishes DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest response. Since SHP-2 is a protein phosphatase, possessing catalytic activity, it is important to define the role that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 plays in this context. Additionally, as the embryonic fibroblast cell lines used in our previous studies were immortalized by SV40 large T antigen, which inactivates p53, it remains to be determined whether the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced cellular response is mediated by p53. In the present study, we have provided evidence that SHP-2 functions in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in catalytically dependent and independent manners, respectively, and have confirmed that the role of SHP-2 in this context does not depend on p53. Cell Lines and Reagents—WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant embryonic fibroblast cell lines were derived from day 9.0–9.5 embryos through SV40 large T antigen immortalization (22Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cisplatin and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma. Anti-c-Abl, anti-Cdc25C, anti-histone H1, and anti-SHP-2 antibodies (Ab) were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-tyrosine Ab (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Retroviral-mediated Gene Transfer—WT SHP-2 and SHP-2 C459S cDNAs were cloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vector (35Persons D.A. Allay J.A. Allay E.R. Ashmun R.A. Orlic D. Jane S.M.

Blood. 1999; 93: 488-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) driving expression of a downstream green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene to facilitate tracking of transduced cells. High titer and helper-free ecotropic retroviruses were generated by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with pQEPAM3 (Minus E) gag polymerase-expressing plasmid, pSrαG envelope protein (VSV-G)-expressing plasmid, and the recombinant SHP-2 retroviral plasmid. The retroviruses were used to transduce WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ cells in the presence of Polybrene (6 μg/ml) for 8 h. After two rounds of hits, transduced cells were harvested and sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on GFP expression. DAPI Staining—Cells grown in slide chambers were treated with cisplatin at various concentrations. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed with distilled water, and then stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (3 μg/ml) for 30 min. Nuclei were visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cells in randomly selected fields. A minimum of 300 cells was counted (36Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol.

Fixed cells were treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Cellular DNA content was analyzed with FACS analysis using BD-LSR flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). The cell cycle profiles were determined with the CELLQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). Mitotic Index Assay—Cells grown in slide chambers were treated with γ irradiation (10 grays). Two, 4, 8, and 24 h following the treatment, cells were fixed in methanol for 10 min and stained with 5% Giemsa. In some experiments, cells were stained with anti-phospho-histone H3 Ab that specifically detects mitotic nuclei. Mitotic cells in metaphase, anaphase, and telophase were identified under the fluorescence microscope and expressed as a fraction of the total cells counted. At least 3000 cells were counted in each preparation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 2mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5μg/ml aprotin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Whole cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of purified Abs as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with indicated Abs. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The c-Abl kinase assay was modified based on previous reports (38Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Abl Ab (2 μg). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and one time with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and were finally resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing GST-Crk (5 μg) and 10 μm ATP. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Proteins in the whole reaction system were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated GST-Crk was visualized by anti-phospho-tyrosine immunoblotting. Differential Roles of the Catalytic Activity of SHP-2 Phosphatase in DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis and G2/M Arrest—SHP-2 is a protein phosphatase, possessing a catalytic activity; however, previous studies have shown that in growth factor/cytokine signaling pathways, SHP-2 also functions as an adaptor protein independent of its enzymatic activity (27Yu W.M.

SHP-2 plays an important role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M checkpoint (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Qu C.K. J. Biol.

To address whether the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is required for its role in DNA damage-triggered signaling and cellular responses, we took advantage of the mutant embryonic fibroblast cell lines with a loss-of-function deletion mutation in SHP-2 (SHP-2Δ/Δ), which have been shown by our previous studies to be defective in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42812-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We transduced WT or catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant (SHP-2 C459S) into SHP-2Δ/Δ cells and then analyzed responses of these “rescued” cells to DNA damage induced by cisplatin. As shown in Fig. 1A, the percentage of the cells with sub-G1 DNA content, known to be apoptotic, was decreased in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells. Reintroduction of WT SHP-2 into mutant cells efficiently restored apoptotic responses to cisplatin, confirming a direct role of SHP-2 in DNA damage response. However, expression of catalytically inactive mutant SHP-2 (SHP-2 C459S) did not rescue the apoptotic response in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells, suggesting that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is required for its function in DNA damage apoptosis. Following cisplatin treatment, the percentage of SHP-2Δ/Δ cells in G2/M phase was not increased, indicative of a defective G2/M checkpoint. Interestingly, DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest in both WT SHP-2 and SHP-2 C459S rescued cells was fully restored (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is required for DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not the G2/M arrest response. To further determine the role of the catalytic activity of SHP-2 in DNA damage-triggered cellular responses, WT SHP-2 and SHP-2 C459S were overexpressed in WT embryonic fibroblasts by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Gene-transduced cells were sorted by FACS based on the expression of GFP and then analyzed for their responses to DNA damage. Overexpression of WT SHP-2 did not significantly influence cisplatin-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. However, inhibition of the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 by overexpression of SHP-2 C459S greatly decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis but not G2/M arrest (Fig. 2, A and B). These experiments were repeated using the Chinese hamster ovary cell line; similar results were obtained (Fig. 2C). The overexpression data are consistent with the rescue results (Fig. 1A), reaffirming differential roles of the catalytic activity of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint. We next investigated the mechanisms by which the enzymatic activity of SHP-2 positively modulates the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Activation of c-Abl kinase, a critical regulator for DNA damage-induced apoptosis (38Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 43Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), in WT SHP-2- and SHP-2 C459S-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, cisplatin treatment activates c-Abl kinase in vector control and WT SHP-2-transduced cells. In contrast, although the basal level of c-Abl activity is slightly increased, activation of c-Abl by DNA damage in SHP-2 C459S-overexpressing cells was diminished. These data suggest that decreased apoptosis in SHP-2 C459S cells is attributed to diminished c-Abl activation and that the phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is required for c-Abl activation. To define the mechanisms of the SHP-2 function in the G2/M arrest response to DNA damage, translocation of Cdc25C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a critical biochemical process in the DNA damage G2/M checkpoint, was examined. Consistent with our previous results (32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42812-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the Cdc25C translocation response in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells was abolished. Interestingly, Cdc25C translocation was fully restored by reintroduction of either WT SHP-2 or catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S (Fig. 4), supporting that the G2/M arrest response does not require the catalytic activity of SHP-2. The Role of SHP-2 Phosphatase in DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis Is Independent of p53—The embryonic fibroblast cell lines used for our previous studies (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C.

To rule out the possibility that SV40 T antigen immortalization affected our results, we treated WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with cisplatin and then assessed their apoptotic responses to cisplatin. As shown in Fig. 5, cisplatin-induced apoptosis in SHP-2Δ/Δ ES cells was also greatly decreased. As p53 and p73 transcriptional factors play important roles in DNA damage-induced apoptosis, induction of p53 and p73 in ES cells was examined. p53 induction following cisplatin treatment was comparable in both WT and SHP-2 mutant ES cells. However, induction of p73 in SHP-2Δ/Δ ES cells was completely abolished (Fig. 6). These results verify that defective p73 but not p53 induction in SHP-2 mutant cells contributes to their decreased apoptotic responses to DNA damage.FIGURE 6Induction of p73, but not p53, in response to DNA damage is blocked in SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant ES cells. WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ ES cells were treated with cisplatin (25 μm) for various time periods. Whole cell lysates were prepared and examined with immunoblottings using anti-p73, anti-p53, and anti-SHP-2 Abs. Shown are representatives of 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since p53 is a critical mediator in DNA damage-induced apoptosis, we next wanted to determine whether the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced cellular responses depends on p53. To address this issue, we generated SHP-2/p53 double heterozygous (SHP-2+/Δ/p53+/–) mice by crossing SHP-2+/Δ mice with p53+/– mice. SHP-2+/Δ/p53+/– mice were then intercrossed. The embryos were dissected at embryonic day 10.5, and embryonic fibroblasts were generated. p53 deficiency renders fibroblast immortalization. Immortalized cells were genotyped by PCR analyses of the p53 gene and by immunoblotting analyses of SHP-2 expression (Fig. 7A). SHP-2+/+/p53–/–, SHP-2+/Δ/p53–/–, and SHP-2Δ/Δ/p53–/– cell pools were identified. Responses of the three cell pools to DNA-damaging treatment were then analyzed. Although the cells were more resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis due to the p53–/– background, apoptosis of SHP-2Δ/Δ/p53–/– cells treated with cisplatin was greatly decreased when compared with SHP-2+/+/p53–/– cells (Fig. 7B). We also treated the cells with ionizing radiation and found that apoptosis of SHP-2Δ/Δ/p53–/– cells was also markedly reduced (Fig. 8A). To determine the cell cycle response to DNA damage, SHP-2+/+/p53–/–, SHP-2+/Δ/p53–/–, and SHP-2Δ/Δ/p53–/– cells were treated with ionizing radiation, and the mitotic index assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 8B, irradiation quickly caused a significant delay in mitosis in SHP-2+/+/p53–/– and SHP-2+/Δ/p53–/– cells, indicative of G2 arrest. However, the irradiation-induced G arrest in SHP-2Δ/Δ/p53–/–2 cells was diminished and shortened. These data confirm that SHP-2 phosphatase regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle checkpoint independent of p53 function.FIGURE 8p53-independent role of SHP-2 in ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest.

Cells were then fixed, stained with DAPI, and analyzed for morphological characteristics associated with apoptosis. The percentages of apoptotic cells were determined as reported previously (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol.

Results shown are the mean ± S.E. of triplicates from one experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SHP-2 phosphatase is a multifunctional protein, involved in multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes. SHP-2 has been recognized for its role in signal transduction induced by a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules (14Qu C.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Despite being a phosphatase, SHP-2 generally promotes signal transmission, and its catalytic activity has been shown to be required for the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway induced by growth factors and cytokines (14Qu C.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that SHP-2 was also involved in DNA damage stress-triggered signaling and cellular responses (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Qu C.K. J. Biol.

DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest responses were diminished by loss of SHP-2 function. In the present studies, we have further defined the role of SHP-2 in this context through rescue and dominant inhibition approaches. We have shown that SHP-2 functions in DNA damage-induced apoptosis and G2/M checkpoint in catalytic-dependent and -independent manners, respectively, and that the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage cellular response is independent of the tumor suppressor p53. It is interesting to note that SHP-2 functions in DNA damage-induced cellular responses in both catalytically dependent and independent manners. Previous studies have suggested that SHP-2 may act as an adaptor in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (40Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1998; 187: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) signaling. We have also shown that SHP-2 plays both catalytically dependent and independent roles in interleukin-3-induced signaling and cellular responses (26Chen J. Yu W.M. Bunting K.D. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Yu W.M. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Qu C.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5995-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In DNA damage-induced cellular responses, although the phosphatase activity of SHP-2 is required for apoptosis, this catalytic activity is redundant for the G2/M arrest response. Mutant embryonic fibroblasts with a deletion mutation in SHP-2 showed decreased apoptosis and diminished G2/M arrest in response to DNA damage. WT SHP-2 rather than catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S rescued apoptotic responses of the mutant cells (Fig. 1A), whereas both WT and catalytically inactive SHP-2 efficiently restored G2/M arrest responses (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, inhibition of the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 in WT cells by overexpression of SHP-2 C459S greatly reduced cell death but not G2/M arrest induced by cisplatin (Fig. 2). It appears that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 regulates DNA damage apoptosis by promotion of c-Abl activation. DNA damage-induced c-Abl activation was diminished by inhibition of the phosphatase activity of SHP-2 in SHP-2 C459S-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3). Although the catalytic activity of SHP-2 plays an important role in c-Abl activation, direct binding of SHP-2 to c-Abl is required. We previously showed that in WT cells, SHP-2 binds to c-Abl via its SH3 domain. In contrast, the interaction between c-Abl and truncated SHP-2 (SHP-2Δ) expressed in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells is barely detectable (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) because the expression level of SHP-2Δ is only 20% of that of WT SHP-2 or the c-Abl/SHP-2Δ interaction is destabilized due to the N-terminal truncation of SHP-2. Consequently, although SHP-2Δ possesses a higher catalytic activity than WT SHP-2 (21Qu C.K. Shi Z.Q. Shen R. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5499-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), DNA damage-induced c-Abl activation in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells is essentially blocked (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It remains unclear exactly how the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is involved in c-Abl activation. c-Abl activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms. It is unlikely that SHP-2 promotes c-Abl activation through its upstream activators as ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATM/ATR) kinases appeared to be equally activated by DNA damage in both WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ mutant cells (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since c-Abl kinase is also regulated by other signaling proteins including its inhibitors (44Wen S.T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 45Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 46Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), SHP-2 may promote c-Abl activation by dephosphorylating such regulator(s). It would be interesting to identify the direct target(s)/substrate(s) of SHP-2 and to determine the biochemical significance of its enzymatic activity in the DNA damage-triggered signaling pathways. In contrast to its role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis, SHP-2 appears to participate in the DNA damage G2/M checkpoint independent of its catalytic activity. Both WT and catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S efficiently restored DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest responses (Fig. 1B) in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells. Also, inhibition of the catalytic activity of endogenous SHP-2 in WT cells did not disturb cell cycle checkpoint function (Fig. 2B). We previously showed that SHP-2 participates in DNA damage G2/M checkpoint by promoting Cdc25C translocation through interaction with 14-3-3β (32Yuan L. Yu W.M. Qu C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42812-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since catalytically inactive SHP-2 C459S can fully restore DNA damage-induced translocation of Cdc25C from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in SHP-2Δ/Δ cells (Fig. 4), these findings suggest that SHP-2 protein per se rather than its catalytic activity is involved in the G2/M checkpoint. Additionally, in this report, we have demonstrated that the role of SHP-2 in DNA damage apoptosis is independent of p53. p53, a tumor suppressor, plays a critical role in DNA damage-induced cell death. It is induced by DNA damage stress and then promotes cells with damaged DNA to undergo apoptosis. It thus plays an important role in maintenance of genetic stability by removing damaged cells. Loss-of-function mutations of p53 are associated with many types of cancer. Although SHP-2 is involved in the regulation of DNA damage-induced cell death, it appears that the SHP-2 function in this context does not depend on p53. p53 induction in response to DNA damage is comparable in WT and SHP-2Δ/Δ ES cells (Fig. 6). Moreover, a p53 deficiency did not affect the function of SHP-2 in DNA damage-induced responses. When compared with cellular SHP-2+/+/p53–/– cells, apoptotic and G2/M arrest responses of SHP-2Δ/Δ/p53– cells to cisplatin or irradiation were greatly decreased (Figs. 7B and 8). Although p53 induction does not require SHP-2 function, induction of p73, another important mediator of DNA damage apoptosis, was blocked by loss-of-function mutation of SHP-2 (Fig. 6). These data, while being consistent with our previous results obtained from SV40 large T antigen-immortalized SHP-2Δ/Δ embryonic fibroblasts (31Yuan L. Yu W.M. Yuan Z. Haudenschild C.C. Qu C.K. J.

https://openalex.org/W2029261512,"Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) plays a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation, function, and survival. RANKL exerts its effect by activating its receptor RANK (receptor activator of NF-κB), which recruits various intracellular signaling molecules via specific motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. Previously, we identified three RANK cytoplasmic motifs (Motif 1, 369PFQEP373; Motif 2, 559PVQEET564; and Motif 3, 604PVQEQG609) mediating osteoclast formation and function. Here, we investigated RANK cytoplasmic motifs involved in osteoclast survival. Motif 1, in contrast to its minimal role in osteoclast formation and function, plays a predominant role in promoting osteoclast survival. Moreover, whereas Motif 2 and Motif 3 are highly potent in osteoclast formation and function, they exert a moderate effect on osteoclast survival. We also investigated the role of these motifs in activating Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), which has been implicated in RANKL-induced osteoclast survival. Motif 1, but not Motif 2 or Motif 3, is able to stimulate Akt/PKB activation. Because Akt/PKB has been shown to utilize distinct downstream effectors (glycogen synthase kinase-3β, FKHR/FOXO1a, BAD, and AFX/FOXO4) to regulate cell survival, we next determined which downstream effector(s) is activated by Akt/PKB to promote osteoclast survival. Our data revealed that RANKL only stimulates AFX/FOXO4 phosphorylation, indicating that AFX/FOXO4 is a key downstream target activated by Akt/PKB to modulate osteoclast survival. Taken together, we conclude that Motif 1 plays a predominant role in mediating osteoclast survival in part by activating Akt/PKB and its downstream effector AFX/FOXO4.

Moreover, it has also been established that RANKL plays an important role in stimulating osteoclast survival (10Fuller K. Wong B. Fox S. Choi Y. Chambers T.J. J. Exp.

Consistent with the notion, osteoprotegerin, the decoy receptor for RANKL, inhibits osteoclast survival (13Akatsu T. Murakami T. Nishikawa M. Ono K Shinomiya N. Tsuda E. Mochizuki S. Yamaguchi K.

RANKL exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in part by activating Akt/PKB through a signaling complex involving TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and c-Src (12Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In this model, RANKL induces TRAF6, c-Src, and RANK to form a trimer. Within this trimeric complex, TRAF6 induces the activation of c-Src, which in turn activates phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-kinase). The activated PI3-kinase then leads to the activation of Akt/PKB. It has become clear that Akt/PKB may utilize distinct downstream pathways (GSK3β, FKHR/FOXO1a, BAD, and AFX/FOXO4) to regulate cell survival (15Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). However, the precise downstream signaling pathway activated by Akt/PKB to regulate osteoclast survival has remained elusive. RANK belongs to the TNF receptor (TNFR) family (3Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar), and members of the TNFR family are characterized by lack of intrinsic enzymatic activity. As such, the TNFR family members transduce intracellular signals primarily by recruiting various adaptor proteins such as TRAF proteins through the specific motifs in their cytoplasmic domains (18Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum.

Recently, using a chimeric receptor approach, we identified three RANK cytoplasmic motifs (Motif 1, 369PFQEP373; Motif 2, 559PVQEET564; and Motif 3, 604PVQEQG609) regulating osteoclast formation and function (21Liu W.

In addition, we demonstrated that these three motifs activate different signaling pathways (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Motif 1 activates NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38, whereas Motif 2 triggers the activation of NF-κB and p38. In contrast, Motif 3 only activates NF-κB. However, the specific RANK cytoplasmic motifs and downstream signaling pathways involved in osteoclast survival have not been functionally identified. In the present study, we sought to elucidate functional RANK motifs that play a role in osteoclast survival. We have demonstrated that the three RANK motifs (Motif 1, 369PFQEP373; Motif 2, 559PVQEET564; and Motif 3, 604PVQEQG609) mediating osteoclast formation and function are also involved in modulating osteoclast survival. Moreover, although Motif 1 plays a minimal role in osteoclast formation and function (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol.

In addition, we investigated which downstream effector(s) is activated by Akt/PKB to promote osteoclast survival, and our data indicate that AFX/FOXO4 is the key downstream effector activated by Akt/PKB to modulate osteoclast survival. Chemicals and Reagents—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Blasticidin was from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Recombinant mouse TNF-α (410-TRNC-050) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.

Retrovirus was prepared using Plat-E packaging cells (22Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Plat-E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum as described in Ref. 22Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T.

Virus supernatant was collected at 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection. Culturing and Infection of Bone Marrow Macrophages (BMMs)—Bone marrow cells were isolated from long bones of 4–8-week-old TNFR1-/-R2-/- double knock-out mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) or wild-type mice (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN) as described (23Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K. Boyer M.I. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). BMMs were prepared by culturing isolated bone marrow cells in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant of monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-producing cells for 2 days as previously described (24Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cells were then infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of 0.1 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells and 8 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were further cultured in the presence of M-CSF and 2 μg/ml puromycin for selection and expansion of transduced cells. Selected cells were subsequently used for various studies. In Vitro Osteoclast Survival Assay—Retrovirally infected BMMs were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (1 × 105 cells/well) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the presence of 0.01 volume of culture supernatant of M-CSF-producing cells (final M-CSF concentration is 22 ng/ml) and 100 ng of glutathione S-transferase-RANKL (25Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) for 4 days to stimulate osteoclast formation. After osteoclasts were formed, the cultures were treated with different factors as indicated in individual assays and then continued for 14 more hours. The cultures were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity using a commercial kit (387-A; Sigma). Survived osteoclasts were determined as those cells with strong tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, more than three nuclei, and intact plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence Assays—Osteoclast apoptosis was assessed by determining distribution of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflets of the plasma membrane using an Annexin V-FITC fluorescence kit from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The assay was performed basically according to the instruction manual. The stained osteoclasts were viewed and documented using an Olympus IX70 inverted fluorescence microscope. Western Analysis—BMMs infected with retrovirus were cultured in serum-free α-minimal essential medium in the absence of M-CSF for 16 h before treatment with TNF-α for various times as indicated in individual experiments. For assays involving osteoclasts, BMMs were treated with M-CSF (22 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 4 days to stimulate osteoclast formation. After osteoclasts were formed, the cultures were treated with PBS or RANKL for 2 or 5 h. Infected BMMs or mature osteoclasts were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 1 (P-2850; Sigma) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture 2 (P-5726; Sigma). 40 μg of cell lysates were boiled in the presence of SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) for 5 min and loaded for electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (catalogue number 162–0147) from Bio-Rad using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding and then washed three times with TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in TBS-T containing 5% bovine albumin (A-7030; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Membranes were washed extensively, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection assay was performed using the SuperSignal West Dura kit from Pierce. The Chimeric Receptor Approach Permits the Investigation of RANK Signaling Involved in Osteoclast Survival—Previously we developed a chimeric receptor approach for delineating functional motifs in the RANK cytoplasmic domain mediating osteoclast differentiation and function (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The chimeric receptor consists of mouse TNFR1 external domain linked to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse RANK. The wild-type chimeric receptor in which no mutation is introduced in the RANK cytoplasmic domain was designated as WT (Fig. 1A). When expressed in osteoclast precursors (namely, BMMs) derived from TNFR1 and R2 double knock-out mice (TNFR1-/-R2-/-), WT was capable of modulating osteoclast differentiation and function in response to TNF-α as a surrogate (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, numerous mutant chimeric receptors were prepared in the previous study (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The RANK cytoplasmic domain contains six putative TRAF binding motifs (PTM1-PTM6). In W1-W6, all PTMs except one are mutated. In P1–6, all PTMs are mutated (Fig. 1A). Using these mutants, we successfully identified three functional RANK motifs that regulate osteoclast formation and function (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we reason that these mutants can also serve as useful tools for elucidating RANK motifs involved in osteoclast survival in the current study. To investigate the role of the six PTMs in osteoclast survival, we need to obtain mature osteoclasts expressing the six mutants (W1-W6). However, the previous study revealed that whereas W3, W5, and W6 can partially promote osteoclast formation, W1, W2, and W4 are incapable of mediating osteoclast formation (Fig. 1B) (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fortunately, the chimeric receptor approach possesses a unique “switch” feature that allows us to overcome the problem. As shown in Fig. 1C, infected BMMs not only express a chimeric receptor but also retain endogenous RANK. As a result, infected BMMs may be treated with RANKL and M-CSF to stimulate osteoclast formation. Once osteoclasts are formed, M-CSF and RANKL are removed and the cultures are treated with TNF-α alone to assess the impact of the expressed chimeric receptor on osteoclast survival (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the chimeric receptor approach indeed has the switch feature and whether RANK motifs mediating osteoclast survival are among the six PTMs, uninfected BMMs and infected BMMs expressing WT or P1–6 were treated with M-CSF (22 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) to stimulate osteoclast formation (Fig. 2A). Four days later, osteoclasts were formed. A representative osteoclast culture is shown in Fig. 2A, top panel. Then, M-CSF and RANKL were removed, and the cultures were treated with vehicle (PBS), M-CSF, RANKL, or TNF-α for 14 h (Fig. 2A). As expected, osteoclasts expressing wild-type chimera (WT) survived in response to M-CSF or RANKL; more importantly, these cells also survived in response to TNF-α. As negative control, osteoclasts derived from uninfected BMMs failed to survive in response to TNF-α. These data indicate that the chimeric receptor approach does possess the unique switch feature. In addition, although osteoclasts expressing WT survived with stimulation of TNF-α, those expressing P1–6 failed to do so, indicating that RANK motifs mediating osteoclast survival are indeed among the six PTMs. Fig. 2B shows the quantification of the data in Fig. 2A. Identification of Three Functional RANK Motifs Mediating Osteoclast Survival—To identify the functional RANK cytoplasmic motifs, we repeated the osteoclast survival assay shown in Fig. 2 with mutant chimeras W1-W6. We also used WT as positive control and P1–6 as negative control. In these assays, after the removal of M-CSF and RANKL, osteoclast cultures were treated with either PBS or TNF-α for 14 h. As shown in Fig. 3A, whereas W1, W2, and W4 failed to promote osteoclast survival, W3, W5, and W6 were able to mediate osteoclast survival. The data shown in Fig. 3A are quantified in Fig. 3B. The survival assays also showed that the potency of these motifs in promoting osteoclast survival is in the order of W3 >W5 >W6. As shown in Fig. 1A, in W3 all PTMs except PTM3 are mutated. Similarly, in W5 and W6 all PTMs except PTM3 and PTM5 are mutated, respectively. To further investigate the role of these mutants in osteoclast survival, we examined and compared the apoptosis rate of osteoclasts expressing the different chimeric receptor mutants by determining distribution of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflets of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). These assays indicate that osteoclasts expressing W1, W2, and W3 undergo extensive apoptosis, whereas those expressing W5 and W6 show some degree of apoptosis. In contrast, cells expressing W3 barely exhibit any distribution of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflets of the plasma membrane. Taken together, we conclude that we have identified PTM3, PTM5, and PTM6 as functional motifs capable of promoting osteoclast survival. To be consistent with our previous study (21Liu W. Xu D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we renamed PTM3, PTM5, and PTM6 as Motif 1 (369PFQEP373), Motif 2 (559PVQEET564), and Motif 3 (604PVQEQG609), respectively.FIGURE 4The apoptosis rate of osteoclasts expressing the different chimeric receptor mutants. BMMs expressing WT or different mutants (W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, or P1–6) were treated with M-CSF (22 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 4 days to promote osteoclast formation. Once osteoclasts formed, the cultures were continued with TNF-α for 8 h. These cultures were then subject to immunofluorescence staining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The top panel is representative of osteoclast cultures right after 4 days of M-CSF/RANKL treatment. Those in the lower panel are cultures continued with TNFα for a further 8 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate that these three RANK motifs play functional roles in osteoclast survival, we repeated the osteoclast survival assay with the mutant chimeric receptors called P3, P5, and P6 (21Liu W.

In P3, PTM3 (Motif 1) is mutated. In P5, PTM5 (Motif 2) is mutated. In P6, PTM6 (Motif 3) is mutated. Fig. 5A shows osteoclast cultures obtained from the survival assays, and the data are quantified in Fig. 5B. Consistent with the notion that PTM3 (Motif 1) plays a predominant role in modulating osteoclast survival, P3 exhibited very low capacity in modulating osteoclast survival. In contrast, P5 and P6 still demonstrated considerable ability to mediate osteoclast survival, revealing that PMT5 (Motif 2) and PTM6 (Motif 3) are less potent than PTM3 (Motif 1) in mediating osteoclast survival. PTM3 (Motif 1), but Not PTM5 (Motif 2) or PTM6 (Motif 3), Activates the Akt/PKB Pathway to Promote Osteoclast Survival—RANK has been shown to be able to activate six major pathways: NF-κB, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, Akt/PKB, and NFATc1 (26Feng X. Gene. 2005; 350: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Among these distinct pathways, NF-κB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt/PKB are capable of modulating osteoclast survival (12Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M.

In accord with their ability to promote osteoclast survival, PTM3 (Motif 1) has been shown to be able to activate NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, whereas PTM5 (Motif 2) and PTM6 (Motif 3) are able to activate NF-κB (21Liu W.

Because RANK also activates Akt/PKB pathway (12Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 28Lee S.E. Chung W.J. Kwak H.B. Chung C.H. Kwack K.B. Lee Z.H. Kim H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49343-49349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the question is whether these three functional RANK motifs are able to activate the Akt/PKB pathway. To address this issue, we performed Western analysis with an antibody against phosphorylated Akt/PKB as previously described (21Liu W. Xu D. Yang H. Xu H. Shi Z. Cao X. Takeshita S. Liu J. Teale M. Feng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54759-54769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). First, we infected TNFR1-/-R2-/- BMMs with virus encoding either the wild-type chimera or the mutant P1–6. Infected cells were then treated with TNF-α for various times, and the activation of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway was determined by Western analysis (Fig. 6A). Whereas the wild-type chimera induced the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB with 15- and 30-min treatments (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3), P1–6 mutant failed to do so (lanes 4–6), indicating that some of the six PTMs are implicated in activation of the Akt/PKB pathway. Next, we determined which PTM activates Akt/PKB by repeating Western analysis with W3, W5, and W6 mutants. As shown in Fig. 6B, whereas W3 induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation with 15- and 30-min treatments (lanes 1–3), W5 and W6 failed to do so (lanes 4–9), revealing that only PTM3 (Motif 1) is able to activate the Akt pathway. The assays above were performed with BMMs, which are osteoclast precursors. To further support a functional role for Akt/PKB in osteoclast survival, it is important to determine whether Akt/PKB is activated by RANKL in mature osteoclasts by repeating the"

https://openalex.org/W2001093729,"We have isolated spontaneous mutants of polyoma virus middle T-antigen (PyMT) that do not activate the ARF-p53 pathway based on their inability to block REF52 cell division. The REF52 cells containing these mutants have a flat untransformed morphological phenotype and do not express the ARF protein. The PyMT mutations in the different cell isolates so far analysed occur at a mutational hotspot in the PyMT sequence between nucleotides 1241 and 1249, which contains nine consecutive cytosines. In one set of mutants a single cytosine was deleted, while in another mutant set an additional cytosine was inserted. Both these mutations result in frameshifts, generating altered PyMT proteins containing amino-acid sequences derived from each of the two other alternative reading frames of the polyoma virus early region. Both types of mutations result in the loss of the C-terminal PyMT region containing the membrane-binding hydrophobic region and result is mislocalization of the PyMT mutant proteins. Revertant wild-type PyMT (containing nine cytosines) was easily detected in transformants generated after infection of REF52 cells expressing high amounts of dominant negative p53 with retroviruses containing either mutation. We demonstrate that wild-type PyMT revertants are derived from mutations in the hotspot sequence of the integrated mutant PyMT sequences."
