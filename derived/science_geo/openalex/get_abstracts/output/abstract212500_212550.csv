https://openalex.org/W2093886487,"A NUMBER of insects of different orders have been reported swarming near various sources of fire and smoke, although the families Buprestidae (Coleoptera), Platy-pezidae and Empididae (Diptera) have received the greatest attention. The most well-known insect associated with fires, however, is a species of Buprestid, Melanophila acuminata, which has been reported as being attracted over long distances to a variety of burning materials such as wood, oil, mill refuse, smelter products and trash in refuse dumps1,2. Other species of Melanophila (consputaLec., notata Cast, et Gory, coriacea Kerr. and ignicola Champion) have similar habits3–6."

Speeds in excess of 45 km/h are included in this suspect category. Walters3 showed that certain morphological features indicate that scombroid fishes may attain velocities of 10 body-lengths/sec, and the large species should be able to attain maximum speeds considerably in excess of 45 km/h."

https://openalex.org/W1991860214,"IT has been found that a Carboxypeptidase (or a mixture of various carboxypeptidases) occurs in the peel of citrus fruit, for example, of the orange (Citrus sinensis), lemon (Citrus medica), and grapefruit (Citrus maxima). This peptidase differs in specificity and in other properties from the known carboxypeptidases A (ref. 1) and B (ref. 2) of the pancreas and from the catheptic Carboxypeptidase of brain3. This citrus peptidase or enzyme mixture, referred to for short as Carboxypeptidase C, is the first Carboxypeptidase to be demonstrated in vegetable tissue. CarboxypeptidaseC belongs to the catheptic peptidases—a group which, if we extend and re-define the term ‘cathep-sin’, can also be said to include the glycyl–glycine–dipeptidase4 and leucinaminopeptidase5 found in leaves."

https://openalex.org/W1976084607,"PREVIOUS investigations have shown that according to their modal DNA content uterine and other tumours in man fall into two fairly discrete ploidy-groups1,2, and follow-up investigations in patients with uterine tumours suggest that the ploidy-group may be of prognostic significance3,4. From the size of the nuclei in histological sections of carcinoma of the cervix, it has been possible to make a correct estimate of the ploidy-group of the tumour in the majority of cases ; based on a large series of sections, 50 per cent of tumours were found to have predominantly small nuclei (corresponding to a near-diploid DNA content) and 50 per cent predominantly large nuclei (corresponding to a near-tetraploid DNA content)5. It would appear that a study of nuclear size in conditions commonly regarded as precursors of malignant disease in the cervix uteri might be of interest, and could possibly throw light on the relationship between the chromosomal changes, which appear to be a constant feature (though variable in extent) of human malignancy, and the apparently stepwise transformation of normal to malignant cervical epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1998201653,"THE recent proposals1,2 of structures for aflatoxin B1 (I and II), the biologically active3,4 metabolite of Aspergillus flavus, prompt consideration of its biogenesis. It is the purpose of this communication to show that of the two modes of forming carbon skeletons summarized in the Acetate and Isoprene Rules the former does not lead to a simple hypothesis in spite of the suggestive pattern of oxygen substituents on ring C and the β (or δ) keto-acyl group of rings D and E."

https://openalex.org/W2083236301,"THE intensity of sound transmitted from the ear drum to the inner ear can be attenuated by contraction of the middle ear muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius. These muscles contract at the onset of sound, thereby reducing the size of cochlear microphonics as recorded at the round window. Previous explanations of middle ear muscle activity have only considered possible acoustic functions1–4. However, in waking, unrestrained cats, we have found middle ear muscle activity related to non-acoustic factors, for example, bodily movement and vocalization. In animals that we have experimentally deafened by crushing both eight nerves, non-acoustic contractions persist in association with bodily movement and vocalization. In these animals all acoustic middle ear muscle activity is absent, the neural component is absent from the cochlear response recorded at the round window, and they show no behavioural reaction to loud sounds."

https://openalex.org/W1981857332,"IN normally monœcious melons (bearing both male and female flowers) the occurrence of andromonœcious (mostly staminate with fewer perfect flowers), hermaphroditic (all perfect flowers), and even gynomonœcious (mostly pistillate with fewer staminate or perfect flowers) plants have been reported1. The latter type would be of considerable value in genetic work. Previous attempts to establish genotypically pure female lines have failed owing to the difficulty of obtaining pollen for inbreeding. In the recorded work here, it is reported that grafting of a gynomonœcious scion to selected andromonœcious understocks will temporarily induce formation of male flowers on the gynomonœcious scion."
https://openalex.org/W2020194558,"AMINOACETONITRILE partially protects the liver of the rat from necrosis observed in this organ 24 h after administration of dimethylnitrosamine1. In the experiments recorded here the effect of aminoacetonitrile was examined on one of the early lesions produced by dimethylnitrosamine in the rat liver, which consists of the inhibition of the protein synthesis2. This lesion is already detectable 3 h after administration of dimethylnitrosamine when the morphological lesions, observable under the light microscope, are missing or are scarcely noticeable2."

https://openalex.org/W1979616303,"J. F. A. P. MILLER has described1 the role of thymus in the development of a normal immune system. J. F. A. P. Miller and his colleagues have shown also the influence of thymectomy on the induction of 3,4-benzpyrene skin cancer in mice2. Moreover, I have shown that homograft of neonatal thymus has an inhibiting influence on the incidence of 20-methylcholanthrene (MC) skin cancer in mice of the L strain3. In these experiments the differences in incidence of induced cancer up to the 120 days after the beginning of the experiment between the control group of animals and the animals repeatedly grafted of neonatal thymus during the whole course of the experiment were significant."

The successful use of potassium tellurite as a bacteriostatic agent1 in the pure isolation of representative aquatic fungi from the orders Blasto-cladiales, Chytridiales4 and Saprolegniales, using material direct from Nature which was sometimes highly contaminated with bacteria, suggested that algae might also respond to this treatment ; and the promising results obtained are reported in this communication."

https://openalex.org/W2088665810,"IT is now well established that the sedative action of reserpine is closely associated with loss of noradrenaline and disappearance of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) in the brain1–3. However, those amines the lack of which is responsible for the sedative action of reserpine are as yet unknown. If lack of amines were responsible for the tranquillizing effects of reserpine, then the administration of amines should counteract these effects. However, there is the blood-brain barrier to amines. There are two ways of bringing about an increase in amine content of the brain: one is the administration of the precursors of the amines, the other is the central administration of them. Intraperitoneal injection of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, a precursor of catecholamine, produced complete counteraction of the reserpine action; on the other hand, the injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan, a precursor of 5HT, did not4. This supports the assumption that lack of catecholamine in the brain is responsible for the sedative action of reserpine."

https://openalex.org/W2060394889,THE mechanisms involved in the termination of immunologioal tolerance are still obscure. Basic to the understanding of this phenomenon is an evaluation of the degree to which the immune capacity of the previously tolerant animal has returned to normal. Such information would also be necessary in comparing the results obtained in the termination of the tolerant state produced under a diversity of experimental situations.
