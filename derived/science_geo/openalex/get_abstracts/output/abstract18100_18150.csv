https://openalex.org/W2007256938,"Two new technologies have made the study of proteins by mass spectrometry straight-forward. Proteins with molecular masses of up to more than 100 kilodaltons can be analyzed at picomole sensitivities to give simple mass spectra corresponding to the intact molecule. This development has allowed unprecedented accuracy in the determination of the molecular weights of proteins. A number of ""case studies"" are used to present the revolutionary impact that these powerful new ways of looking at proteins are having on biological research."

https://openalex.org/W1973173532,"The candidate oncogene bcl-3 was discovered as a translocation into the immunoglobulin alpha-locus in some cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemias. The protein Bcl-3 contains seven so-called ankyrin repeats. Similar repeat motifs are found in a number of diverse regulatory proteins but the motifs of Bcl-3 are most closely related to those found in I kappa B proteins in which the ankyrin repeat domain is thought to be directly involved in inhibition of NF-kappa B activity. No biological function has yet been described for Bcl-3, but it was noted recently that Bcl-3 interferes with DNA-binding of the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B in vitro. Here we demonstrate that Bcl-3 can aid kappa B site-dependent transcription in vivo by counteracting the inhibitory effects of p50/NF-kappa B homodimers. Bcl-3 may therefore aid activation of select NF-kappa B-regulated genes, including those of the human immunodeficiency virus."

https://openalex.org/W24457209,"Bronchial epithelial dysplasia is believed to precede invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Six paired dysplasia and tumour samples were distinguished histologically in sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue from patients with lung cancer. Additionally, samples of dysplastic bronchial epithelium were obtained from patients without lung tumours. Microdissection of the unstained sections provided dysplastic and tumour samples from which DNA was prepared for comparison with the patients' constitutional genotype, using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All six samples of tumour and the paired adjacent samples of bronchial dysplasia showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci on the short arm of chromosome 3. Five of the six cases showed involvement of the p53 gene as assessed by LOH at the AccII site within the gene, and by immunoreactivity to CM-1, an antibody which recognizes the mutated form of the p53 protein in paraffin-embedded material. Of the dysplastic samples, obtained from patients without invasive tumours, all three showed LOH at 3p; one sample showed LOH at the AccII polymorphic locus within the p53 gene, and another sample, uninformative at this locus, stained positively with this antibody. These results indicate that somatic genetic changes are present in preinvasive lesions in the bronchus."
