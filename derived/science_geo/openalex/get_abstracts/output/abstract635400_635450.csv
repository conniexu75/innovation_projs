https://openalex.org/W2954124637,"A neuronal population encodes information most efficiently when its stimulus responses are high-dimensional and uncorrelated, and most robustly when they are lower-dimensional and correlated. Here we analysed the dimensionality of the encoding of natural images by large populations of neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice. The evoked population activity was high-dimensional, and correlations obeyed an unexpected power law: the nth principal component variance scaled as 1/n. This scaling was not inherited from the power law spectrum of natural images, because it persisted after stimulus whitening. We proved mathematically that if the variance spectrum was to decay more slowly then the population code could not be smooth, allowing small changes in input to dominate population activity. The theory also predicts larger power-law exponents for lower-dimensional stimulus ensembles, which we validated experimentally. These results suggest that coding smoothness may represent a fundamental constraint that determines correlations in neural population codes."

https://openalex.org/W2953700900,"Nucleation plays a critical role in many physical and biological phenomena that range from crystallization, melting and evaporation to the formation of clouds and the initiation of neurodegenerative diseases1–3. However, nucleation is a challenging process to study experimentally, especially in its early stages, when several atoms or molecules start to form a new phase from a parent phase. A number of experimental and computational methods have been used to investigate nucleation processes4–17, but experimental determination of the three-dimensional atomic structure and the dynamics of early-stage nuclei has been unachievable. Here we use atomic electron tomography to study early-stage nucleation in four dimensions (that is, including time) at atomic resolution. Using FePt nanoparticles as a model system, we find that early-stage nuclei are irregularly shaped, each has a core of one to a few atoms with the maximum order parameter, and the order parameter gradient points from the core to the boundary of the nucleus. We capture the structure and dynamics of the same nuclei undergoing growth, fluctuation, dissolution, merging and/or division, which are regulated by the order parameter distribution and its gradient. These experimental observations are corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation in liquid–solid phase transitions of Pt. Our experimental and molecular dynamics results indicate that a theory beyond classical nucleation theory1,2,18 is needed to describe early-stage nucleation at the atomic scale. We anticipate that the reported approach will open the door to the study of many fundamental problems in materials science, nanoscience, condensed matter physics and chemistry, such as phase transition, atomic diffusion, grain boundary dynamics, interface motion, defect dynamics and surface reconstruction with four-dimensional atomic resolution. Atomic electron tomography captures crystal nucleation in four dimensions in FePt nanoparticles, with the observed early-stage nucleation not consistent with classical nucleation theory."
https://openalex.org/W2953483328,"Although many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in human and other mammalian genomes, there has been limited systematic functional characterization of these elements. In particular, the contribution of lncRNAs to organ development remains largely unexplored. Here we analyse the expression patterns of lncRNAs across developmental time points in seven major organs, from early organogenesis to adulthood, in seven species (human, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, rabbit, opossum and chicken). Our analyses identified approximately 15,000 to 35,000 candidate lncRNAs in each species, most of which show species specificity. We characterized the expression patterns of lncRNAs across developmental stages, and found many with dynamic expression patterns across time that show signatures of enrichment for functionality. During development, there is a transition from broadly expressed and conserved lncRNAs towards an increasing number of lineage- and organ-specific lncRNAs. Our study provides a resource of candidate lncRNAs and their patterns of expression and evolutionary conservation across mammalian organ development."
https://openalex.org/W2956111241,"The enigmatic coupling between electronic and magnetic phenomena was one of the riddles propelling the development of modern electromagnetism. Today, the fully controlled electric field evolution of ultrashort laser pulses permits the direct and ultrafast control of electronic properties of matter and is the cornerstone of light-wave electronics. In sharp contrast, because there is no first order interaction between light and spins, the magnetic properties of matter can only be affected indirectly on the much slower tens-of-femtosecond timescale in a sequence of optical excitation followed by the rearrangement of the spin structure. Here we record an orders of magnitude faster magnetic switching with sub-femtosecond response time by initiating optical excitations with near-single-cycle laser pulses in a ferromagnetic layer stack. The unfolding dynamics are tracked in real-time by a novel attosecond time-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (atto-MCD) detection scheme revealing optically induced spin and orbital momentum transfer (OISTR) in synchrony with light field driven charge relocation. In tandem with ab-initio quantum dynamical modelling, we show how this mechanism provides simultaneous control over electronic and magnetic properties that are at the heart of spintronic functionality. This first incarnation of attomagnetism observes light field coherent control of spin-dynamics in the initial non-dissipative temporal regime and paves the way towards coherent spintronic applications with Petahertz clock rates."
https://openalex.org/W2955719861,"Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) is a pioneer transcription factor that is essential for the normal development of several endoderm-derived organs, including the prostate gland1,2. FOXA1 is frequently mutated in hormone-receptor-driven prostate, breast, bladder and salivary-gland tumours3-8. However, it is unclear how FOXA1 alterations affect the development of cancer, and FOXA1 has previously been ascribed both tumour-suppressive9-11 and oncogenic12-14 roles. Here we assemble an aggregate cohort of 1,546 prostate cancers and show that FOXA1 alterations fall into three structural classes that diverge in clinical incidence and genetic co-alteration profiles, with a collective prevalence of 35%. Class-1 activating mutations originate in early prostate cancer without alterations in ETS or SPOP, selectively recur within the wing-2 region of the DNA-binding forkhead domain, enable enhanced chromatin mobility and binding frequency, and strongly transactivate a luminal androgen-receptor program of prostate oncogenesis. By contrast, class-2 activating mutations are acquired in metastatic prostate cancers, truncate the C-terminal domain of FOXA1, enable dominant chromatin binding by increasing DNA affinity and-through TLE3 inactivation-promote metastasis driven by the WNT pathway. Finally, class-3 genomic rearrangements are enriched in metastatic prostate cancers, consist of duplications and translocations within the FOXA1 locus, and structurally reposition a conserved regulatory element-herein denoted FOXA1 mastermind (FOXMIND)-to drive overexpression of FOXA1 or other oncogenes. Our study reaffirms the central role of FOXA1 in mediating oncogenesis driven by the androgen receptor, and provides mechanistic insights into how the classes of FOXA1 alteration promote the initiation and/or metastatic progression of prostate cancer. These results have direct implications for understanding the pathobiology of other hormone-receptor-driven cancers and rationalize the co-targeting of FOXA1 activity in therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2955039931,"Mutations in the transcription factor FOXA1 define a unique subset of prostate cancers but the functional consequences of these mutations and whether they confer gain or loss of function is unknown1-9. Here, by annotating the landscape of FOXA1 mutations from 3,086 human prostate cancers, we define two hotspots in the forkhead domain: Wing2 (around 50% of all mutations) and the highly conserved DNA-contact residue R219 (around 5% of all mutations). Wing2 mutations are detected in adenocarcinomas at all stages, whereas R219 mutations are enriched in metastatic tumours with neuroendocrine histology. Interrogation of the biological properties of wild-type FOXA1 and fourteen FOXA1 mutants reveals gain of function in mouse prostate organoid proliferation assays. Twelve of these mutants, as well as wild-type FOXA1, promoted an exaggerated pro-luminal differentiation program, whereas two different R219 mutants blocked luminal differentiation and activated a mesenchymal and neuroendocrine transcriptional program. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of wild-type FOXA1 and representative Wing2 and R219 mutants revealed marked, mutant-specific changes in open chromatin at thousands of genomic loci and exposed sites of FOXA1 binding and associated increases in gene expression. Of note, ATAC-seq peaks in cells expressing R219 mutants lacked the canonical core FOXA1-binding motifs (GTAAAC/T) but were enriched for a related, non-canonical motif (GTAAAG/A), which was preferentially activated by R219-mutant FOXA1 in reporter assays. Thus, FOXA1 mutations alter its pioneering function and perturb normal luminal epithelial differentiation programs, providing further support for the role of lineage plasticity in cancer progression."

https://openalex.org/W3098989814,"Mechanical systems facilitate the development of a new generation of hybrid quantum technology comprising electrical, optical, atomic and acoustic degrees of freedom. Entanglement is the essential resource that defines this new paradigm of quantum enabled devices. Continuous variable (CV) entangled fields, known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, are spatially separated two-mode squeezed states that can be used to implement quantum teleportation and quantum communication. In the optical domain, EPR states are typically generated using nondegenerate optical amplifiers and at microwave frequencies Josephson circuits can serve as a nonlinear medium. It is an outstanding goal to deterministically generate and distribute entangled states with a mechanical oscillator. Here we observe stationary emission of path-entangled microwave radiation from a parametrically driven 30 micrometer long silicon nanostring oscillator, squeezing the joint field operators of two thermal modes by 3.40(37) dB below the vacuum level. This mechanical system correlates up to 50 photons/s/Hz giving rise to a quantum discord that is robust with respect to microwave noise. Such generalized quantum correlations of separable states are important for quantum enhanced detection and provide direct evidence for the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator without directly measuring its state. This noninvasive measurement scheme allows to infer information about otherwise inaccessible objects with potential implications in sensing, open system dynamics and fundamental tests of quantum gravity. In the near future, similar on-chip devices can be used to entangle subsystems on vastly different energy scales such as microwave and optical photons."
https://openalex.org/W2953549877,"High-quality genotypic data is a requirement for many genetic analyses. For any crop, errors in genotype calls, phasing of markers, linkage maps, pedigree records, and unnoticed variation in ploidy levels can lead to spurious marker-locus-trait associations and incorrect origin assignment of alleles to individuals. High-throughput genotyping requires automated scoring, as manual inspection of thousands of scored loci is too time-consuming. However, automated SNP scoring can result in errors that should be corrected to ensure recorded genotypic data are accurate and thereby ensure confidence in downstream genetic analyses. To enable quick identification of errors in a large genotypic data set, we have developed a comprehensive workflow. This multiple-step workflow is based on inheritance principles and on removal of markers and individuals that do not follow these principles, as demonstrated here for apple, peach, and sweet cherry. Genotypic data was obtained on pedigreed germplasm using 6-9K SNP arrays for each crop and a subset of well-performing SNPs was created using ASSIsT. Use of correct (and corrected) pedigree records readily identified violations of simple inheritance principles in the genotypic data, streamlined with FlexQTL software. Retained SNPs were grouped into haploblocks to increase the information content of single alleles and reduce computational power needed in downstream genetic analyses. Haploblock borders were defined by recombination locations detected in ancestral generations of cultivars and selections. Another round of inheritance-checking was conducted, for haploblock alleles (i.e., haplotypes). High-quality genotypic data sets were created using this workflow for pedigreed collections representing the U.S. breeding germplasm of apple, peach, and sweet cherry evaluated within the RosBREED project. These data sets contain 3855, 4005, and 1617 SNPs spread over 932, 103, and 196 haploblocks in apple, peach, and sweet cherry, respectively. The highly curated phased SNP and haplotype data sets, as well as the raw iScan data, of germplasm in the apple, peach, and sweet cherry Crop Reference Sets is available through the Genome Database for Rosaceae."
https://openalex.org/W2953419696,"Changes in the function and microbiome of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract have been documented in Parkinson’s disease (PD), although most studies have examined merely fecal microbiome profiles and patients with advanced disease states. In the present study we sought to identify sensitive and specific biomarkers of changes in the oral microbiome of early stage PD through shotgun metatranscriptomic profiling. We recruited 48 PD subjects and 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Subjects completed detailed assessments of motor, cognitive, balance, autonomic and chemosensory (smell and taste) functions to determine their disease stage. We also obtained a saliva sample for profiling of microbial RNA and host mRNA using next generation sequencing. We found no differences in overall alpha and beta diversity between subject groups. However, changes in specific microbial taxa were observed, including primarily bacteria, but also yeast and phage. Nearly half of our findings were consistent with prior studies in the field obtained through profiling of fecal samples, with others representing highly novel candidates for detection of early stage PD. Testing of the diagnostic utility of the microbiome data revealed potentially robust performance with as few as 11 taxonomic features achieving a cross-validated area under the ROC curve of 0.90 and overall accuracy of 84.5%. Bioinformatic analysis of 167 different metabolic pathways supported shifts in a small set of distinct pathways involved in amino acid and energy metabolism among the organisms comprising the oral microbiome. In parallel with the microbial analysis, we also examined the evidence for changes in human salivary mRNAs in the same subjects. This revealed significant changes in a set of 9 host mRNAs, several of which mapped to various brain functions and showed correlations with some of the significantly changed microbial taxa. Unexpectedly, we also observed robust correlations between many of the microbiota and functional measures, including those reflecting cognition, balance, and disease duration. These results suggest that the oral microbiome may represent a highly-accessible and informative microenvironment that offers new insights in the pathophysiology of early stage PD."
https://openalex.org/W2954138707,"Various models and datasets related to aflatoxins in the maize and dairy production chain have been developed and used but they have not yet been linked with each other. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change on aflatoxin B1 production in maize and its consequences on aflatoxin M1 contamination in dairy cow’s milk, using a full chain modelling approach. To this end, available models and input data were chained together in a modelling framework. As a case study, we focused on maize grown in Eastern Europe and imported to the Netherlands to be fed–as part of dairy cows’ compound feed–to dairy cows in the Netherlands. Three different climate models, one aflatoxin B1 prediction model and five different carryover models were used. For this particular case study of East European maize, most of the calculations suggest an increase (up to 50%) of maximum mean aflatoxin M1 in milk by 2030, except for one climate (DMI) model suggesting a decrease. Results from all combinations of carryover and climate models suggest a similar or slight increase (up to 0.6%) of the chance of finding aflatoxin M1 in milk above the EC limit of 0.05 μg/kg by 2030. Results varied mainly with the climate model data and carryover model considered. The model framework infrastructure is flexible so that forecasting models for other mycotoxins or other food safety hazards as well as other production chains, together with necessary input databases, can easily be included as well. This modelling framework for the first time links datasets and models related to aflatoxin B1 in maize and related aflatoxin M1 the dairy production chain to obtain a unique predictive methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation. Such an integrated approach with scenario analysis provides possibilities for policy makers and risk managers to study the effects of changes in the beginning of the chain on the end product."
https://openalex.org/W2953488643,"Bacteria occupy heterogeneous environments, attaching and growing within pores in materials, living hosts, and matrices like soil. Systems that permit high-resolution visualization of dynamic bacterial processes within the physical confines of a realistic and tractable porous media environment are rare. Here we use microfluidics to replicate the grain shape and packing density of natural sands in a 2D platform to study the flow-induced spatial evolution of bacterial biofilms underground. We discover that initial bacterial dispersal and grain attachment is influenced by bacterial transport across pore space velocity gradients, a phenomenon otherwise known as rheotaxis. We find that gravity-driven flow conditions activate different bacterial cell-clustering phenotypes depending on the strain's ability to product extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). A wildtype, biofilm-producing bacteria formed compact, multicellular patches while an EPS-defective mutant displayed a linked-cell phenotype in the presence of flow. These phenotypes subsequently influenced the overall spatial distribution of cells across the porous media network as colonies grew and altered the fluid dynamics of their microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2955176420,"Integration of trees in agroforestry systems can increase the system sustainability compared to monocultures. The resulting increase in system complexity is likely to affect soil-N cycling by altering soil microbial community structure and functions. Our study aimed to assess the abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in soil-N cycling in paired monoculture and agroforestry cropland in a Phaeozem soil, and paired open grassland and agroforestry grassland in Histosol and Anthrosol soils. The soil fungi-to-bacteria ratio was greater in the tree row than in the crop or grass rows of the monoculture cropland and open grassland in all soil types, possibly due to increased input of tree residues and the absence of tillage in the Phaeozem (cropland) soil. In the Phaeozem (cropland) soil, gene abundances of amoA indicated a niche differentiation between archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidizers that distinctly separated the influence of the tree row from the crop row and monoculture system. Abundances of nitrate (napA and narG), nitrite (nirK and nirS) and nitrous oxide reductase genes (nosZ clade I) were largely influenced by soil type rather than management system. The soil types’ effects were associated with their differences in soil organic C, total N and pH. Our findings show that in temperate regions, conversion of monoculture cropland and open grassland to agroforestry systems can alter the abundance of soil bacteria and fungi and soil-N-cycling genes, particularly genes involved in ammonium oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2954165813,"Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular tool to investigate accessibility to public facilities, in particular health care services. FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results."
https://openalex.org/W2955321591,"The prevalence of metabolic disorders, in particular obesity has dramatically increased worldwide. Genetic variants explain only a minor part of the obesity epidemic induced by physical inactivity and over-nutrition. Epidemiological studies in humans and animal models indicate that epigenetic changes associated with adverse parental and/or intrauterine factors may contribute to the missing heritability of metabolic disorders. Possible adverse paternal effects are likely transmitted by sperm to the next-generation. To investigate this hypothesis, we have systematically analyzed the effects of male body mass index (BMI) on sperm epigenome and its association with next-generation fetal cord blood (FCB) DNA methylation. Methylation levels of maternally imprinted (PEG1, PEG4, PEG5, and PEG10), paternally imprinted (H19-IG DMR, IGF2-DMR0, and MEG3-IG DMR) regions, and obesity-related non-imprinted HIF3A gene were quantified by bisulphite pyrosequencing in sperm samples of 294 human donors undergoing in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and in 113 FCBs of the resulting offspring. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that MEG3 intergenic differentially methylated region (IG DMR) showed positive correlation between sperm methylation and donor’s BMI. A gender-specific correlation between paternal BMI and FCB methylation was observed for MEG3-IG DMR, HIF3A, and IGF2-DMR0. The former two genes displayed same directional nominal association (as sperm) between paternal BMI and FCB methylation in male offspring. Hypomethylation of IGF2-DMR0 with increased paternal BMI was observed in FCBs from female offsprings. Our results suggest that male obesity is nominally associated with modification of sperm DNA methylome in humans, which may affect the epigenome of the next-generation. Nevertheless, it is important to note that none of the associated p-values survived multiple testing adjustments. Future work should test the effect of associated methylation aberrations in the offspring as DNA methylation was shown to control expression and/or imprint establishment across the studied genes."
https://openalex.org/W2955327667,"Introduction This population-based study aimed to fill the knowledge gap on Human Papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and associated sociodemographic risk factors of the general population in the North Tongu District, Ghana. These results are needed to guide cervical cancer prevention efforts, as the leading type of female cancers. Methods A cross-sectional study including 2002 women in the North Tongu District, Ghana investigated HPV prevalence and associated sociodemographic risk factors. Women were recruited by geographical distribution through the local community-based health system and samples collected using a self-sampling device. For HPV genotyping BSGP5+/6+-PCR with Luminex-MPG readout was used. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed sociodemographic risk factors for HPV positivity. Results Of 2002 self-collected samples, 1943 were eligible, contained sufficient DNA and provided valid HPV genotyping results. Prevalence of single high risk HPV types was 32.3% and of multiple high risk types 9.7%. The five most common detected HPV types were HPV16 (7.4%; 95%CI: 6.3–8.7), HPV52 (7.2%; 95%CI: 6.1–8.5), HPV35 (4.8%; 95%CI: 3.9–5.8), HPV59 (4.7%; 95%CI: 3.8–5.8), HPV56 (3.9%; 95%CI: 3.1–4.8). Highest prevalence was observed among women aged 18–24 years, while age 25–54 years was inversely associated with high risk HPV positivity in multivariate analysis. Sociodemographic risk factors identified were i) having any sexual partner, ii) more partners increased the odds for high risk HPV positivity, iii) independently from this marital status, in particular not being married. Discussion & conclusion Most importantly, the high risk HPV prevalence detected from this study is higher than estimates reported for Western Africa. This needs be considered, when deciding on the cervical cancer screening algorithms introduced on a wider scale. Follow-up and triage, depending on the methods chosen, can easily overburden the health system. Self-sampling worked well and provided adequate samples for HPV-based screening. Women with increasing number of sexual partners and not being married were found to have higher odds of being high risk HPV positive, therefore could be a higher prioritized screening target group."
https://openalex.org/W2955335560,"Background High-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) atherogenic traits can describe the role of both particles on cardiovascular diseases more accurately than HDL- or LDL-cholesterol levels. However, it is unclear how these lipoprotein properties are particularly affected by different cardiovascular risk factors. Objective To determine which lipoprotein properties are associated with greater cardiovascular risk scores and each cardiovascular risk factor. Methods In two cross-sectional baseline samples of PREDIMED trial volunteers, we assessed the associations of HDL functionality (N = 296) and LDL atherogenicity traits (N = 210) with: 1) the 10-year predicted coronary risk (according to the Framingham-REGICOR score), and 2) classical cardiovascular risk factors. Results Greater cardiovascular risk scores were associated with low cholesterol efflux values; oxidized, triglyceride-rich, small HDL particles; and small LDLs with low resistance against oxidation (P-trend<0.05, all). After adjusting for the rest of risk factors; 1) type-2 diabetic individuals presented smaller and more oxidized LDLs (P<0.026, all); 2) dyslipidemic participants had smaller HDLs with an impaired capacity to metabolize cholesterol (P<0.035, all); 3) high body mass index values were associated to lower HDL and LDL size and a lower HDL capacity to esterify cholesterol (P<0.037, all); 4) men presented a greater HDL oxidation and lower HDL vasodilatory capacity (P<0.046, all); and 5) greater ages were related to small, oxidized, cytotoxic LDL particles (P<0.037, all). Conclusions Dysfunctional HDL and atherogenic LDL particles are present in high cardiovascular risk patients. Dyslipidemia and male sex are predominantly linked to HDL dysfunctionality, whilst diabetes and advanced age are associated with LDL atherogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2955956765,"Edible insect rearing could provide one alternative for protein production by having a smaller environmental impact than traditional livestock farming due to insects’ ability to convert organic side streams. Currently, the insect rearing industry utilizes soybeans as a major source of protein in the feeds. Protein-rich by-products of food industry could be used to replace them in insect feeds, but it is not known if they also meet the insects’ nutritional requirements. Our study evaluated the growth performance of two widely used edible cricket species, Acheta domesticus and Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), on 18 experimental diets. The experimental diets included commercial chicken feeds and cricket diets, where soybean was partly and completely replaced with by-products from food industry: potato protein, barley mash, barley feed, compressed leftover of turnip rape and mix of broad bean and pea on three levels of protein. We found that the high- and medium-protein turnip rape and barley mash diets produced the highest yield and an increase in all performance variables. Overall, the high- and medium-protein diets produced the highest yield, growth and fastest development. Our results showed that by-products of food industry could be utilized as a part of the cricket feeds and thus advance the goals of circular economy."
https://openalex.org/W2955258500,"Trypsin is by far the most commonly used protease in proteomics. Even though the amount of protease used in each experiment is very small, digestion of large amounts of protein prior to enrichment can be rather costly. The price of commercial trypsin is highly dependent on the quality of the enzyme, which is determined by its purity, activity, and chemical modifications. In this study we evaluated several strategies for improving the quality of crude trypsin by reductive methylation and affinity purification. We present a protocol applicable to most proteomics laboratories for obtaining a highly stable and pure trypsin preparation using reductive methylation and purification by benzamidine-sepharose. The entire workflow can be performed within a day and yields ~4 mg per batch but is completely scalable. The methylated product was benchmarked against sequencing grade trypsin from Promega and they were found to be comparable for one hour digestions at elevated temperatures, where residual chymotryptic activity was found to be negligible."
https://openalex.org/W2954119306,"Despite the ability to induce a broad range of cross protection, M2e5x virus-like particles (VLPs) alone provide limited vaccine efficacy and confer low efficacy of protection against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection in chickens. Avian influenza hemagglutinin (HA) has been a major antigenic target that enhances humoral immunity, but the efficacy of avian HA-based vaccines against HPAIV needs to be further improved. In this study, we evaluated the vaccine efficacy induced by combination of conserved tandem repeat M2e5x VLPs and HA VLPs against an avian influenza virus. We found that combinatorial vaccine elicited higher levels of reassortant H5N1 (rgH5N1) virus-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA antibody responses compared to M2e5x VLPs in sera and lungs of mice. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination induced higher levels of CD8+ T cell and germinal center B cell responses in lung and spleen compared to M2e5x VLPs. Combinatorial VLPs vaccination showed significantly reduced inflammatory responses and lung viral loads upon rgH5N1 virus challenge infection, resulting in less body weight loss compared to M2e5x VLPs alone. These results indicate that immune responses to both M2e and HA might provide a strategy of vaccination inducing enhanced protection against avian influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W2954832298,"Due to higher temperatures and lower water availability, climate change is likely to have a major impact on walnut production in the near future. Climate change will alter the land suitability for walnut cultivation around the world, especially in arid and semi-arid regions like Iran. Here, land suitability for the cultivation of walnut (Juglans regia L.) in Iran was determined using the GIS for present and future conditions (2020-2049) with an approach to climate change. Accordingly, data from 375 synoptic stations throughout Iran were gathered for climatic factors including average, minimum and maximum temperatures, relative humidity and chilling requirement. Also, ASTER sensors (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) and their data provided this research with cells that make a precision of 150 m (5 s), and the data were used for gauging geological parameters such as altitude and land slope. The electrical conductivity (EC) of soil and water were informed by the data bank of the Iranian Water Resources Management. The results of temperature simulations for the future (2020-2049) were analyzed by 21 AOGCM-AR5 models under the RCP4.5 emission scenario. In the first phase of evaluations, the maps of land suitability were constructed for present conditions by considering a network of the above-mentioned parameters. By combining these layers of information, the final map of land suitability was illustrated for walnut cultivation. In the second phase, the NEX-GDDP was used in order to determine land suitability for the future (2020-2049). The results showed that Iran currently has 582844 km2 of land suitable for walnut cultivation. However, the future will see less suitable lands: the current area will be reduced by 6.19%, from 582844 km2 to 546710 km2. In general, the northern, northwestern and western margins of Iran are currently suitable for walnut cultivation. By approximation, these lands will also be major areas for prospective cultivations of walnut in the future (2020-2049), even though their current stretch will be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W2953588239,"Glioblastoma is a high-grade glioma with poor prognosis even after surgery and standard therapy. Here, we asked whether carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine), a naturally occurring dipeptide, exert its anti-neoplastic effect on glioblastoma cells via PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Therefore, glioblastoma cells from the lines U87 and T98G were exposed to carnosine, to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and to the PI3K inhibitor Ly-294,002. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4) expression, known to be a target of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and which is also affected by carnosine, was analyzed by RT-qPCR, and reporter gene assays with the human PDK4 promoter were performed. Cell viability was assessed by cell-based assays and mTOR and Akt phosphorylation by Western blotting. Rapamycin and Ly-294,002 increased PDK4 mRNA expression in both cell lines but significance was only reached in U87. Carnosine significantly increased expression in both lines. A significant combinatorial effect of carnosine was only detected in U87 when the dipeptide was combined with Ly-294,002. Reporter gene assays revealed no specific effect of carnosine on the human PDK4 promoter, whereas both inhibitors increased reporter gene expression. Rapamycin reduced phosphorylation of mTOR, and Ly-294,002 that of Akt. A significant reduction of Akt phosphorylation was observed in the presence of carnosine in U87 but not in T98G, and carnosine had no effect on mTOR phosphorylation. Cell viability as determined by ATP in cell lysates was reduced only in the presence of carnosine. We conclude that carnosine’s anti-neoplastic effect is independent from PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. As the dipeptide reduced viability in tumor cells that do not respond to PI3K or mTOR inhibitors, it appears to be worth to further investigate the mechanisms by which carnosine exerts its anti-tumor effect and to consider it for therapy, especially as it is a naturally occurring compound that has already been used for the treatment of other diseases without indication of side-effects."
https://openalex.org/W2955702159,"Observed bimodal tree cover distributions at particular environmental conditions and theoretical models indicate that some areas in the tropics can be in either of the alternative stable vegetation states forest or savanna. However, when including spatial interaction in nonspatial differential equation models of a bistable quantity, only the state with the lowest potential energy remains stable. Our recent reaction-diffusion model of Amazonian tree cover confirmed this and was able to reproduce the observed spatial distribution of forest versus savanna satisfactorily when forced by heterogeneous environmental and anthropogenic variables, even though bistability was underestimated. These conclusions were solely based on simulation results for one set of parameters. Here, we perform an analytical and numerical analysis of the model. We derive the Maxwell point (MP) of the homogeneous reaction-diffusion equation without savanna trees as a function of rainfall and human impact and show that the front between forest and nonforest settles at this point as long as savanna tree cover near the front remains sufficiently low. For parameters resulting in higher savanna tree cover near the front, we also find irregular forest-savanna cycles and woodland-savanna bistability, which can both explain the remaining observed bimodality."
https://openalex.org/W2954114546,"Gluten is a complex of proteins present in barley, wheat, rye and several varieties of oats that triggers celiac disease in genetically predisposed subjects. Gluten is notoriously difficult to digest by mammalian proteolytic enzymes and therefore, proline-rich digestion-resistant peptides contain multiple immunogenic epitopes. Prolyl endopeptidases (PEP) hydrolyse internal proline residues on the carboxyl side of peptides and have been proposed for food gluten detoxification and as oral enzyme supplementation for celiacs. The aim of this study was to identify new gluten-degrading microbial enzymes with the potential to reduce gluten immunogenicity by neutralizing its antigenic epitopes. Using a gluten-degrading colony screening approach, a bacterial isolate (2RA3) displaying the highest glutenase activity was selected, characterized and its genome completely sequenced. The identification through 16S rDNA gene sequencing showed a 99,1% similarity to Chryseobacterium taeanense. Hydrolysis of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) was further monitored, over a 48-hour period, by colony encapsulation in gliadin-containing microspheres, followed by detection with the G12 anti-GIP monoclonal antibody. Glutenase activity was detected in the extracellular medium of 2RA3 cultures, where gel electrophoresis and gliadin zymography revealed the presence of a ~50 kDa gluten-degrading enzyme. Nano-ESI-Q-TOF of the excised active band identified 7 peptides contained in the protein product predicted for an open reading frame (ORF) in the 2RA3 genome. Based on sequence similarity to the PEP family, the new enzyme was named PEP 2RA3. The PEP 2RA3 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from C. taeanense 2RA3, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminally His-tagged recombinant protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein, with predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 78.95 kDa and 6.8, respectively, shows PEP activity with standard chromogenic substrates, works optimally at pH 8.0 and 30°C and remains stable at pH 6.0 and 50°C, indicating a potential use in gluten-containing food process applications. The ability of the recombinant enzyme to degrade GIP in beer into smaller peptides was confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2954329776,"Background The Philippines is ranked 3rd globally for tuberculosis incidence (554/100,000 population). The tuberculosis ward at San Lazaro Hospital, Manila receives 1,800–2,000 admissions of acutely unwell patients per year with high mortality. Objectives of this prospective cohort study were to quantify the association of under-nutrition (primary) and diabetes (secondary) with inpatient mortality occurring between 3–28 days of hospital admission in patients with suspected or previously diagnosed TB. Methods and results We enrolled 360 adults (≥18 years); 348 were eligible for the primary analysis (alive on day 3). Clinical, laboratory, anthropometric and enhanced tuberculosis diagnostic data were collected at admission with telephone tracing for mortality up to 6 months post-discharge. In the primary analysis population (mean age 45 years, SD = 15.0 years, 70% male), 58 (16.7%) deaths occurred between day 3–28 of admission; 70 (20.1%) between day 3 and discharge and documented total post-day 3 mortality including follow-up was 96 (27.6%). In those in whom it could be assessed, body mass index (BMI) ranged from 11.2–30.6 kg/m2 and 141/303 (46.5%) had moderate/severe undernutrition (BMI<17 kg/m2). A sex-specific cut-off for mid-upper arm circumference predictive of BMI<17 kg/m2 was associated with inpatient Day 3–28 mortality in males (AOR = 5.04, 95% CI: 1.50–16.86; p = 0.009; p = 0.032 for interaction by sex). The inability to stand for weight/height for BMI assessment was also associated with mortality (AOR = 5.59; 95% CI 2.25–13.89; p<0.001) as was severe compared to normal/mild anaemia (AOR = 9.67; 95% CI 2.48–37.76; p<0.001). No TB specific variables were associated with Day 3–28 mortality, nor was diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5% or diabetes treatment). Similar effects were observed when the same multivariable model was applied to confirmed TB patients only and to the outcome of all post-day 3 in-patient mortality. Conclusion This research supports the use of mid-upper arm circumference for triaging acutely unwell patients and the design and testing of nutrition-based interventions to improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2954248836,"Background and aims Liver disease in people living with HIV co-infected with hepatitis C virus is a source of morbidity and mortality in Russia. HIV accelerates liver fibrosis in the setting of HCV co-infection and alcohol use. Zinc deficiency is common among people living with HIV and may be a factor that facilitates the underlying mechanisms of liver fibrosis. We investigated the association between zinc deficiency and advanced liver fibrosis in a cohort of HIV/HCV co-infected persons reporting heavy drinking in Russia. Methods This is a secondary data analysis of baseline data from 204 anti-retroviral treatment naïve HIV/HCV co-infected Russians with heavy drinking that were recruited into a clinical trial of zinc supplementation. The primary outcome of interest in this cross-sectional study was advanced liver fibrosis. Zinc deficiency, the main independent variable, was defined as plasma zinc <0.75 mg/L. Exploratory analyses were performed examining continuous zinc levels and fibrosis scores. Analyses were conducted using multivariable regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results The prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis was similar for those with zinc deficiency compared to those with normal zinc levels, (27.7% vs. 23.0%, respectively). We did not detect an association between zinc deficiency and advanced liver fibrosis in the adjusted regression model (aOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.62–2.61, p = 0.51) nor in exploratory analyses. Conclusions In this cohort of Russians with HIV/HCV co-infection, who are anti-retroviral treatment naïve and have heavy alcohol use, we did not detect an association between zinc deficiency or zinc levels and advanced liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2954750601,"Introduction Research has recently focused on the relationships between working memory, negative affect (e.g., general anxiety, depressive symptoms) and personal assets (e.g., self-concept, academic and competence dimensions, and ego-resiliency), and their influence on mathematics and reading literacy. Although these variables have been amply explored, previous research has usually considered each of these aspects in isolation. Method In the present study, 143 schoolchildren in sixth to eighth grade were tested on general anxiety, depressive symptoms, working memory, self-concept (academic and competence scales), ego-resiliency, and mathematics and reading literacy. Results Variance partitioning showed that all predictors, i.e., working memory, negative affect (i.e., general anxiety and depressive symptoms), and personal assets (i.e., self-concept, academic and competence dimensions, and ego-resiliency) explained a unique and shared portion of the variance in mathematics and reading literacy. Conclusions Our findings point to the importance of investigating the relationship between these factors. Underlying implications and directions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2954983822,"Background Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality among women from Paraguay, with high incidence and mortality rates (31.2 and 16 per 100 000 women, respectively). Although the risk factors associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection and preneoplastic cervical lesions are widely studied, population-based characteristics of particular settings may influence the feasibility of HPV-based CC screening implementation. This study aimed to explore factors associated with hrHPV infection and high-grade cervical neoplasia in hrHPV-positive (hrHPV+) women from Paraguay. Methods A total of 5677 women aged 30–64 years from the Central Department of Paraguay were screened with HPV test (Hybrid Capture 2) and Pap smear. Sociodemographic and risk factor interviews were conducted. hrHPV+ women were referred to colposcopy and women with an abnormal colposcopy had a biopsy taken. The outcomes recorded were the hrHPV status and the presence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN2+) among hrHPV+ women. Associations were investigated using multivariate logistic regressions. Results hrHPV prevalence was 13.8% (95%CI 13.0–14.8). This value decreased with the age of women (p-trend<0.001) and increased with the lifetime number of sexual partners (p-trend<0.001) and number of previous female partners of their current male partner if women had had one lifetime sexual partner (p-trend<0.001), increasing from 3.06 (95%CI 0.073–20.9) if partners had had one previous female partner to 9.19 (95%CI 2.36–61.1) if they had had eight or more. In hrHPV+ women, CIN2+ prevalence was 10.7% (95%CI 8.58–13.2) and increased with time since the last Pap smear (p-trend<0.001) and with the increasing number of pregnancies (p-trend = 0.05). Conclusion In these settings, the sexual behavior of women and their male partners is associated with hrHPV infection. In hrHPV+ women, underscreening practices and multiple pregnancies are associated with CIN2+. This knowledge can contribute to public health policies for CC prevention and control in Paraguay."
https://openalex.org/W2954647932,"Background Objective methods to measure physical activity (PA) can lead to better cross-cultural comparisons, monitoring temporal PA trends, and measuring the effect of interventions. However, when applying this technology in field-work, the accelerometer data processing is prone to methodological issues. One of the most challenging issues relates to standardizing total wear time to provide reliable data across participants. It is generally accepted that at least 4 complete days of accelerometer wear represent a week for adults. It is not known if this same assumption holds true for pregnant women. Aim We assessed the optimal number of days needed to obtain reliable estimates of overall PA and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during the 2nd trimester in pregnancy using a raw triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were carried out in the antenatal wave of the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. Participants wore the wrist ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer for seven consecutive days. The daily average acceleration, which indicated overall PA, was measured as milli-g (mg), and time spent in MVPA (minutes/day) was analyzed in 5-minute bouts. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare variability across days of the week. Bland-Altman plots and the Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formula were applied to determine the reliability coefficient associated with one to seven days of measurement. Results Among 2,082 pregnant women who wore the accelerometer for seven complete days, overall and MVPA were lower on Sundays compared to other days of the week. Reliability of > = 0.80 to evaluate overall PA was reached with at least three monitoring days, whereas seven days were needed to estimate reliable measures of MVPA. Conclusions Our findings indicate that obtaining one week of accelerometry in adults is appropriate for pregnant women, particularly to obtain differences on weekend days and reliably estimate overall PA and MVPA."
https://openalex.org/W2954693523,"Background Women engaging in compensated dating is one of the at risk group of HIV infection due to multiple sexual partnerships and risky sexual practices. The present study examined the prevalence of HIV testing behavior and intention, and identified factors associated with HIV testing intention among women engaging in compensated dating in Hong Kong. Factors from the Theory of Planned Behaviors and the role of various types of barriers to HIV testing were also explored. Methods An anonymous, cross-sectional survey was conducted online. Target participants were women who have engaged in compensated dating and provided sex services to clients. Participants were recruited via three sources, including i) online outreaching, ii) referral made by NGOs, and iii) referral made by participants. A total of 183 participants completed the study. Results Respectively 29.7% and 18.6% have taken up HIV testing and showed intention to take up HIV testing in the future year. Results from the multiple hierarchical regression model showed that having ever received HIV testing (β = 0.44, p < .001), attitudes towards HIV testing (β = 0.22, p < .01), subjective norm (β = 0.18, p < .05), perceived behavioral control (β = 0.18, p < .01) and perceived discrimination from health care workers (β = -0.24, p < .05) significantly predicted intention to take up HIV testing. Conclusion The present study demonstrates the applicability of extended TPB in HIV testing intention among women engaging in compensated dating. Interventions to promote HIV testing among this group are greatly warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2956148719,"Introduction Asymptomatic carriage of P. falciparum is frequent in areas endemic for malaria and individual diagnosis of clinical malaria attacks is still difficult. We investigated the impact of changes in malaria endemicity on the diagnostic criteria for malaria attacks in an area of seasonal malaria transmission. Methods We analyzed the longitudinal data collected over 20 years from a daily survey of all inhabitants of Ndiop, a rural community in central Senegal, in a logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the risk of fever, with the aim of determining the best parasitemia thresholds for attributing to malaria a fever episode. Results A total of 34,136 observations recorded from July 1993 to December 2013 from 850 individuals aged from 1 day to 87 years were included. P. falciparum asymptomatic carriage declined from 36% to 1% between 1993 and 2013. A total of 9,819 fever episodes were associated with a positive blood film for P. falciparum. Using age-dependent parasitemia thresholds for attributing to malaria a fever episode, we recorded 6,006 malaria attacks during the study period. Parasitemia thresholds seemed to be lower during the low-to-zero transmission season and tended to decrease with changes in control policies. The number of clinical malaria attacks was overestimated for all age groups throughout the study when all fever episodes associated with P. falciparum parasitemia were defined as malaria attacks. Conclusion Pyrogenic thresholds are particularly sensitive to changes in malaria epidemiology and are therefore an interesting tool to accurately assess the burden of malaria in the context of declining transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2953659489,"Objective To assess whether laparoscopy has any advantages over open resection for right-sided colon cancer. Summary background data Right hemicolectomy can be performed using either a conventional open or a minimally invasive laparoscopic technique. It is not clear whether these different access routes differ with regard to short-term postoperative outcomes. Methods Patients documented in the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery StuDoQ|ColonCancer registry who underwent right hemicolectomy were analyzed regarding early postoperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo (primary endpoint), operation (OP) time, length of postoperative hospital stay (LOS), MTL30 and number of lymph nodes retrieved (secondary endpoints). Results A total of 4.997 patients were identified as undergoing oncological right hemicolectomy without additional interventions. Of these, 4.062 (81.3%) underwent open, 935 (18.7%) laparoscopic surgery. Propensity score analysis showed a significantly shorter LOS (OR: 0.55 CI 95%0.47-.64) and a significantly longer OP time (OR2.32 CI 1.98–2.71) for the laparoscopic route. Risk factors for postoperative complications, anastomotic insufficiency, ileus, reoperation and positive MTL30 were higher ASA status, higher age and increasing BMI. The surgical access route (open / lap) had no influence on these factors, but the laparoscopic group did have markedly fewer lymph nodes retrieved. Conclusion The present registry-based analysis could detect no relevant advantages for the minimally invasive laparoscopic access route. Further oncological analyses are needed to clarify the extent to which the smaller lymph node harvest in the laparoscopic group is accompanied by a poorer oncological outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2953891818,"Purpose Bladder cancer is a Warburg-like tumor characterized by a reliance on aerobic glycolysis and expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). PKM2 oscillates between an active tetramer and an inactive dimer. We aim to further characterize PKM2, in particular PKM2 dimer, as a urinary biomarker of bladder cancer and a potential target for treatment. Methods HTB-9, HTB-5, and UM-UC3 bladder cancer cells were assessed for proliferation under differential glucose levels using the hexosaminidase assay. Western blot and Blue-native analysis was performed for protein expression of PKM2. Shikonin, an herb that is known to bind and inhibit PKM2, was utilized to determine if PKM2 has a role in glucose usage and cellular proliferation in bladder cancer cells by caspase activity assay. Institutional review board approval was obtained to collect healthy control and bladder cancer patient urine samples. The ScheBo M2-PK EDTA Plasma Test was performed on urine samples to assess urine Tumor M2-PK values. Results The three bladder cancer cell lines tested all demonstrate statistically significant increases in proliferation when exposed to higher level of glucose (200mg/dL). Similarly, low doses of glucose (25mg/dL) result in reduced proliferation. Increased cell growth in higher glucose concentration correlated with up-regulation of PKM2 protein expression. Shikonin, a PKM2 inhibitor, reduced cell proliferation and switched PKM2 isoforms from the dimer to tetramer. Lastly, dimer PKM2 (Tumor-M2PK) levels were assessed in the urine samples from bladder cancer (Bca) patients and healthy controls. Tumor M2-PK significantly correlated with the presence of BCa in our subjects. Conclusions Our studies demonstrate the potential of PKM2, specifically the dimer (Tumor-M2PK) as a target of drug therapy and as a urinary marker for bladder cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2954635194,"Purpose The role of insulin resistance (IR) in developing postmenopausal breast cancer has not been thoroughly resolved and may be confounded by lifestyle factors such as obesity. We examined whether genetically determined IR is causally associated with breast cancer risk. Methods We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using individual-level data from our previous meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 11,109 non-Hispanic white postmenopausal women). Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with fasting glucose (FG), 2 with fasting insulin (FI), and 6 with homeostatic model assessment–IR (HOMA-IR) but were not associated with obesity. We used this GWAS to employ hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer risk by adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results No direct association was observed between comprising 12 IR genetic instruments and breast cancer risk (HR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.76–1.14). In phenotype-specific analysis, genetically elevated FG was associated with reduced risk for breast cancer (main contributor of this MR-effect estimate: G6PC2 rs13431652; HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35–0.99). Genetically driven FI and HOMA-IR were not significantly associated. Stratification analyses by body mass index, exercise, and dietary fat intake with combined phenotypes showed that genetically elevated IR was associated with greater breast cancer risk in overall obesity and inactive subgroups (single contributor: MTRR/LOC729506 rs13188458; HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.03–4.75). Conclusions We found complex evidence for causal association between IR and risk of breast cancer, which may support the potential value of intervention trials to lower IR and reduce breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2955835942,"The study of early development in Neotropical Leiuperinae frogs (Anura, Leptodactylidae) has been addressed by several works in recent times. However, a comparative developmental approach under a phylogenetic context was not available. Herein we analyzed the morphological and ontogenetic diversity of embryos belonging to 22 species of the three largest genera in Leiuperinae. We find that in most cases, variations fit with the phylogeny at the inter- and intrageneric levels. Embryo kyphosis and whitish color are synapomorphies for the clade grouping Physalaemus and Engystomops. The presence of a third lower tooth row on the oral disc is plesiomorphic for Leiuperinae, only changing in derived clades. The configurations and developmental trajectories of the lower lip are exceptionally diverse. The developmental sequences optimized on the phylogenetic tree recover an early differentiated first lower tooth row a synapomorphy of Pseudopaludicola and Physalaemus, and an early differentiated second row as synapomorphy of Pleurodema. On the other hand, few features are highly conserved in the subfamily, such as the adhesive glands universally present in a type-C configuration. Our results also suggest that the morphology and ontogeny of embryos is in some cases associated to the environment where they develop. A large body size, poorly developed transient respiratory structures, large yolk provision and delayed development of the digestive tract occur convergently in embryos inhabiting cold, oxygenated environments. Embryos that develop in warmer water bodies in xeric environments show more complex and persistent transient respiratory structures and an early onset of hind limbs development. Our survey highlights that morphology and early development of anurans can be a valuable source of information for phylogenetic studies, and provide fundamental bases to explore and discuss how evolutionary changes can be shaped by environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2953608015,"We have previously reported that lamellar dissection of the cornea transects stromal nerves, and that regenerating neurites form a dense net along the surgical plane. In these experiments, we have disrupted the stromal nerve trunks in situ, without incising the cornea, to determine the regeneration events in the absence of a surgical plane.Thy1-YFP mice were anesthetized and in vivo images of the corneal nerves were obtained with a wide-field stereofluorescent microscope. A far infrared XYRCOS Laser attached to 20X objective of an upright microscope was used to perform in situ transection of the stromal nerves. 3 types of laser transections were performed (n = 5/group): (i) point transection (a single cut); (ii) segmental transection (two cuts enclosing a segment of nerve trunk); and (iii) annular transection (cuts on all nerve trunks crossing the perimeter of a 0.8 mm diameter circular area centered on the corneal apex). Mice were imaged sequentially for 4 weeks thereafter to assess nerve degeneration (disappearance or weakening of original fluorescence intensity) or regeneration (appearance of new fluorescent fronds). Beta-3-tubulin immunostaining was performed on corneal whole-mounts to demonstrate nerve disruption.The pattern of stromal nerves in corneas of the same mouse and in corneas of littermates was dissimilar. Two distinct patterns were observed, often within the same cornea: (i) interconnected trunks that spanned limbus to limbus; or (ii) dichotomously branching trunks that terminate at the corneal apex. Point transections did not cause degeneration of proximal or distal segment in interconnected trunks, but resulted in degeneration of distal segment of branching trunks. In segmental transections, the nerve segment enclosed within the two laser cuts degenerated. Lack of beta-3 tubulin staining at transection site confirmed nerve transection. In interconnected trunks, at 4 weeks, a hyperfluorescent plaque filled the gap created by the transection. In annular transections, some nerve trunks degenerated, while others regained or retained fluorescence.Interconnected stromal nerves in murine corneas do not degenerate after in situ point transection and show evidence of healing at the site of disruption. Presence or absence of a surgical plane influences corneal nerve regeneration after transection."
https://openalex.org/W2956009245,"Aluminum is increasingly globally bioavailable with acidification from industrial emissions and poor mining practices. This bioavailability increases uptake by flora, contaminating products such as fruit, pollen, and nectar. Concentrations of aluminum in fruit and pollen have been reported between 0.05 and 670mg/L in North America. This is particularly concerning for pollinators that ingest pollen and nectar. Honey bees represent a globally present species experiencing decline in Europe and North America. Region specific decline may be a result of differential toxicity of exposure between subspecies. We find that European honey bees (Apis mellifera mellifera) may have differential toxicity as compared to two allopatric Mediterranean subspecies (Apis mellifera carnica and Apis mellifera caucasica) which showed no within subspecies exposure differences. European honey bees were then used in a laboratory experiment and exposed to aluminum in their daily water supply to mimic nectar contamination at several concentrations. After approximately 3 weeks of aluminum ingestion these bees showed significantly shorter captive longevity than controls at concentrations as low as 10.4mg/L and showed a possible hormetic response in motility. We also compared European honey bees to Africanized/European hybrid bees (Apis mellifera mellifera/scutellata hybrid) in short-term free-flight experiments. Neither the European honey bee nor the hybrid showed immediate foraging deficits in flight time, color choice, or floral manipulation after aluminum exposure. We conclude that European honey bees are at the greatest risk of aluminum related decline from chronic ingestion as compared to other subspecies and offer new methods for future use in honey bee toxicology."
https://openalex.org/W2953733834,"Advanced imaging techniques generate large datasets capable of describing the structure and kinematics of tissue spreading in embryonic development, wound healing, and the progression of many diseases. These datasets can be integrated with mathematical models to infer biomechanical properties of the system, typically identifying an optimal set of parameters for an individual experiment. However, these methods offer little information on the robustness of the fit and are generally ill-suited for statistical tests of multiple experiments. To overcome this limitation and enable efficient use of large datasets in a rigorous experimental design, we use the approximate Bayesian computation rejection algorithm to construct probability density distributions that estimate model parameters for a defined theoretical model and set of experimental data. Here, we demonstrate this method with a 2D Eulerian continuum mechanical model of spreading embryonic tissue. The model is tightly integrated with quantitative image analysis of different sized embryonic tissue explants spreading on extracellular matrix (ECM) and is regulated by a small set of parameters including forces on the free edge, tissue stiffness, strength of cell-ECM adhesions, and active cell shape changes. We find statistically significant trends in key parameters that vary with initial size of the explant, e.g., for larger explants cell-ECM adhesion forces are weaker and free edge forces are stronger. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimated parameters for one explant can be used to predict the behavior of other similarly sized explants. These predictive methods can be used to guide further experiments to better understand how collective cell migration is regulated during development."
https://openalex.org/W2955197169,"Endosomes are subcellular organelles which serve as important transport compartments in eukaryotic cells. Fluorescence microscopy is a widely applied technology to study endosomes at the subcellular level. In general, a microscopy image can contain a large number of organelles and endosomes in particular. Detecting and annotating endosomes in fluorescence microscopy images is a critical part in the study of subcellular trafficking processes. Such annotation is usually performed by human inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracy if carried out by inexperienced analysts. This paper proposes a two-stage method for automated detection of ring-like endosomes. The method consists of a localization stage cascaded by an identification stage. Given a test microscopy image, the localization stage generates a voting-map by locally comparing the query endosome patches and the test image based on a bag-of-words model. Using the voting-map, a number of candidate patches of endosomes are determined. Subsequently, in the identification stage, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained using the endosome patches and the background pattern patches. Each of the candidate patches is classified by the SVM to rule out those patches of endosome-like background patterns. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with real microscopy images of human myeloid endothelial cells. It is shown that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art competing methods using multiple performance metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2955925903,"Aims To report corneal topometric and aberrometric values in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) and to investigate their correlation with biomechanical corneal parameters. Methods One randomly chosen eye of 20 MPS patients with no to moderate corneal clouding and one eye of 23 healthy controls with comparable age were prospectively included into this study. Corneal surface regularity was assessed by index of surface variance (ISV), -vertical asymmetry (IVA), -height asymmetry (IHA), -height decentration (IHD); keratoconus index (KI), central keratoconus index (CKI) and Zernike indices of anterior and posterior corneal surface using Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam). Corneal resistance factor (CRF) and corneal hysteresis (CH) were assessed by Ocular Response Analyzer. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney-Test and Spearman Correlation Coefficients. Results IVA, ISV, IHD, IHA, but not KI and CKI were significantly higher in MPS patients compared to age matched healthy controls. Spherical aberration and asphericity coefficients either at the anterior or at the posterior corneal surface differed significantly between both groups. The grade of the MPS-associated corneal opacity correlated significantly with ISV (rho = 0.52), IVA (rho = 0.54), IHA (rho = 0.57) and IHD (rho = 0.48). Density of the MPS-affected corneas correlated significantly with ISV (rho = 0.52), IVA (rho = 0.72), IHA (rho = 0.57), IHD (rho = 0.69), 3rd order horizontal trefoil aberration at the posterior (rho = 0.62) and anterior surface (rho = 0.48) as well as with CH (rho = 0.55) and CRF (rho = 0.57). Spherical aberration at the back surface correlated with CRF and CH in MPS and in healthy controls. Conclusions This is the first study analyzing shape of the corneal surface in MPS patients. Topometric indices of corneal asymmetry are significantly increased and correlate with MPS-related corneal opacity and density. Spherical aberration and asphericity coefficient at the front and at the back corneal surface differ significantly between MPS and healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2953587440,"Telomere length (TL) is a marker of cellular and biological aging. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported to be associated with short TLs, which suggests that accelerated biological aging occurs in some cellular compartments of HIV+ individuals. In this study, we measured the TLs of peripheral leukocytes of HIV+ and healthy individuals and examined the biological and environmental correlates of TL. We also investigated the influence of TL on leukoaraiosis, an indicator of cerebral small vessel disease, in HIV+ individuals. Three hundred and twenty-five HIV+ individuals who received stable combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for >1 year and achieved viral loads of <40 RNA copies/mL were enrolled along with 147 healthy individuals. Relative TLs of leukocytes were estimated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Leukoaraiosis was assessed in 184 HIV+ individuals by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging. We analyzed several covariates, including markers of HIV infection, cART, and social/environmental factors; variables associated with TL length in univariate analyses were incorporated into multivariate models. The TLs of peripheral leukocytes of HIV+ individuals were significantly shorter than those of healthy individuals, and the rate of LT length decline with increasing age was greater. Linear regression analysis showed that in HIV+ individuals, increasing age, cART without integrase-stand transfer inhibitors (INSTI), failure to achieve viral loads of <40 copies/mL within 1 year of initiating cART, and substance use were significantly associated with shorter TLs, even after adjustment for the effects of age. Logistic regression analysis indicated an increasing risk of leukoaraiosis was associated with older age, shorter TLs, hypertension, and carotid artery plaque. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that older age and shorter TLs were significant risk factors for leukoaraiosis. In summary, our data showed that TL shortening in HIV+ individuals was independently associated with leukoaraiosis, and was associated with age, control of viral loads, use of INSTI, and substance use. Our results suggest that effective viral control and less toxic cART can help reduce TL shortening and improve outcomes among HIV+ individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2954159986,"Living neuronal networks in dissociated neuronal cultures are widely known for their ability to generate highly robust spatiotemporal activity patterns in various experimental conditions. Such patterns are often treated as neuronal avalanches that satisfy the power scaling law and thereby exemplify self-organized criticality in living systems. A crucial question is how these patterns can be explained and modeled in a way that is biologically meaningful, mathematically tractable and yet broad enough to account for neuronal heterogeneity and complexity. Here we derive and analyse a simple network model that may constitute a response to this question. Our derivations are based on few basic phenomenological observations concerning the input-output behavior of an isolated neuron. A distinctive feature of the model is that at the simplest level of description it comprises of only two variables, the network activity variable and an exogenous variable corresponding to energy needed to sustain the activity, and few parameters such as network connectivity and efficacy of signal transmission. The efficacy of signal transmission is modulated by the phenomenological energy variable. Strikingly, this simple model is already capable of explaining emergence of network spikes and bursts in developing neuronal cultures. The model behavior and predictions are consistent with published experimental evidence on cultured neurons. At the larger, cellular automata scale, introduction of the energy-dependent regulatory mechanism results in the overall model behavior that can be characterized as balancing on the edge of the network percolation transition. Network activity in this state shows population bursts satisfying the scaling avalanche conditions. This network state is self-sustainable and represents energetic balance between global network-wide processes and spontaneous activity of individual elements."

Through processes of natural adaptation and selective breeding, the accumulation of mutations has driven the genetic divergence between pig breeds. The most common and well-studied mutations are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, insertions and deletions (indels) usually represents a fifth part of the detected mutations and should also be considered for animal breeding. In the present study, three different programs (Dindel, SAMtools mpileup, and GATK) were used to detect indels from Whole Genome Sequencing data of Iberian boars and Landrace sows. A total of 1,928,746 indels were found in common with the three programs. The VEP tool predicted that 1,289 indels may have a high impact on protein sequence and function. Ten indels inside genes related with lipid metabolism were genotyped in pigs from three different backcrosses with Iberian origin, obtaining different allelic frequencies on each backcross. Genome-Wide Association Studies performed in the Longissimus dorsi muscle found an association between an indel located in the C1q and TNF related 12 (C1QTNF12) gene and the amount of eicosadienoic acid (C20:2(n-6))."

Subjects may compensate for their deficits by utilizing other strategies; to avoid this, it is recommended to assess postural control using a dual-task test. In most dual-task tests, it is difficult to monitor the performance in the secondary task and the individual's task prioritisation. This study evaluated a new dual-task testing approach.A convenience sample of 54 community-dwelling elderly (age 65+ years) and a reference group of 20 young participants were included in the study. They performed a test in which they could utilize cues to improve their baseline performance, provided their level of postural control allowed them residual attention capacity for this cognitive task.Significant performance differences were seen between the young and the elderly. The young group improved their performance time by 23.9% (10.7) and 7.1% (14.2) with a cue and a reverse cue, respectively, whereas the elderly failed to improve their performance time. The test was unable to distinguish between individuals within the elderly group due to a floor effect.The test reveals an individual's capacity to use cues for anticipatory postural control strategies in a dual-task setting and thereby estimates automatization of postural control. While the young subjects were capable of improving their performance during dual-task conditions, the elderly subjects apparently had no residual attentional capacity allowing them to utilize the facilitating cues. Within the elderly group, the dual-task aspects of the test added no value with respect to differentiation in the level of postural control."

Nevertheless, this feature may vary both between subjects and even within the vertebrae of the same individual. Although such variation can be important in archaeological research, anthropological studies and forensic medicine, it has not so far been the subject of any detailed studies. Material and methods An analysis of 200 cervical spine CT examinations was performed. The morphology of the spinous process was evaluated, and new anthropometric parameters were selected to allow a more precise quantitative analysis of the degree of bifidity. Results The spinous process base (i.e. the part of the spinous process which was not bifid) was significantly longer in CII and CVII than in the other vertebrae. The spinous process branches (bifid elements) were significantly longer in CVI and CVII than in the other vertebrae. The angle between the branches was significantly sharper in CII and CVII than in CIII-CVI, on the right side, and CIII-CV, on the left side. On the right side, the branching coefficient (degree of branch development) was significantly higher for CII and significantly lower for CVI-CVII than for the other vertebrae. On the left side, the coefficient was significantly higher for CII and CIV, and significantly lower for CVI-CVII, compared to the other vertebrae. Conclusion Our findings highlight new objective parameters of morphological variability in the spinous processes of the cervical spine. They can form the basis of a new detailed differentiation of vertebrae and can represent an independent determinant of anatomical variability in the cervical spine."

In the event that Legionella become aerosolized in water droplets and inhaled by humans, they can cause a potentially fatal form of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease. Strains of L. pneumophila have highly plastic genomes that harbor numerous inter- and intra-genomic elements, enhancing their ability to live under diverse environmental conditions. One such mobile genomic element, p45 carries ~45 kbp of genes, including the Lvh (Legionella Vir homolog) type IVa secretion system. This element was evaluated for its contribution to L. pneumophila environmental resilience and virulence-related characteristics by comparing clinically isolated strain Philadelphia-1 that carries p45, Lp01 that lacks p45, and Lp01 with p45 reintroduced, Lp01+p45. We found that the p45 element impacts host cell entry and resistance to sodium, both virulence-related characteristics in Legionella species."

https://openalex.org/W2954620883,"Evidence of involvement of novel biomarkers in disease pathogenesis from research cohorts often precedes an understanding of their distributions in broader populations. This study aimed to estimate the distribution of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), an endocrine hormone that helps to regulate serum phosphate levels, in the overall US population and in important subgroups. We used a predictive model generated using data from the Framingham Health Study to estimate FGF-23 values for adults in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the size of patient subgroups with levels of FGF-23 above selected thresholds. To assess the face validity of our FGF-23 estimates, we examined the relationship between estimated FGF-23 and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality within NHANES using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional-hazards regression models and compared it to that observed in Framingham. Estimated FGF-23 values from NHANES were lower (median [interquartile range] 47.4 [35.8, 64.0] vs. 67.0 [54.0, 85.0] RU/mL) than the observed FGF-23 values from the Framingham cohort. Age- and sex-adjusted 10-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher (hazard ratio 2.43 [95% confidence interval: 1.42, 4.16]) for subjects with estimated FGF-23 levels in the highest versus lowest quartile. Estimating the distribution of biomarker values in the general population by applying predictive equations from smaller research cohorts is feasible and can inform drug research decision making."
