https://openalex.org/W2011221727,"Microglia, brain immune cells, engage in the clearance of dead cells or dangerous debris, which is crucial to the maintenance of brain functions. When a neighbouring cell is injured, microglia move rapidly towards it or extend a process to engulf the injured cell. Because cells release or leak ATP when they are stimulated or injured, extracellular nucleotides are thought to be involved in these events. In fact, ATP triggers a dynamic change in the motility of microglia in vitro and in vivo, a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying microglial chemotaxis; in contrast, microglial phagocytosis has received only limited attention. Here we show that microglia express the metabotropic P2Y6 receptor whose activation by endogenous agonist UDP triggers microglial phagocytosis. UDP facilitated the uptake of microspheres in a P2Y6-receptor-dependent manner, which was mimicked by the leakage of endogenous UDP when hippocampal neurons were damaged by kainic acid in vivo and in vitro. In addition, systemic administration of kainic acid in rats resulted in neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, where increases in messenger RNA encoding P2Y6 receptors that colocalized with activated microglia were observed. Thus, the P2Y6 receptor is upregulated when neurons are damaged, and could function as a sensor for phagocytosis by sensing diffusible UDP signals, which is a previously unknown pathophysiological function of P2 receptors in microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2170139952,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that motor-skill memories improve across a night of sleep, and that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep commonly plays a role in orchestrating these consolidation enhancements. Here we show the benefit of a daytime nap on motor memory consolidation and its relationship not simply with global sleep-stage measures, but unique characteristics of sleep spindles at regionally specific locations; mapping to the corresponding memory representation.Two groups of subjects trained on a motor-skill task using their left hand - a paradigm known to result in overnight plastic changes in the contralateral, right motor cortex. Both groups trained in the morning and were tested 8 hr later, with one group obtaining a 60-90 minute intervening midday nap, while the other group remained awake. At testing, subjects that did not nap showed no significant performance improvement, yet those that did nap expressed a highly significant consolidation enhancement. Within the nap group, the amount of offline improvement showed a significant correlation with the global measure of stage-2 NREM sleep. However, topographical sleep spindle analysis revealed more precise correlations. Specifically, when spindle activity at the central electrode of the non-learning hemisphere (left) was subtracted from that in the learning hemisphere (right), representing the homeostatic difference following learning, strong positive relationships with offline memory improvement emerged-correlations that were not evident for either hemisphere alone.These results demonstrate that motor memories are dynamically facilitated across daytime naps, enhancements that are uniquely associated with electrophysiological events expressed at local, anatomically discrete locations of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1984820303,"Major copper proteins in the cytoplasm of plant cells are plastocyanin, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome c oxidase. Under copper limited conditions, expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase is down-regulated and the protein is replaced by iron superoxide dismutase in chloroplasts. We present evidence that a micro-RNA, miR398, mediates this regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana, by directing the degradation of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase mRNA when copper is limited. Sequence analysis indicated that the transcripts encoding cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and COX5b-1, a subunit of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, are also targeted by miR398. This regulation via miR398 takes place in response to changes in a low range of copper levels (0.2-0.5 μm), indicating that miR398 is involved in a response to copper limitation. On the other hand, another major copper protein, plastocyanin, which is involved in photosynthetic electron flow and is essential in higher plants, was not regulated via miR398.We propose that miR398 is a key factor in copper homeostasis in plants and regulates the stability of mRNAs of major copper proteins under copper-limited conditions.

In plants, copper must be delivered to a number of important enzymes that are active in various subcellular locations (1.Pilon M. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Gogolin K.A. Ye H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One of the most abundant copper proteins in photosynthetic tissues is plastocyanin (PC), 4The abbreviations used are: PC, plastocyanin; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; MS, Murashige-Skoog; MV, methyl viologen; CCD, charge-coupled device; LUC, luciferase; AOX, alternative oxidase; RT, reverse transcriptase; APX1, ascorbate peroxidase 1. which localizes to the thylakoid lumen of chloroplasts and mediates electron transport between the cytochrome b6f complex and photosystem I. Although a heme-containing cytochrome c6 can serve as an alternative to PC under low copper conditions in certain algae (2.Merchant S. Robert R. Wise R.R. Hoober K. The Structure and Function of Plastids. Springer, The Netherlands2006: 199-218Google Scholar), an ortholog that can replace PC function is not found in higher plants (3.Molina-Heredia F.P. Wastl J. Navarro J.A. Bendall D.S. Herva´s M. Howe C.J. De la Rosa M.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, PC is essential for photosynthetic electron transport in plants (4.Weigel M. Varotto C. Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Salamini F. Leister D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31286-31289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Another major copper enzyme in plants is copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) aids in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by converting O2. to H2O2 (5.Bowler C. Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 199-218Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). SOD enzymes are classified based on the metal cofactors (5.Bowler C. Van Camp W. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1994; 13: 199-218Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In green tissues of Arabidopsis the major isoforms of Cu,Zn-SOD localize to the cytoplasm (CSD1) and to the chloroplast stroma (CSD2), whereas the peroxisomal isoform (CSD3) constitutes a minor activity (6.Kliebenstein D.J. Monde R.A. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, another SOD called FSD1, which uses an iron cofactor, can be found. A manganese requiring MnSOD localizes to mitochondria (6.Kliebenstein D.J. Monde R.A. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Next to its roles in photosynthesis and superoxide scavenging in chloroplasts, copper is also involved in respiratory electron transport in mitochondria as a cofactor in the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex (7.Ferguson-Miller S. Babcock G.T. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2889-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Therefore the allocation of available copper over these two organelles may also be crucial for maintaining an optimum energy budget in a cell. The copper delivery system to PC and Cu,Zn-SOD in plant cells has been studied in some detail (1.Pilon M. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Cohu C.M. Gogolin K.A. Ye H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). copper enters the cell by means of the CopT family of transporters (8.Sanceno´n V. Puig S. Mira H. Thiele D.J. Penarrubia L. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 51: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 9.Andrés-Cola´s N. Sanceno´n V. Rodri´guez-Navarro S. Mayo S. Thiele D.J. Ecker J.R. Puig S. Penarrubia L. Plant J. 2006; 45: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A cytosolic form of the copper chaperone for SOD (CCS) delivers copper to CSD1 (10.Chu C.-C. Lee W.-C. Guo W.-Y. Pan S.-M. Chen L.-J. Li H.-M. Jinn T.-L. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Two P-type ATPases, PAA1 and PAA2, are required for efficient copper delivery across the plastid envelope and the thylakoid membrane, respectively, in Arabidopsis (11.Shikanai T. Müller-Moulé P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Once copper is transported into the stroma by PAA1, it can be transferred to the stromal form of CCS, which can target it to stromal CSD2 (10.Chu C.-C. Lee W.-C. Guo W.-Y. Pan S.-M. Chen L.-J. Li H.-M. Jinn T.-L. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Burkhead J.L. Gogolin K.A. Andrés-Cola´s N. Bodecker J.R. Puig S. Penarrubia L. Pilon M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, stromal copper can also be transferred to PC via PAA2. In illuminated chloroplasts, the possible one electron reduction of oxygen at PSI results in the generation of superoxide (14.Asada K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 601-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). The potential damage caused by superoxide or by superoxide-derived ROS is minimized by the combined action of stromal Fe-SOD or Cu,Zn-SOD enzymes, which convert superoxide to oxygen and peroxide, and by stromal ascorbate peroxidases, which convert the formed peroxide into water. Despite the presence of these ROS scavenging systems, the chloroplast is a cell organelle, where plants encounter a high risk of generating damaging ROS. Whereas copper delivery is important for energy metabolism and superoxide scavenging, excess copper is toxic and growth of plants on tissue culture media containing copper above 20 μm causes visible damage to plants (15.Murphy A. Taiz L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Free copper ions may participate in the Fenton reaction, resulting in the production of highly reactive and damaging hydroxyl radicals. However, the risk of free copper ions may be minimized by a strict regulation of copper delivery in a cell. For example, the free copper concentration was estimated to be less than 10-18 m in a yeast cell, whereas the total copper concentration is ∼70 μm (16.Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). In plants, the chloroplast is particularly sensitive to copper toxicity, which is illustrated by the phenotypes of mutants in genes that encode chloroplast copper transporters. The sensitivity to excess copper is reduced in the Arabidopsis paa1 mutant, in which copper delivery to the stroma is severely impaired (11.Shikanai T. Müller-Moulé P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In contrast, paa2, in which copper is not delivered to the thylakoid lumen, is hypersensitive to high copper concentrations (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Major copper proteins such as PC and Cu,Zn-SOD may act as copper sinks under conditions where copper supply is in excess. Therefore, copper homeostasis may involve the regulation of the abundance of these copper sinks. Previously, it was shown that the levels of three copper proteins, CSD1, CSD2, and to a lesser extent PC increase in response to elevated copper concentrations (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The abundance of CSD1 and CSD2 was found to be regulated in response to copper availability at the mRNA abundance level. Whereas CSD1 and CSD2 expression was shut off when copper is limiting, the iron-requiring FSD1 was up-regulated. In contrast, the PC level is likely to be a consequence of copper delivery to the thylakoid lumen because apo-PC without copper is unstable (17.Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15850-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The regulation of SOD expression would allow efficient delivery of limited copper to PC, which is essential, yet also maintain plastid SOD activity. Based on these observations, we proposed a model, in which the copper available to chloroplasts is sensed and the resulting information is used to direct the expression of CSD1 and CSD2. Micro-RNAs are small 21-22-long RNA molecules that, in plants, contribute to the regulating the expression of specific genes by directing an endo-ribonuclease machinery to degrade target mRNAs (19.Carrington J.C. Ambros V. Science. 2003; 30: 336-338Crossref Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Micro-RNAs have been shown to direct a variety of developmental processes (20.Zhang B. Pan X. Cobb G.P. Anderson T.A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) but also have been implied in responses to stress (21.Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 11511-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and phosphate (24.Fujii H. Chiou T.-J. Lin S.-I. Aung K. Zhu J.-K. Curr. Biol. 2006; 15: 2038-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 25.Chiou T.-J. Aung K. Lin S.-I. Wu C.-C. Chiang S.-F. Su C.-L.

Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 988-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The micro-RNA family, miR398, was identified by computational analysis and predicted to target CSD1, CSD2, and COX5b-1 mRNAs (21.Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 23.Bonnet E. Wuyts J. Rouzé P. Van de Peer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11511-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 27.Sunkar R. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2001-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). In a recent report, the miR398 family was shown to control CSD1 and CSD2 expression in response to environmental stress (28.Sunkar R. Kapoor A. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2051-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that transcripts of CSD1, CSD2, and also COX5b-1, which encodes a plant homolog of the zinc-binding subunit of the mitochondrial copper enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, are regulated by miR398. Regulation of miR398 is predominantly in response to copper. Consequently, CSD1 and CSD2 transcripts and proteins do not accumulate when copper is below a critical threshold even under stress conditions. However, when copper is sufficient a slight additive effect of copper and stress can be observed on miR398 expression. We propose a regulatory mechanism in which the expression of chloroplast SOD isozymes is determined by metal cofactor availability, a mechanism that involves miR398, the expression of which is regulated by copper availability. Plant Material and Growth Conditions−Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia gl1 was used as the wild type, and the background of all transgenic plants was also Columbia gl1. Plants were grown on agar-solidified MS (Murashige-Skoog) medium including 1% sucrose (Sigma) with CuSO4 as indicated, and were grown under controlled conditions (light intensity of 40 μmol m-2 s-1, 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 23 °C). Stress Treatments−For high-light stress, 2-week-old seedlings grown on MS medium or MS plus copper at a light intensity of 120 μmol m-2 s-1, in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle were transferred in the middle of the light cycle to continuous high light (950 μmol m-2 s-1). Control plants were maintained at low light intensity throughout the experiment. For methyl viologen (MV) treatment, MS and MS plus copper-grown seedlings were sprayed with 100 μm MV (Sigma). After 24 h, unstressed and stress-treated seedlings were harvested and used for RNA and protein extraction. Plasmid Construction−To construct CSD2pro::LUC, the CSD2 promoter region was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers CSD2pro-F (5′-AGTGAGATCTTGTCAAAATGGGGAAGACG-3′) and CSD2pro-R (5′-GCATTCTCATCTCCTTCTCGT-3′). The underlined sequence is the restriction site used for the cloning. When restriction sites are not indicated in primers, the site present in the genome sequence was used for the cloning. The amplified product was digested with XbaI and NcoI, then cloned into the pBI221-LUC+ vector (29.Ono S. Tanaka T. Watakabe Y. Hiratsuka K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and confirmed by sequencing. The primers used for PCR amplification were CSD2ox-F (5′-TTCCTCTAGACGTCAAACATAGC-3′) and CSD2cut3-R (5′-CTAACAACATGACCCATGGAGCTCCAGAA-3′) for CSD2Δ1::LUC, CSD2ox-F and CSD2cut2-R (5′-CATAAATGCCATGGCCGATGGT-3′) for CSD2Δ2::LUC, and CSD2ox-F and CSD2full-R2 (5′-CTTTCGCAGGTGTGATTGCCATGGCG-3′) for CSD2full::LUC. The amplified products were inserted into NcoI-digested CSD2pro::LUC, then confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. For construction of 35S::CSD2, the primers used for PCR amplification were CSD2ox-F and CSD2ox-R (5′-AACGAATTCAAACGCATGATTCAT-3′). The PCR product was inserted into XbaI-EcoRI-digested pBI121 vector (GenBank™ accession number AF485783). To create 35S::miR398b, the primers used for PCR amplification were miR398box-F (5′-TTTGATCTAGATTTAGAATATGGGGAC-3′), and miR398box-R (5′-GAAGAGGAAGCACGGAGCTCGTTTC-3′). The PCR product was inserted into XbaI-SacI-digested pBI121 vector. To construct 35S::CSD2ina, the primers were CSD2ox-F and CSD2ina-R (5′-CCTCTGTTTGATTTTGCAGTGTGAGTTTGG-3′) for template 1, and CSD2ina-F (5′-ATTTTGCAGTGTGAGTTTGGTGATACAAC-3′) and CSD2ox-R for template 2. The two templates were fused by recombinant PCR (30.Rashtchian A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using primers CSD2ox-F and CSD2ox-R. The PCR product was inserted into pBI121 in the same way as 35S::CSD2. Luciferase (LUC) and SOD Assays−LUC activity was detected in 2-week-old seedlings. 1 mm Luciferine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was sprayed onto plants. Images of emitted light were captured by a CCD (charge-coupled device) camera, and light intensities were calculated using AQUACOSMOS software (Hamamatsu Hotonics, Japan). SOD isozymes were extracted and assayed on native polyacrylamide gels as described (11.Shikanai T. Müller-Moulé P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and RNA Gel Blot Analysis−Total RNA was isolated from 3-week-old seedlings grown on MS nutrient-agar plates using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For transcript analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 4% formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled probes. The probes for CSD1, CSD2 (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and APX1 (31.Panchuk I.I. Volkov R.A. Schöffl F. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 838-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) were obtained by PCR amplification. Radioactive probes were synthesized with an oligo-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) using random primers. Hybridization and washing was performed as described (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For small RNA analysis, 20 μg of total RNA (40 μg total RNA for Fig. 3B) was loaded per lane and resolved on a denaturing 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) and transferred electrophoretically to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). DNA oligonucleotide probes specific for miR398a (5′-AAGGGGTGACCTGAGAACACA-3′) and miR398b or miR398c (5′-CAGGGGTGACCTGAGAACACA-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). The blots were also analyzed with an oligonucleotide probe specific to small nuclear RNA U6 (5′-TCATCCTTGCGCAGGGGCCA-3′) as a loading control. Blots were prehybridized for 1 h and hybridized overnight using ULTRAhybo-oligo hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 38 °C. Blots were washed four times, 20 min each (two times with 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS, one time with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and one time with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C. Membranes were briefly dried and bands were visualized using a phosphorimager. RT-PCR Analysis−10 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I (Fermentas) and cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to instructions. Primers used were as follows: 5′-TCCTACAACTGTGAATGTTCG-3′ and 5′-CTTAGTCTGACCACTGGAAAC-3′ for CSD2, 5′-GAGTTGCAGTTTTGAACAGC-3′ and 5′-TTCTTTGGAAACGTAGCAGC-3′ for CSD1, 5′-CGATCGAACCAAAGCTAAACG-3′ and 5′-GGACTCAATTAGAGGCTCTTC-3′ for PC, 5′-GAGAGATTCAGGTGCCCAG-3′ and 5′-AGAGCGAGAGCGGGTTTTCA-3′ for Actin, 5′-ATTTCAAAGGAGTGGCATGTG-3′ and 5′-CCTCACCCCTTTGAATCTCCC-3′ for miR398a, 5′-GATCTCGACAGGGTTGATATG-3′ and 5′-GGTCACCCCTGCTGAGCTCTT-3′ for miR398b, 5′-CAGCTATTCTGATTACACCCG-3′ and 5′-GGAATCCATCTTGCTCCAACA-3′ for LUC. The PCRs were performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2 units of Taq polymerase. 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 cycles of amplification were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler, each consisting of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 55 °C, and 30 s of extension at 72 °C. The amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunoblot Analysis−Rosette leaves from Arabidopsis plants grown on MS-agar plates or MS supplemented with CuSO4 were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Total protein was extracted as described (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and the protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Antibodies for immunoblot detection of PC (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and SOD isoforms (6.Kliebenstein D.J. Monde R.A. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) have been described. Antibody for Hsp70 was obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies for cytochome f and COX2 were gifts from Dr. A Makino (Tohoku University, Japan) and Dr. K. Nogichi (University of Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies for alternative oxidase (AOX) were obtained from Agrisera (Vannas, Sweden). Ferritin-specific antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. J. F. Briat (INRA Montpellier, France). For the detection of COX2 and AOX crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared as described (33.Munshi M.K. Kobayashi Y. Shikanai T. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CSD2 mRNA Abundance Is Post-transcriptionally Regulated by Copper Availability−The protein levels of two Cu,Zn-SODs were analyzed in Arabidopsis seedlings cultured at three different copper concentrations (Fig. 1A). Standard MS plant growth medium (34.Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol.

Müller-Moulé P. Munekage Y. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cu,Zn-SOD expression is very low and FSD1 is expressed perhaps to compensate (Fig. 1A) (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The expression pattern was drastically changed, and CSD1 and CSD2 were predominately accumulated in seedlings cultured at 5 and 10 μm CuSO4. Previously, it was shown that protein levels of SODs were correlated to the transcript levels (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The protein level of PC was only mildly elevated in response to increases in copper in the media in this range (Fig. 1A); more severe reduction of PC levels and photosynthetic electron transport occurs at much lower copper levels (12.Abdel-Ghany S.E. Müller-Moulé P. Niyogi K.K. Pilon M. Shikanai T. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1233-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To study the molecular mechanism that regulates the CSD2 mRNA level in response to copper availability, we constructed transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing LUC under the control of the CSD2 promoter (CSD2pro::LUC). For this construct the intergenic region with the upstream gene and the 5′-untranslated region including the translational initiation codon of CSD2 was used. The in vivo LUC activity was monitored with a CCD camera in seedlings cultured on low copper (0.1 μm CuSO4) and sufficient copper (5 and 10 μm CuSO4) media. Unexpectedly, the same level of luminescence was detected at all copper conditions (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the level of CSD2 mRNA is not regulated in response to copper by transcriptional activity via the promoter. The CSD2 mRNA level may therefore be regulated in response to copper availability post-transcriptionally. To investigate this possibility, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively transcribe CSD2 mRNA (CSD2ox lines). Despite the control by the constitutive CaMV35S promoter, the accumulation of CSD2 mRNA strictly depended on copper concentrations (Fig. 1C) as was observed for the endogenous gene transcribed from the CSD2 promoter. Although the RNA level was higher in the CSD2ox lines than in the wild type even under low copper conditions, it was drastically elevated under sufficient copper conditions. To test the possibility that the activity of the CaMV35S promoter could perhaps somehow respond to copper availability, we tested the accumulation of mRNA derived from a different gene, PGR5 as a control. PGR5 is involved in photosystem I cyclic electron transport (35.Munekage Y. Hojo M. Meurer J. Endo T. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Cell. 2002; 110: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and its expression is unlikely to be affected by copper availability. In CaMV35S::PGR5 lines the PGR5 mRNA level was not influenced by copper concentrations (data not shown), indicating that copper availability does not affect the transcriptional activity of the CaMV35S promoter. Consistent with the results of RNA gel blot analysis, the CSD2 protein level responded to copper availability in CSD2ox lines (Fig. 1D). The activity of CSD2 also responded to the copper concentration in CSD2ox lines, as in the wild type (Fig. 1E). To test if copper regulation of CSD2 requires activity of the protein, we also constructed transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively express inactive CSD2 (CSD2ina lines). In Cu,Zn-SODs, five well conserved histidines are involved in the binding of a copper ion. The bound copper ion can cycle between the Cu(I) and Cu(II) redox states, which is necessary for catalytic activity (36.Hart P.J. Balbirnie M.M. Ogihara N.L. Nersissian A.M. Weiss M.S. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37.Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A change of the conserved His, which corresponds to His-48 in yeast and human Cu,Zn-SOD, should result in altered copper binding with loss of activity in CSD2ina lines. As expected, in lines that overaccumulate the CSD2ina protein we did not observe increased activity of SODs (Fig. 1E). In fact, compared with the wild type, the CSD2 activity in CSD2ina lines was even slightly reduced, probably as a result of competition for copper binding with overaccumulating CSD2ina (Fig. 1E). Despite the lack of activity of CSD2ina, the protein (Fig. 1F) and mRNA (Fig. 1G) levels were precisely regulated by copper, as in the lines overexpressing active CSD2 (CSD2ox-1). The level of CSD2 mRNA accumulation was lower in the two CSD2ina lines, even though both constructs share the same promoter. This difference is most likely explained by the position effect and a consequence of the random insertion of T-DNA during Agrobactrium-mediated transformation. We conclude that CSD2 expression is regulated by copper independently of the activity of the product. miR398 Targets CSD2 mRNA and Its Expression Is Regulated in Response to Copper Availability−A bioinformatic analysis of the Arabidopsis genome has suggested that a micro-RNA family, miR398, targets the mRNA of CSD1, CSD2, and COX5b-1 (21.Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). The targets of miR398 (Fig. 2A) are the coding region of CSD2 mRNA and the 5′-untranslated region of CSD1 mRNA (28.Sunkar R. Kapoor A. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2051-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) as well as the 5′-untranslated region of COX5b-1 mRNA (21.Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). The miR398 family consists of three genes, miR398a (localized to chromosome II), miR398b and miR398c (both localized to chromosome V). The sequences of mature miR398b and miR398c are identical, whereas the 3′ end nucleotide is different in miR398a (Fig. 2A). Recently, miR398 was shown to be involved in the regulation of CSD1 and CSD2 expression under oxidative stress conditions (28.Sunkar R. Kapoor A. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2051-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). We were interested to see if CSD2 expression in response to copper is regulated via miR398. To te"
https://openalex.org/W1988285822,"During their trajectories in still air, fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) explore their landscape using a series of straight flight paths punctuated by rapid 90 degrees body-saccades [1]. Some saccades are triggered by visual expansion associated with collision avoidance. Yet many saccades are not triggered by visual cues, but rather appear spontaneously. Our analysis reveals that the control of these visually independent saccades and the flight intervals between them constitute an optimal scale-free active searching strategy. Two characteristics of mathematical optimality that are apparent during free-flight in Drosophila are inter-saccade interval lengths distributed according to an inverse square law, which does not vary across landscape scale, and 90 degrees saccade angles, which increase the likelihood that territory will be revisited and thereby reduce the likelihood that near-by targets will be missed. We also show that searching is intermittent, such that active searching phases randomly alternate with relocation phases. Behaviorally, this intermittency is reflected in frequently occurring short, slow speed inter-saccade intervals randomly alternating with rarer, longer, faster inter-saccade intervals. Searching patterns that scale similarly across orders of magnitude of length (i.e., scale-free) have been revealed in animals as diverse as microzooplankton, bumblebees, albatrosses, and spider monkeys, but these do not appear to be optimised with respect to turning angle, whereas Drosophila free-flight search does. Also, intermittent searching patterns, such as those reported here for Drosophila, have been observed in foragers such as planktivorous fish and ground foraging birds. Our results with freely flying Drosophila may constitute the first reported example of searching behaviour that is both scale-free and intermittent."
https://openalex.org/W1995038549,"Background Since the creation of “Golden Rice”, biofortification of plant-derived foods is a promising strategy for the alleviation of nutritional deficiencies. Potato is the most important staple food for mankind after the cereals rice, wheat and maize, and is extremely poor in provitamin A carotenoids. Methodology We transformed potato with a mini-pathway of bacterial origin, driving the synthesis of beta-carotene (Provitamin A) from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Three genes, encoding phytoene synthase (CrtB), phytoene desaturase (CrtI) and lycopene beta-cyclase (CrtY) from Erwinia, under tuber-specific or constitutive promoter control, were used. 86 independent transgenic lines, containing six different promoter/gene combinations, were produced and analyzed. Extensive regulatory effects on the expression of endogenous genes for carotenoid biosynthesis are observed in transgenic lines. Constitutive expression of the CrtY and/or CrtI genes interferes with the establishment of transgenosis and with the accumulation of leaf carotenoids. Expression of all three genes, under tuber-specific promoter control, results in tubers with a deep yellow (“golden”) phenotype without any adverse leaf phenotypes. In these tubers, carotenoids increase approx. 20-fold, to 114 mcg/g dry weight and beta-carotene 3600-fold, to 47 mcg/g dry weight. Conclusions This is the highest carotenoid and beta-carotene content reported for biofortified potato as well as for any of the four major staple foods (the next best event being “Golden Rice 2”, with 31 mcg/g dry weight beta-carotene). Assuming a beta-carotene to retinol conversion of 6∶1, this is sufficient to provide 50% of the Recommended Daily Allowance of Vitamin A with 250 gms (fresh weight) of “golden” potatoes."

Thus, a dense network of lateral connections distributes odor-evoked excitation between channels in the first brain region of the olfactory processing stream. All the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that express the same odorant receptor gene respond similarly to odors, and all project to the same sphere of neuropil (glomerulus) in the brain (Buck, 1996Buck L.B. Information coding in the vertebrate olfactory system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 517-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in most species, each second-order olfactory neuron receives direct synaptic input from only one glomerulus. Thus, each odorant receptor gene defines a unique parallel processing channel in the olfactory system. There is good evidence for crosstalk between these glomerular channels very early in the olfactory system, as early as the level of second-order neurons. Anatomically, glomeruli are interconnected by a network of local interneurons. Functionally, synaptic connections have been demonstrated between interneurons and second-order principal neurons, both in the insect antennal lobe and in the mammalian olfactory bulb (Jahr and Nicoll, 1980Jahr C.E.

Role of GABAergic inhibition in shaping odor-evoked spatiotemporal patterns in the Drosophila antennal lobe.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9069-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It seems likely that these lateral connections have a role in shaping the output of the olfactory bulb and the antennal lobe. However, none of these studies has directly assessed the net effect of glomerular crosstalk on second-order neurons during in vivo odor stimulation. Understanding how the antennal lobe and olfactory bulb transform olfactory representations requires an in vivo characterization of interglomerular synaptic connections. Is the net effect of these lateral connections inhibitory or excitatory? How powerful are these connections compared to direct ORN inputs? How does the amount of lateral input to a second-order neuron vary across odor stimuli? What rules govern the pattern of synaptic connectivity between glomeruli? Is a single glomerulus only connected with glomeruli in its local vicinity? Is each glomerulus only connected to a few others, or is the pattern of connectivity more dense? Is there a correlation between glomerular connectivity and odor tuning? To what extent is the pattern of lateral connectivity stereotyped from one animal to the next? The most direct way to characterize lateral input to a second-order olfactory neuron would be to silence its direct ORN inputs while preserving ORN input to another glomerulus or glomeruli. Any remaining odor responses in cells postsynaptic to a “silent” glomerulus should reflect purely lateral inputs. This type of experiment is currently not possible in vertebrates, so we have turned to the Drosophila antennal lobe. This structure shares the same basic architecture as the vertebrate olfactory bulb but presents several experimental advantages. First, the odorant receptor gene expressed by most Drosophila ORN types has already been identified and mapped onto spatially stereotyped glomeruli in the antennal lobe (Couto et al., 2005Couto A.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1535-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005Fishilevich E. Vosshall L.B.

Coding of odors by a receptor repertoire.Cell. 2006; 125: 143-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Second, the circuitry of the Drosophila antennal lobe develops properly in the absence of normal olfactory activity, and ORNs target the correct glomerulus even when they do not express a functional receptor (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A. van der Goes van Naters W. Warr C.G. Steinbrecht R.A. Carlson J.R. Integrating the molecular and cellular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2003; 37: 827-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, Berdnik et al., 2006Berdnik D. Chihara T. Couto A. Luo L. Wiring stability of the adult Drosophila olfactory circuit after lesion.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally there are only ∼50 glomeruli in the Drosophila antennal lobe, as compared to ∼1000 in the mouse olfactory bulb (Laissue et al., 1999Laissue P.P. Reiter C. Hiesinger P.R. Halter S. Fischbach K.F. Stocker R.F. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the antennal lobe in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 405: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This makes it possible to record from second-order neurons (called projection neurons, or PNs) postsynaptic to an identified ORN input. Importantly, like olfactory bulb mitral cells in most vertebrates, PNs in the Drosophila antennal lobe receive direct ORN input from a single glomerulus. Circumstantial evidence suggests that interglomerular connections shape PN odor responses in Drosophila. A comparison of odor-evoked responses in ORNs and PNs corresponding to the same glomerulus revealed that the rank order of a PN's odor preferences can be different from the preferences of its presynaptic ORNs (Wilson et al., 2004Wilson R.I. Turner G.C. Laurent G. Transformation of olfactory representations in the Drosophila antennal lobe.Science. 2004; 303: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This argues that a PN's responses are not completely determined by its direct ORN inputs. Instead, it implies that PNs integrate input from multiple ORN types. However, this conclusion has been challenged by functional imaging studies (Ng et al., 2002Ng M. Roorda R.D. Lima S.Q. Zemelman B.V. Morcillo P. Miesenbock G. Transmission of olfactory information between three populations of neurons in the antennal lobe of the fly.Neuron. 2002; 36: 463-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2003Wang J.W. Wong A.M. Flores J. Vosshall L.B. Axel R. Two-photon calcium imaging reveals an odor-evoked map of activity in the fly brain.Cell. 2003; 112: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Here, we use a variety of genetic manipulations and microdissections to remove direct ORN inputs to one or more glomeruli in the Drosophila antennal lobe. In vivo recordings from PNs postsynaptic to “silent” glomeruli reveal that these PNs receive lateral inputs from other glomeruli. The net effect of lateral synaptic inputs to PNs is predominantly excitatory and can be strong enough to trigger a train of action potentials. In order to define the functional connectivity between identified glomeruli, we have generated flies with only a single active ORN type. Stimulation of just one ORN type is sufficient to recruit lateral excitatory inputs to other glomeruli, but this sensitivity also leads to saturation as more ORN types are activated. A single glomerulus provides indirect excitatory input to most, if not all, glomeruli, thus defining a dense network of lateral connections spanning the entire antennal lobe. However, some lateral excitatory connections are substantially stronger than others. Finally, we find that this pattern of connection strengths is relatively stereotyped across flies, suggesting that it may be genetically hardwired. These findings directly demonstrate that synaptic crosstalk between glomeruli can shape PN odor responses in vivo. Furthermore, our results reveal some of the fundamental rules governing these interglomerular interactions. The Drosophila antennal lobes receive olfactory input from two peripheral organs, the antennae and the maxillary palps. The palps contain ∼120 ORNs which fall into six distinct types not found in the antennae (de Bruyne et al., 1999de Bruyne M. Clyne P.J. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in a model olfactory organ: the Drosophila maxillary palp.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4520-4532PubMed Google Scholar, Goldman et al., 2005Goldman A.L. van der Goes van Naters W. Lessing D. Warr C.G. Carlson J.R. Coexpression of two functional odor receptors in one neuron.Neuron. 2005; 45: 661-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The antennae contain an additional 43 ORN types not found in the palps (de Bruyne et al., 2001de Bruyne M. Foster K. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2001; 30: 537-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, Hallem et al., 2004Hallem E.A. Ho M.G. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Thus, each glomerulus receives direct ORN input exclusively from either the palps or the antennae. Within the antennal lobe, the six palp glomeruli are intermingled with the 43 antennal glomeruli (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the Drosophila olfactory system.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1535-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005Fishilevich E. Vosshall L.B. Genetic and functional subdivision of the Drosophila antennal lobe.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This anatomy provides a convenient way to independently manipulate inputs to two groups of glomeruli. In order to determine whether interactions between glomeruli shape PN odor responses, we began by acutely severing the antennal nerves. This manipulation leaves the palp ORNs intact and allows us to test whether antennal PNs receive lateral input from palp glomeruli (Figure 1A). Consistent with previous reports (Berdnik et al., 2006Berdnik D. Chihara T. Couto A. Luo L. Wiring stability of the adult Drosophila olfactory circuit after lesion.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we found that ablating ORN input to some glomeruli does not induce morphological rearrangement of the remaining ORN axons, even five days postsurgery (Figure 1B). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that removing ORN input to some glomeruli induces more subtle synaptic plasticity of interglomerular connections. Therefore, we performed PN recordings immediately after severing the antennal nerves in order to rule out a role for any such plasticity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from PNs typically show abundant spontaneous synaptic input (Figure 1C). In contrast, PNs postsynaptic to antennal glomeruli in antennae-less flies show no spontaneous activity (Figures 1D and 1E). Nevertheless, odor stimulation of the maxillary palps evokes a depolarization in these PNs (n = 6 PNs in 6 flies; Figures 1D and 1E). The magnitude of this depolarization varied across cells but was sufficient to produce a train of spikes in a PN postsynaptic to glomerulus VC3, for example (Figure 1E). We confirmed that each of the PNs we recorded from innervated an antennal glomerulus by filling the cell with biocytin (see Experimental Procedures). We averaged the membrane potential across six presentations of the same odor in the same cell (Figure 1F) before averaging across experiments (Figure 1G). All these odors strongly activate one or more palp ORN types (de Bruyne et al., 1999de Bruyne M. Clyne P.J. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in a model olfactory organ: the Drosophila maxillary palp.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4520-4532PubMed Google Scholar), and all elicited a substantial depolarization in each of the antennal PNs we recorded from. The solvent we use to dilute our odors (paraffin oil) evoked no response (Figure 1G). Removing both antennae and maxillary palps abolished odor-evoked depolarizations (n = 3), demonstrating that the maxillary palps mediate this response (Figure 1G). These results demonstrate that antennal PNs receive lateral synaptic input from palp ORNs and that the net effect of this indirect input is excitatory. It is possible that some interglomerular synapses hyperpolarize PNs, but if so, this inhibition is evidently obscured by a larger excitatory component. It is important to note that ORN input was removed acutely (∼10–20 min before recording). Therefore, the lateral excitation we observed cannot reflect remodeling of the antennal lobe circuitry. What is the total impact of all lateral synaptic input to a PN? In order to answer this question, we selectively silenced a single ORN type. By recording from PNs postsynaptic to the “silent” glomerulus while stimulating the antennae and palps with odors, we should be able to observe the total lateral input to that PN. In order to silence a single ORN type, we used flies with mutations in one of two odorant receptor genes, Or43b and Or10a. Or43b is expressed in ORNs that project to glomerulus VM2, and Or10a is expressed in ORNs that project to glomerulus DL1 (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J.

The Or10af03694 allele results from a pBac insertion in the gene (Thibault et al., 2004Thibault S.T. Singer M.A. Miyazaki W.Y. Milash B. Dompe N.A. Singh C.M. Buchholz R. Demsky M. Fawcett R. Francis-Lang H.L. et al.A complementary transposon tool kit for Drosophila melanogaster using P and piggyBac.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) but has not been characterized previously. We first verified that this mutation does not disrupt ORN axon targeting (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). We then confirmed that both the Or43b1 and Or10af03694 mutations virtually abolish ORN odor responses (Figures S1B–S1D). We occasionally observed very weak responses to a few specific odors in both mutants (Figure S2). These weak responses may be mediated by Or83b, a protein with homology to odorant receptors that is expressed in most ORNs and which is required for trafficking receptors to the cell membrane (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B. Or83b encodes a broadly expressed odorant receptor essential for Drosophila olfaction.Neuron. 2004; 43: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). We did not use these odors in our stimulus set when we analyzed PN responses in these mutants (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Note that these mutations also reduce the rate of spontaneous ORN spikes (Figure S1C). We then recorded from PNs postsynaptic to these “silent” ORNs (Figure 2A). In flies with the mutation that silences VM2 ORNs, we targeted VM2 PNs using an enhancer trap line (Tanaka et al., 2004Tanaka N.K. Awasaki T. Shimada T. Ito K. Integration of chemosensory pathways in the Drosophila second-order olfactory centers.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to specifically label these cells with GFP (NP5103-Gal4,UAS-CD8:GFP;Or43b1). We recorded from one PN per fly and confirmed the glomerular identity of each recorded PN by imaging the biocytin fill post hoc. As expected from the decrease in spontaneous activity in mutant ORNs, spontaneous spiking in VM2 PNs was reduced compared to wild-type (Figures 2B and 2C). Similarly, in flies with mutant DL1 ORNs, we recorded from DL1 PNs using an enhancer trap line (Tanaka et al., 2004Tanaka N.K. Awasaki T. Shimada T. Ito K. Integration of chemosensory pathways in the Drosophila second-order olfactory centers.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to specifically label these cells with GFP (Or10af03694;+/+;NP3529-Gal4,UAS-nlsGFP). Again, spontaneous spiking was reduced in these PNs (Figures 2B and 2D). We confirmed that these PNs show normal dendrite morphology in the absence of functional ORNs (Figures 2C and 2D), consistent with previous reports (Wong et al., 2002Wong A.M. Wang J.W. Axel R. Spatial representation of the glomerular map in the Drosophila protocerebrum.Cell. 2002; 109: 229-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, Berdnik et al., 2006Berdnik D. Chihara T. Couto A. Luo L. Wiring stability of the adult Drosophila olfactory circuit after lesion.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3367-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In flies with silent VM2 ORNs, all VM2 PNs were depolarized by every odor we tested (n = 10 cells in 10 flies), with the exception of 4-methyl phenol, which failed to elicit any activity in two cells. These depolarizations were typically large enough to trigger a train of action potentials (Figure 3). Similarly, in flies with silent DL1 ORNs, all DL1 PNs were depolarized by every odor we tested (n = 10 cells in 10 flies). Again, most responses were large enough to elicit a train of spikes. We also saw similar spiking responses to odors in cell-attached mode (prior to going whole-cell), demonstrating that these depolarizations are not an artifact of intracellular dialysis. As expected, most odors evoked a larger response in wild-type flies than in mutant flies. For example, ethyl butyrate elicits vigorous activity in normal VM2 ORNs (Figure S1) and in wild-type VM2 PNs. When the VM2 ORNs are silenced, this odor elicits a much smaller response in VM2 PNs (Figure 3A1). Similarly, methyl salicylate evokes a very strong response in DL1 ORNs (Figure S1) and in wild-type DL1 PNs but only a small response in DL1 PNs postsynaptic to silent ORNs (Figure 3B1). We also noticed that in PNs postsynaptic to silent ORNs, odor-evoked responses were often more transient than in wild-type PNs (Figures 3A1 and 3B1). Some odor responses, however, were relatively unaffected by odorant receptor mutations. For example, 2,3-butanedione evokes very little response in wild-type VM2 ORNs (Figure S1). When these ORNs are silenced, the response of VM2 PNs to this odor is virtually unaltered (Figure 3A2). Similarly, ethyl acetate does not excite wild-type DL1 ORNs (Figure S1). Accordingly, the response of DL1 PNs to ethyl acetate is undiminished by silencing their presynaptic ORNs (Figure 3B2). How does the size of total lateral input to a PN depend on the odor stimulus? We quantified odor responses by computing mean firing rates over the 500 ms duration of the odor stimulus, and we plotted these response magnitudes for each odor stimulus to produce tuning curves (Figures 4A and 4B). These plots show that different odors evoke different amounts of lateral excitatory input to each PN. However, the odor tuning of PNs postsynaptic to silent ORNs is completely different from the normal odor tuning of these PNs. For both glomeruli, the odor tuning of wild-type and mutant PNs showed no significant correlation (both comparisons Pearson's r2 < 0.05, p > 0.4). We also noted that, in the absence of direct ORN inputs, both VM2 PNs and DL1 PNs are broadly tuned to odors. This suggests that each of these glomeruli receives indirect excitatory input from multiple ORN types, not just one or two. We wondered whether these two glomeruli receive indirect input from similar or different populations of ORNs. To assess this, we compared the responses of PNs in these two “silent” glomeruli to the same odors. Overall, the responses of these two PN types are significantly correlated (Figure 4C; Pearson's r2 = 0.31, p < 0.05). However, some odors elicit different amounts of lateral input to these glomeruli. For example, butyric acid elicits a larger response in VM2 than in DL1 (p = 0.05, t test, n = 6 for each glomerulus). These results are consistent with the idea that these two glomeruli receive indirect input from overlapping populations of ORNs but that the indirect inputs to these PNs are not identical. Because total lateral excitatory input to VM2 and DL1 PNs is broadly tuned and significantly correlated, it is likely that two glomeruli receive indirect input from many of the same ORNs. This, in turn, implies that each ORN type provides indirect input to many glomeruli. To test this prediction directly, we designed experiments to measure the spread of excitation across the antennal lobe evoked by activation of a single ORN type. We used two approaches to selectively stimulate one ORN type (Figure 5). These two approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses but yielded similar results. In the first method (experiment 1), we took advantage of a mutation in Or83b. This gene is expressed in most ORNs and encodes a chaperone protein required for trafficking odorant receptors to ORN dendrites (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B.

Sachse S. Michnick S.W. Vosshall L.B.

Mutating Or83b abolishes odor responses in all maxillary palp ORNs (and many antennal ORNs; Figure S3). Thus, all ORN input to the antennal lobes is abolished by removing the antennae of mutant flies. In these flies, we then rescued normal function in the maxillary palp ORNs that project to glomerulus VA7l. This was done by expressing Or83b under the control of the odorant receptor gene promoter corresponding to the VA7l ORNs (Or46-Gal4/UAS-Or83b;Or83b2; Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005Fishilevich E. Vosshall L.B. Genetic and functional subdivision of the Drosophila antennal lobe.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1548-1553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). We verified the specificity of this rescue by making extracellular ORN recordings from the maxillary palps. Each sensillum in the palp contains exactly two ORNs, and a VA7l ORN is always paired with an ORN that projects to another glomerulus (de Bruyne et al., 1999de Bruyne M. Clyne P.J. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in a model olfactory organ: the Drosophila maxillary palp.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4520-4532PubMed Google Scholar, Goldman et al., 2005Goldman A.L. van der Goes van Naters W. Lessing D. Warr C.G. Carlson J.R. Coexpression of two functional odor receptors in one neuron.Neuron. 2005; 45: 661-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the palps of “rescued” flies, we encountered only silent sensilla, or sensilla containing exactly one spontaneously active ORN (n = 51 sensilla). This ORN always displayed odor tuning that matched the odor tuning of wild-type VA7l ORNs (Figures 5B and S4). We verified that the rescued ORNs correctly target glomerulus VA7l by coexpressing CD8:GFP with Or83b (Figure 5C). Furthermore, biocytin fills show that PNs postsynaptic to neighboring glomeruli do not inappropriately invade glomerulus VA7l (Figure 5C). This argues that the antennal lobe circuitry is grossly normal in the Or83b2 mutant. This approach permits us to selectively stimulate exactly one ORN type. However, it has the drawback that most ORN types are inactive during the development of the fly, which could conceivably produce subtle changes in the antennal lobe circuitry. To address this issue, we used a second method to stimulate one ORN type under conditions in which almost all ORNs are normal and active throughout the life of the fly; this ensures that normal antennal lobe circuitry is pre"
https://openalex.org/W2013957985,"Social approach is crucial for establishing relationships among individuals. In rodents, social approach has been studied primarily within the context of behavioral phenomena related to sexual reproduction, such as mating, territory defense and parental care. However, many forms of social interaction occur before the onset of reproductive maturity, which suggests that some processes underlying social approach among juvenile animals are probably distinct from those in adults. We conducted a longitudinal study of social investigation (SI) in mice from two inbred strains to assess the extent to which genetic factors influence the motivation for young mice to approach one another. Early-adolescent C57BL/6J (B6) mice, tested 4-6 days after weaning, investigated former cage mates to a greater degree than BALB/cJ (BALB) mice, irrespective of the sex composition within an interacting pair. This strain difference was not due to variation in maternal care, the phenotypic characteristics of stimulus mice or sensitivity to the length of isolation prior to testing, nor was it attributable to a general difference in appetitive motivation. Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) production was positively correlated with the SI responses of mice from both strains. Interestingly, several USV characteristics segregated with the genetic background of young mice, including a higher average frequency and shorter duration for the USVs emitted by B6 mice. An assessment of conditioned place preference responses indicated that there was a strain-dependent difference in the rewarding nature of social contact. As adolescent mice aged, SI responses gradually became less sensitive to genetic background and more responsive to the particular sex of individuals within an interacting pair. We have thus identified a specific, genetic influence on the motivation of early-adolescent mice to approach one another. Consistent with classical theories of motivation, which propose a functional relationship between behavioral approach and reward, our findings indicate that reward is a proximal mechanism through which genetic factors affect social motivation during early adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2077516679,"Nicotine enhances attention and working memory by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for these cognitive functions and is also rich in nAChR expression. Specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying nicotine's effects on cognition remain elusive. Here we show that nicotine exposure increases the threshold for synaptic spike-timing-dependent potentiation (STDP) in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse PFC. During coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, nicotine reduces dendritic calcium signals associated with action potential propagation by enhancing GABAergic transmission. This results from a series of presynaptic actions involving different PFC interneurons and multiple nAChR subtypes. Pharmacological block of nAChRs or GABA(A) receptors prevented nicotine's actions and restored STDP, as did increasing dendritic calcium signals with stronger postsynaptic activity. Thus, by activating nAChRs distributed throughout the PFC neuronal network, nicotine affects PFC information processing and storage by increasing the amount of postsynaptic activity necessary to induce STDP."
https://openalex.org/W2146353372,"Simple cells in primary visual cortex exhibit contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in seeming contradiction to feed-forward models that rely on lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input alone. Contrast invariance has therefore been thought to depend on the presence of intracortical lateral inhibition. In vivo intracellular recordings instead suggest that contrast invariance can be explained by three properties of the excitatory pathway. (1) Depolarizations evoked by orthogonal stimuli are determined by the amount of excitation a cell receives from the LGN, relative to the excitation it receives from other cortical cells. (2) Depolarizations evoked by preferred stimuli saturate at lower contrasts than the spike output of LGN relay cells. (3) Visual stimuli evoke contrast-dependent changes in trial-to-trial variability, which lead to contrast-dependent changes in the relationship between membrane potential and spike rate. Thus, high-contrast, orthogonally oriented stimuli that evoke significant depolarizations evoke few spikes. Together these mechanisms, without lateral inhibition, can account for contrast-invariant stimulus selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1994955948,"Damage to orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been associated with deficits in reversal learning. OFC damage also causes inflexible associative encoding in basolateral amygdala (ABL) during reversal learning. Here we provide a critical test of the hypothesis that the reversal deficit in OFC-lesioned rats is caused by this inflexible encoding in ABL. Rats with bilateral neurotoxic lesions of OFC, ABL, or both areas were tested on a series of two-odor go/no-go discrimination problems, followed by two serial reversals of the final problem. As expected, all groups acquired the initial problems at the same rate, and rats with OFC lesions were slower to acquire the reversals than sham controls. This impairment was abolished by accompanying ABL lesions, while ABL lesions alone had no effect on reversal learning. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that OFC facilitates cognitive flexibility by promoting updating of associative encoding in downstream brain areas."

The subfornical organ (SFO) is the center of the sensing responsible for the control of salt-intake behavior, where Nax channels are expressed in specific glial cells as the Na-level sensor. Here, we show direct interaction between Nax channels and α subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase, which brings about Na-dependent activation of the metabolic state of the glial cells. The metabolic enhancement leading to extensive lactate production was observed in the SFO of wild-type mice, but not of the Nax-knockout mice. Furthermore, lactate, as well as Na, stimulated the activity of GABAergic neurons in the SFO. These results suggest that the information on a physiological increase of the Na level in body fluids sensed by Nax in glial cells is transmitted to neurons by lactate as a mediator to regulate neural activities of the SFO.

Because Na homeostasis is essential to life, Na-ion concentrations in plasma and CSF are continuously monitored to maintain a physiological level of Na in body fluids. A specific Na sensor has been long hypothesized to exist in the brain for the control of Na intake (Denton et al., 1996Denton D.A. McKinley M.J. Weisinger R.S.

The site for the sensing was postulated in the circumventricular organs (CVOs) in the periventricular region of the brain (Cox et al., 1987Cox P.S. Denton D.A. Mouw D.R. Tarjan E.

The CVOs, midline structures found in the brains of all vertebrates (McKinley et al., 2003McKinley M.J. McAllen R.M. Davern P. Giles M.E. Penschow J. Sunn N. Uschakov A. Oldfield B.J. The sensory circumventricular organs of the mammalian brain.Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 2003; 172 (1–122): III-XIIPubMed Google Scholar), are so named because of their proximity to the ventricles of the brain. Their specialized common features are extensive vascularization, no blood-brain barrier, and atypical ependymal cells. Only three loci in the CVOs, the subfornical organ (SFO), organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), and area postrema (AP), harbor neuronal cell bodies, which have efferent neural connections to many other areas of the brain. Their neurons are supposedly exposed to the chemical environment of the general circulation, unlike other neuronal perikarya in the CNS, because of the lack of a normal blood-brain barrier. Therefore, these three CVOs are termed “sensory circumventricular organs” (Johnson and Gross, 1993Johnson A.K. Gross P.M. Sensory circumventricular organs and brain homeostatic pathways.FASEB J. 1993; 7: 678-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that Nax, an atypical Na channel whose structure is poorly homologous to the voltage-gated Na channels (Goldin et al., 2000Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F. Howe J.R. Hunter J.C. Kallen R.G. Mandel G. Meisler M.H. Netter Y.B. et al.Nomenclature of voltage-gated Na channels.Neuron. 2000; 28: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), is expressed in the four CVOs, the SFO, OVLT, median eminence (ME), and posterior pituitary (Watanabe et al., 2000Watanabe E. Fujikawa A. Matsunaga H. Yasoshima Y. Sako N. Yamamoto T. Saegusa C. Noda M. Nav2/NaG channel is involved in control of salt-intake behavior in the CNS.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7743-7751PubMed Google Scholar). Nax-KO mice showed marked neuronal activation in the SFO and OVLT after water deprivation compared with wild-type mice as estimated by Fos immunoreactivity (Watanabe et al., 2000Watanabe E. Fujikawa A. Matsunaga H. Yasoshima Y. Sako N. Yamamoto T. Saegusa C. Noda M. Nav2/NaG channel is involved in control of salt-intake behavior in the CNS.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7743-7751PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Nax-KO mice did not stop ingesting salt when dehydrated, while wild-type mice avoided salt (Hiyama et al., 2004Hiyama T.Y. Watanabe E. Okado H. Noda M. The subfornical organ is the primary locus of Na-level sensing by Nax Na channels for the control of salt-intake behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Watanabe et al., 2000Watanabe E. Fujikawa A. Matsunaga H. Yasoshima Y. Sako N. Yamamoto T. Saegusa C. Noda M. Nav2/NaG channel is involved in control of salt-intake behavior in the CNS.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7743-7751PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that the Nax channel is a concentration-sensitive Na channel with a threshold value of ∼150 mM for the extracellular Na ion (Hiyama et al., 2002Hiyama T.Y. Watanabe E. Ono K. Inenaga K. Tamkun M.M. Yoshida S. Noda M. Nax channel involved in CNS Na-level sensing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 511-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We further showed that salt-aversive behavior does not occur on direct infusion of a hypertonic Na solution into the cerebral ventricle in Nax-KO mice in contrast to wild-type mice (Hiyama et al., 2004Hiyama T.Y. Watanabe E. Okado H. Noda M. The subfornical organ is the primary locus of Na-level sensing by Nax Na channels for the control of salt-intake behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The behavioral phenotype of Nax-KO mice was completely recovered by a site-directed transfer of the Nax gene with an adenoviral vector into the SFO (Hiyama et al., 2004Hiyama T.Y. Watanabe E. Okado H. Noda M. The subfornical organ is the primary locus of Na-level sensing by Nax Na channels for the control of salt-intake behavior.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9276-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All these findings indicate that the Nax channel is the brain's Na-level sensor (Noda, 2006Noda M. The subfornical organ, a specialized Na channel, and the sensing of Na levels in the brain.Neuroscientist. 2006; 12: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that was postulated to be present in the CVOs involved in the regulation of water/salt intake (Andersson, 1978Andersson B. Regulation of water intake.Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 582-603PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we found that Nax channels are specifically expressed in perineuronal processes of astrocytes and ependymal cells enveloping particular neural populations in the sensory CVOs (Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe E. Hiyama T.Y. Shimizu H. Kodama R. Hayashi N. Miyata S. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Noda M. Na-level-sensitive Na channel Nax is expressed in glial laminate processes in the sensory circumventricular organs.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R568-R576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These Nax-positive glial cells were sensitive to an increase in the extracellular Na level, indicating that glial cells, not neurons, are the primary site of Na-level sensing. Thus, the mechanism by which the Na signal sensed by “inexcitable” glial cells is transferred to neurons has remained to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that Nax channels stably interact with Na+/K+-ATPase to assist in the activation and Na+ influx by Nax channels stimulates anaerobic glucose metabolism in the glial cells. The resultant lactate released from the glial cells appeared to play a crucial role in the control of neuronal activities involved in the Na-intake behavior in the brain. To better understand the physiological processes involving Nax in glial cells, we screened for molecules interacting with Nax using the yeast two-hybrid system with each of the cytoplasmic domains of mouse Nax as bait. Among the positive clones isolated from a mouse DRG cDNA library by using the C-terminal region of Nax (amino acid residues 1489–1681) as bait (Figure 1A, left), three clones coded for the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase. A detailed analysis revealed that all of these clones were identical and coded for the amino acid residues 596–717 of the α1 isoform, a position close to the cytoplasmic catalytic domain of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (Figure 1A, right; Figure 1B). The direct interaction between the C-terminal region of Nax and the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase was verified by pull-down assays (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). We further examined the interaction between the full-length mouse α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and full-length Nax protein by establishing C6 cell lines expressing Nax (C6M16; see next section). Following the immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with a specific antibody (6H antibody) to the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase, a Western blot analysis with anti-Nax-channel antibodies was performed. The 6H antibody efficiently pulled down both Nax (∼200 kDa) and the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase at ∼110 kDa (Figure 1C), demonstrating an interaction between the two proteins in living cells. Anti-HA used as a control antibody did not pull down either the Nax channel or the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (Figure 1C, Con). Coexpression of the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and Nax channels was examined by double-fluorescent immunostaining using sections of the SFO and dissociated cells from the SFO. The α1 subunit was broadly distributed throughout the SFO, overlapping with the expression of Nax channels (Figure 1D). The confocal microscopic analyses with isolated cells from the SFO showed that both molecules were colocalized in the plasma membrane (Figure 1E). Nax channels were expressed in large round cells, but not in small cells with neurite-like processes: we know that the former are glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial cells including ependymal cells, and the latter are neurons (see Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe E. Hiyama T.Y. Shimizu H. Kodama R. Hayashi N. Miyata S. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Noda M.

Physiol. 2006; 290: R568-R576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase was expressed in both cell types, as expected (Figure 1E). Because the α2 and α3 isoforms of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase are also expressed in the nervous system (Shamraj and Lingrel, 1994Shamraj O.I. Lingrel J.B. A putative fourth Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-subunit gene is expressed in testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 12952-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we subsequently examined the interaction of the α2 and α3 isoforms with the C-terminal region of Nax. Experiments using the yeast two-hybrid system showed that the cytoplasmic fragment of α2 corresponding to the region of the α1 isoform isolated (amino acids 593–714, Figure 1B) also interacted with the C-terminal region of Nax, but that of α3 (586–707, Figure 1B) did not (Figure 1F). To know whether the three α subunit isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase are coexpressed with Nax channels in astrocytes and ependymal cells of the SFO, we performed in situ hybridization using adult mouse SFO tissue sections. The mRNAs encoding the α1 and α2 isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase were expressed in the SFO with a similar pattern to the Nax channels (Figures 1Ga–1Gc). However, signals for the α3 isoform were not detected in the SFO (Figure 1Gd). Attempts to establish stable cell lines expressing functional Nax channels have been long unsuccessful. Therefore, we turned our attention to developing cell lines in which the expression of Nax channel is inducible under the control of the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE). In this system, Nax expression is induced by a transactivator, Tet-Off, which is then transfected and expressed with an adenoviral vector: it is possible to suppress the expression again in the presence of a tetracycline analog, doxycycline (Dox), in this system (Figure 2A). C6 is a rat glioma cell line devoid of endogenous Nax expression (Gautron et al., 1992Gautron S. Dos Santos G. Pinto-Henrique D. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Berwald-Netter Y. The glial voltage-gated Na channel: cell- and tissue-specific mRNA expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 7272-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We established four such inducible cell lines from C6 cells by transfection of an expression vector for Nax. Figures 2B–2D show characteristic features of one of the four cell lines, C6M16. The expression of Nax proteins began to be detected 24 hr after the viral transfection of the Tet-Off activator (Figure 2B, lane 2). The expression was completely inhibited with Dox at a concentration of 10 ng/ml or more (Figure 2B, lane 4). Immunocytochemistry with anti-Nax-channel antibodies confirmed these results (Figure 2C): intensive immunopositive signals were observed in the plasma membrane of the cells only when the expression of Nax was induced (Figure 2Cb). Colocalization of the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase and Nax channels at the subcellular level was observed in C6M16 cells by double-fluorescent immunocytochemistry (Figure S2, 145 mM). By using an intracellular Na-ion-imaging technique, we recently demonstrated that Nax-positive cells dissociated from the SFO specifically show Na+ influx in response to an increase of the extracellular Na level above the physiological level (Hiyama et al., 2002Hiyama T.Y.

Physiol. 2006; 290: R568-R576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether the Nax-expressing C6M16 cells acquired such Na sensitivity using the same method. As shown in Figure 2D, C6M16 cells showed significant Na+ influx in response to an increase in the extracellular Na level within the physiological range (from 145 mM to 170 mM) specifically under the conditions where Nax channels are expressed. The results clearly indicated that functional Nax channels were expressed in C6M16 cells through induction by Tet-Off. Similar results were obtained with the other three C6 lines (data not shown). Our immunocytochemical experiments indicated that the change of the extracellular Na level did not affect the colocalization of Nax channels and the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase at the light microscopic level resolution (Figure S2, compare 145 mM and 170 mM), suggesting a constitutive interaction between the two. The close interaction of Nax channels with the α subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase raised the notion that Nax channels have a direct influence on molecular properties of the Na+/K+-ATPase. If it were the case, cellular energy metabolism should be affected, because cells in the CNS use ∼50% of their energy resources to drive the Na+/K+-ATPase activity (Rosenthal and Sick, 1992Rosenthal M. Sick T.J. Glycolytic and oxidative metabolic contributions to potassium ion transport in rat cerebral cortex.Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: S165-S169Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In order to explore this possibility, we measured glucose uptake activity of the C6M16 cells by using a fluorescent glucose derivative, 2-NBDG (Yoshioka et al., 1996Yoshioka K. Takahashi H. Homma T. Saito M. Oh K.B. Nemoto Y. Matsuoka H. A novel fluorescent derivative of glucose applicable to the assessment of glucose uptake activity of Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Yamada et al., 2000Yamada K. Nakata M. Horimoto N. Saito M. Matsuoka H. Inagaki N. Measurement of glucose uptake and intracellular calcium concentration in single, living pancreatic beta-cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22278-22283Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar): Rb+, which is often used for measuring activities of Na+/K+-ATPase directly (Serpersu and Tsong, 1984Serpersu E.H. Tsong T.Y. Activation of electrogenic Rb+ transport of (Na,K)-ATPase by an electric field.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7155-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not suitable in this case because Rb+ affects Nax function (our unpublished data). C6M16 cells 36 hr after the viral transfection with or without the Tet-Off transactivator were used for the analysis (Figure 3A). The C6M16 cells did not show significant uptake of 2-NBDG in the 145 mM solution when the expression of Nax was not induced (Con). In contrast, upon the expression of Nax (Nax), the cells showed substantial increase in 2-NBDG uptake in the 145 mM solution (Figure 3B, Nax in 145 mM of C6M16). However, the enhancement was ouabain insensitive, indicating that it is independent of the Na+/K+-ATPase activity (compare Nax with and without ouabain in 145 mM of C6M16 cells). Here, it should be noted that this substantial 2-NBDG uptake in C6M16 cells in the 145 mM Na solution is not observed in the native cells (see below and Figure 5). We then compared the cellular activities of 2-NBDG uptake in isotonic (145 mM) and hypertonic (170 mM) Na solutions. The C6M16 cells with Nax expression (Nax) showed ∼1.6-fold greater activity for 2-NBDG uptake in the 170 mM Na solution as compared with in the 145 mM solution (p < 0.05), while the uptake by the C6M16 cells without Nax expression (Con) was not increased in the 170 mM Na solution (Figure 3B, Con in 170 mM in C6M16). The increase in the uptake of 2-NBDG in Nax-expressing cells in the 170 mM Na solution was completely inhibited by 1 mM ouabain (Figure 3B), indicating that the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase plays an essential role in the glucose demand induced by the elevation of the extracellular Na level. Next, we tested the effect of overexpression of the Nax-binding fragments (Figure 1B) of α1 and α2 subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase in C6M16 cells, because these fragments are expected to work as a competitor of Na+/K+-ATPase for binding to Nax channels. As was expected, the transfection of an expression vector carrying the fragments of the α1 and α2 subunits significantly suppressed the metabolic response in the C6M16 cells with Nax expression in the 170 mM Na solution (Figure 3C; p < 0.05). In contrast, overexpression of the fragment of the α3 subunit, which was negative for interaction with Nax channel (see Figure 1F), did not suppress the metabolic activation (Figure 3C). The C-terminal fragment of Nax was also expected to work as a competitor for the binding of Nax channels to Na+/K+-ATPase. Unexpectedly but intriguingly, overexpression of the C-terminal fragment of Nax further enhanced the 2-NBDG uptake when it was coexpressed in Nax-positive cells (Figure 3D, Nax; p < 0.05). This suggests that the C-terminal region of Nax is also able to support Na+/K+-ATPase, as well as the native Nax. However, the expression of the C-terminal fragment of Nax by itself (without concomitant expression of the native Nax) exerted no effect on the 2-NBDG uptake (Figure 3D, Con). This strongly suggests that a function of the native Nax channel (presumably Na+-influx activity) is also essential for the upregulation of the metabolic state, in addition to the function that is substitutable with the C-terminal region of Nax. To estimate the contribution of Na+ influx itself to the metabolic activation, we tested the effect of the influx generated by a Na-specific ionophore, monensin (Harootunian et al., 1989Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. Fluorescence ratio imaging of cytosolic free Na+ in individual fibroblasts and lymphocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on the uptake of glucose. Na-imaging experiments with C6M16 cells clearly showed that monensin induced Na+ influx in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A): here, background fluorescence values in the cells without monensin were subtracted from the respective values. At a concentration of 0.5 μM, monensin triggered a small Na+ influx into cells (Figure 4Ab), comparable to that of the C6M16 cells expressing Nax when stimulated in the 170 mM solution (Figure 2Db). However, the application of 0.5 μM monensin to C6M16 cells without Nax-channel expression did not enhance the 2-NBDG uptake (compare Figures 4Ba and 4Bb), and higher concentrations (2 and 5 μM) of monensin were not effective either (Figures 4Bc and 4Bd and open bars in Figure 4C). In contrast, when Nax-expressing cells were treated with 0.5, 2, and 5 μM monensin, the 2-NBDG uptake was markedly enhanced dose-dependently (compare Figures 4Be and 4Bf and filled bars in Figure 4C). This increase was not observed in the presence of ouabain (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the increase of the Na-ion concentration in the cell is not enough by itself to trigger the uptake of glucose (metabolic stimulation) and that the presence of Nax-channel protein is required for the stimulation of glucose uptake by the cells. Surprisingly and importantly, the C-terminal fragment of Nax showed markedly enhanced 2-NBDG uptake under the condition without Nax-channel expression with 0.5 μM monensin (Figure 4D, Mon). The increase was cancelled out by the ouabain treatment (Figure 4D, Mon + Oua). This indicates that the full-length Nax channel can be replaced by the C-terminal fragment under the condition where Na+ influx was secured by monensin. Taken together, it is probable that both prestimulation of Na+/K+-ATPase (by interaction with Nax channels through the C-terminal region of Nax) and Na+ influx (through Nax channels or monensin) are essential for the activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase and the cellular metabolic stimulation. To examine whether the Nax channel is indeed involved in the energy-control system in the Nax-positive glial cells in vivo, we performed an imaging analysis of the uptake of glucose in the SFO using 2-NBDG, where specific glial cells expressing Nax are located (Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe E. Hiyama T.Y. Shimizu H. Kodama R. Hayashi N. Miyata S. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Noda M. Na-level-sensitive Na channel Nax is expressed in glial laminate processes in the sensory circumventricular organs.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R568-R576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The SFO from wild-type and Nax-KO mice was sectioned frontally at 250 μm, incubated with 2-NBDG (200 μM) in the 145 mM or 170 mM Na solution for 1 hr, and observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope. Na-sensitive 2-NBDG uptake was obviously detected selectively in the wild-type (Figures 5Aa, 5Ab, and 5B, p < 0.01), but not in Nax-KO (Figures 5Ac, 5Ad, and 5B) tissues: in the wild-type SFO incubated with 2-NBDG in the 170 mM solution, an intensively labeled mesh-like structure became apparent (Figure 5Ab), suggesting that fine glial processes in the SFO actively took up the fluorescent derivative of glucose. These results clearly indicate that the SFO tissue has activity to take up glucose in response to a Na-level increase, and the Nax channel is an essential component for this mechanism. The enhancement of 2-NBDG uptake in the wild-type SFO under the high-Na condition was completely abolished by 1 mM ouabain (Figures 5Ae, 5Af, and 5B). These results indicate that the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase is the origin of the cellular energy demand at the tissue level in vivo. Next, we examined the dissociated cells from the SFO to confirm that the cells showing the enhancement of 2-NBDG uptake express Nax channels. Cells isolated from the SFO were incubated with 2-NBDG in the 145 mM or 170 mM Na solution for 20 min to estimate the glucose-uptake activity in the cells. After that, cells were fixed and stained with anti-Nax antibody or anti-GFAP antibody. Among the wild-type cells, cellular populations that intensively took up 2-NBDG in the 170 mM solution were present, and these cells were all positive for Nax (Figures 5C and 5D) and GFAP (Figure S3). These results clearly indicate that the Nax channel is an essential component for the upregulation of energy demand in the SFO under the high-Na condition, as observed in the C6M16 cells. Furthermore, the effect of monensin in the Nax-positive C6M16 cells was reproduced in the native cells (Figure 5E). Cells dissociated from the SFO of wild-type mice showed a markedly enhanced uptake of 2-NBDG in the presence of 0.5 μM monensin, while the same stimulation of the cells from Nax-KO mice induced little enhancement of the uptake. Increased demand for glucose by cells means that cellular glycolysis is enhanced to yield lactate (or pyruvate). To confirm this view, we next measured the amounts of lactate and pyruvate released from the SFO as another parameter of the metabolic activity (Figure 6A). The SFO tissues removed from mice of both genotypes were incubated in a modified Ringer solution (containing 145 mM or 160 mM Na) at 37°C for 30 hr with tetrodotoxin (TTX) to reduce the influence of neuronal activities on the glial cells: Nax is resistant to 1 μm TTX (Hiyama et al., 2002Hiyama T.Y. Watanabe E. Ono K. Inenaga K. Tamkun M.M. Yoshida S. Noda M. Nax channel involved in CNS Na-level sensing.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 511-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Ringer solutions contained 10 mM glucose and 0 mM lactate. After the incubation, lactate and pyruvate concentrations in the solutions were measured by enzyme assays using lactate oxidase and pyruvate oxidase, respectively. As was expected, the wild-type SFO showed an increase in lactate secretion by ∼60% compared with the Nax-KO SFO (Figure 6A, p < 0.05), consistent with the increase of glucose uptake (Figures 5A and 5B; WT). On the other hand, amounts of pyruvate released into the medium were 10-fold lower than those of lactate and did not differ under the two different conditions (Figure 6B). This indicates that anaerobic glycolysis was stimulated in Nax-positive glial cells of the SFO under the high-Na condition. We know that neurons in the SFO of Nax-KO mice are hyperactivated under dehydrated conditions compared with wild-type mice (Watanabe et al., 2000Watanabe E. Fujikawa A. Matsunaga H. Yasoshima Y. Sako N. Yamamoto T. Saegusa C. Noda M. Nav2/NaG channel is involved in control of salt-intake behavior in the CNS.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7743-7751PubMed Google Scholar), and GABAergic neurons are one of the major neuronal types surrounded by Nax-positive glial processes in the SFO (Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe E. Hiyama T.Y. Shimizu H. Kodama R. Hayashi N. Miyata S. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Noda M.

Physiol. 2006; 290: R568-R576Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Then we examined the neuronal activity of GABAergic neurons in the SFO under the high-Na condition. We prepared acute slices containing the SFO from GAD-GFP mice and GAD-GFP/Nax-KO (see Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe E. Hiyama T.Y. Shimizu H. Kodama R. Hayashi N. Miyata S. Yanagawa Y. Obata K.

We have used multibeam two-photon calcium microscopy combined with targeted electrophysiological recordings in order to determine the development of population coherence from embryonic to postnatal stages in the hippocampus. At embryonic stages (E16–E19), synchronized activity is absent, and neurons are intrinsically active and generate L-type channel-mediated calcium spikes. At birth, small cell assemblies coupled by gap junctions spontaneously generate synchronous nonsynaptic calcium plateaus associated to recurrent burst discharges. The emergence of coherent calcium plateaus at birth is controlled by oxytocin, a maternal hormone initiating labour, and progressively shut down a few days later by the synapse-driven giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) that synchronize the entire network. Therefore, in the developing hippocampus, delivery is an important signal that triggers the first coherent activity pattern, which is silenced by the emergence of synaptic transmission.

During brain maturation, networks shift from an ensemble of cells endowed with sparse spontaneous activity to a collection of neuronal microcircuits communicating by means of thousands of synapses to generate complex spike patterns that are behaviorally relevant. During this process, emerging networks engage in a sequential maturation of coordinated activity that is believed to control the formation of region-specific synaptic connections (Colin-Le Brun et al., 2004Colin-Le Brun I.

In spite of this considerable information, the maturation of population coherence in the brain is not fully understood. First, at the cellular level, the electrophysiological correlates of nonsynaptic coherent activity patterns have not been described. Second, it is not known whether distinct coherent events such as localized and widespread synchronous activities coexist and interact during circuit maturation. It is also essential to determine whether delivery and other pivotal biological developmental steps control the evolution of network patterns. The aims of the present study were therefore to investigate the development of population coherence both at the network and cellular levels within the same cortical network and to determine its correlation with delivery and postnatal maturation. We have determined in detail the maturation of correlated activity in the developing hippocampus, a region where the maturation of GABA and glutamate receptors and synapse-driven patterns have been extensively described (Ben Ari, 2002Ben Ari Y. Excitatory actions of gaba during development: the nature of the nurture.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). We used a quantitative approach that enabled us to record the activity of a large number of identified neurons in order to determine their contribution to correlated activities without an a priori assumption. Fast multibeam two-photon calcium microscopy (Nielsen et al., 2001Nielsen T. Fricke M. Hellweg D. Andresen P. High efficiency beam splitter for multifocal multiphoton microscopy.J. Microsc. 2001; 201: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) combined with targeted electrophysiological recordings was implemented here for the first time (to our knowledge). We recorded the activity of large networks with a cellular resolution that allows the detection of discrete coherent patterns and identified their cellular correlates (Cossart et al., 2003Cossart R. Aronov D. Yuste R. Attractor dynamics of network UP states in the neocortex.Nature. 2003; 423: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We report that, at embryonic stages, neurons are intrinsically active and sporadically generate voltage-gated calcium spikes. Around birth, a remarkable coordinated activity pattern emerges: small groups of intrinsically active neurons couple by gap junctions and generate synchronous, nonsynaptic calcium plateaus. Such coherent calcium activity is produced by sustained periods of recurrent burst discharges (<1 Hz, for tens of seconds) dependent on the activation of L-type calcium and sodium channels and on the cationic current Ih. Since we observed the emergence of population coherence at birth, we hypothesized that it is related to parturition and in particular to oxytocin. This maternal hormone, released during delivery (Gimpl and Fahrenholz, 2001Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. The oxytocin receptor system: structure, function, and regulation.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 629-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar) and which easily reaches the fetus (Malek et al., 1996Malek A. Blann E. Mattison D.R. Human placental transport of oxytocin.J. Matern. Fetal Med. 1996; 5: 245-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was recently shown to induce a transient excitatory-to-inhibitory switch in GABA actions in the fetal brain shortly before delivery (Tyzio et al., 2006Tyzio R. Cossart R. Khalilov I. Minlebaev M. Hübner C. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Khazipov R. Maternal oxytocin triggers a transient inhibitory switch in GABA signaling in the fetal brain during delivery.Science. 2006; 314: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we demonstrate that the first coherent activity pattern dominating the hippocampal network at birth is boosted up by oxytocin. Furthermore, we establish that similar mechanisms underlie the near-term enhancement of population coherence and the oxytocin-mediated switch in GABA signaling. The handover of network synchrony from local nonsynaptic to widespread synapse-driven activities (GDPs) occurs progressively during the first postnatal week, since both dynamics coexist during a critical period. Blocking GDPs reinstates the synchronous primitive nonsynaptic burst discharges, suggesting that both events are mutually exclusive. Thus, delivery triggers the first coherent activity in gap-junction-coupled cell assemblies in the form of calcium plateaus nesting nonsynaptic burst discharges. This primitive pattern is shut off by the emergence of synaptic transmission. To acquire a dynamic and quantitative estimate of the activity of a large number of neurons, we used large-scale two-photon calcium microscopy in mouse hippocampal slices (Cossart et al., 2003Cossart R. Aronov D. Yuste R. Attractor dynamics of network UP states in the neocortex.Nature. 2003; 423: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, Cossart et al., 2005Cossart R. Ikegaya Y. Yuste R. Calcium imaging of cortical networks dynamics.Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since the major limitation of imaging techniques is time resolution, we have used a novel system based on multibeam scanning of the preparation, which achieves millisecond resolution and reliably detects single action potentials. We recorded movies of spontaneous activity in slices of mouse hippocampus aged between E16 and P14 and focused on the CA1 region (field size: 430 × 380 μm2; 135−560 cells, average: 274 cells per movie; 76,107 neurons recorded in total). Analysis was performed online using custom software to measure fluorescence changes in each hippocampal cell and mark the onset and offset of individual calcium transients (Figure 1; see also Experimental Procedures). We then combined calcium transients from all cells into raster plots indicating the activity of each imaged cell as a function of time (Figure 1). With this compound approach, we determined the number of neurons participating in a given network pattern and described their temporal and spatial links. Neurons involved in the generation of network activities were targeted for whole-cell recordings to determine the physiological properties underlying such events (Figure 1). Recorded neurons were filled with dyes for post hoc morphological identification (Figure 1). We first determined the patterns of activity most represented at three sequential developmental stages using calcium imaging and targeted current-clamp recordings from active neurons: embryo (E16–E19), around birth (P0–P2), and postnatal (P6–P10). Spontaneous calcium events were sorted both manually and automatically based on their kinetics, blindly to the experimental condition (see Experimental Procedures). We found three successive dominant types of calcium dynamics:(1)At embryonic stages (E16–E19), only a minority of cells were active (21% ± 1%, n = 11 slices, 3832 cells). All activity consisted of sporadic brief calcium events (2.95 ± 0.04 s duration, n = 7000 events, Figure 1, Figure 2) that were poorly correlated between neurons (0.54% cell pairs significantly correlated, see Experimental Procedures). Current-clamp recordings from active neurons revealed that these calcium events corresponded to immature membrane-potential spikes (Figure 1). We will refer to these early calcium events as calcium spikes.(2)Around birth (P0–P2), more cells generated calcium spikes (see Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data available online), but another pattern appeared in about 20% of active cells consisting of long-lasting calcium plateaus (duration: 9.1 ± 0.1 s, 0.02 Hz, n = 5893 events, significantly different from calcium spikes in terms of duration, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, p < 0.001; Figure 1, Figure 2). These plateaus produced recurrent burst discharges when cells were recorded at Vrest, as shown by targeted whole-cell recordings (Vm = −61 ± 1 mV, ΔV = 12 ± 4 mV, 0.5 ± 0.2 Hz, n = 12 cells, Figure 1, Figure 4). In contrast to calcium spikes, the onsets of calcium plateaus were significantly synchronized between neurons within a 200 ms time window (7.8% pairs of calcium plateaus correlated versus 1.3% calcium spikes pairs, p < 0.05, Figure 6, Figure 8). On average, synchronous calcium plateaus involved 3.0 ± 0.2 neurons; per movie, the largest synchronous events comprised 7.4 ± 1.9 neurons (n = 11 slices, 384 cells producing plateaus). Synchronous events occurred on average 7 ± 1 times per min (n = 11 slices). The synchronous occurrence of calcium plateaus in a subpopulation of neurons represents the first coherent activity pattern in the hippocampus. We propose to refer to this primary coherent activity, characterized by the occurrence of synchronous calcium plateaus in neuronal assemblies as SPA (synchronous plateau assemblies).(3)At later postnatal stages (P6–P10), a majority of cells (64% ± 4%) were active in a strongly coordinated manner (21.1% pairs significantly correlated, peaks of synchronous activation involving up to 80% of imaged cells, n = 30 slices, p < 0.05; Figure 1, see Movie S2). This activity corresponds to the well-described GDPs (Ben Ari et al., 1989Ben Ari Y. Cherubini E. Corradetti R. Gaiarsa J.L. Giant synaptic potentials in immature rat CA3 hippocampal neurones.J. Physiol. 1989; 416: 303-325PubMed Google Scholar), as revealed by current-clamp recordings (Figure 1) and by their blockade by GABAA and glutamate receptor antagonists (Figure 3).Figure 3Pharmacological Properties of the Three Dominant Forms of Primary Activity in the CA1 HippocampusShow full caption(A) Representative histograms showing the percentage of imaged cells that are detected as being active (active cells [%]) at each movie frame from E16 to P6 (time resolution: 100 ms).

Error bars indicate SEMs. We conclude that three patterns, differing both by their calcium dynamics and their electrophysiological correlates, dominate early spontaneous activity in the CA1 region: uncorrelated isolated spikes, synchronized calcium plateaus nesting recurrent burst discharges (SPAs), and a pattern corresponding to the synapse-driven GDPs. The developmental incidence of calcium spikes, SPAs, and GDPs also differed: uncorrelated spikes were the dominant pattern at embryonic stages (E16–E19) and was then progressively replaced by SPAs and GDPs that prevailed by the end of the first postnatal week (Figure 2). Both SPAs and GDPs disappear after the second postnatal week (Figure 2). Therefore, population coherence emerges at birth in the hippocampus in the transient form of SPAs involving bursting neuronal assemblies. We next investigated the cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of the two dominating patterns from E16 until birth, calcium spikes and SPAs. Sporadic calcium spikes were intrinsically generated by high-threshold calcium conductances with a contribution of sodium channels since (1) L-type calcium (10 μM nifedipine) and sodium (1 μM TTX) channel antagonists strongly reduced these events (Figure 3). Before birth (E16–E19), the fraction of active cells displaying calcium spikes, “fraction of calcium-spike cells,” was reduced by nifedipine (10 μM) alone to 22% ± 10% of control; further addition of TTX reduced the fraction of calcium-spike cells to 15% ± 4% of control (n = 7 slices, 2058 cells, Figure 3). At later stages (P3–P10), both nifedipine and TTX were required to reduce the fraction of calcium-spike cells to 11% ± 1% of control (n = 7 slices, 1476 cells, Figure 3). Interestingly, the T-type calcium channel antagonist (30 μM nickel) failed to suppress calcium spikes (fraction of calcium-spike cells was 115% ± 41% of control, n = 2 slices, 536 cells, not shown). (2) The fraction of calcium-spike cells was not affected by blocking synaptic transmission using GABAA-, AMPA-, and NMDA-receptor antagonists (antagonist cocktail #1: 10 μM bicuculline, 10 μM NBQX, 40 μM D-APV, 108% ± 16% of control, n = 11, Figure 3); subsequent addition of GABAB (5 μM CGP 55845), metabotropic glutamate (group I, 100 μM AIDA; group II/III, 100 μM CPPG), and muscarinic (10 μM atropine) receptor antagonists also failed to block calcium spikes (fraction of calcium-spike cells in the presence of antagonist cocktail #2: 101% ± 7% of control, n = 4 slices, 902 cells, not shown). SPAs are nonsynaptic voltage-gated events since (1) targeted current-clamp recordings from neurons producing SPAs revealed a strong voltage dependence of these events that were abolished when the cell was hyperpolarized (to Vm ∼−80 mV) or depolarized (to Vm ∼−40 mV; Figure 4). In keeping with this, raising—in the presence of ionotropic GABA- and glutamate-receptor antagonists—the extracellular potassium concentration from 3.5 to 8 mM to depolarize neurons (from −61 ± 1 mV to −44 ± 1 mV, respectively, n = 4 neurons) produced a highly significant drop of the fraction of active cells producing calcium plateaus, i.e., “fraction of SPA-cells” (to 26% ± 4% of control n = 5 slices, 1122 cells imaged, Figure 4, p < 0.001); (2) targeted whole-cell recordings showed that recurrent membrane-potential bursts were associated with sodium action potentials but also occurred in very immature neurons with poorly developed sodium conductances, suggesting that pure calcium currents could generate them. Accordingly, SPAs were sensitive to antagonists of L-type calcium and sodium channels (10 μM nifedipine and 1 μM TTX, reduction of the fraction of SPA cells to 6% ± 2% of control, n = 7 slices, 1476 cells, Figure 3), indicating that they were generated by high-threshold calcium currents with a contribution of sodium channels. (3) Like calcium spikes, the fraction of SPA cells was not affected by perfusion with antagonist cocktails #1 and #2 that included GABA, glutamate, and muscarinic receptor blockers (antagonist cocktail #2: 90% ± 12%, n = 4 slices, 902 cells). These cocktails also did not affect significantly the coherence between calcium plateaus (5.5% pairs of SPA cells correlated in blockers versus 7.8% pairs in control). In the presence of antagonist cocktail #1, we also performed voltage-clamp recor"

Methods and Findings We conducted a nested case-control study using data from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database between 1991 and 2001. Controls were matched to cases on general practice clinic, sex, year of birth and date of outcome diagnosis in their matched case. We found positive associations between GBS and infection with Campylobacter, Epstein-Barr virus and influenza-like illness in the previous two months, as well as evidence of a protective effect of influenza vaccination. After correction for under-ascertainment of Campylobacter infection, the excess risk of GBS following Campylobacter enteritis was 60-fold and 20% of GBS cases were attributable to this pathogen. Conclusions Our findings indicate a far greater excess risk of GBS among Campylobacter enteritis patients than previously reported by retrospective serological studies. In addition, they confirm previously suggested associations between infection due to Epstein-Barr virus infection and influenza-like illness and GBS. Finally, we report evidence of a protective effect of influenza vaccination on GBS risk, which may be mediated through protection against influenza disease, or result from a lower likelihood of vaccination among those with recent infection. Cohort studies of GBS incidence in this population would help to clarify the burden of GBS due to influenza, and any potential protective effect of influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2129485669,"Many theories of cerebellar function assume that long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber (PF) synapses enables Purkinje cells to learn to recognize PF activity patterns. We have studied the LTD-based recognition of PF patterns in a biophysically realistic Purkinje-cell model. With simple-spike firing as observed in vivo, the presentation of a pattern resulted in a burst of spikes followed by a pause. Surprisingly, the best criterion to distinguish learned patterns was the duration of this pause. Moreover, our simulations predicted that learned patterns elicited shorter pauses, thus increasing Purkinje-cell output. We tested this prediction in Purkinje-cell recordings both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we found a shortening of pauses when decreasing the number of active PFs or after inducing LTD. In vivo, we observed longer pauses in LTD-deficient mice. Our results suggest a novel form of neural coding in the cerebellar cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2149624859,"Perceptual illusions are usually thought to arise from the way sensory signals are encoded by the brain, and indeed are often used to infer the mechanisms of sensory encoding. But perceptual illusions might also result from the way the brain decodes sensory information, reflecting the strategies that optimize performance in particular tasks. In a fine discrimination task, the most accurate information comes from neurons tuned away from the discrimination boundary, and observers seem to use signals from these 'displaced' neurons to optimize their performance. We wondered whether using signals from these neurons might also bias perception. In a fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli, we found that observers' perception of the direction of motion is indeed biased away from the boundary. This misperception can be accurately described by a decoding model that preferentially weights signals from neurons whose responses best discriminate those directions. In a coarse discrimination task, to which a different decoding rule applies, the same stimulus is not misperceived, suggesting that the illusion is a direct consequence of the decoding strategy that observers use to make fine perceptual judgments. The subjective experience of motion is therefore not mediated directly by the responses of sensory neurons, but is only developed after the responses of these neurons are decoded."
https://openalex.org/W2134218637,"Several genetic strategies for inhibiting neuronal function in mice have been described, but no system that directly suppresses membrane excitability and is triggered by a systemically administered drug, has been validated in awake behaving animals. We expressed unilaterally in mouse striatum a modified heteromeric ivermectin (IVM)-gated chloride channel from C. elegans (GluClalphabeta), systemically administered IVM, and then assessed amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Rotation was observed as early as 4 hr after a single intraperitoneal IVM injection (10 mg/kg), reached maximal levels by 12 hr, and was almost fully reversed by 4 days. Multiple cycles of silencing and recovery could be performed in a single animal. In striatal slice preparations from GluClalphabeta-expressing animals, IVM rapidly suppressed spiking. The two-subunit GluCl/IVM system permits ""intersectional"" strategies designed to increase the cellular specificity of silencing in transgenic animals."

To determine whether LSD1 demethylase activity has a global impact on cell proliferation, we generated MCF7 cell lines, which inducibly express N-terminally HA-tagged LSD1 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter. Three representative cell lines, MCF7-HA-LSD1–2/-6/-22, along with parental MCF7-pTR-7 cell line, are shown in Fig. 1A. The level of GAPDH was determined as a loading control. Next, we performed colony formation assay and found that LSD1 overexpression had no effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). As a control, tetracycline was not found to have any effect on MCF7-pTR-7 cell proliferation (Fig. 1B, the first column). To determine whether LSD1 deficiency has an effect on cell proliferation, we generated three MCF7 cell lines, MCF7-LSD1-KD-11/-30/-46, in which LSD1 is inducibly knocked down by the tetracycline-inducible shRNA expression system. For each cell line, LSD1 levels were significantly decreased upon induction of LSD1 shRNA for 4 days (Fig. 1C). Next, we performed a 6-day growth curve on MCF7-pTR-7 and MCF7-LSD1-KD-30 cells and found that there was a decrease in the number of proliferating cells after knockdown of LSD1 for 6 days (data not shown). To further address the long term effect of LSD1 knockdown on cell proliferation, colony formation assay was done (Fig. 1D). We found that the ability of MCF7 cells to proliferate was attenuated upon knockdown of LSD1 for 10 days. Thus, we further characterized this and found that the total number of colonies was not affected by tetracycline. However, the number of small colonies (less than 1 mm in diameter) was significantly increased by LSD1 knockdown in MCF7-LSD1-KD-11/-30/-46 cells compared with that by tetracycline in parental MCF7-pTR-7 cells (Fig. 1E). Concomitantly, there was a significant decrease in the number of large colonies (more than 1 mm in diameter) in all three LSD1 knockdown cell lines (Fig. 1F). Together, these results suggest that LSD1 is required for normal cell proliferation. To further characterize the cell cycle profile of LSD1 knockdown cells, DNA histogram assay was performed with MCF7-LSD1-KD-11 cells induced to express LSD1 shRNA for 4 days. We found that upon LSD1 knockdown, the number of cells in G1 was decreased, concomitantly with an increase in the number of cells in G2/M (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that LSD1 is required for cell cycle progression. To investigate whether LSD1 modulates p53 function, MCF7-pTR-7 and MCF7-LSD1-KD-46 cells were pretreated with tetracycline to knockdown LSD1 for 10 days, followed by treatment with a DNA damage agent (doxorubicin or camptothecin) or Nutlin-3 for 6 h, and then maintained for 4 days. Nutlin-3 is an MDM2 inhibitor, which activates p53 without causing DNA damage (15Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.A. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3825) Google Scholar). We showed that in MCF7 cells, growth suppression induced by DNA damage or Nutlin-3 was markedly increased by LSD1 knockdown but not treatment with tetracycline (Fig. 2). To further characterize the prosurvival function of LSD1, Western blot analysis was performed to measure the levels of p53 and its target gene products, p21 and MDM2. Thus, MCF7-LSD1-KD-11/-30/-46 cells were uninduced or induced to knock down LSD1 for 4 days, followed by treatment with doxorubicin for 3 or 6 h (Fig. 3A). For each cell line, a marked decrease in LSD1 was detected upon induction of LSD1 shRNA and endogenous p53 was activated upon treatment with doxorubicin, which led to induction of p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we found that LSD1 knockdown decreased to some extend p53 stabilization in the first 3 h following treatment with doxorubicin, resulting in a decrease in p21 and MDM2 induction (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 3, 9, and 15 with lanes 4, 10, and 16, respectively). However, the long term stabilization of p53 induced by DNA damage was not affected by LSD1 knockdown (Fig. 3A, doxorubicin treatment for 6 h, compare lanes 5, 11, and 17 with lanes 6, 12, and 18, respectively; treatment with doxorubicin for 12 h, data not shown). Next, Northern blot analysis was performed to examine whether the levels of p53, p21, and MDM2 transcripts are affected by LSD1 knockdown. MCF7-pTR-7 and MCF7-LSD1-KD-46 cells were pretreated with tetracycline for 4 days, followed by doxorubicin treatment for 3 or 6 h. We found that in MCF7-pTR-7 cells, there was no change in the level of p53 transcript (Fig. 3B). As expected, p21 and MDM2 were induced upon treatment with doxorubicin regardless of tetracycline pretreatment (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5 with lanes 2, 4, and 6, respectively). We also found that in MCF7-LSD1-KD-46 cells, LSD1 knockdown had no effect on p53 expression (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, LSD1 knockdown significantly decreased the induction of MDM2 and, to a lesser extent, p21 following treatment with doxorubicin for 3 h (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 9 and 10). However, the long term induction of p21 and MDM2 by DNA damage was not affected by LSD1 knockdown (Fig. 3B, treatment with doxorubicin for 6 h, compare lanes 11 and 12). Thus, the effect of LSD1 knockdown on p21 and MDM2 transcription is likely responsible for the decreased expression of p21 and MDM2 proteins via decreased stabilization of p53 protein. Since LSD1 is a demethylase, we determined whether LSD1 has any effect on p53 methylation. MCF-7-LSD1-KD-46 cells were uninduced or induced to knock down LSD1 for 4 days, followed by treatment with doxorubicin for 8 h. Using commercially available antibodies against methylated p53 or antibodies against methylated lysines, the methylation status of p53 was not found to be altered by LSD1 knockdown (data not shown). Since p53 methylation appears to affect its acetylation and phosphorylation, specific antibodies against acetylated or phosphorylated p53 were used to examine those modifications. As shown in Fig. 3C, LSD1 levels were decreased upon knockdown and p53 was stabilized by doxorubicin. Interestingly, we found that LSD1 knockdown had no significant effect on the levels of total p53, Lys373/Lys382-acetylated p53, and Ser15-/Ser20-phosphorylated p53 induced by DNA damage (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our data suggest that the pro-survival effect of LSD1 is mediated at least in part through the regulation of p53 stability and transcriptional activity. To further address the pro-survival function of LSD1, we wanted to determine which genes are specifically regulated upon LSD1 knockdown. Thus, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip analysis using MCF7-LSD1-KD-46 cells uninduced or induced to knock down LSD1 for 4 days. Several novel LSD1 target genes, such as S100A8, which encodes a calcium-binding protein, and DEK, a proto-oncogene, were found to be repressed upon LSD1 knockdown (Table 1). Furthermore, their repression upon LSD1 knockdown was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5 with lanes 2, 4, and 6, respectively). Therefore, it is likely that S100A8, DEK, and other LSD1 target genes play a role in LSD1 pro-survival function.TABLE 1Genes regulated by LSD1Gene symbolFold change in relative mRNA upon LSD1-KD vs. controlLSD1-7.9LSD1 targets S100A8-45.2 PLCL1-6.9 LEPR-2.8 DR1-3.2 DEK-2.2 TESC+3.5 Cyclin A1+2.9 CSRP2+2.8 ADAMTS1+2.5 PSMB9+2.4 Open table in a new tab LSD1 is known to play a role in REST-dependent repression of neural-specific genes and activation of androgen receptor-dependent genes via chromatin remodeling (4Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A.

Peters A.H. Gunther T. Buettner R. Schule R. Nature. 2005; 437: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). However, the precise physiological significance of LSD1 is yet unclear. Here, we found, for the first time, that LSD1 is required for cell proliferation. We also found that LSD1 knockdown induces a partial G2/M arrest. Furthermore, we found that LSD1 may exert its pro-survival function by modulating the p53-dependent DNA damage response. In particular, LSD1 is necessary for the rapid stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage leading to prompt induction of p21 and MDM2, both of which are key players in the p53 pro-survival pathway (16Helton E.S. Chen X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 100: 883-896Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We speculate that a rapid initial activation of p53 is crucial to induce pro-survival mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, to limit the extent of damage to DNA. Consistent with this, a recent study identified LSD1 as a novel biomarker predictive for prostate cancer with aggressive biology (17Kahl P. Gullotti L. Heukamp L.C. Wolf S. Friedrichs N. Vorreuther R. Solleder G. Bastian P.J. Ellinger J. Metzger E. Schule R. Buettner R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11341-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of p53 play an important role in regulating p53 stability and transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage (18Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Among those, acetylation of p53 at specific C-terminal lysine residues by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP (Lys372/Lys382) and P/CAF (Lys320), differentially regulates the expression of target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell proliferation, or senescence (19Knights C.D. Catania J. Di Giovanni S. Muratoglu S. Perez R. Swartzbeck A. Quong A.A. Zhang X. Beerman T. Pestell R.G. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies showed that altered acetylation in various p53 mutants effects the affinity of p53 for downstream target promoters and the ability of p53 to recruit diverse co-factors, for instance p300, Brg1, HDAC1, or SIRT1, to initiate or prevent gene transcription (20Roy S. Tenniswood M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4765-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, acetylated lysine residues in p53 are subjected to deacetylation by histone deacetylases and subsequent ubiquitination by MDM2, which leads to decreased p53 stability. Furthermore, lysine methylation of p53 was recently reported to modulate p53 stability and transcriptional activity in both positive and negative manners, depending on the methylation site (9Chuikov S. Kurash J.K. Wilson J.R. Xiao B. Justin N. Ivanov G.S. McKinney K. Tempst P. Prives C. Gamblin S.J. Barlev N.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 2004; 432: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 11Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the modification status of a particular lysine residue is a determinant in mediating specific gene expression profile to trigger appropriate p53 tumor suppressive function. Although we were unable to detect any alteration in methylated or acetylated p53, it remains possible that one or more lysine residues are regulated by LSD1 demethylase activity. It is also possible that the effect of LSD1 on p53 transcriptional activity is mediated through demethylation of MDM2 or other modifiers of p53. In this study, we identified, for the first time, various genes specifically regulated by LSD1, such as DEK, S100A8, PLCL1, and ADAMTS1 (Table 1). DEK, a nuclear DNA-binding protein, is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancers and its expression correlates with cell proliferation (21Kondoh N. Wakatsuki T. Ryo A. Hada A. Aihara T. Horiuchi S. Goseki N. Matsubara O. Takenaka K. Shichita M. Tanaka K. Shuda M. Yamamoto M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4990-4996PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DEK is found to be expressed as DEK-CAN fusion protein, which may be responsible for a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (22von Lindern M. Fornerod M.

Although DEK has been implicated in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, its precise physiological role remains to be elucidated (23Waldmann T. Scholten I. Kappes F. Hu H.G. Knippers R. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, DEK and other LSD1 target genes are likely to mediate the pro-survival function of LSD1.

https://openalex.org/W2128608940,"Mitotic progression is controlled by proteolytic destruction of securin and cyclin. The mitotic E3 ubiquitin ligase, known as the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C), in partnership with its activators Cdc20p and Cdh1p, targets these proteins for degradation. In the presence of defective kinetochore-microtubule interactions, APC/C(Cdc20) is inhibited by the spindle checkpoint, thereby delaying anaphase onset and providing more time for spindle assembly. Cdc20p interacts directly with Mad2p, and its levels are subject to careful regulation, but the precise mode(s) of APC/C( Cdc20) inhibition remain unclear. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC, consisting of Mad3p, Mad2p, Bub3p and Cdc20p in budding yeast) is a potent APC/C inhibitor. Here we focus on Mad3p and how it acts, in concert with Mad2p, to efficiently inhibit Cdc20p. We identify and analyse the function of two motifs in Mad3p, KEN30 and KEN296, which are conserved from yeast Mad3p to human BubR1. These KEN amino acid sequences resemble 'degron' signals that confer interaction with APC/C activators and target proteins for degradation. We show that both Mad3p KEN boxes are necessary for spindle checkpoint function. Mutation of KEN30 abolished MCC formation and stabilised Cdc20p in mitosis. In addition, mutation of Mad3-KEN30, APC/C subunits, or Cdh1p, stabilised Mad3p in G1, indicating that the N-terminal KEN box could be a Mad3p degron. To determine the significance of Mad3p turnover, we analysed the consequences of MAD3 overexpression and found that four-fold overproduction of Mad3p led to chromosome bi-orientation defects and significant chromosome loss during recovery from anti-microtubule drug induced checkpoint arrest. In conclusion, Mad3p KEN30 mediates interactions that regulate the proteolytic turnover of Cdc20p and Mad3p, and the levels of both of these proteins are critical for spindle checkpoint signaling and high fidelity chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2058860441,"When the left and right eyes are simultaneously presented with different images, observers typically report exclusive awareness of only one image. This phenomenon is termed binocular rivalry, reflecting the fact that the dominant image alternates every few seconds in a cycle of perceptual competition that continues indefinitely. Despite the apparent continuity in perceptual switching, we now demonstrate that the initial “onset” period is fundamentally different to all subsequent rivalry epochs. Using brief intermittent presentations, rivalry dominance shows strong biases such that the same target is perceived with each successive stimulus onset. These biases remain consistent within any given location, but vary across the visual field in a distribution that is stable over multiple weeks but highly idiosyncratic across observers. If the presentation exceeds ∼1sec at any location, however, the very different and much more balanced alternations of sustained binocular rivalry become apparent. These powerful onset biases are observed with brief intermittent presentations at a single location or with continual smooth motion of the targets. Periods of adaptation to one of the rivaling targets induced local switches in dominance to the non-adapted target. However, these effects were generally limited to the spatial site of adaptation and had less influence over each subsequent cycle of the target. We conclude that onset rivalry is independent of sustained rivalry and cannot be explained by local regions of monocular dominance or memory of past perceptual history, but rather reflects low-level, spatially localized factors that are stable over periods of weeks. These findings suggest that brief presentation paradigms are inappropriate for their current use in studies of the mechanisms underlying sustained rivalry. However, brief presentations are ideal for investigating early stages of perceptual competition."

https://openalex.org/W2159608689,"When interfering objects occlude a scene, the visual system restores the occluded information. Similarly, when a sound of interest (a “foreground” sound) is interrupted (occluded) by loud noise, the auditory system restores the occluded information. This process, called auditory induction, can be exploited to create a continuity illusion. When a segment of a foreground sound is deleted and loud noise fills the missing portion, listeners incorrectly report hearing the foreground continuing through the noise. Here we reveal the neurophysiological underpinnings of illusory continuity in single-neuron responses from awake macaque monkeys' primary auditory cortex (A1). A1 neurons represented the missing segment of occluded tonal foregrounds by responding to discontinuous foregrounds interrupted by intense noise as if they were responding to the complete foregrounds. By comparison, simulated peripheral responses represented only the noise and not the occluded foreground. The results reveal that many A1 single-neuron responses closely follow the illusory percept."
https://openalex.org/W2009331316,"Blood cell formation is maintained by the replication of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that continuously feed downstream ""compartments"" where amplification and differentiation of cells occurs, giving rise to all blood lineages. Whereas HSC replicate slowly, committed cells replicate faster as they become more differentiated.We propose a multi-compartment model of hematopoiesis, designed on the principle of cell flow conservation under stationary conditions. Cells lost from one compartment due to differentiation are replaced by cells from the upstream compartment. We assume that there is a constant relationship between cell input and output in each compartment and fix the single parameter of the model using data available for granulocyte maturation. We predict that approximately 31 mitotic events separate the HSC from the mature cells observed in the circulation. Besides estimating the number of compartments, our model allows us to estimate the size of each compartment, the rate of cell replication within each compartment, the mean time a given cell type contributes to hematopoiesis, the amplification rate in each compartment, as well as the mean time separating stem-cell replication and mature blood-cell formation.Despite its simplicity, the model agrees with the limited in vivo data available and can make testable predictions. In particular, our prediction of the average lifetime of a PIG-A mutated clone agrees closely with the experimental results available for the PIG-A gene mutation in healthy adults. The present elucidation of the compartment structure and dynamics of hematopoiesis may prove insightful in further understanding a variety of hematopoietic disorders."

ALS2 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5 (Rab5GEF) and is involved in endosome dynamics. However, the spatiotemporal regulation of the ALS2-mediated Rab5 activation is unclear. Here we identified an upstream activator for ALS2 and showed a functional significance of the ALS2 activation in endosome dynamics. ALS2 preferentially interacts with activated Rac1. In the cells activated Rac1 recruits cytoplasmic ALS2 to membrane ruffles and subsequently to nascent macropinosomes via Rac1-activated macropinocytosis. At later endocytic stages macropinosomal ALS2 augments fusion of the ALS2-localized macropinosomes with the transferrin-positive endosomes, depending on the ALS2-associated Rab5GEF activity. These results indicate that Rac1 promotes the ALS2 membranous localization, thereby rendering ALS2 active via Rac1-activated endocytosis. Thus, ALS2 is a novel Rac1 effector and is involved in Rac1-activated macropinocytosis.

ALS2 also contains eight consecutive membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs, which are known to mediate the plasma membrane binding (8.Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M.

Recently, two independent studies of the Als2-knock-out (KO) mice have revealed that a loss of ALS2 results in the delayed fusion of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-positive endosomes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (16.Hadano S.

Furthermore, small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of rat Als2 in cultured motor neurons led to smaller-sized early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA1)-positive endosomes (18.Jacquier A. Buhler E. Schäfer M.K. Bohl D. Blanchard S. Beclin C. Haase G. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, endogenous ALS2 certainly plays an important role in Rab5-dependent endosome fusion. Additionally, several studies have shown that ALS2 also activates a Rho member Rac1, thereby facilitating the neurite outgrowth (18.Jacquier A. Buhler E. Schäfer M.K. Bohl D. Blanchard S. Beclin C.

In any case, it is currently believed that ALS2 is involved in either the Rab5- or the Rac1-mediated cellular process or both.Two GTPases, Rab5 and Rac1, generally control distinct cellular processes. Rab5 is a key regulator in both endocytosis and following membrane trafficking events, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, fusion and motility of early endosomes, and transcriptional regulation (21.Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar, 22.Miaczynska M. Christoforidis S. Giner A. Shevchenko A. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Habermann B. Wilm M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rac1 generally controls cell spreading and migration via regulating actin dynamics. Remarkably, it has been recently reported that Rab5, Rac1, and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase are simultaneously required for the induction of dorsal ruffle, the prerequisite for a mode of endocytosis called macropinocytosis (24.Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Cooper J.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10337-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25.Lanzetti L. Palamidessi A. Areces L. Scita G. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2004; 429: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that ALS2 takes part in cellular processes such as macropinocytosis, which is enhanced by both Rab5 and Rac1, although no such experimental evidence has been provided thus far.Although the current evidence supports that ALS2 is involved in endosome fusion in vivo, it is also equally important to note that ALS2 is mostly sequestered in the cytoplasm and certain ALS2 molecules are usually localized onto EEA1-positive endosomes and are thereby involved in endosome dynamics (12.Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.-E. Hum. Mol.

Brain. 2006; 129: 1710-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have identified a pathogenic missense mutation in the RLD (the N-terminal half of ALS2; see Fig. 2A) that results in the ALS2 mislocalization. These findings suggest that proper regulation of the ALS2 sub-cellular localization is crucial to exert the physiological ALS2 functions. However, the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown.In this study, to gain a better understanding of the physiological ALS2 roles, we aimed to determine when and how cytoplasmic dormant ALS2 turns to participate in membrane dynamics. Here we show that Rac1 induces the recruitment of the ALS2 molecules to the plasma membrane, and then ALS2 is relocalized to macropinosomes via Rac1-regulated macropinocytosis. Subsequently, macropinosomal ALS2 augments fusion of the ALS2-localized macropinosomes with the transferrin (Tf)-positive endosomes. Thus, ALS2 is the first Rab5GEF that acts as a novel Rac1 effector and plays important roles in Rac1-activated macropinocytosis and fusion of macropinosomes. These findings raise the interesting possibility that an unfamiliar endocytic mechanism, macropinocytosis, and/or the following membrane trafficking might be indispensable for the integrity of motor neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Materials−Anti-ALS2_RLD (HPF1-680) and anti-ALS2_MORN/VPS9 (MPF1012-1651) polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were previously described (12.Otomo A.

All other reagents were from commercial sources and of analytical grade.Plasmids−All the expression constructs were obtained by subcloning the PCR- or the reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified human cDNAs into the appropriate expression vectors. The DNA sequence of the insert as well as the flanking regions in each plasmid construct was verified by sequencing. Plasmids expressing mutant proteins were generated by a PCR-based method. The cDNA fragments of ALS2 and TRIO were subcloned into the original or modified pCI-neo Mammalian Expression Vectors (Promega), allowing the production of the N-terminal-FLAG-, HA-, or 2XHA-tagged or untagged proteins. RAC1, RHOG, and RAB5A and their mutants were subcloned into the p3XFLAG-CMV™-10 Expression Vector (Sigma), modified p3XFLAG-CMV™-10 (p2XHA-CMV™-10), or pCI-neo, generating plasmids expressing 3XFLAG- or 2XHA-tagged or untagged small GTPases.

The resulting supernatants were mixed with Ezview™ Red Glutathione Affinity Gel (Sigma) conjugating GST-CRIB for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the gels were washed three times with ice-cold buffer A. Appropriate amounts of pulldown products were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 mAb as previously described (12.Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H.

After washing three times with buffer C, appropriate amounts of the pulldown products were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In the case of the pull-down with nucleotide-free GST fusion proteins, supernatants were prepared in buffer B containing 10 mm EDTA instead of 10 mm MgCl2, and the reaction was carried out in buffer C containing 10 mm EDTA instead of 15 mm MgCl2. To confirm a direct interaction between ALS2 and Rac1, the FLAG-tagged ALS2 protein was obtained by the affinity purification with Ezview™ Red ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) followed by elution with 3XFLAG peptide (Sigma), as previously described (15.Kunita R.

After gentle rotation for 4 h at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated either with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) or with anti-HA Affinity Gel (Sigma). The affinity gels were washed three times with buffer D or E. Appropriate amounts of the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using either the anti-FLAG M2 or anti-HA mAb. In the case of co-immunoprecipitation of ALS2 with either Rac1Q61L or Rac1T17N, COS-7 cells were cultured on a suspension culture dish (Corning) instead of a tissue culture dish for adherent cells.Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy−Immunofluorescence studies were carried out as previously described (10.Rossman K.L.

Briefly, HeLa or COS-7 cells transfected with appropriate plasmids were washed with PBS(-) twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(-) for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS(-) for 30 min. HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP-ALS2_L were serum-starved for 12 h and treated with EGF (DIACLONE) (100 ng/ml, 10 min) before fixation.

Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) was used for the detection of signals of either tag epitopes or proteins of interest. F-actin was visualized by Alexa 594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes).

https://openalex.org/W1974367156,"The Hox clusters play a crucial role in body patterning during animal development. They encode both Hox transcription factor and micro-RNA genes that are activated in a precise temporal and spatial sequence that follows their chromosomal order. These remarkable collinear properties confer functional unit status for Hox clusters. We developed the TranscriptView platform to establish high resolution transcriptional profiling and report here that transcription in the Hox clusters is far more complex than previously described in both human and mouse. Unannotated transcripts can represent up to 60% of the total transcriptional output of a cluster. In particular, we identified 14 non-coding Transcriptional Units antisense to Hox genes, 10 of which (70%) have a detectable mouse homolog. Most of these Transcriptional Units in both human and mouse present conserved sizeable sequences (>40 bp) overlapping Hox transcripts, suggesting that these Hox antisense transcripts are functional. Hox clusters also display at least seven polycistronic clusters, i.e., different genes being co-transcribed on long isoforms (up to 30 kb). This work provides a reevaluated framework for understanding Hox gene function and dys-function. Such extensive transcriptions may provide a structural explanation for Hox clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2102629189,"The function of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), the essential protein for the pathogenesis and transmission of prion diseases, is still largely unknown. The putative roles of PrP(C) are thought to be related to cell signaling, survival, and differentiation. In a previous study, we showed that PrP(C) was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues. In the present report, we show that ectopic expression of PrP(C) could promote tumorigenesis, proliferation, and G1/S transition in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, CyclinD1, a protein related to cell cycle, was shown to be significantly up-regulated by PrP(C) at both mRNA and protein levels. PI3K/Akt pathway mediated above PrP(C) signal since PrP(C) increased the expression of phosphorylated Akt, and the specific inhibitor of Akt, LY294002, could markedly suppress growth of SGC7901 and transactivation of CyclinD1 induced by PrP(C). Octapeptide repeat region played a vital role in this function, as deletion of this region abolished or reduced these effects. Collectively, this study demonstrates that overexpression of PrP(C) might promote the tumorigenesis and proliferation of gastric cancer cells at least partially through activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and subsequent transcriptional activation of CyclinD1 to regulate the G1/S phase transition, in which octapeptide repeat region might be an indispensable region."
https://openalex.org/W1996490110,"A basic tenet of microeconomics suggests that the subjective value of financial gains decreases with increasing assets of individuals (""marginal utility""). Using concepts from learning theory and microeconomics, we assessed the capacity of financial rewards to elicit behavioral and neuronal changes during reward-predictive learning in participants with different financial backgrounds. Behavioral learning speed during both acquisition and extinction correlated negatively with the assets of the participants, irrespective of education and age. Correspondingly, response changes in midbrain and striatum measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging were slower during both acquisition and extinction with increasing assets and income of the participants. By contrast, asymptotic magnitudes of behavioral and neuronal responses after learning were unrelated to personal finances. The inverse relationship of behavioral and neuronal learning speed with personal finances is compatible with the general concept of decreasing marginal utility with increasing wealth."

The necessity of these channels in the case of small substrates is questionable because diffusion through the protein matrix is often assumed.

The TPQ is derived from an endogenous tyrosine through a self-catalytic process requiring only molecular oxygen and Cu(II) (see Fig. 1a) (1Janes S.M. Mu D. Wemmer D. Smith A.J. Kaur S. Maltby D.

HPAO follows a Bi Bi ping-pong reaction mechanism that can be expressed as two half-reactions, reductive and oxidative (see Fig. 1b). In the reductive half-reaction the enzyme oxidizes a primary amine to an aldehyde, generating the 2e- reduced aminoquinol form of the cofactor. In the subsequent oxidative half-reaction molecular oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide via cofactor reoxidation to TPQ. Biochemical studies from several different laboratories have led to mechanistic proposals for the catalytic cycle of CAOs (8Mure M. Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9269-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Dooley D.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These studies have given significant insight into the mechanism for the reductive half-reaction (10Klinman J.P. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2541-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). However, the details surrounding the activation of molecular oxygen both in terms of the biogenesis of the TPQ (11Okajima T. Kishishita S. Chiu Y.C. Murakawa T. Kim M. Yamaguchi H. Hirota S.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 4686-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The utilization of copper as a redox center has been the focus of recent controversy. Because CAOs contain a copper ion in their active site, chemical intuition suggests Cu(I) as the O2-activating species to give Cu(II)-superoxide (17Lewis E.A. Tolman W.B. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1047-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Upon anaerobic amine reduction of CAOs, an equilibrium between Cu(II)-aminoquinol and Cu(I)-semiquinone is observed, with Cu(I)-semiquinone yields varying from 0 to 40% depending on the enzyme source (18Dooley D.M. McGuirl M.A. Brown D.E. Turowski P.N. McIntire W.S. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19Medda R. Padiglia A. Bellelli A. Pedersen J.Z. Agro A.F. Floris G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Plant CAOs have high yields of Cu(I)-semiquinone and bacterial CAOs are in the middle of the range, whereas non-plant eukaryotic CAOs have minimal or undetectable amounts of Cu(I) after amine reduction. It has been postulated that despite the unobservable amount of Cu(I)-semiquinone in many non-plant eukaryotic CAOs, there must still be enough Cu(I) present for this to be the O2-activating species during catalysis. However, Co(II)-substituted HPAO has a kcat almost identical to Cu-HPAO at pH 7 (2Goto Y. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13637-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9897-9904Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The reduction potential for Co(II)/Co(I) (e.g. -0.4 to -0.5 V versus SHE in methionine synthase) (22Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3732-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) makes Co(I) an unlikely intermediate in catalysis and effectively rules out the requirement for a copper redox change during HPAO catalysis. Additionally, kinetic isotope effects, steady state kinetics, viscosogen, and stopped-flow experiments have shown that the reduction of molecular oxygen contributes 29% to the overall kcat (3Mills S.A. Goto Y. Su Q. Plastino J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10577-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi K. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4683-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This is a surprising result because the reduction of O2 by Cu(I) to give superoxide is likely to be extremely fast (17Lewis E.A. Tolman W.B. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1047-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Based on these results a new mechanism was proposed for both HPAO and bovine serum amine oxidase that invoked an off-metal molecular oxygen binding pocket for the first electron transfer to O2 directly from the aminoquinol (2Goto Y. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13637-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The off-metal binding site at which O2 undergoes the initial one-electron reduction was proposed to be adjacent to the metal, bounded by the side chains of Met-634, Leu-425, and Tyr-407 (24Su Q. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of residue Met-634 found a size dependence on kcat/Km (O2) in support of this proposal. Xenon complexation can be used to probe the interior of protein structures for sites that favor molecular oxygen gas binding. Because of its analogous properties in size and hydrophobicity, any region that binds xenon is proposed to also be favorable for O2 (25Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In myoglobin, for instance, xenon binding cavities observed crystallographically were also shown to bind photolysed CO, another dioxygen mimic (26Bourgeois D. Vallone B. Schotte F. Arcovito A.

X-ray crystal structures of CAOs bound to Xe are available from bacterial (Arthrobacter globiformis, AGAO), yeast (Pichia pastoris, PPLO), plant (Pisum sativum, PSAO) (31Duff A.P. Trambaiolo D.M. Cohen A.E. Ellis P.J. Juda G.A. Shepard E.M. Langley D.B. Dooley D.M. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. J. Mol.

Rigo A. Zanotti G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An additional solution phase NMR study found that Xe also bound to lentil seedling CAO (Lens esculenta), and the data implicated a Xe-induced conformational change at the active site during amine reduction (33Medda R. Mura A. Longu S. Anedda R. Padiglia A. Casu M. Floris G. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the four available crystal structures there is one consistent xenon site that is ∼7 Å from the copper and ∼7.5 Å from the TPQ. We term this site the “anteroom,” and the residues bordering this pocket in HPAO are Leu-425, Tyr-407, Phe-460, Ile-423, Ile-622, and Ile-639 (see Fig. 2). The anteroom is too far from either the copper or aminoquinol to be directly involved in the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide but could act as a holding pocket for O2 close to the active site, and is consistent with results that indicate O2 is pre-bound to the enzyme before reduction (3Mills S.A. Goto Y. Su Q. Plastino J. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10577-10584Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Su Q. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The off-metal hydrophobic pocket proposed through mutagenesis studies at Met-634 in HPAO is adjacent to the anteroom, and the two pockets share a common residue, Leu-425 (see Fig. 2) (2Goto Y. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13637-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, a L425A mutant had surprisingly little effect on kcat/Km (O2) (2Goto Y. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13637-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The shortest distance from the anteroom to the protein-solvent boundary in CAOs (∼10 Å long) follows a chain of ordered waters from the equatorial water ligand of the copper ion to an area of solvent termed the “inland lake” (see Fig. 2) (34Li R. Klinman J.P. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 293-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wilce M.C. Dooley D.M. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Matsunami H. McIntire W.S. Ruggiero C.E. Tanizawa K. Yamaguchi H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16116-16133Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The inland lake is conserved at the dimer interface of CAOs and has been suggested as the entry point for O2 (35Wilce M.C. Dooley D.M. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Matsunami H. McIntire W.S. Ruggiero C.E. Tanizawa K. Yamaguchi H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16116-16133Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, as a polar channel often only one water molecule wide, it is hard to reconcile this with the hydrophobic nature of molecular oxygen. To help resolve all these data, we wanted to delineate more clearly molecular oxygen holding pockets in HPAO as well as define other potential molecular oxygen pathways into the buried active site. Here we report a crystal structure of HPAO in complex with xenon that offers new insights into CAO-molecular oxygen interactions. Bound xenon in the dense hydrophobic interior of the catalytic domain suggests a putative channel within CAOs accessible to molecular oxygen. Free energy maps of molecular oxygen, computed from dynamics simulations of several CAOs in the absence of xenon, correlate with experimental observations and suggest new pathways that molecular oxygen might take to the buried active site. HPAO Purification—Wild-type HPAO (wtHPAO) for crystallization was heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified as described previously (7Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7647-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36DuBois J.L. Klinman J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 378: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, single colonies from URA- plates incubated at 30 °C were streaked and used to inoculate URA- liquid medium supplemented with 10 μm CuSO4 and a sterile filtered nucleotide/amino acid mixture (5.0 g/liter adenine, 5.0 g/liter histidine, 7.5 g/liter leucine, and 5.0 g/liter tryptophan). The preparation of the URA- media contained 1.7 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) to minimize the Zn2+ concentration in the media. Previous protocols called for 6.7 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base (36DuBois J.L. Klinman J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 378: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Once they had reached an A600 of 5 ∼ 6, the cells were collected by centrifugation and ruptured by Bead-Beater (Biospec). The soluble fraction of the freshly lysed cells was not dialyzed as previously reported but was, instead, equilibrated into 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer by 10-fold dilution. The diluted soluble fraction was then immediately loaded onto the DEAE anion exchange column. This was followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex S-300 column. The protein was buffer exchanged into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and concentrated to 13 mg/ml before crystallization. HPAO Crystallization—Crystallization was performed as previously reported (13 mg/ml HPAO in 8.0–9.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.28–0.30 m phosphate at pH 6.0 at 293 K) with the exception of the use of hanging drop crystallization rather than sitting drop (34Li R. Klinman J.P. Mathews F.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 293-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of protein to well solution in the hanging drops was 1:1, with volumes of 2.5 μl, giving a total volume of 5.0 μl. The best diffracting crystals were cube-shaped with dimensions of 40 × 40 × 30 μm and grew within 3 days. The space group of the crystals used in this study was P21, although crystals also grew in the space groups C2 and P212121 from the same crystallization conditions. Cryoprotection was performed by soaking crystals for 10 s in 25% high purity glycerol (Hampton Research) mixed with mother liquor directly from the crystallization well. Xenon Complexation—Crystals of HPAO in cryoprotected mother liquor were complexed with xenon using a pressure cell (Rigaku) at a pressure of 10 atm for 10 min. To prevent dehydration of the crystal during the pressurization, a small knot of water-saturated Kimwipe was placed at the bottom of the chamber near where the loop containing the crystal would rest during the pressurization. Before pressurization the crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant. Within 5–10 s of depressurization the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Single Crystal Microspectrophotometry—Single crystal spectra were collected at 100 K using the 4DX Systems AB microspectrophotometer equipped with an MS125™ 1/8 m spectrograph (Thermo Oriel), CCD detector (Andor Technology), and xenon lamp (Zeiss) emitting from 300 to 800 nm. Spectra were generated from the integration of 10 19-ms exposures (37Hadfield A. Hajdu J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 839-842Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Each x-ray data set was collected from a single crystal at 100 K at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Beamline ID-19, SBC-CAT). High resolution diffraction data were measured at λ = 0.979 Å (Table 1). For the xenon complex, data were collected at two detector distances; one for the optimal collection of high resolution data and another for the minimization of overlaps at lower resolution. These two data sets were merged for optimal completeness. From the same crystal, an additional lower resolution data set was collected at λ = 1.72 Å to optimally collect anomalous scattering associated with the bound xenon (for Xe f″= 9.0 electrons) (supplemental Table S1). Data were processed with HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP, part of the CCP4 suite (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), using the previously deposited HPAO model, Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1a2v. Calculation of the anomalous map was performed using the programs of the CCP4 suite (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Model building was performed using COOT (40Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). Refinement of the model was performed using REFMAC5 (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). There was no use of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints during refinement. Waters were placed in the model at peaks >3.0 σ in the 2Fo - Fc map using ARP waters, part of REFMAC5 (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates for the position of xenon atoms were located by 6-fold averaging of the anomalous map. Peaks above 6.5 σ were assigned to xenon in the xenon complex provided that they did not overlap with other anomalous scatterers at this wavelength, including copper and sulfur, and were in agreement with expected hydrophobic backbone and side-chain interactions.

Mutant Characterization—TPQ content was determined by titration against phenylhydrazine in 100 mm KPi, pH 7.2, at 30 °C and measuring the change in absorbance at λ = 448 nm using ∈ = 40,500 m-1 cm-1. TPQ per subunit concentrations were then calculated using a total protein concentration obtained from a Bio-Rad protein assay using a bovine serum albumin standard and a Mr of 75,700 for HPAO. Metal content was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Optima 3000DV spectrometer, analyzing the copper wavelengths at 327.4, 324.8, and 224.7 nm and the zinc wavelengths at 206.2, 213.9, and 202.5 nm. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance—Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected at 15 K using a Varian E9 spectrometer with a scan range of 1790–4790 G, microwave power 5 milliwatt, microwave 9.2450 GHz, modulation amplitude 20 G, and receiver gain 32000. A buffer blank spectrum was subtracted from sample spectra before further processing. Steady State Kinetics—Steady state kinetic measurements were carried out by monitoring oxygen consumption using a Clark electrode and a YSI-5300 biological oxygen monitor. Standard conditions were: final volume, 1 ml; temperature, 25 °C; reactions initiated by the addition of HPAO. For determinations of kcat/Km (O2), the methylamine concentration was kept constant at 5 mm, whereas for determinations of kcat/Km (methylamine), the oxygen concentration was kept constant at 258 μm. Solutions were equilibrated to atmospheric conditions by stirring at 1000 rpm for 5 min just before initiation. For reactions at different oxygen concentrations, two flow meters were used to regulate the flow of O2 and N2, and the equilibration time was extended to 10 min. For assays in the pH range 6–8 and 8–9, 100 mm KPi and 25 mm pyrophosphate buffers were used, respectively. The ionic strength of all buffers was kept constant at 0.3 m by the addition of an appropriate amount of KCl. Data were fit directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and kcat was calculated using the active protein concentration as determined by phenylhydrazine titration. The variation of kcat/Km (O2) with pH best fit to an increase with 2 pKa model using the equation, log(x)=log(x)max-log(1+10pKa1-pH+10pKa1+pK2-2pH)(Eq. 1) where x = kcat/Km (O2). O2 Free Energy Maps—Computational analysis was used to predict the location of preferred pathways taken by O2 to reach the active sites of HPAO, AGAO, PPLO, and PSAO. The starting co-ordinates for each simulation were the native oxidized structures and, thus, contained no information regarding experimentally determined Xe binding sites. The protein PDB coordinates (HPAO, 2oov; AGAO, 1w6g; PPLO, 1w7c; PSAO, 1ksi) were first solvated in a 50 mm NaCl water box. If the TPQ was in the inactive “copper-on” conformation (HPAO and PPLO), it was modeled into the active “copper-off” conformation before molecular dynamics. Keeping everything else fixed, the solution was then equilibrated for 30 ps followed by a combination of the solution and protein"
https://openalex.org/W2094599445,"Background The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) plays numerous crucial roles in cancer biology. The majority of knowledge on IGF-1R signaling is concerned with its role in the activation of the canonical phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. However, the role of IGF-1R ubiquitination in modulating IGF-1R function is an area of current research. In light of this we sought to determine the relationship between IGF-1R phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and modulation of growth signals. Methodology Wild type and mutant constructs of IGF-1R were transfected into IGF-1R null fibroblasts. IGF-1R autophosphorylation and ubiquitination were determined by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. IGF-1R degradation and stability was determined by cyclohexamide-chase assay in combination with lysosome and proteasome inhibitors. Principal Findings IGF-1R autophosphorylation was found to be an absolute requirement for receptor ubiquitination. Deletion of C-terminal domain had minimal effect on IGF-1 induced receptor autophosphorylation, however, ubiquitination and ERK activation were completely abolished. Cells expressing kinase impaired IGF-1R, exhibited both receptor ubiquitination and ERK phosphorylation, however failed to activate Akt. While IGF-1R mutants with impaired PI3K/Akt signaling were degraded mainly by the proteasomes, the C-terminal truncated one was exclusively degraded through the lysosomal pathway. Conclusions Our data suggest important roles of ubiquitination in mediating IGF-1R signaling and degradation. Ubiquitination of IGF-1R requires receptor tyrosine kinase activity, but is not involved in Akt activation. In addition we show that the C-terminal domain of IGF-1R is a necessary requisite for ubiquitination and ERK phosphorylation as well as for proteasomal degradation of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2020062724,"A well-known developmental event of retinal maturation is the progressive segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites into a and b sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), a morphological rearrangement crucial for the emergence of the ON and OFF pathways. The factors regulating this process are not known, although electrical activity has been demonstrated to play a role. Here we report that Environmental Enrichment (EE) accelerates the developmental segregation of RGC dendrites and prevents the effects exerted on it by dark rearing (DR). Development of RGC stratification was analyzed in a line of transgenic mice expressing plasma-membrane marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of Thy-1 promoter; we visualized the a and b sublaminae of the IPL by using an antibody selectively directed against a specific marker of cholinergic neurons. EE precociously increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the retina, in parallel with the precocious segregation of RGC dendrites; in addition, EE counteracts retinal BDNF reduction in DR retinas and promotes a normal segregation of RGC dendrites. Blocking retinal BDNF by means of antisense oligos blocks EE effects on the maturation of RGC dendritic stratification. Thus, EE affects the development of RGC dendritic segregation and retinal BDNF is required for this effect to take place, suggesting that BDNF could play an important role in the emergence of the ON and OFF pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2137575813,"Background Access to oestrus females tends to be the main driver of male sociality. This factor can lead to complex behavioural interactions between males and groups of males. Male bottlenose dolphins may form alliances to consort females and to compete with other males. In some populations these alliances may form temporary coalitions when competing for females. I examined the role of dyadic and group interactions in the association patterns of male bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. There is no apparent mating competition in this population and no consortship has been observed, yet agonistic interactions between males occur regularly. Methodology/Principal Findings By comparing the network of male interactions in several social dimensions (affiliative, agonistic, and associative) I show that while agonistic interactions relate to dyadic association patterns, affiliative interactions seem to relate to group association patterns. Some evidence suggests that groups of males also formed temporary coalitions during agonistic interactions. While different groups of males had similar relationships with non-oestrus females, the time they spent with oestrus females and mothers of newborns differed greatly. Conclusions/Significance After considering several hypotheses, I propose that the evolution of these complex relationships was driven by sexual competition probably to out-compete other males for female choice."
https://openalex.org/W2067508944,"Background With the increased occurrence of outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide there is concern that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time. It therefore can be a useful tool to inform policy decisions."

Follistatin is expressed as two splice variants (FS288 and FS315). Previous studies indicated differences in heparin binding between FS288 and FS315, potentially influencing the physiological functions and locations of these isoforms. We have determined the structure of the FS315-activin A complex and quantitatively compared heparin binding by the two isoforms. The FS315 complex structure shows that both isoforms inhibit activin similarly, but FS315 exhibits movements within follistatin domain 3 (FSD3) apparently linked to binding of the C-terminal extension. Surprisingly, the binding affinities of FS288 and FS315 for heparin are similar at lower ionic strengths with FS315 binding decreasing more sharply as a function of salt concentration. When bound to activin, FS315 binds heparin similarly to the FS288 isoform, consistent with the structure of the complex, in which the acidic residues of the C-terminal extension cannot interact with the heparin-binding site.

Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Activin A also has other important physiological roles, because activin A-deficient mice die shortly after birth and exhibit multiple defects in craniofacial development (6Matzuk M.M. Kumar T.R.

Comparative studies of the similarities and differences between TGFβ ligands have lead to a better understanding of the many physiological effects of this multipotent ligand superfamily. TGFβ superfamily members typically exist as covalently linked dimers and fall into three main sub-categories: TGFβs, activins/inhibins/nodals, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (8Lin S.J. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Jardetzky T.S. Woodruff T.K. Reproduction. 2006; 132: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Structurally, these proteins all share a cysteine-knot fold and signal by engaging type II and type I receptors (9Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). Activin and BMPs bind to their type II receptors through a structural feature known as the “knuckle” region (10Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol.

Although specific ligand:receptor pairs have been characterized, multiple ligands share several receptors providing complexity and precise control to the system. The members of this superfamily are produced as prepro-proteins, and the pro-domain often regulates biological functions. In the absence of the pro-domain, TGFβ-1 and -2, as well as BMP-2, -4, and -7, can bind directly to the cell surface through heparin binding sites (17Rider C.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Lyon M. Rushton G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

This provides a mechanism for internalization and degradation of the bioactive ligand not associated with a receptor. Many TGFβ superfamily members, such as activin, do not directly associate with heparin, yet are cleared from the extracellular space through the adaptor protein follistatin. Thus the local concentration of these ligands is precisely controlled by heparin binding interactions. Several extracellular inhibitors of ligands of the TGFβ superfamily have been identified and characterized. Two such ligand antagonists, noggin and follistatin, have been characterized structurally and both are observed to disrupt type I and II receptor binding (19Groppe J. Greenwald J. Wiater E.

Noggin specifically inhibits BMP signaling, whereas follistatin modulates signaling by activin, myostatin, and a subset of BMPs to varying extents, displaying a wide range of affinities for these ligands (22Abe Y.

Commun. 2001; 289: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The specific details of the noggin and follistatin inhibitory mechanisms are distinct, and in particular distinguished by differing stoichiometries of complex formation. Noggin binds ligands with a 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas two follistatin molecules bind a single activin dimer (27Shimonaka M. Inouye S. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3313-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Follistatin is composed of an N-terminal domain (ND), and three follistatin domains (FSD1-3; see Fig. 1A), each of which is further divided into epidermal growth factor-like and a kazal protease inhibitor-like sub-domains (28Phillips D.J. de Kretser D.M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 19: 287-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). FSD1, FSD2, and FSD3 adopt different internal arrangements of the two subdomains, which appear to act as separately folded units with structural but not functional linkage to epidermal growth factor ligands or protease inhibitors. The ND comprises a modified TB fold, found in latent TGFβ-binding proteins and fibrillins (20Thompson T.B. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A helical segment within the ND presents a phenylalanine, which is spatially conserved in type I TGFβ receptors. This striking molecular mimic interferes with type I receptor binding (20Thompson T.B. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Type II receptor interactions are abrogated by FSD1 and -2, which bury a surface area of 810 Å2 on the type II receptor interface (20Thompson T.B. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The mechanism of follistatin binding, together with varying ligand affinities, also permits the formation of a 1:1:1 complex of follistatin-BMP-type I receptor (29Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C.

A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), potentially providing additional degrees of signal modulation, in addition to complete inhibition. Follistatin exists physiologically in three forms: FS288, -303, and -315, ending at residues 288, 303, and 315, respectively. FS288 and -315 arise from alternative splicing of follistatin mRNA, whereas the FS303 form results from proteolysis of the C terminus of FS315 (30Shimasaki S. Koga M. Esch F. Cooksey K. Mercado M.

Muramatsu M. Shiokawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most follistatin mRNA corresponds to the FS315 form, with <5% coding for the FS288 form (32Michel U. Albiston A. Findlay J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). FS288 has the highest affinity for activins, with an affinity for activin A of ∼45 pm and a virtually non-existent dissociation rate. A 10-fold lower affinity between activin and FS315 is attributed to a 10-fold slower association rate of complex formation (33Hashimoto O. Kawasaki N. Tsuchida K. Shimasaki S. Hayakawa T. Sugino H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Activin found in follicular fluid associates with FS288 or FS303, whereas FS315 appears to be the major form found in serum (34Schneyer A.L. Wang Q. Sidis Y. Sluss P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5067-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These data imply that isoform compartmentalization is important for the physiological functions of follistatin. Previous biochemical studies have suggested that the different follistatin isoforms have different binding affinities for heparin, with FS288 having a high affinity, followed by FS303 with intermediate affinity, and finally FS315, which appeared in these studies to have a very low affinity (35Sugino K.

These data, together with the apparent physiological compartmentalization of the isoforms, lead to the proposal that FS288 represents a predominantly cell-bound bioneutralizing antagonist, whereas FS315 is a soluble, serum scavenger for activin (34Schneyer A.L. Wang Q. Sidis Y. Sluss P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5067-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The heparin binding site (HBS) of follistatin has been mapped to a lysine- and arginine-rich sequence within residues 75-86 in FSD1 (Fig. 1A) (37Inouye S. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region have identified lysines 75, 76, 81, and 82 as critical for cell surface association (38Sidis Y. Schneyer A.L. Keutmann H.T. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Asparagine 80 and arginine 86 have also been shown to be important in binding to small heparin analogs (39Innis C.A. Hyvonen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39969-39977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The affinity differences in cell surface association between FS315, -303, and -288 have been attributed to the highly acidic nature of the C-terminal amino acids present in the longer isoforms of follistatin, where 11 of 13 contiguous residues are either glutamic acid or aspartic acid in FS315. Together, these observations suggest that, in the free state, FS315 could adopt an autoinhibited conformation, where the acidic C-terminal tail folds back and associates with the HBS in FSD1 (Fig. 1B), competing for heparin binding. When binding to activin or other members of the TGFβ superfamily, FS315 would have to first disengage this interaction to extend to a conformation capable of binding ligand, potentially explaining its slower on-rates and reduced affinity as compared with FS288. FS288 would lack this autoinhibited interaction and should be more capable of ligand binding. This model is consistent with differences in both on-rates and cell surface association through heparin and heparan sulfates; however, the mechanistic differences between follistatin isoforms and their implications for associated physiological functions remain to be fully understood. To examine the structural and mechanistic differences between follistatin-288 and -315 isoforms, we have determined the x-ray structures of FS-activin A complexes and used quantitative heparin binding assays. The structure of FS315 in complex with activin reveals structural changes in FSD3 that are associated with an apparent binding of the C-terminal extension within an extended peptide-binding groove. The heparin binding characteristics of FS288 and FS315, both alone and in complexes with activin A, are also quantitatively compared, revealing activin-dependent changes in FS315 affinity. These structural and biophysical studies of the two follistatin isoforms suggest a novel mechanistic role of this vital regulator of TGFβ signaling. Production and Purification of Activin and Follistatin—Activin A and follistatin 288 were produced and purified as previously described (11Thompson T.B. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Thompson T.B. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), using Chinese hamster ovary cell lines obtained from Genentech and S. Shimasaki, respectively. Initial crystal screening was performed with recombinant human FS315 purified previously (40Inouye S. Guo Y. DePaolo L. Shimonaka M. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Subsequently, FS315 was purified as described for FS288. Briefly, supernatants from Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing follistatin were obtained from the National Cell Culture Centre, concentrated, dialyzed into 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and applied to a HiPrep 16/10 heparin FF column (GE Healthcare). A gradient to 1.5 m NaCl was used to elute bound protein, and fractions containing FS were pooled. These fractions were dialyzed into 20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl (pH 5.0) and applied to a Bio-Scale S2 cation-exchange column (Bio-Rad). A gradient from 150 mm to 1.25 m NaCl was used to elute the protein, and FS-containing fractions were applied to a HiLoad S200 Superdex gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) for final purification. FS288 or -315 were mixed with activin in a 2.5:1 ratio, incubated for 30 min, and reapplied to the HiLoad S200 gel-filtration column to purify the complexes. Proteins were analyzed on Coomassie-stained 4-20% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and by Western blot, using anti-FS monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems) and a monoclonal antibody specific for FS315 (provided by. Crystallographic Analysis—Activin A-FS315 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and subjected to crystallization trials. Diffraction quality crystals were grown in 20-23% polyethylene glycol 1000, 200 mm MgCl2 (pH 6.5), with 3% EtOH and 20 mm trimethylamine-HCl added. Crystals belonging to space group P2221 diffracted x-rays to 3.4-Å resolution using a synchrotron x-ray source (DND-CAT, Advance Photon Source). Data processing was performed using the CCP4 Program Suite (41P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled in Mosflm and SCALA packages. The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement using one activin monomer and ND, FSD1, and FSD2 of one follistatin molecule of the activin-FS288 complex (PDB ID 2B0U) as a search model using the program PHASER. Data refinement was carried out in REFMAC5 (41P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar) and CNS (42Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). Electron density for the C-terminal extension of FS315 was improved by NCS averaging using the program DM (41P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). NCS restraints were applied during refinement but provided only minor improvement of the final statistics. Model building was performed using O (43Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar), and figures were generated using PyMol. 4W. L. DeLano (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. Fluorescence Polarization—Fluorescence polarization assays were performed at Northwestern University's Keck Biophysics Facility on a Beacon 2000 (Invitrogen). Assays were performed at 1 nm fluorescein-labeled heparin (Invitrogen) and were repeated at least three times in triplicate, carried out in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 150 mm or 250 mm NaCl. Competition assays using unlabeled porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma) were done at 25 nm follistatin. NaCl titration experiments showed that differences in heparin affinity were magnified at 250 mm NaCl, thus competitions were done at this concentration. For FS-activin complexes, proteins were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, ensuring that all follistatin present would exist in an activin-bound state. Samples were incubated for 1 h prior to measurement. Direct binding curves were generated using equations generated by Roehrl et al. (45Roehrl M.H. Wang J.Y. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16056-16066Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and heparin competition curves were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation for a competitive inhibition. Data were plotted using KaleidaGraph. Coordinate Deposition—Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB protein data bank (accession code 2P6A). FS288 Binding to Heparin Is Not Competed by FS289-315 Peptide—Given the highly acidic nature of the C-terminal FS315 extension, it seemed possible that this peptide region could potentially exert its effects on follistatin function by directly mimicking heparin binding. In this scenario, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the FS315 C-terminal region might be expected to act independently as an inhibitor of heparin binding. To study heparin binding to FS288 and FS315, and the potential inhibitory capability of a synthetic C-terminal peptide, we established a fluorescence polarization assay using fluoresceinated heparin. We readily observed FS288 and activin-FS288 associating with fluorescein-labeled heparin, by monitoring increases in the fluorescence polarization of the labeled heparin, as a function of follistatin or follistatin complex concentration, with a maximum value of ∼100 mP (milli-polarization units) (Fig. 1C). These interactions are specific, because the addition of unlabeled heparin competes with the polarization signal efficiently at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 1C). We then tested whether a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 289-315 of FS315 could act as a competitor. When added, the synthetic peptide was unable to compete for heparin binding to FS288 alone or in complex with activin (Fig. 1C), at concentrations comparable to those used for heparin. These data indicate that any interaction between the peptide and the FS HBS must be substantially weaker than the heparin affinity itself. Because the acidic tail is covalently linked in FS315, it exists locally at a much higher concentration. We increased the peptide concentration to 10,000-fold excess over the labeled heparin but still observed no competitive effect (Fig. 1C, inset). These results demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of FS315 does not, on its own, efficiently block activin-FS288 or FS288 interactions with heparin. Structure of the Activin-Follistatin 315 Complex—To further understand the role of the C-terminal tail of FS315 in heparin binding, we determined the crystal structure of FS315 in complex with activin A. FS315 was purified from the conditioned media of FS315-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (40Inouye S. Guo Y. DePaolo L. Shimonaka M. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) by binding to a 16/10 heparin FF column (GE Healthcare), following our approach in purifying FS288 (20Thompson T.B. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Woodruff T.K. Jardetzky T.S. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 535-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This purification strategy indicated that FS315 does associate to some extent with heparin. Purified FS288 and -315 were analyzed by Western blot, and antibodies specific for FS315 were used to discriminate between the two species (Fig. 1D). Crystallization conditions were screened, and a suitable condition was identified that yielded diffraction quality crystals of FS315 in complex with activin A. The FS315 complex was solved by molecular replacement methods, and the structure was refined to the final statistics collected in Table 1.TABLE 1Processing and refinement statistics for the activin-FS315 complexData processingSpace groupP2221Unit cell dimensionsa = 104.64Å, b = 106.58Å,c = 87.57Å; α = β = γ = 90°Resolution (Å)3.4Wavelength (Å)1.00No. unique observations13,978 (1994)aNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.Completeness (%)99.7 (100)aNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.Redundancy7.2 (7.3)aNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.Rmerge (%)16 (70.8)aNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.I/σ4.0 (1.0)aNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.Refinement statisticsNo. unique reflections13,672No. Residues816No. atoms5,952Rwork/Rfree (%)22.3/32.4Figure of merit74.3r.m.s.d.Bonds (Å)0.014Angles (°)1.945Mean B-factor (Å2)57.307Activin A46.005FS315155.297FS315268.921Ramachandran statisticsbDistribution is within the allowed range for this resolution.Most favored (%)64.9Additionally allowed (%)27.0Generously allowed (%)5.6Disallowed (%)2.6a Numbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.b Distribution is within the allowed range for this resolution. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Activin A Is Similar between Follistatin Isoforms—Noggin and follistatin both bioneutralize some members of the TGFβ superfamily by the physical occupation of type I and II receptor binding sites. However, they accomplish this by different structural mechanisms (8Lin S.J. Lerch T.F. Cook R.W. Jardetzky T.S. Woodruff T.K.

In contrast, two follistatin molecules associate with a single molecule of activin (27Shimonaka M. Inouye S. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3313-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In the activin-FS315 structure (Fig. 2, A and B), each follistatin molecule occupies two distinct binding sites on activin, accounting for high affinity interactions. The first region (site 1) is composed of the concave surface of one activin monomer and the helical wrist region of the other, interacting with ND of follistatin. This region comprises the putative type I receptor binding site on activin (13Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H. Donaldson C. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol.

The second binding region (site 2) is located on the convex knuckle region of activin, which interacts with the kazal-like domain of FSD1 and both epidermal growth factor and kazal-like domains of FSD2. This is the binding site for the type II receptors on activin and BMP molecules (10Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol.

Both FS315 and FS288 form a complex with activin through these two binding surfaces to inhibit binding to all activin receptors. There are minimal contacts (<15 Å2) between FSD3 and the activin ligand. The epidermal growth factor-like domain on FSD1 contains the HBS on follistatin and acts as a bridge between the two sites of interaction, making no contacts with activin. Additionally, there are contacts between the ND and FSD3 of the two follistatin molecules, burying 330 Å2 of surface. This interaction is likely an artifact of activin dimerization, as there is no evidence of cooperative binding for follistatin. Comparison of follistatin complexes reveals that FS315 and FS288 bind to activin in a conserved manner. The buried surface area at every contact site between activin and these two follistatin isoforms is comparable. Least squares r.m.s.d. between the activin molecules in each structu"

It possesses phosphotransferase activity and thereby also catalyzes the reverse reaction. Both reactions are allosterically activated by adenine-based nucleotides and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. We have solved structures of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II as native protein (2.2 Angstrom) and in complex with adenosine (1.5 Angstrom) and beryllium trifluoride (2.15 Angstrom) The tetrameric enzyme is structurally similar to enzymes of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, including mitochondrial 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase III but possesses additional regulatory regions that contain two allosteric effector sites. At effector site 1 located near a subunit interface we modeled diadenosine tetraphosphate with one adenosine moiety in each subunit. This efficiently glues the tetramer subunits together in pairs. The model shows why diadenosine tetraphosphate but not diadenosine triphosphate activates the enzyme and supports a role for cN-II during apoptosis when the level of diadenosine tetraphosphate increases. We have also modeled 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in effector site 1 using one phosphate site from each subunit. By comparing the structure of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II with that of mitochondrial 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase in complex with dGMP, we identified residues involved in substrate recognition."

In mice, CCl4 decreased plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, increased cellular lipids, and reduced microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) without diminishing mRNA levels. Similarly, CCl4 decreased apoB-lipoprotein production and MTP activity but had no effect on mRNA levels in primary enterocytes and colon carcinoma and hepatoma cells. CCl4 did not affect MTP synthesis but induced post-translational degradation involving ubiquitinylation and proteasomes in McA-RH7777 cells.

This modification was prevented by the inhibition of P450 oxygenases, indicating that CCl3· generated by these enzymes targets MTP for degradation. To determine whether inhibition of proteolysis could prevent CCl4 toxicity, mice were fed with CCl4 with or without lactacystin.

Hepatic accumulation of triglycerides (steatosis) is a major complication associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (1Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). This is attributed to increased lipogenesis and decreased β-oxidation followed by lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction (1Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Although benign, steatosis can advance to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a colorless liquid that is nonflammable and volatile, with a distinct odor. In the 19th century it was used as an anesthetic. In the first 25 years of the 20th century its toxicity was firmly established (2Recknagel R.O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1967; 19: 145-208PubMed Google Scholar). CCl4 was banned in the United States as a dry-cleaning agent in 1970 because of its hepatotoxicity. It is, however, used in the synthesis of refrigerants and production of semiconductors, as a fumigant, and in the processing of fats, oils, and rubber (3International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC Monogr Eval. Carcinog. Risks Hum. 1999; 71: 401-432PubMed Google Scholar). Industrial emission is the major source of CCl4 in the air. It is found in low levels in ambient air and water (3International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC Monogr Eval. Carcinog. Risks Hum. 1999; 71: 401-432PubMed Google Scholar). CCl4 is rapidly metabolized by mixed function cytochrome P450 oxygenases of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; HDL, high density lipoprotein. resulting in the generation of CCl3· (4Plaa G.L.

Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). CCl3· can also react with oxygen to form CCl3OO· (4Plaa G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

CCl3OO· initiates a chain reaction leading to lipid peroxidation, changes in membrane permeability, and loss of calcium homeostasis. In addition, tissue lipid levels increase (see below). The initial cellular injury subsequently takes the form of inflammation (5Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 6Basu S. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the chronic effects of CCl4 exposure include fatty degeneration, fibrosis, hepatocellular death, and carcinogenicity (5Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). After oral administration, CCl4 concentrates in the liver. Early biochemical changes are obvious in the first couple of hours, and tissue necrosis is visible after 5 h. Around 12 h, central zone necrosis is evident (5Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). CCl4 decreases secretion of triglycerides as part of very low density lipoproteins and increases hepatic triglyceride by 195% within 3 h in rats (7Boll M. Weber L.W. Becker E. Stampfl A. Z. Naturforsch. (C). 2001; 56: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, a distinctive feature of CCl4 toxicity is the rapidity of triglyceride accumulation in the liver due to a failure in their secretory mechanisms (2Recknagel R.O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1967; 19: 145-208PubMed Google Scholar, 4Plaa G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 42-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). This failure has been largely attributed to unspecified functional impairment in the Golgi apparatus (5Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), and the need to study the possible effects of chlorinated methanes on the molecular events involved in triglyceride secretion has been emphasized (4Plaa G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 42-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Triglyceride secretion requires assembly and secretion of lipoproteins by the liver and intestine, which is critically dependent on apolipoprotein B (apoB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (8Hussain M.M. Shi J. Dreizen P. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 9Hussain M.M. Iqbal J. Anwar K. Rava P. Dai K. Front.

ApoB serves as a structural protein, and MTP present in the ER is a required chaperone for the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. MTP transfers several lipids, and its phospholipid transfer activity is sufficient for lipoprotein production (11Rava P. Ojakian G.K. Shelness G.S. Hussain M.M. J. Biol.

Stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Dr. David Gordon, Bristol-Myers Squibb, kindly provided BMS197636. For in vivo experiments, CCl4 was mixed with olive oil and gavaged (1 μl/g body weight). For ex vivo and in vitro experiments, CCl4 was dissolved in Me2SO. Final concentrations of Me2SO did not exceed 0.25%. C57Bl/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were housed in an air-conditioned room at 22 °C with a 12-h lighting schedule and fed rodent chow. Male 10–12-week-old mice were used in this study. Food was removed the night before the experiments. Experimental mice received CCl4 in olive oil. Control mice received an equal volume of oil and saline. Blood was collected from the heart, and serum lipid levels were determined in plasma using commercial kits (Thermo Trace). Cholesterol and triglyceride in high density lipoproteins (HDL) were measured after the precipitation of apoB-lipoproteins with phosphotungstate magnesium chloride (22Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. J.

MTP Activity Assays—To measure MTP activity, 100 μgof liver and intestine were homogenized in 1 ml of buffer K (1.0 mm EGTA, 1 mm Tris-HCl, and mm MgCl2) and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was used to measure MTP activity (28Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J.

For in vitro activity assays, MTP purified from bovine liver or mice intestinal and liver microsomal proteins were incubated with different concentrations of olive oil or CCl4 in oil for 30 min in the presence of donor and acceptor vesicles. Changes in fluorescence due to lipid transfer by MTP were recorded and used to determine the effect of CCl4 on MTP activity. Lipid Synthesis—To measure lipid synthesis and secretion, cells were labeled with 5 μCi/ml [3H]glycerol with or without CCl4 for 4 h. The media were collected, and the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total lipids in the cells and medium were then extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v). The organic solvent was evaporated, and the residues were dissolved in isopropanol and spotted on a thin layer chromatographic plate. Radiolabeled triglycerides and phospholipids were separated using hexanes/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:2) as a developing solvent. Lipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors; bands corresponding to the marker lipids were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (26Luchoomun J. Hussain M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19565-19572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were preincubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (100–200 μCi/ml). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/ml) for 2 h in methionine-deficient media supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μm methionine in the presence and absence of CCl4 in Me2SO for different times. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.015% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton, 1% SDS. Cell lysates were incubated at 70 °C for 15 min to ensure complete cell lysis and diluted with lysis buffer to achieve a SDS concentration of 0.1% (w/v) as reported (23Hussain M.M. Zhao Y.

Supernatants (0.9 ml) were combined with 0.1 ml of 10× lysis buffer containing 1% SDS. Cell lysates and media were incubated with antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 2 h and then with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (10% solution) for an additional 2 h. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1% Triton, eluted in 50 μlof sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. Radioactivity in apolipoproteins was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated under non-reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked for 2 h in 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature. The blots were washed three times and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing 0.5% dry milk and a primary antibody (1:1000 dilution), washed, and then incubated with mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000) in 1.0% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immune reactivity was detected by chemiluminescence. For subcellular fractionation experiments, cells were homogenized using a syringe with a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes) and centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C; Beckman GS-15R centrifuge). The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged (3,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to get the heavy mitochondrial pellet. To isolate the microsomal fraction, the postmitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman tabletop Ultracentrifuge TLA-110 rotor. The remaining supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction as reported previously (31Anwar K. Kayden H.J. Hussain M.M. J.

The microsomal pellet and the supernatant proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen; 1:2,000 dilution) or anti-MTP antibody (1:2,000 dilution). To detect ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, cell or tissue homogenates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS and incubated with protein A and anti-MTP antibodies for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection of ubiquitinylated proteins, membranes were incubated with antibodies against ubiquitin or MTP. After 2 h, membranes were washed and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody tagged with horseradish peroxidase, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Analyses of Gene Expressions—Total tissue RNA was isolated from frozen tissues or cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) (33Zhang H. Vakil V. Braunstein M. Smith E.L. Maroney J. Chen L. Dai K. Berenson J.R.

RNA was treated with DNase I at 37 °C followed by inactivation at 75 °C for 5 min. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers. Real-time PCR measurements of individual cDNAs were performed in triplicate by TaqMan probe or SYBR Green methods using an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems).

GAPDH mRNA was used as an internal control (Applied Biosystems) (35Terada T. Shimada Y. Pan X. Kishimoto K. Sakurai T. Doi R. Onodera H. Katsura T. Imamura M. Inui K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 1756-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All determinations were made in triplicate or quadruplicate and reported as the mean ± S.D. Treatment groups were subjected to one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's test for multiple comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. CCl4 Decreases Plasma ApoB-lipoproteins and Increases Hepatic and Intestinal Lipid Levels—To study the acute effects of CCl4, mice were gavaged with saline, olive oil, or CCl4 in olive oil (Fig. 1). Olive oil had no effect on total plasma triglyceride (Fig. 1A) or cholesterol (Fig. 1B) levels compared with saline. In plasma, these lipids are carried on apoB-lipoproteins and HDL that mainly contain apoAI. Increasing amounts of CCl4 decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol (Fig. 1, A and B, total) mainly because of reductions in apoB-lipoproteins (Fig. 1A, 1B). Tissue analyses revealed that this treatment increased (∼2-fold) intestinal as well as hepatic triglyceride (Fig. 1C) and cholesterol (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that CCl4 decreases plasma apoB-lipoproteins and increases tissue lipid levels. Time course studies revealed maximum reductions in plasma triglycerides at 4 h (Fig. 1E, total). Subsequently, there was a trend toward an increase in their plasma levels. In fact, plasma lipids reverted to normal levels after 24 h (data not shown). CCl4 mainly decreased apoB-lipoprotein triglyceride (Fig. 1E, apoB-lipoproteins) without affecting HDL (Fig. 1E, HDL). Total plasma cholesterol levels also significantly decreased with time in CCl4-fed mice (Fig. 1F, total). Again, apoB-lipoprotein (Fig. 1F, apoB-lipoprotein) cholesterol levels were significantly reduced and HDL levels were unaffected (Fig. 1F, HDL). Tissue lipid analyses revealed that intestinal and hepatic triglyceride increased (∼3-fold) up to 4 h and then decreased at 6 h (Fig. 1G). Similarly, hepatic and intestinal cholesterol levels increased until 4 h and started to decline later (Fig. 1H). These studies show that a single dose of CCl4 significantly decreases plasma apoB-lipoproteins and increases intestinal and hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels in a time-dependent fashion. Increases in liver triglyceride levels have been observed in CCl4-exposed animals (2Recknagel R.O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1967; 19: 145-208PubMed Google Scholar, 4Plaa G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 42-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Weber L.W. Boll M. Stampfl A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 105-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar); however, intestinal steatosis has not yet been appreciated. CCl4 Decreases MTP in Mice—Because CCl4 had a major effect on plasma apoB-lipoproteins, we studied its effect on MTP. Mice were fed with increasing amounts of CCl4, and triglyceride transfer activity of MTP was measured after 4 h. Increasing CCl4 concentrations decreased MTP activity in the intestine (Fig. 2A) and liver (Fig. 2B). Western analyses showed significant decrease in MTP but no change in cytosolic marker GAPDH (Fig. 2, C and D). Time course studies showed that MTP activity decreased in the liver and the intestine with maximum reduction (∼75%) evident at 4 h (Fig. 2, E and F). In addition, there was a time-dependent loss of protein in these tissues (Fig. 2, G and H). These studies indicate that CCl4 decreases MTP protein and activity in different tissues. To address whether CCl4 has a direct effect on MTP, we studied its effect on the purified and cellular MTP. CCl4 had no inhibitory effect on the lipid transfer activity of purified MTP (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, it did not alter hepatic and intestinal MTP activities (Fig. 3, B and C) excluding the possibility that CCl4 inhibits MTP. CCl4 Decreases ApoB-lipoprotein Secretion and MTP Levels in Cultured Cells—To evaluate the mechanisms involved in decreases in plasma apoB-lipoproteins and tissue MTP in mice, we tested cultured cells for their response to CCl4. Mouse primary enterocytes were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h in the presence of increasing amounts of CCl4. Increasing concentrations of CCl4 decreased apoB secretion without affecting apoAI (Fig. 4A). Amounts of apoB were significantly lower in cells treated with higher concentrations of CCl4. However, this treatment had no effect on cellular apoAI levels (Fig. 4B). Next, we measured the amounts of radiolabeled MTP and GAPDH in cells treated with increasing CCl4 concentrations. This treatment significantly decreased cellular MTP without affecting GAPDH levels (Fig. 4C). We also measured MTP activity in enterocytes exposed to different CCl4 levels (Fig. 4D) and observed that MTP activity was reduced in cells exposed to higher levels of CCl4. These studies showed that CCl4 treatment decreases MTP but does not affect GAPDH levels. Moreover, it decreased apoB secretion without affecting apoAI secretion. Studies were then performed in human colon carcinoma Caco-2 and hepatoma HepG2 cells (Fig. 5). CCl4 decreased secretion of lipids (Fig. 5A) and apoB (Fig. 5B) but had no effect on apoAI secretion in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, it decreased cellular MTP activity (Fig. 5C). Analyses of mRNA levels revealed that CCl4 had no effect on apoB, apoAI, or MTP mRNA levels (Fig. 5D). Exposure of HepG2 to increasing amounts of CCl4 also resulted in decreased secretion of lipids (Fig. 5E) and apoB (Fig. 5F) consistent with other toxicity studies in these cells (36Harries H.M. Fletcher S.T. Duggan C.M. Baker V.A. Toxicol. In Vitro. 2001; 15: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, this treatment had no effect on apoAI secretion. Again, CCl4 decreased MTP activity (Fig. 5G) but had no effect on mRNA levels of apoB, apoAI, or MTP (Fig. 5H). These studies indicate that CCl4 specifically decreases apoB secretion by reducing MTP activity. Decrease in MTP was not due to changes in its mRNA levels, excluding transcriptional repression mechanisms. Incubation of rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells with increasing concentrations of CCl4 significantly decreased triglyceride and phospholipid secretion (Fig. 6, A and B), increased cellular triglycerides, but not phospholipids and proteins (Fig. 6B), and reduced apoB secretion without affecting apoAI secretion (Fig. 6C) consistent with the inhibition of lipid secretion by CCl4 in primary rat hepatocytes (7Boll M.

Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 2419-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these cells, MTP protein decreased, but protein disulfide isomerase (ER enzyme) and GAPDH remained unaltered (Fig. 6D). In contrast to its effects on protein levels, CCl4 had no effect on MTP mRNA levels eliminating the model in which changes in mRNA lead to differences in protein activities (Fig. 6E). In short, CCl4 reduces MTP activity in both intestinal and liver cells, decreases lipoprotein secretion, and increases intracellular triglyceride as it does in mice. CCl4 Induces Post-translational Degradation of MTP Involving Ubiquitin and Proteasomes—The data presented thus far have indicated that CCl4 decreases MTP protein. Loss of protein with no change in mRNA levels could be because of reduced synthesis or enhanced post-translational degradation. To study the effect of CCl4 on MTP synthesis, McA-RH7777 cells were treated with CCl4 for 4 h and then radiolabeled for 5–15"

We have previously shown that ITSN-1s is required for caveolae fission and internalization in endothelial cells (ECs). In the present study, using small interfering RNA to knock down ITSN-1s protein expression, we demonstrate a novel role of ITSN-1s as a key antiapoptotic protein. Knockdown of ITSN-1s in ECs activated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis as determined by genomic DNA fragmentation, extensive mitochondrial fission, activation of the proapoptotic proteins BAK and BAX, and cytochrome c efflux from mitochondria. ITSN-1 knockdown acts as a proapoptotic signal that causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and generation of reactive oxygen species. These effects were secondary to decreased activation of Erk1/2 and its direct activator MEK. Bcl-XL overexpression prevented BAX activation and the apoptotic ECs death induced by suppression of ITSN-1s. Our findings demonstrate a novel role of ITSN-1s as a negative regulator of the mitochondrial pathway-dependent apoptosis secondary to activation of the Erk1/2 survival signaling pathway.

McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ITSNs interact via the SH3A domain with the mammalian Son-of-sevenless, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Ras (9Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E. Kurakin A. Abi-Jaoude E. Quinn C.C. Olson M.F. Marais R. Baranes D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The association of ITSN with mammalian Son-of-sevenless leads to increased levels of RasGTP with functional consequences in signaling Erk1/2 activation (9Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. de Heuvel E.

Activated Ras initiates the phosphorylation cascade, leading to phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 MAPKs (Erk1 and Erk2). In both neurons and nonneuronal cell lines, overexpression of the SH3A to -E, presumed to function in a dominant negative manner (11Marie B. Sweeney S.T. Poskanzer K.E. Roos J. Kelly R.B. Davis G.W. Neuron. 2004; 43: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), attenuated the activation of EGF-mediated Ras/MAPK pathway (8Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. Adams A.G.

The concept of ITSNs as mediators of MAPK signaling is further supported by studies showing that full-length ITSN overexpression in HEK cells generated increased Ras-GTP levels associated with cytoplasmic vesicles, resulting in the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation (12Mohney R.P.

More recent work (13Wang J.B. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that the long ITSN isoform mediates JNK activation, and this effect is due to the capability of ITSN-L to activate both Ras and Cdc42. Together, these findings suggest that ITSNs regulate the MAPK pathways important for essential cellular functions, such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In the present study, we used the siRNA to specifically knock down ITSN-1s protein expression and to analyze its effects on ECs. Biochemical and morphological analyses of cells lacking ITSN-1s showed morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis, such as genomic DNA fragmentation, extensive mitochondrial fission, blebbing of the mitochondrial membrane, widening of the narrow tubular cristae, and swollen and unstacked Golgi apparatus. Moreover, the proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, BAX and BAK, were activated, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to the cytosol and mitochondrial dysfunction. These effects were secondary to decreased MEK/Erk1/2 activation. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL prevented BAX activation and inhibited apoptotic cell death caused by ITSN-1s down-regulation. Thus, we conclude that ITSN-1s is a key link between the regulatory signaling mechanisms of the mitochondrial death and upstream survival signaling pathways.

For silencing ITSN-1 gene expression, we used Dharmacon SMARTpool reagents. Preliminary experiments were carried out to establish optimized transfection and cell culture conditions. RNase-free conditions and reagents were used throughout the silencing experiments. The individual siGENOME duplex most efficient in knocking down ITSN-1s protein expression (ITSN-1s RNAi), GGACAUAGUUGUACUGAAAUU (sense sequence) and 5′-UUUCAGUACAACUAUGUCCUU (antisense), was delivered in cultured ECs using Dharmafect1 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siCONTROL™ functional nontargeting siRNA sequence 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′ was used as control for potential secondary effects caused by siRNA transfection. The siGloCyclophilin B siRNA was used as control for efficient transfection and to evaluate any off-target effects caused by the introduction of ITSN-1 RNAi in ECs. RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Qiagen RNeasy Mini RNA isolation kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated by the first step of the Invitrogen Thermoscript 2 Step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Amplifications were carried out using the following primers: ITSN-1s (5′-TTGGTTCCCCAAGTCTTACG-3′,5′-AGCCTATCTGGCGCTTTTTC-3′), ITSN-1L (5′-GTTGATGGTGAACGTGGTTG-3′, 5′-CCATCCCATATCCCTGTGAC-3′), ITSN-2s (5′-CTGTCCATTCCTCAGCCATT-3′,5′-ACGTCAGCCAGAGTCCAAAT-3′), ITSN-2L (5′-CAGATGATTTCCTGGGTCGT-3′, 5′-ACATTCAACCGAGCGGTAAC-3′). An equal volume of cDNA from the first step was used as template for the PCR containing standard conditions as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 30 cycles, products were run in 1.5% agarose gel (Invitrogen) and visualized using ethidium bromide. Relative amounts of RNA were assessed by amount of PCR product in comparison with PCR product for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Retrovirus was produced by transfection into the retroviral packaging PT67 cell line. Briefly, vectors (10 μg) were transfected in PT67 cells using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Viral supernatants, collected 48 h post-transfection, were used to infect cultured ECs for 4 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Subsequently, the cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml puromycin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and then transfected with a 100 nm final concentration of ITSN-1s RNAi. 48 h post-siRNA transfection EC monolayers were used for biochemical and morphological analyses. EC monolayers grown on glass coverslips were stained with MitoTracker RedCMXRos according to the manufacturer's instructions. After MitoTracker staining, ECs were washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, for 5 min at room temperature. After quenching in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, the fixed and permeabilized ECs were incubated with anti-cytochrome c or anti-Bax mAbs diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed (5 × 5 min) and then were incubated with an anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor 488 conjugated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. After washing as above, the cells were mounted on glass slides using the Prolong Antifade kit. Control and RNAi ITSN-1s transfected cells were subjected to standard EM procedure. Briefly, EC monolayers were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in the same buffer (3 × 10 min), the cells were post-fixed in Palade's 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h on ice, stained with Kellenberger buffer, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Epon at 60 °C. For analyzing the morphological changes induced by ITSN-1 RNAi transfection, 15-20 sections/grid and 3-5 grids/block from six blocks chosen at random were used. The mitochondrial profiles were recorded on 100 micrographs (×64,000 magnification) for each experimental condition, and their number was normalized per 100 μm2 of EC surface. A polyclonal anti-ITSN Ab was raised in New Zealand rabbits against GST fusion protein GST-human ITSN1-s (residues 1-440) as in Ref. 7Okamoto M. Schoch S. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18446-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar. The cDNA of human ITSN-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Suzana de la Luna (Molecular Genetics Center IRO, Barcelona, Spain). The Ab was affinity purified on immobilized GST-human ITSN-(1-440) and characterized by Western blotting using human cultured EC 1% Triton X-100 extracts. The TUNEL assay was carried out for detection of apoptosis induced by ITSN-1s siRNA knockdown. Control and siRNA-treated cells (ECs or MEFs), 48 h after transfection, were washed in PBS and then permeabilized by methanol fixation for 5 min, at -20 °C. The TUNEL reaction mixture (label and enzyme solutions), prepared as indicated by the manufacturer, was applied on cell monolayers for 60 min, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. EC monolayers reacted with the label solution only were used as negative controls. After washing, the coverslips were mounted using the Prolong Antifade kit with DAPI. TUNEL-positive cells were identified by fluorescence microscopy analysis using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Preparation of Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Fractions—ECs were gently scraped from the culture dish and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then resuspended in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml leupeptin as in Ref. 15Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. After 30 min on ice, the cells were disrupted by 40 strokes with a glass Dounce homogenizer with a tight pestle. After Dounce homogenization, the unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial fraction was isolated by centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant at 22,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet lysed in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and mixture of protease inhibitors) and the resulting supernatant (cytosolic fraction) were used to analyze by immunoblotting the levels of cytochrome c. Immunoblotting—Protein concentration of both cytosol fraction and mitochondrial extract were determined by BCA. Equivalent protein amounts (25 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with anti-cytochrome c, anti-BAX, or anti-BAK mAbs. The bands of immunoreactivity were visualized using appropriate reporter Abs horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and ECL. Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ1.37v software. Cross-linking of Mitochondrial Fractions—In parallel experiments, mitochondria-enriched fraction from controls and ITSN-1 RNAi-treated ECs were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide-containing control buffer or with 10 mm BMH cross-linker. After 30 min, the cross-linking reaction was stopped with 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the mitochondrial membranes were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-BAX mAbs. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) opening was measured in intact ECs by monitoring the fluorescence of mitochondrial confined calcein-AM, including the appropriate use of CoCl2 to quench cytosolic fluorescence. Briefly, 1 × 106 control and ITSN-1 RNAi-treated ECs (48 h post-transfection) were prepared as single cell suspension in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing Ca2+ and loaded with calcein-AM for 15 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. In parallel experiments, similar cell samples were loaded with calcein-AM in the presence of CoCl2. After removal of excess stain and quenching reagent, the cell pellets were resuspended in ∼400 μl of HBSS containing Ca2+ and analyzed for calcein-AM fluorescence by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACscan flow cytometer in conjunction with winMDI 2.8 software (excitation/emission 494/517 nm). Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) were determined by flow cytometry using TMRE staining as in Ref. 16Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B.

Briefly, aliquots of 106 control and ITSN-1s-depleted ECs (48 h post-transfection) were prepared as a single cell suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and stained for 20 min at 37 °C with 25 nm TMRE. Cells stained with TMRE were visualized by flow cytometry using the BD Biosciences FACscan flow cytometer (excitation/emission 549/574 nm). The levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. For fluorescence microscopy, control and ITSN-1 RNAi-treated ECs (48 h post-transfection) grown on coverslips were briefly washed with HBSS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then incubated with MitoSOX for 10 min at 37 °C, protected from light. The cells were washed, counterstained with DAPI, and used for imaging. For flow cytometry, controls and ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected ECs were trypsinized and prepared as single cell suspension in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS/Ca/Mg). As controls, nontransfected ECs or ECs transfected with the nontargeting siRNA sequence were used. Cells were loaded with the MitoSOX Red reagent as above, washed gently, and then resuspended in ∼400 μl of HBSS/Ca/Mg. The fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry as above. The cells were washed briefly in PBS, centrifuged, and lysed in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of protein (typically, 30 μg of total protein) were subjected to 5-20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated forms of MAPKs with Abs specific for phospho-Erk1/2, -MEK1/2, -p38, and -JNK, followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated reporters. Knockdown of ITSN-1s Protein Expression—siRNA targeting the ITSN-1 gene was employed to assess the function of ITSN-1s in ECs. Down-regulation of ITSN-1s protein expression was first achieved using SMARTpool ITSN-1 RNAi reagents that comprise four selected siRNA duplexes targeting the ITSN-1 gene. Since ITSN-1L is neuron specific and thus not expressed in lung endothelium, isoform specificity for the siRNA sequence is not required. Each siRNA duplex in the SMARTpool was tested for the depletion efficiency of ITSN-1s. The siRNA duplex GGACAUAGUUGUACUGAAAUU (sense sequence) and 5′-UUUCAGUACAACUAUGUCCUU (antisense sequence) was found to be the most efficient in suppressing ITSN-1s expression; thus, this sequence was further used for the silencing experiments. The depletion efficiency of ITSN-1s was first evaluated by Western blotting using the anti-ITSN pAb raised against the GST-human ITSN-(1-440) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A significant decrease in ITSN-1s/2s immunoreactivity 48 h post-transfection was detected in ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected ECs (Fig. 1A, lane c, top), by reference to control non-transfected cells (Fig. 1A, lane a) or ECs transfected with the control siRNA sequence (Fig. 1A, lane b), due to efficient silencing of ITSN-1s protein expression. A weak ITSN immunoreactivity was still detected in transfected cells due to ITSN-2s and remnants of ITSN-1s. No detectable changes in ITSN-2L or caveolin-1 protein expression were observed (Fig. 1A), indicating the specific nature of ITSN-1 knock down. Actin immunoblotting (Fig. 1A) was used to confirm the equal protein loading. To confirm that indeed the RNAi sequence silenced specifically ITSN-1s, the Western blot analysis was complemented by RT-PCR to evaluate the mRNA levels of ITSN isoforms in controls and RNAi-transfected ECs. As shown in Fig. 1B, ITSN-1 RNAi transfection did not affect the mRNA levels of ITSN-2 isoforms (Fig. 1B, lane c) by reference to controls (Fig. 1B, lanes a and b), whereas in ECs transfected with ITSN-1 RNAi, the ITSN-1s mRNA levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 1B, lane c). The control siRNA sequence did not affect the level of ITSN-1s mRNA (Fig. 1B, lane b). RT-PCR analysis expectedly showed that ITSN-1L was not present in the lung ECs (not shown). Since the levels of ITSN-2 protein expression are not affected by ITSN-1 RNAi, one can assume that the decreased immunoreactivity of short ITSNs detected in the lysates prepared from ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected ECs are caused exclusively by ITSN-1s down-regulation. Quantitative analysis applied on similar ECL-developed immunoblots obtained from four different experiments indicated that greater than 85% of the total amount of ITSN-1s protein was knocked down in ECs transfected with RNAi targeting the ITSN-1 gene (Fig. 1C). Control experiments to achieve efficient transfection and cell culture conditions were carried out and monitored using siRNA GloCyclophilin B. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of ECs transfected with 100 nm siGlo siRNA shows numerous cells displaying perinuclear fluorescent staining at 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 1D). We also observed that ITSN-1s protein expression was efficiently suppressed by the same siRNA duplex in MEFs. The efficiency of down-regulation was evaluated by immunoblotting of control and ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected MEF lysates with a specific anti-ITSN-1 mAb (BD Biosciences), that recognizes only mouse ITSN-1, (Fig. 1E). At 48 h post-RNAi transfection, light microscopy observations showed shrinking of ECs, appearance of intracellular vacuoles, detachment of ECs from the substrate, and significant cell death (Fig. 1F, f2 and f3). At 72 h post-transfection, the number of cells attached to the substrate was significantly reduced (not shown). ECs transfected with the control siRNA sequence show normal morphology and intact interendothelial junctions at 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 1F, f1). siRNA Targeting the ITSN-1 Gene Induces Apoptosis—To address whether cell death induced by down-regulation of ITSN-1s is the result of apoptosis, we evaluated the DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL reaction. As shown in Fig. 2A, most of the ECs transfected with ITSN-1 RNAi were TUNEL-positive at 48 h post-transfection. The nuclear morphology of ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected ECs showed fragmentation and extensive blebbing of their membrane (Fig. 2B, b1 and b2). Since ITSN-1 RNAi also silenced ITSN-1 protein expression in MEFs, we evaluated if the fragmentation of genomic DNA occurred in these cells. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, down-regulation of ITSN-1 levels induced DNA fragmentation in the nuclei of mouse fibroblasts. However, detachment of MEFs from gel-atin-coated coverslips was not as marked as seen for ECs (Fig. 2D). TUNEL-positive cells were detected rarely in nontransfected and mock-transfected cells (not shown). No TUNEL-positive cells were detected in ECs transfected with the control siRNA duplex (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that the apoptotic changes caused by suppression of ITSN-1s expression are not secondary effects caused by siRNA transfection. Next, we examined the morphology of ITSN-1s RNAi-transfected ECs at the EM level. One of the most obvious morphological changes caused by transfection of ECs with ITSN-1 RNAi was the presence of numerous small round mitochondria often associated with an extensive endoplasmic reticulum network (Fig. 3B). In ECs transfected with the control siRNA sequence (Fig. 3A, a1) or nontransfected ECs (not shown), mitochondria were elongated, oval structures with narrow cristae. A detailed analysis showed mitochondria with pleiomorphic cristae, blebbing, and swelling after transfection of ECs with ITSN-1 RNAi (Fig. 3B, b1 and b2). Morphometric analysis indicated a 2.4-fold increase in the number of mitochondria in ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected cells compared with nontransfected ECs or cells transfected with the control siRNA sequence (Fig. 3F). In addition, we observed in transfected cells swelling and unstacking of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3D). In healthy ECs, the Golgi apparatus consisted of a system of multiple flattened membranous cisternae, situated in close apposition to each other as stacks (Fig. 3C, arrows). In contrast, in ECs depleted of ITSN-1s, individual cisternae were swollen and disassembled into clusters of vesicles and tubules dispersed throughout the cell (Fig. 3D). We also observed in ITSN-1s RNAi transfected ECs widespread network of the endoplasmic reticulum. As shown in Fig. 3B, the endoplasmic reticulum tubules extend throughout the cytosol from one front to the other of the cell, in association with small and round mitochondria. The morphological analysis of ITSN-1s RNAi-transfected ECs also revealed a dramatic reduction in the number of caveolae (Fig. 3E) by comparison with control cells (Fig. 3A, a2). Occasionally, ITSN-1 RNAi-transfected ECs displayed caveolae open to the cell surface or caveolae free in the cytosol (not shown). ITSN-1s Knockdown Induces Release of Cytochrome c Mitochondria—Studies have shown that the involvement of mitochondria in apoptosis includes a critical step involving the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial IMS into the cytosol (17Scorrano L.

https://openalex.org/W2092153134,"Background Francisella tularensis causes tularaemia, a life-threatening zoonosis, and has potential as a biowarfare agent. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, which causes the most severe form of tularaemia, is usually confined to North America. However, a handful of isolates from this subspecies was obtained in the 1980s from ticks and mites from Slovakia and Austria. Our aim was to uncover the origins of these enigmatic European isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined the complete genome sequence of FSC198, a European isolate of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, by whole-genome shotgun sequencing and compared it to that of the North American laboratory strain Schu S4. Apparent differences between the two genomes were resolved by re-sequencing discrepant loci in both strains. We found that the genome of FSC198 is almost identical to that of Schu S4, with only eight SNPs and three VNTR differences between the two sequences. Sequencing of these loci in two other European isolates of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis confirmed that all three European isolates are also closely related to, but distinct from Schu S4. Conclusions/Significance The data presented here suggest that the Schu S4 laboratory strain is the most likely source of the European isolates of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis and indicate that anthropogenic activities, such as movement of strains or animal vectors, account for the presence of these isolates in Europe. Given the highly pathogenic nature of this subspecies, the possibility that it has become established wild in the heartland of Europe carries significant public health implications."
https://openalex.org/W2106006522,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) commonly participate in herpesvirus entry. They are thought to provide a reversible attachment to cells that promotes subsequent receptor binding. Murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) infection of fibroblasts and epithelial cells is highly GAG-dependent. This is a function of the viral gp150, in that gp150-deficient mutants are much less GAG-dependent than wild-type. Here we show that the major MHV-68 GAG-binding protein is not gp150 but gp70, a product of ORF4. Surprisingly, ORF4-deficient MHV-68 showed normal cell binding and was more sensitive than wild-type to inhibition by soluble heparin rather than less. Thus, the most obvious viral GAG interaction made little direct contribution to infection. Indeed, a large fraction of the virion gp70 had its GAG-binding domain removed by post-translational cleavage. ORF4 may therefore act mainly to absorb soluble GAGs and prevent them from engaging gp150 prematurely. In contrast to gp70, gp150 bound poorly to GAGs, implying that it provides little in the way of adhesion. We hypothesize that it acts instead as a GAG-sensitive switch that selectively activates MHV-68 entry at cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2049184370,"Background Interspecific hybridization is widespread, occurring in a taxonomically diverse array of species. The Cyprinidae family, which displays more than 30% hybridization, is a good candidate for studies of processes underlying isolation and speciation, such as genetic exchange between previously isolated lineages. This is particularly relevant in the case of recent hybridization between an invasive species, Chondrostoma nasus nasus (from Eastern Europe), and C. toxostoma toxostoma (a threatened species endemic to southern France), in which bidirectional introgressive hybridization has been demonstrated. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 128 specimens from reference populations and 1495 hybrid zone specimens (two years of sampling and four stations), using five molecular markers (one mitochondrial gene, four nuclear introns), morphology (meristic and plastic characters) and life history traits (weight, size, coefficient of condition, sex, age, shoaling). We identified 65 hybrid combinations and visualized spatial and temporal changes in composition. The direction of mitochondrial introgression was density-dependent in favor of the rarer species and we demonstrate that the sexual selection hypothesis is a preponderant explanation in the asymmetry of introgression. Despite genomic evolution in the hybrid zone, convergence was observed for body shape and coefficient of condition, indicating changes in foraging behavior with respect to reference populations, reflecting strong environmental pressure. Conclusions/Significance The complex rules of hybrid zone dynamics are established very early in the contact zone. We propose “inheritance from the rare species” as a new evolutionary hypothesis for animal models. The endemic species was not assimilated by the invasive species. Survival rates for this species were highest in the middle of the river (the warmest part) due to a trade-off between food availability and fecundity. The environment-independent hybrid combination may result from nuclear-mitochondrial interactions involving the Tpi1b gene or a gene linked to this gene (Chromosome 16). This genomic region is also responsible for shoaling behavior in Danio rerio and is a promising zone for studies of changes in population dynamics and advances in integrated studies of hybrid zones."
https://openalex.org/W2059340786,"Bax and Bak are multidomain pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by direct modulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Since double-knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts with deficiency of Bax and Bak are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli, Bax and Bak are considered to be an essential gateway for various apoptotic signals. Here we showed that the combination of calcium ionophore A23187 and arachidonic acid induced cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent death of double-knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, indicating that other mechanisms of cytochrome c release exist. Furthermore, A23187/arachidonic acid (ArA)-induced caspase-dependent death was significantly suppressed by the treatment of several serine protease inhibitors including 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride and l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone but not the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins or the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition. These results indicate that there are at least two mechanisms of cytochrome c release leading to caspase activation, a Bax/Bak-dependent mechanism and a Bax/Bak-independent, but serine protease(s)-dependent, mechanism. Bax and Bak are multidomain pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by direct modulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Since double-knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts with deficiency of Bax and Bak are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli, Bax and Bak are considered to be an essential gateway for various apoptotic signals. Here we showed that the combination of calcium ionophore A23187 and arachidonic acid induced cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent death of double-knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, indicating that other mechanisms of cytochrome c release exist. Furthermore, A23187/arachidonic acid (ArA)-induced caspase-dependent death was significantly suppressed by the treatment of several serine protease inhibitors including 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride and l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone but not the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins or the inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition. These results indicate that there are at least two mechanisms of cytochrome c release leading to caspase activation, a Bax/Bak-dependent mechanism and a Bax/Bak-independent, but serine protease(s)-dependent, mechanism. Apoptosis plays a critical role in the regulation of development processes, tissue homeostasis, and elimination of damaged cells. It has been shown that the mitochondria play a crucial role in apoptosis by releasing several apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and HtrA2/Omi (1.Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2.Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R177-R179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After release into the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 to cause recruitment of caspase-9, which leads to the initiation of a caspase cascade that includes caspase-3 and results in the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Smac/Diablo and HtrA2/Omi bind directly with members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, which are endogenous caspase inhibitory proteins and thus contribute to caspase activation (1.Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2.Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R177-R179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The best characterized regulators of apoptosis are the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which directly modulate outer mitochondrial membrane permeability during apoptosis. This family of proteins can be categorized into anti-apoptotic members (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) and pro-apoptotic members, which consist of multidomain proteins (such as Bax and Bak) and BH3-only proteins (including Bid, Bim, Bik, Bad, Noxa, and Puma) (3.Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax/Bak are essential and redundant regulators of a diverse intrinsic mitochondrial cell death pathway; Bax/Bak double-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; DKO, double-knock-out; TKO, triple-knock-out; ArA, arachidonic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride; AEBSA, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide; TPCK, l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone; TLCK, l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone; WT, wild type; mPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CsA, cyclosporin A; Cyp D, cyclophilin D; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; Ac, acetyl; MCA, methylcoumarylamide.2The abbreviations used are: MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; DKO, double-knock-out; TKO, triple-knock-out; ArA, arachidonic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride; AEBSA, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide; TPCK, l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone; TLCK, l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone; WT, wild type; mPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CsA, cyclosporin A; Cyp D, cyclophilin D; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; Ac, acetyl; MCA, methylcoumarylamide. are resistant to multiple apoptotic stimuli that increase outer mitochondrial membrane permeability, including staurosporine, ultraviolet radiation, growth factor deprivation, and etoposide (4.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that double-knock-out (DKO) MEFs undergo death in a caspase-dependent manner, although at a lower rate when compared with WT MEFs, after exposure to agents such as arachidonic acid and Ca2+ ionophore (5.Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that there is a Bax/Bak-independent mechanism that regulates mitochondrial membrane permeability. In this present study, we found that the treatment of the combination of arachidonic acid and A23187 caused cytochrome c release and subsequently caspase activation succeeding the cell death in DKO MEFs. These events were inhibited by the treatment of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF), a serine protease inhibitor, but not the treatment of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) inhibitors, deletion of cyclophilin D (mPT component), and overexpression Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Antibodies and Chemicals−The following antibodies were used. Numbers in parentheses indicate dilutions used. Anticaspase-3 (1:250) and anti-caspase-9 (1:1000) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and MBL (Nagoya, Japan), respectively. Anti-lamin B1 (1:1000) and anti-GAPDH (1:1000) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and BD Biosciences, respectively. Anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies for Western blotting (clone 7H8.2C12, 1:1000) and immunostaining (clone 6H2.B4, 1:500) were purchased from Pharmingen. A23187 and arachidonic acid were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. AEBSF,l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone (TPCK), and l-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK) were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Penzberg, Germany). 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide (AEBSA) were purchased from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and other chemicals were purchased from Wako Co. (Osaka, Japan). Cell Culture and DNA Transfection−SV40 T antigen-immortalized WT MEFs, Bax/Bak DKO MEFs (kindly provided by Dr. S. J. Korsmeyer), and Bax/Bak/CypD TKO MEFs were grown in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Apaf-1-deficient MEFs and control MEFs were kindly provided by Dr. X. Wang and were also grown in the same medium. DNAs encoding human Bax and human Bcl-xL were used in the pUC-CAGGS expression vector. Cells (1 × 106) were transfected with plasmid DNA using the Amaxa electroporation system according to the supplier’s protocol (kit V, program U-20). The transfection efficiency was more than 75% as assessed by co-transfection with DNA expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP). All of the siRNAs were produced by Dharmacon Research. The sequences used were as follows (numbers in parentheses indicate nucleotide positions within the respective open reading frames): mouse cytochrome c siRNA, 5′-GGGAGAAAGGGCAGACCUA-3′ (267-285); mouse HtrA2/Omi siRNA, 5′-GGGGAGUUUGUUGUUGCCA-3′ (760-778); and GFP siRNA, 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCA-3′ (274-292). Mouse caspase-9 siRNA SMARTpool™ was also purchased from Dharmacon Research. Cells (1 × 106) were transfected twice on alternate days with 10 μg of siRNA using the Amaxa electroporation system. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection with siRNA, cells were used for experiments. Cell Viability and DEVDase Activity Assay−Cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded into 6-well dishes. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10 μm A23187/100 μm arachidonic acid or 10 μm etoposide in the presence or absence of 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk or 100 μg/ml AEBSF. Cells were harvested and stained with 1 μm propidium iodide, 1 μm Cy3-conjugated annexin V, or 1 μm Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature and were analyzed with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, FACS Caliber) or under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX50). For DEVDase assay, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA. After the addition of Triton-X to 0.1%, cells were incubated for 30 min at on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min, and cleared lysates containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 100 μm enzyme substrate Ac-DEVD-MCA at 37 °C for 1 h. Levels of released 7-amino-4-methlycoumarin were measured using a spectrofluorometer (Hitachi F-3000) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Preparation of the Cytosolic Fraction and Total Cell Lysate−For the detection of released cytochrome c, the cytosolic fraction was collected from MEFs after incubation with 0.1 mg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 37 °C in isotonic buffer (20 mm potassium-Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm Na2+-EDTA). After centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min, aliquots of the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and the pellet (mitochondrial fraction) were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-cytochrome c antibody. In some experiments, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate (sodium salt), and 150 mm NaCl). Immunofluorescence Staining−Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation with 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with anti-cytochrome c for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000) for 1 h. Then fluorescence was detected under a confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510). Microinjection−DKO MEFs (1.5 × 104) were plated on 35-mm dishes 1 day before use. PBS or PBS containing 400 μm AEBSF, 400 μm AEBSA, 100 μm DFP, 100 μm TLCK, or 200 μm TPCK was microinjected through a glass capillary into the cytoplasm with a Narishige micromanipulator. For identification of injected cells, samples were mixed with green fluorescent protein. Cells were then treated with A23187/ArA at 1 h. Cell morphology was examined 20 h after A23187/ArA treatment under a fluorescence microscope. We added various apoptotic reagents to Bax/Bak DKO MEFs, Apaf-1-/- MEFs, and their control MEFs, all of which were immortalized, and then measured DEVDase activity. In both DKO MEFs (Fig. 1A) and Apaf-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 1B), activation of DEVDase was not observed after exposure to etoposide that induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, whereas in the control MEFs, activation of DEVDase was readily observed, confirming previous observations that Bax/Bak is essential for such apoptosis (4.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Time-dependent decrease of DEVDase activities was due to disruption of plasma membrane. Similar results were also obtained when these cells were treated with staurosporine, UV, and X-rays (data not shown). In contrast, when the cells were treated with A23187 plus ArA, activation of DEVDase was observed in DKO MEFs but not in Apaf-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 1, C and D). It has previously been reported that ionomycin (another Ca2+ ionophore) plus ArA could induce DEVDase activation in DKO MEFs (5.Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Consistent with the elevation of caspase activation, A23187/ArA treatment induced cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and lamin B1 in WT and DKO MEFs but not in Apaf-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, A23187/ArA induced the death of DKO MEFs, as assessed by staining with annexin V (Fig. 1G) and propidium iodide (data not shown), whereas such cell death was not completely inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor (Fig. 1G and data not shown), indicating that A23187/ArA induced both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent death of DKO MEFs. It is known that not a few reagents induce both apoptosis and necrosis, such as oxidative stress (7.Pompeia C. Lima T. Curi R. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2003; 21: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ overload (8.Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). Staining with Hoechst 33342 revealed that A23187/ArA induced nuclear pyknosis, which was partially inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1H). A23187/ArA-induced caspase activation and death of DKO MEFs were slightly delayed when compared with these processes in WT MEFs (Fig. 1, C and G). Primary cultures of DKO MEFs tended to mainly undergo caspase-independent death (data not shown). These results indicated that A23187/ArA induced caspase-dependent death of immortalized MEFs in both a Bax/Bak-dependent and a Bax/Bak-independent manner. To examine whether mitochondria were involved in the A23187/ArA-induced caspase-dependent death of DKO MEFs, we used gene silencing with siRNA to down-regulate caspase-9 and cytochrome c. Caspase-9 is activated by forming a complex called the apoptosome with Apaf-1 and cytochrome c in the presence of (d)ATP (9.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of caspase-9 leads to activation of caspase-3 (9.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Endogenous caspase-9 and cytochrome c were silenced in DKO MEFs by the respective siRNAs (Fig. 2, A and C). Silencing of caspase-9 and cytochrome c in DKO MEFs markedly reduced A23187/ArA-induced death, as assessed by annexin V staining, but did not completely abolish it (Fig. 2, B and D). Although silencing of caspase-9 only partially inhibited the activation of DEVDase (Fig. 2B), probably due to incomplete silencing (Fig. 2A), silencing of cytochrome c inhibited more strongly the activation of DEVDase (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that A23187/ArA-induced caspase activation required the presence of Apaf-1/cytochrome c. Incomplete inhibition of cell death after silencing of cytochrome c was mainly due to the simultaneous occurrence of caspase-independent death because the addition of Z-VAD-fmk did not further reduce A23187/ArA-induced death, as shown in Fig. 2D.To avoid the influence of mitochondrial respiration in the experiment with silencing of cytochrome c, we also performed the experiment in the presence of antimycin A (an inhibitor of respiration) and, although antimycin A enhanced cell death, virtually identical results were obtained (Fig. 2E). These results indicated that A23187/ArA-induced caspase-dependent death required the presence of Apaf-1/caspase-9/cytochrome c but not Bax/Bak. We next examined whether cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria in A23187/ArA-treated DKO MEFs. Subcellular fractionation revealed that etoposide induced cytochrome c release in WT MEFs but not DKO MEFs (data not shown), whereas A23187/ArA caused cytochrome c release from both WT and DKO MEFs in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this result, cytochrome c localization was altered in A23187/ArA-treated DKO MEFs, but not etoposide-treated DKO MEFs, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). All these findings indicated that A23187/ArA induced cytochrome c release in a Bax/Bak-independent manner and subsequently activated caspases to induce cell death. How was cytochrome c released from the mitochondria in a Bax/Bak-independent manner after treatment with A23187/ArA? First, we examined whether Bcl-xL could inhibit this Bax/Bak-independent process of cytochrome c release. As shown in Fig. 4A, a pan-caspase inhibitor, but not overexpression of Bcl-xL, inhibited A23187/ArA-induced death of DKO MEFs. Consistent with this result, activation of both caspases and cytochrome c release was not influenced by Bcl-xL (Fig. 4, B and C). As expected, the expression of Bcl-xL markedly inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis in Bax-transfected DKO MEFs (Fig. 4D). ArA and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 are thought to induce the mPT (8.Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar, 10.Petronilli V. Penzo D. Scorrano L. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12035-12040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which is a Ca2+-dependent, cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability that allows various solutes to equilibrate across the membranes (12.Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Since the CsA-sensitive mPT has been suggested to have a role in apoptotic cytochrome c release, we investigated whether it was also involved in A23187/ArA-induced Bax/Bak-independent cytochrome c release and cell death. Accordingly, CsA, bongkrekic acid, and l-carnitine, all of which are known to inhibit the mPT (12.Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 13.Di Lisa F. Bobyleva-Guarriero V. Jocelyn P. Toninello A. Siliprandi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), were added to cultures of A23187/ArA-treated DKO MEFs. As shown in Fig. 4E, none of these reagents inhibited A23187/ArA-induced death, whereas Z-VAD-fmk caused significant inhibition, suggesting that the mPT was not involved in this mode of cell death. To confirm this possibility, we employed mice lacking cyclophilin D (Cyp D), in which the CsA-sensitive mPT is completely blocked (14.Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Watanabe T. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Yamagata H. Inohara H. Kubo T. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 2005; 434: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Cross-breeding produced Bax-/-Bak-/-Cyp D-/- (TKO) mice, from which immortalized MEFs were obtained. As shown in Fig. 4F, A23187/ArA equally induced the death of TKO and DKO MEFs, with cell death being partially inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk. Consistent with these findings, cytochrome c release was also observed in A23187/ArA-treated TKO MEFs (Fig. 4G), indicating that the CsA-sensitive mPT was not involved in Bax/Bak-independent cytochrome c release and cell death induced by A23187/ArA. To obtain some insight into the molecular mechanisms of A23187/ArA-induced cytochrome c release, we tested the effects of various drugs, such as protease inhibitors and lipase inhibitors, on A23187/ArA-treated DKO MEFs and found that AEBSF, which inhibits serine proteases through sulfonylation of the active site serine residue (15.Markwardt F. Drawert J. Walsmann P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and has been described to inhibit some forms of cell death (16.Kagaya S. Kitanaka C.

Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), could prevent A23187/ArA-induced caspase activation and cell death (Fig. 5, A-C). AEBSF inhibited A23187/ArA-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, whereas AEBSA, an inactive analog of AEBSF, did not inhibit it at any doses tested (Fig. 5D). To confirm the involvement of a serine protease(s), we examined other serine protease inhibitors, DFP, TLCK, and TPCK. The addition of DFP, TLCK, and TPCK into culture medium did not inhibit A23187/ArA-induced death (data not shown), which could be due to their membrane impermeability; therefore, we microinjected them into cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, all the serine protease inhibitors inhibited A23187/ArA-induced cell death. Since inhibitors are diluted to 2.5 × 102-103-fold in the cytoplasm (20.Matsuoka Y. Takechi S. Nakayama T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 693-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the estimated intracellular concentrations of AEBSF are calculated to 40-400 nm. AEBSF not only inhibited A23187/ArA-induced cell death but also blocked cytochrome c release (Fig. 5, F and G). These results indicated that a serine protease(s) is involved in the process of A23187/ArA-induced cell death upstream of cytochrome c release. AEBSF was a more effective inhibitor of A23187/ArA-induced cell death than Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5A), suggesting that it acted at a common step further upstream in the death-signaling pathways or that it inhibited independently both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death. We examined the influence of HtrA2/Omi, a serine protease located in the mitochondria that is known to be involved in apoptosis (21.Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 22.Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R. Cilenti L. DuBois G. Lazebnik Y. Zervos A.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, H-J, silencing of HtrA2/Omi had no effect on A23187/ArA-induced death, although it significantly reduced Fas-mediated apoptosis of DKO MEFs (data not shown). This study revealed the following findings. 1) the combination of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and arachidonic acid causes caspase-dependent cell death following cytochrome c release as well as caspase-independent death in Bax/Bak double-knock-out MEFs. 2) The Bcl-2 family of proteins and the CsA-sensitive mPT are not involved in this mode of cell death. 3) Instead, this mode of death is mediated by an unknown serine protease(s). These findings demonstrate the existence of a novel mechanism of cytochrome c release that is regulated by serine proteases but not by the Bcl-2 family. Bax/Bak-dependent and Bax/Bak-independent mechanisms seem to respond to different stimuli. After treatment with etoposide, UV, or staurosporine, cytochrome c release occurred in a Bcl-2 family-dependent manner, whereas A23187/ArA not only induced cytochrome c release in a Bcl-2 family-dependent manner but also in a Bcl-2 family-independent, serine protease(s)-dependent manner. This difference might be related to the influence of molecule(s) acting upstream of the mitochondria. Since apoptosis induced by BH3-only proteins occurs in a Bax/Bak-dependent manner (23.Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 24.Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), A23187/ArA probably activates unidentified apoptotic molecule(s) in addition to BH3-only proteins. A23187/ArA interferes with intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (5.Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), so Ca2+ itself or Ca2+-regulated proteins might be involved in the mechanism of A23187/ArA-induced cell death. If the Ca2+ ion was a major signal mediator, it seemed likely that cytochrome c release would occur via mPT. However, we excluded this possibility by employing MEFs deficient in Bax, Bak, and Cyp D (Fig. 4, F and G). This result was consistent with our findings obtained in Cyp D-/- MEFs and mice (14.Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Watanabe T. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Yamagata H. Inohara H. Kubo T. Tsujimoto Y.

Therefore, a Ca2+-regulated protein, rather than Ca2+ itself, may be the most suitable candidate as an inducer of Bax/Bak-independent cytochrome c release. We could not formally exclude the possibility that A23187/ArA-induced cytochrome c release was mediated by the CsA-insensitive mPT. Since A23187/ArA-induced death of DKO MEFs was inhibited by the treatment of serine protease inhibitors including AEBSF and TPCK, proteolytic activity of a serine protease(s) seems to be involved in this form of cell death. Although it is still to be determined how serine protease inhibitors suppressed A23187/ArA-induced death, the possibility was excluded that AEBSF inhibited A23187/ArA-induced death by blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, by using Rhod2-AM as an indicator of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. 3T. Mizuta, S. Shimizu, and Y. Tsujimoto, unpublished results. A serine protease(s) may cleave one or more unidentified substrates in the mitochondria that are involved in the regulation of death due to A23187/ArA. For example, a mitochondrial channel protein might be cleaved by a serine protease(s), resulting in conformational changes that allow cytochrome c release, but elucidation of the actual mechanism will require further investigation. A serine protease(s)-mediated, but not Bax/Bak-mediated, cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent cell death were observed in immortalized MEFs. Do other normal cells also have the potential to undergo these forms of death? It has previously been described that the brains of bax-/-bak-/- mice displayed a normal gross anatomy, regardless of the fact that neuronal progenitor cells derived from these mice are strongly resistant to apoptosis (25.Lindsten T.

In excitotoxic death of cerebellar granule cells, novel apoptotic mechanisms, which are Bax/Bak-independent, might be activated. In conclusion, we demonstrated the existence of a novel mechanism of cytochrome c release that involves a serine protease(s) but not the mPT or Bcl-2 family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2070095556,"TFIIIC in yeast and humans is required for transcription of tRNA and 5 S RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TFIIIC is composed of six subunits, five of which are conserved in humans. We report the identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of the sixth subunit of human TFIIIC, TFIIIC35, which is related to the smallest subunit of yeast TFIIIC. Human TFIIIC35 does not contain the phosphoglycerate mutase domain of its yeast counterpart, and these two proteins display only limited homology within a 34-amino acid domain. Homologs of the sixth TFIIIC subunit are also identified in other eukaryotes, and their phylogenic evolution is analyzed. Affinity-purified human TFIIIC from an epitope-tagged TFIIIC35 cell line is active in binding to and in transcription of the VA1 gene in vitro. Furthermore, TFIIIC35 specifically interacts with the human TFIIIC subunits TFIIIC63 and, to a lesser extent, TFIIIC90 in vitro. Finally, we determined a limited region in the smallest subunit of yeast TFIIIC that is sufficient for interacting with the yeast TFIIIC subunit ScTfc1 (orthologous to TFIIIC63) and found it to be adjacent to and overlap the 34-amino acid domain that is conserved from yeast to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2088075604,"The sperm protein associated with nucleus in the X chromosome (SPANX) genes cluster at Xq27 in two subfamilies, SPANX-A/D and SPANX-N. SPANX-A/D is specific for hominoids and is fairly well characterized. The SPANX-N gave rise to SPANX-A/D in the hominoid lineage approximately 7 MYA. Given the proposed role of SPANX genes in spermatogenesis, we have extended studies to SPANX-N gene evolution, variation, regulation of expression, and intra-sperm localization. By immunofluorescence analysis, SPANX-N proteins are localized in post-meiotic spermatids exclusively, like SPANX-A/D. But in contrast to SPANX-A/D, SPANX-N are found in all ejaculated spermatozoa rather than only in a subpopulation, are localized in the acrosome rather than in the nuclear envelope, and are expressed at a low level in several nongametogenic adult tissues as well as many cancers. Presence of a binding site for CTCF and its testis-specific paralogue BORIS in the SPANX promoters suggests, by analogy to MAGE-A1 and NY-ESO-1, that their activation in spermatogenesis is mediated by the programmed replacement of CTCF by BORIS. Based on the relative density of CpG, the more extended expression of SPANX-N compared to SPANX-A/D in nongametogenic tissues is likely attributed to differences in promoter methylation. Our findings suggest that the recent duplication of SPANX genes in hominoids was accompanied by different localization of SPANX-N proteins in post-meiotic sperm and additional expression in several nongonadal tissues. This suggests a corresponding functional diversification of SPANX gene families in hominoids. SPANX proteins thus provide unique targets to investigate their roles in the function of spermatozoa, selected malignancies, and for SPANX-N, in other tissues as well."

As ubiquitous as they are, their precise in vivo properties and their integration into the cellular function still remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a multilevel approach that efficiently connects in both directions molecular properties with cell physiology and use it to characterize the molecular properties of the looped DNA-lac repressor complex while functioning in vivo. The properties we uncover include the presence of two representative conformations of the complex, the stabilization of one conformation by DNA architectural proteins, and precise values of the underlying twisting elastic constants and bending free energies. Incorporation of all this molecular information into gene-regulation models reveals an unprecedented versatility of looped DNA-protein complexes at shaping the properties of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1999307515,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) plays a major role in the pathogenesis of a variety of human epithelial tumors including papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Previous reports demonstrated that HGF, acting through the Met receptor, repressed thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) expression. To study the mechanisms by which HGF down-regulated TSP-1 expression, we transiently transfected a panel of deleted human TSP-1 promoter reporter plasmids into papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. We identified a region between –1210 and –1123 bp relative to the transcription start site that is responsive to HGF treatment and harbors a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) at position –1199 (TGACGTCC). Overexpression of various members of the CRE-binding protein family identified activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) as the transcription factor responsible for HGF-induced repression of TSP-1 promoter activity. This inhibition was associated with a concomitant increase in the abundance of nuclear ATF-1 protein. Gel shift and antibody supershift studies indicated that ATF-1 was involved in DNA binding to the TSP-1-CRE site. Finally, we utilized small hairpin RNA to target ATF-1 and showed that these small interfering RNA constructs significantly inhibited ATF-1 expression at both the RNA and the protein level. ATF-1 knockdown prevented HGF-induced down-regulation of TSP-1 promoter activity and protein expression and also reduced HGF-dependent tumor cell invasion. Taken together, our results indicate that HGF-induced down-regulation of TSP-1 expression is mediated by the interaction of ATF-1 with the CRE binding site in the TSP-1 promoter and that this transcription factor plays a crucial role for tumor invasiveness in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid triggered by HGF.

We identified activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) binding to the ATF/CREB-responsive element as a negative regulator of TSP-1 expression. Functional analyses revealed that silencing of gene expression at the mRNA and protein level by small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) directed against ATF-1 reversed HGF-dependent down-regulation of TSP-1 expression and inhibited HGF-induced TPC-1 cell invasion.

Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells were made quiescent by serum starvation for at least 24 h before incubation with human recombinant HGF. Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and total cell protein was measured using bicinchoninic acid microassay from Pierce. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain, placed on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein (whole cell extract, nuclear extracts, conditioned media) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blot was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading of proteins and then probed with the indicated antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences). To ensure equal loading of proteins from nuclear extracts, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody under the same conditions as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (47Guillemot L. Levy A. Raymondjean M. Rothhut B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39394-39403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA. Protease inhibitors were introduced into each buffer. The amount of protein was determined using the BCA protein quantification kit (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a CRE consensus sequence (Promega, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′), to the sequence of the human TSP-1 CRE site (Invitrogen, 5′-GGAGCGAGGCGGCTGACGTCCCATCCCGAA-3′ (bp –1212 to –1183)), and to the sequence of the human TSP-1 CRE mutated site (Invitrogen, 5′-GCGGCTGACGGGCCATCCCGAA-3′ (bp –1204 to –1183)) were prepared by annealing sense and antisense specific sequences. Binding reactions for gel shift assays were performed as described (48Antonicelli F. Brown D. Parmentier M. Drost E.M. Hirani N. Rahman I. Donaldson K. MacNee W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L1319-L1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared by labeling 3.5 pmol of the double-stranded oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Five micrograms of each nuclear protein was diluted in 20 μl of gel retardation buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol). 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (5,000 cpm) were incubated for 20 min with nuclear extracts in the presence of the nonspecific DNA sequence poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). In competition experiments, the nuclear extract was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of the appropriate unlabeled specific and nonspecific competitor oligonucleotides. After incubation at room temperature, electrophoresis of the different samples was carried out on nondenaturating polyacrylamide gels for 3 h in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to Kodak XAR film overnight. In supershift studies, a mouse monoclonal anti-ATF-1 or a nonspecific IgG was preincubated with the crude nuclear extract for 3 h at 4°C before the addition of the labeled probe. Cell Invasion Assay—Invasion of TPC-1 cells in vitro was investigated using modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; Transwell Costar, Brumath, France). Cells were trypsinized, suspended (1 × 106 cells/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and seeded onto membranes coated with 30 μg/cm2 Matrigel (extracellular matrix gel, Sigma). Purified TSP-1 or anti-TSP-1 antibody (clone 3F355, 30 μg/ml) were added to the upper chamber of the Transwell units. Complete medium containing HGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the lower compartment of the chamber. After 24 h at 37 °C, cells on the upper membrane surface were removed by careful wiping with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed by treatment with methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution for 15 min. Invasive cells adhering to the undersurface of the filter were then counted (five high power fields/chamber) using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse). Identification of Binding Sites That Mediate Down-regulation of the Human TSP-1 Promoter by HGF—HGF-induced down-regulation of TSP-1 expression has been reported in various cells including thyroid papillary carcinoma (13Zhang Y.W. Su Y. Volpert O.V. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12718-12723Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Scarpino S. Di Napoli A. Taraboletti G. Cancrini A. Ruco L.P. J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We performed RT-PCR analysis on total cellular RNA from HGF (50 ng/ml)-treated TPC-1 cells using specific primers for TSP-1 and S26. As shown in Fig. 1A, the PCR products of TSP-1 and S26 were amplified to the appropriate sizes of 604 and 250 bp, respectively, and HGF incubation induced a down-regulation in TSP-1 mRNA level. To determine the relationship of TSP-1 protein expression to TSP-1 mRNA expression after HGF stimulation, Western blot analysis was performed in culture supernatants (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrated that HGF caused a reduction in TSP-1 production at the protein level. To determine whether HGF was capable of down-regulating TSP-1 promoter activity, we transiently transfected TPC-1 cells with the –1290/+750-bp human TSP-1 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene. HGF treatment resulted in a repression of TSP-1 promoter activity in a dose- (Fig. 1C) and time-dependent (Fig. 1D) manner. The location of potential binding sites for transcription factors in the human TSP-1 promoter has been published (41Hennessy S.W. Frazier B.A. Kim D.D. Deckwerth T.L. Baumgartel D.M. Rotwein P. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Framson P. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4989-4996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is shown in Fig. 1E. To identify sequences that mediate down-regulation of TSP-1 promoter activity by HGF, functional analysis was carried out using a series of luciferase reporter gene plasmids containing various lengths of the human TSP-1 5′-flanking sequences into TPC-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1F, HGF decreased luciferase activity in the –1290/+750 and –1210/+750 plasmid constructs, respectively. When the sequence between nucleotides –1210/+750 and –1123/+750 was deleted, the inhibitory effect of HGF was lost, indicating that the region between nucleotides –1210/+750 to –1123/+750 contains a negative regulatory element required for transcriptional inactivation of TSP-1. A potential CRE binding site (TGACGTCC) for ATF/CREB transcription factors is located within this sequence. Fig. 1, E and F, also showed that further deletion of the TSP-1 promoter between nucleotides –1123/+750 and –767/+750 resulted in a supplementary increase in luciferase activity. This region harbors a putative E-box motif (CAGATG) able to bind USF proteins that might also participate in the negative regulation by HGF. ATF-1 Transcription Factor Is Involved in the Down-regulation of TSP-1 Expression by HGF—A number of transcription factors specifically bind to the CRE sequence as homo- and heterodimers via a carboxyl-terminal basic domain leucine zipper (bZip) motif (49Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar). To identify the proteins that could be involved in the regulation of TSP-1 promoter, TPC-1 cells were co-transfected with different plasmids encoding various members of the ATF/CREB family such as CREB, CREM isoforms, ATF-1, and ICER. Fig. 2A showed that only ATF-1 overexpression was able to inhibit basal TSP-1 promoter activity as well as to enhance the inhibitory effect elicited by HGF, and the observed effect was dose-dependent (data not shown). Expression of all the other members stimulated TSP-1 promoter activity. To test whether ATF-1 phosphorylation is required for HGF repression of the TSP-1 promoter, we used a dominant negative ATF-1 phosphorylation site mutant (S63A). Transfection with this construct had no effect on HGF-induced inhibition of the TSP-1 promoter reporter gene (data not shown). We than tested whether HGF had an effect on the abundance of ATF-1 protein. Western blot analysis with nuclear extracts from TPC-1 cells showed that HGF treatment caused accumulation of the ATF-1 transcription factor in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that ATF-1 plays a major role in HGF-mediated down-regulation of TSP-1 promoter activity in TPC-1 cells. Our results corroborate with earlier studies that demonstrated the involvement of ATF-1 in the regulation of TSP-1 in nickel-transformed cells (37Salnikow K. Wang S. Costa M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5060-5066PubMed Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 Do Not Participate in HGF-induced Down-regulation of TSP-1 Expression—USF1 and USF2, originally identified as activators of the adenovirus major late promoter (50Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), are ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factors (51Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). They recognize and bind to DNA with an E-box motif as either homodimers or heterodimers. USF1 and USF2 regulate the expression of several genes (52Heckert L.L. Sawadogo M. Daggett M.A. Chen J.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1836-1848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kennedy H.J. Viollet B. Rafiq I. Kahn A. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) including smooth muscle cell-expressed genes (54Johnson A.D. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1420-C1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Wang et al. (38Wang S. Skorczewski J. Feng X. Mei L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34311-34322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that repression of glucose-induced TSP-1 gene expression by cGMP protein kinase involved down-regulation of USF2 protein levels, resulting in a decrease in USF2 binding to a single region (–932 to –915) in the human TSP-1 promoter. To check whether or not USF proteins are involved in the negative regulation of TSP-1 promoter by HGF, co-transfection assays were performed with either the –1290/+750-bp or the –1123/+750-bp human TSP-1-LUC promoters and plasmids encoding USF1, USF2, or the dominant negative ΔbTDU1 and ΔbTDU2 constructs. Results from Fig. 3, A and B, showed that both USF1 and USF2 stimulated basal and HGF-dependent TSP-1 promoter activity, whereas the dominant negative forms were either without effect (Fig. 3A) or inhibitory (Fig. 3B) when compared with control pCR3 plasmid. To prove the specificity of the USF plasmids, co-transfection experiments were also performed with a positive control construct that carries three copies of the L4 E-box ligated to the –96/+54 proximal bp of the L-type pyruvate kinase promoter. Fig. 3C showed that USF1 and USF2 can act as transactivators of the (L4)3-96PK-LUC promoter, whereas both USF1 and USF2 mutants repressed transcription. We then tested whether HGF had an effect on the amount of USF proteins. Western blot analysis with nuclear extracts from TPC-1 cells showed that HGF treatment had no impact on the amount of USF2 transcription factor level when compared with β-actin (Fig. 3D). Identical results were obtained when USF1 protein was analyzed (data not shown). In conclusion to our experimental data, we can rule out the possibility that USF1 and/or USF2 are involved in HGF-dependent repression of TSP-1 gene expression. Identification of ATF-1 Binding to the CRE—To determine whether the transcription factor ATF-1 was able to bind specifically to the CRE motif, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes encoding the CRE consensus, TSP-1-CRE, or TSP-1-CREmut (TSP-1 · CRE mutated) sequence and nuclear extracts prepared from control and HGF-stimulated TPC-1 cells. Results from Fig. 4A indicate that incubation of nuclear extracts from HGF-treated cells with the CRE consensus probe resulted in an increase in a DNA-protein complex (lane 2) when compared with control (lane 1, arrow). The complex was competed away by an excess of unlabeled CRE consensus oligonucleotide (lane 3) but not by excess of a nonspecific sequence (lane 4). A similar increase in DNA-protein complex was also observed when the TSP-1-CRE oligonucleotide was used as a probe (compare lanes 5 and 6, arrow). In contrast, when an oligonucleotide containing a mutated TSP-1-CRE site was used as a probe, the specific DNA-protein complex disappeared (lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that in TPC-1 cells, one complex corresponds to a transcription factor that specifically binds to the CRE within the TSP-1 promoter. To identify whether ATF-1 is the transcription factor that binds the promoter, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts from HGF-stimulated cells, using either CRE consensus or TSP-1-CRE-labeled oligonucleotide probes and an antibody against human ATF-1, which does not cross-react with other members of the ATF/CREB family. Two supershifts were observed with the anti-ATF-1 antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 2, asterisks) but not with an irrelevant antibody (lane 3). Similar results were also obtained with the TSP-1-CRE probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6), although the migration of the lower supershifted band differed (lanes 2 and 5, compare the asterisks). These data clearly identify ATF-1 as the binding protein for the TSP-1-CRE site in TPC-1 cells. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that heterodimerization occurs with other members of the ATF-CREB family as it has been described by others (55Ellis M.J. Lindon A.C. Flint K.J. Jones N.C. Goodbourn S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 255-265PubMed Google Scholar). This can be emphasized by the fact that two bands are supershifted with a specific antibody (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 5). One plausible explanation could be that ATF-1 may be bound to DNA as a homodimer or a complex with additional proteins in the extract and, owing to a difference in size or charge, each band is supershifted to a different position. Silencing of the ATF-1 Gene by shRNA Significantly Reduced HGF-induced Down-regulation of TSP-1—To further confirm the involvement of ATF-1 during HGF-induced TSP-1 down-regulation, a shRNA plasmid targeted at the human ATF-1 mRNA sequence was used in this study. Luciferase reporter assays using the shRNA construct and the –1290/+750 TSP-1-LUC reporter plasmid were performed. As shown in Fig. 5A, gene silencing of ATF-1 prevented HGF-induced inhibition of TSP-1 promoter activity when compared with control (shCTL) vector. In addition, shATF-1 down-regulated ATF-1 expression at the mRNA (Fig. 5B) and protein level (Fig. 5C). This effect was correlated with the up-regulation of TSP-1 protein expression/secretion independently of HGF treatment. These findings clearly indicate that ATF-1 is an essential transcription factor that regulates TSP-1 expression. ATF-1-dependent TSP-1 Down-regulation Promotes Tumor Cell Invasion—The effect of HGF on in vitro Matrigel invasion of TPC-1 cells was examined. As shown in Fig. 6A, HGF stimulated Matrigel invasion of TPC-1 cells. To confirm the involvement of TSP-1 in HGF-mediated promotion of tumor invasion, cells were allowed to invade into the Matrigel matrix in the presence or absence of TSP-1 protein. Incubation of cells with TSP-1 protein reduced basal as well as HGF-stimulated Matrigel cell invasion. To further determine the involvement of TSP-1 in TPC-1 cell invasion, we performed assays in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against TSP-1. Anti-TSP-1 antibody was able to significantly enhance basal TPC-1 cell invasion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HGF-induced cell invasion is mediated at least in part by the regulation of TSP-1 expression. To address the involvement of ATF-1, invasion assays were performed using control and ATF-1 shRNA-expressing cells. Fig. 6B showed that knockdown of ATF-1 inhibited HGF-induced TPC-1 cell invasion. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ATF-1 transcription factor is a major intermediary in the signaling pathway that is responsible for HGF-induced TSP-1 down-regulation, leading to thyroid tumor cell invasion. As reported previously, disruption of ATF-1 activity in human metastatic melanoma cells by using an inhibitory anti-ATF-1 antibody fragment suppressed their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice (56Jean D. Tellez C. Huang S. Davis D.W. Bruns C.J. McConkey D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2721-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore ATF-1 may represent a target of choice to develop novel strategies for thyroid cancer therapy. We are grateful to Dr. James A.

To achieve these properties, we combined two high-performance matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass analyzers in one modular mass spectrometric tool, and applied this tool for dissecting the composition and post-translational modifications of protein complexes. As an example of this approach, we here present studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae anaphase-promoting complexes (APC) and elucidation of phosphorylation sites on its components. In general, the modular concept we describe could be useful for assembling mass spectrometers operating with both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) ion sources into powerful mass spectrometric tools for the comprehensive analysis of complex biological samples."

Here we provide evidence suggesting that both Cdk2/E and phosphorylation of Thr187 on p27 are essential for the recognition of p27 by the SCFSkp2/Cks1 complex, the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3).

At the G1/S transition, phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187 leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, resulting in the activation of Cdk2/E or Cdk2/A and commitment of the cell to the S phase (4Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R431-R435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p27 in certain cancer cells prevents DNA replication and tumor formation in nude mice (5Chen J. Willingham T. Shuford M. Bruce D. Rushing E. Smith Y. Nisen P.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1395-1403PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the loss of p27 has been reported in many human cancers and predicts a poor prognosis in breast, prostate, colon, gastric, lung, and esophageal cancers (6Tsihlias J. Kapusta L. Slingerland J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Increased degradation of p27 is likely to be one of the mechanisms leading to abnormally low levels of the p27 protein in cancer cells. In several types of cancers, there is a strong correlation between the loss of p27 and induction of Skp2, a subunit of the SCFSkp2/Cks1 (Skp1, Cul1, Roc1, Skp2, Cks1 complex) ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets p27 for ubiquitination and degradation (7Masuda T.A.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), forming a thiol ester bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group and an active cysteine on E2. An ubiquitin E3 ligase binds to both the substrate and E2 and facilitates the transfer of the ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate. Ubiquitin is attached to the substrate through an isopeptide bond formed between Gly76 of ubiquitin and the ϵ-amino group of a substrate lysine residue. Polyubiquitin chains are formed via isopeptide bonds between the carboxyl group of Gly76 on one ubiquitin molecule and the ϵ-amino group of Lys48 (or less frequently, Lys63) on another ubiquitin molecule. The substrate specificity of ubiquitination is mainly provided by different E3 ligases. Substrate recognition by E3 is often the rate-limiting step for protein degradation in cells (8Nalepa G.

Cul1 serves as a scaffold connecting the catalytic core with the substrate-binding site. It is an elongated protein with a stalk at its N terminus and a globular domain at its C terminus (14Zheng N.

The RING finger protein Roc1 binds the C-terminal globular domain of Cul1, forming a catalytic core that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2. Skp1 binds to the N terminus of Cul1. Skp2 is connected to Cul1 by the interaction between an F box on Skp2 and an F-box recognition site on Skp1. The ten C-terminal leucine-rich repeats of Skp2 form a curved blade with a concave surface lined with β strands. A 39-amino acid tail C-terminal to the leucine-rich repeats packs into the concave surface and serves as a platform for binding Cks1 (16Hao B. Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Wu G. Miller J.J. Pagano M.

Although the phosphate-binding site on Cks1 binds directly to phosphorylated Thr187 on p27, the Skp2/Cks1 interface provides another binding site for Glu185 on p27. Skp2 greatly enhances the affinity between Cks1 and a C-terminal p27 phospho-peptide (21Seeliger M.A. Breward S.E. Friedler A. Schon O. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that interaction of Glu185 with Skp2/Cks1 is also essential for substrate recognition by the SCFSkp2/Cks1 ubiquitin ligase.In addition to phosphorylation on Thr187, p27 must be in complex with Cdk2/E to be efficiently ubiquitinated by SCFSkp2/Cks1 (22Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Cdk2/E or Cdk2/A plays a noncatalytic role in the ubiquitination of p27 by SCFSkp2/Cks1 (23Ungermannova D. Gao Y. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30301-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Zhu X.H. Nguyen H. Halicka H.D. Traganos F. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6058-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro reconstituted p27 ubiquitination system with purified protein components, we found that a phospho-p27 peptide containing phosphorylated Thr187 can block p27 ubiquitination; however, the affinity of the phospho-p27 peptide is 1000-fold less than that of the phosphorylated p27 in complex with Cdk2/E. We developed an HTR-FRET assay to quantitatively measure the interaction between phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E and the SCFSkp2/Cks1 complex. We found that phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E binds to the Skp2/Cks1 complex in a cooperative manner with a Kd of 44 nm. Both the phospho-p27 peptide and Cdk2/E can compete for Skp2/Cks1 binding to phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E with different affinities. We also found that Cdk2/E phosphorylates Skp2 in a Cks1-dependent manner in vitro. This phosphorylation increases auto-ubiquitination of Skp2, which is inhibited by p27.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit anti-phospho-p27 (71–7700) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

IRDye-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). Ubiquitin was from Sigma. EZlink™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was from Pierce. 2× SDS loading buffer for protein PAGE was purchased from Invitrogen. The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a p27 C-terminal peptide surrounding underlined Thr187 (Bio-6-aminohexanoic acid-AGGVEQTPKKPGLRRRQT-CONH2) were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA). GST-ubiquitin was purchase from Boston Biochem (Boston, MA). EZView red anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads were purchased from Sigma.Preparation of Protein Components—His-E1 and His-UbcH3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on Ni2+ chelate resin. The SCFSkp2 complex was affinity purified via glutathione-agarose chromatography from Sf9 cells co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST-Skp2, His-Skp1, His-Cul1, and Roc1. The baculoviruses for GST-Skp2, His-Skp1, his-Cul1, and Roc1 were kindly provided by Dr. Michele Pagano (New York University School of Medicine). p27/Cdk2/E, FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E, FLAG-p27 T187A/Cdk2/E, and Cdk2/E complexes were purified via Ni2+ chelate chromatography from Sf9 cells co-infected with baculoviruses expressing human p27 (with or without a N-terminal FLAG tag, YKDDDDKG), Cdk2, and His-tagged cyclin E. In FLAG-p27 T187A, Thr187 was mutated to alanine through site-directed mutagenesis. Human Cks1 was expressed in E. coli with an S tag (KETAAAKFERQHMDS) at the N terminus and a Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) at the C terminus and purified via S resin affinity chromatography (Novagen). Subsequently, the S tag was removed from Cks1 by cleavage with thrombin. All of the above proteins were dialyzed into Ub dialysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) and stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. Ubiquitin was labeled with biotin by incubating 100 mg of Ub (Sigma U6253) with 12.5 mg of EZ-link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in phosphate-buffered saline on ice for 2 h. The average stoichiometry of labeling was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to be 1–2 biotin group/ubiquitin molecule. The biotinylated ubiquitin was dialyzed three times against 4 liters of 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0 for 2–4 h at 4 °C and stored in small aliquots at –80 °C.Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E—Phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E (phospho-p27) was prepared by incubating 0.1 mg/ml Cdk2/E (∼1.25 μm) with 0.1 mg/ml (∼1 μm) p27/Cdk2/E or FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E at room temperature for 2 h in kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP). Aliquots were stored at –80 °C. For liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, p27/Cdk2/E or phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E were precipitated by chloroform/methanol to remove detergent. Precipitated p27 was resuspended in 5% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile and injected onto a ZQ liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system. To determine phosphorylation sites, p27 from different samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). p27 proteins were digested in-gel with trypsin as described (25Havlis J. Thomas H. Sebela M. Shevchenko A. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Tryptic digests were analyzed on an MS4 liquid chromatography system interfaced to an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) equipped with a nanotrap source (Michrom Bioresources). Tryptic peptides were first captured and desalted on a C18 trapping cartridge followed by separation on a MAGIC C18 0.1 × 150 mm nanotrap column. The peptides were eluted with a 120-min gradient from 5 to 65% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid. During acquisition, continuous data dependent MS3 scanning was performed via the following steps: 1) survey MS scan of peptide ions, 2) MS/MS peptide fragmentation scan of the top five most intense ions, and 3) an MS3 scan (MS/MS/MS) of peptides triggered by neutral loss of 49 or 33 m/z values from the peptides selected for fragmentation in step 2). Raw MS files were processed with MASCOT Distiller then submitted to an internal MASCOT server (version 2.1) for data base searching using the Human IPI data base (June 1, 2006). Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (IPI00006991) was the top protein identified. Relative phosphorylation ratios were calculated as percentages by determining the ion current intensities from extracted ion chromatograms for the ions corresponding to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides.In Vitro Phosphorylation of Skp2—The SCFSkp2 complex (1 μm) was incubated with Cdk2/E (1 μm), Cks1 (1 μm), and ATP (1 mm) in the kinase buffer described above at 30 °C for 2 h. In some experiments, 20 μm staurosporine was added to the reaction to inhibit the Cdk2/E activity.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Unless specifically indicated, p27 was ubiquitinated in a 15-μl reaction by incubating phospho-p27 (40 nm) with E1 (40 nm), E2 (5 μm), SCFSkp2 (25 nm), Cks1 (25 nm), and Bio-Ub (27.8 μm) in Ub buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm DTT and 0.5 mm ATP at room temperature for 1 h. For peptide competition experiments, p27 ubiquitination was performed in the presence of phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated p27 peptide at various concentrations. For analysis of the ubiquitination of p27 by SDS-PAGE, the assay mixture was mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer containing 200 mm DTT. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with anti-p27 or anti-Skp2 antibody. The signal on the membrane was detected and quantified by a densitometer or an Odyssey infrared imaging system from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE).Measurement of Interaction between FLAG-p27 and GST-Skp2—For interaction of FLAG-tagged p27 with Skp2 or Cks1, 20 nm of phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E, FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E, FLAG-p27 T187A/Cdk2/E, Cdk2/E, or buffer control was incubated with 20 nm of SCFSkp2 complex and 20 nm of Cks1 in the presence of 30 nm of XL665 anti-FLAG and 1 nm of LANCE Eu anti-GST or LANCE Eu anti-Myc in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm DTT at room temperature for 2–4 h. The FRET signal was measured on an Analyst HT plate reader from Molecular Devices Corp (Sunnyvale, CA) as fluorescence of Cy5 emission at 665 nm/fluorescence of Eu emission at 620 nm × 10,000 after excitation of europium at 340 nm. To determine the Kd between phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E and the SCFSkp2/Cks1 complex, increasing amounts of phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E were incubated with 20 nm SCFSkp2 and 20 nm Cks1 in the presence of 1 nm LANCE Eu Anti-Skp2 and 100 nm XL665 anti-FLAG. For competition experiments, 20 nm of phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E was incubated at room temperature for 2–4 h with 20 nm of SCFSkp2 complex and 20 nm of Cks1 in the presence of increasing amounts of phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E, phospho- or nonphospho-p27 peptide, or Cdk2/E and 1 nm LANCE Eu anti-Skp2 and 40 nm XL665 anti-FLAG. The interaction between FLAG-p27 and GST-Skp2 was measured as above.Anti-FLAG Immunoprecipitation—Phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E and unphosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E (50 ng/μl, 100 μl) were incubated either on ice or at 78 °C for 20 min (heat inactivation). The heat inactivation samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 for 5 min at room temperature in a tabletop microcentrifuge. 90 μl of the supernatant for each sample was incubated with 20 μl of EZView anti-FLAG M2 affinity agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.RESULTSReconstitution of the Ubiquitination of p27 in Vitro—An in vitro p27 ubiquitination assay was first reported by Pagano et al. (26Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) using cell extracts as a source of enzymes essential for p27 ubiquitination. Since then, all of the essential components for efficient in vitro p27 ubiquitination have been identified (17Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). All of these were recombinantly expressed and purified (Fig. 1A and Table 1). To generate a robust in vitro p27 ubiquitination assay, p27 in complex with Cdk2/E (p27/Cdk2/E) purified from Sf9 cells was used as the substrate. We found that this complex was weakly ubiquitinated (Fig. 1B, lane 2) in vitro even in the presence of Cks1. However, when extra Cdk2/E was added to the reaction, p27 ubiquitination was greatly increased (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the p27/Cdk2/E purified from Sf9 cells was not fully phosphorylated and that additional Cdk2/E was required to phosphorylate the p27/Cdk2/E. As expected, the in vitro p27 ubiquitination is dependent on the presence of Cks1 (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Essential protein components of in vitro p27 ubiquitination assayReagent nameComponentsExpression systemPurificationE1His-E1E. coli or insect cellsNi2+-NTA columnaNTA, nitrilotriacetic acid.E2His-UbcH3E. coliNi2+-NTA columnSCFSkp2 complexHis-Skp1/His-Cul1/GST-Skp2/Roc1Insect cellsGSH columnp27/Cdk2/EP27/Cdk2/His-Cyc EInsect cellsNi2+-NTA columnCdk2/ECdk2/His-Cyc EInsect cellsNi2+-NTA columnCks1S-Cks1-MycE. coliS columnBio-UbBiotinylated ubiquitina NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. Open table in a new tab p27 phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot with a phospho-Thr187-specific anti-p27 antibody (Fig. 2, lane 13). Cdk2/E increased phosphorylation on Thr187 of p27 in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylated substrate was prepared for routine ubiquitination and binding assays by incubating p27/Cdk2/E (100 ng/μl) with additional Cdk2/E (100 ng/μl) in the presence of ATP and Mg2+.FIGURE 2Phosphorylation of Thr187 on p27 by Cdk2/E. p27/Cdk2/E (100 ng/μl) was incubated with increasing amount of Cdk2/E at room temperature for 1 h. Total p27 and p27 phosphorylated on Thr187 were detected by Western blotting using anti-p27 antibody (BD PharMingen) and anti-phospho-Kip (Thr187; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) that specifically recognize phosphorylated Thr187.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mass spectrometry was used to further quantify p27 phosphorylation. Analysis of intact p27 protein as well as a peptide digestion of p27 in both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms indicated that only a small portion of p27 in p27/Cdk2/E purified from insect cells was singly phosphorylated, whereas the majority of p27 was unphosphorylated. In contrast, p27 in the phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E complex was either singly or doubly phosphorylated with the single phosphorylation species being the dominant form (data not shown). Data from peptide mapping indicated that Thr187 was ∼90% phosphorylated in phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E, whereas the corresponding peptides recovered from the digestion of unphosphorylated p27 were not phosphorylated. An additional phosphorylation site was identified at Ser106 in the phosphorylated p27 digestion, although it does not appear to be a consensus site for Cdk2 (27Stevenson-Lindert L.M. Fowler P. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50956-50960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the p27 in the complex of p27/Cdk2/E purified from Sf9 cells was unphosphorylated; upon in vitro Cdk2/E phosphorylation under our experimental conditions, it became almost completely phosphorylated on Thr187.Phosphorylation on Thr187 Is Essential but Not Sufficient for High Affinity Binding between p27/Cdk2/E and SCFSkp2/Cks1—It has been shown that phosphorylation on Thr187 of p27 is essential for p27 ubiquitination (22Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also revealed the importance of Cdk2/E or Cdk2/A for p27 ubiquitination (22Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 23Ungermannova D. Gao Y. Liu X. J. Biol.

However, none of these studies had directly compared the impact of Thr(P)187 and Cdk2/E or Cdk2/A on the substrate recognition by the SCFSkp2/Cks1 E3 ligase in a quantitative manner.An HTR-FRET assay using FLAG-tagged p27 and GST-tagged Skp2 to measure the interaction between SCFSkp2/Cks1 E3 ligase and phosphorylated p27/Cdk2/E was developed (Fig. 3A, top left panel). FLAG-tagged p27 or FLAG-tagged p27 T187A mutant were co-expressed and co-purified with Cdk2 and His-Cyc E via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and subsequently phosphorylated by Cdk2/E under the conditions described above. Phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E was incubated with the SCFSkp2/Cks1 E3 ligase in the presence of europium-labeled anti-GST and XL665-labeled anti-FLAG antibodies. Interaction of the substrate and the E3 generates a FRET signal between the Eu donor and XL665 acceptor after the excitation of Eu at 320 nm. A strong FRET signal was generated when phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E was incubated with both Cks1 and the SCFSkp2 complex (Fig. 3A, top left panel). In the absence of either Cks1 or the SCFSkp2 complex, no FRET was generated, indicating that the FRET signal specifically measures the interaction between p27 and Skp2. Unphosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E or T187A mutant did not generate significant FRET signal when incubated with Cks1 and the SCFSkp2 complex, confirming that phosphorylation on Thr187 of p27 is essential for the interaction of p27 with Skp2/Cks1 complex. The Myc tag on the C terminus of Cks1 enables the measurement of the interaction between p27 and Cks1 (Fig. 3A, top right panel) as well as the interaction between Skp2 and Cks1 (Fig. 3A, bottom panel) in the same reactions. Similar to the interaction of Skp2 and p27, the interaction of p27/Cks1 depends on the presence of the SCFSkp2 complex. On the other hand, p27/Cdk2/E or Cdk2/E has no impact on the Skp2/Cks1 interaction.FIGURE 3Phosphorylation on Thr187 is essential but not sufficient for the interaction of p27/Cdk2/E with the SCFSkp2/Cks1 complex. A, an HTR-FRET assay is used to detect interactions between FLAG-p27, GST-Skp2, and Cks1-Myc. FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E or FLAG-p27 T187A/Cdk2/E were preincubated with Cdk2/E and ATP in kinase buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures” (phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E and FLAG-p27 T187A/Cdk2/E, respectively). As controls, FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E or buffer alone were incubated with Cdk2/E under the same conditions in the absence of ATP (FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E and Cdk2/E, respectively). 20 nm of phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E, FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E, FLAG-p27 T187A/Cdk2/E, Cdk2/E, or buffer alone (–) were incubated with 20 nm of the SCFSkp2 complex and 20 nm of Cks1 in the presence of 1 nm of LANCE Eu anti-GST and 20 nm of XL665 anti-FLAG (p27/Skp2 interaction), 1 nm LANCE Eu anti-Myc and 20 nm of XL665 anti-FLAG (p27/Cks1 interaction), or 1 nm LANCE Eu anti-Myc and 20 nm Cy5 anti-GST (Skp2/Cks1 interaction) at room temperature for 2–4 h. The interactions between p27 and Skp2, p27 and Cks1, and Skp2 and Cks1 were measured as a FRET signal (10,000 × fluorescence @ 665 nm/Fluorescence @ 620 nm) generated between Eu anti-Myc and XL665 anti-FLAG, Eu anti-GST and XL665 anti-FLAG, and Eu anti-Myc and Cy5 anti-GST. B, heat inactivation of phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E abolishes p27/Skp2 interaction. Left panel, phosphorylated FLAG-p27/Cdk2/E was preincubated either on ice (without heat inactivation) or at 75 °C (heat inactivation) for 20 min. 20 nm of pretreated phosphorylated FLAG-p27 was incubated with 20 nm of the SCFSkp2 complex and 20 nm of Cks1 in the presence of 1 nm of LANCE Eu anti-GST and 20 nm of XL665 anti-FLAG in the presence or absence of 20 nm Cdk2/E at room temperature for 2–4 h. Right panel, the levels of total p27, p27 with phosphorylated Thr187, Cdk2, and Cyc E in different samples were detected by Western blot with mouse anti-p27 (BD PharMingen), rabbit anti-phospho-p27 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), mouse anti-Cdk2 (BD PharMingen), and mouse anti-Cyc E (Santa Cruz), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2127308452,"Background Most tumor-associated antigens (TAA) currently used for immunotherapy of cancer are also expressed in normal tissues, which may induce tolerance and impair T cell-mediated immunity. However, there is limited information about how physiological expression in normal tissues alters the function of TAA-specific T cells. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a T cell receptor transgenic model to study how MDM2 expression in normal tissues affects the function of T cells specific for this TAA that is found at high levels in many different types of tumors. We found that some MDM2-specific T cells escaped thymic deletion and persisted in the peripheral T cell pool. When stimulated with antigen, these T cells readily initiated cell division but failed to proliferate and expand, which was associated with a high rate of apoptosis. Both IL-2 and IL-15 efficiently rescued T cell survival and antigen-specific T cell proliferation, while IL-7 and IL-21 were ineffective. Antigen-stimulated T cells showed impaired expression of the effector molecules CD43, granzyme-B and IFN-γ, a defect that was completely restored when T cells were stimulated in the presence of IL-2. In contrast, IL-15 and IL-21 only restored the expression of CD43 and granzyme-B, but not IFN-γ production. Finally, peptide titration experiments with IL-2 rescued T cells indicated that they were of lower avidity than non-tolerant control T cells expressing the same TCR. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that cytokines can rescue the antigen-specific proliferation and effector function of MDM2-specific T cells, although this does not lead to the recovery of high avidity T cell function. This study sheds light on possible limitations of immunotherapy approaches that target widely expressed TAA, such as MDM2."
https://openalex.org/W1481505398,"The pore structural changes associated with Cys-loop receptor gating are currently the subject of considerable interest. Several functional approaches have shown that surface exposure of pore-lining side chains does not change significantly during activation. However, a disulfide trapping study on α1T6′Cβ1T6′C γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors (GABAARs), which showed that adjacent β subunits cross-link in the open state only, concluded that channel gating is mediated by β subunits contra-rotating through a summed angle of ∼120°. Such a large rotation is not easily reconciled with other evidence. The present study initially sought to investigate an observation that appeared inconsistent with the rotation model: namely that α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAARs expressed in HEK293 cells form 6′ cysteine-mediated disulfide bonds in the closed state. On the basis of electrophysiological and Western blotting experiments, we conclude that adjacent βT6′C subunits dimerise efficiently in the closed state via cross-links between their respective 6′ cysteines and that this locks the channels closed. This questions the β subunit contra-rotation model of activation and raises the question of how the closed state cross-links form. We propose that β subunit 6′ cysteines move into sufficiently close proximity for disulfide formation via relatively large amplitude random thermal motions that appear to be a unique feature of β subunits. Because dimerized channels are locked closed, we conclude either that the spontaneous β subunit movements or asymmetries in the movements of adjacent β subunits during activation are essential for pore opening.

Neurotransmitter binding initiates a conformational change at the extracellular binding sites which is propagated throughout the receptor (5Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A.

There is currently a great deal of interest in understanding how the TM2 domains move to mediate channel activation. The original model, based on electron diffraction images of two-dimensional crystal arrays of Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), concluded that the TM2 domains were kinked inwards to form a central pore constriction and that upon ligand binding they rotated about their long axes to open the pore (10Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). However, several functionally based approaches have since shown that the pattern of residue exposure in the pore does not change in a manner suggesting a significant rotation between the closed and open states (8Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P.

Nature. 2005; 438: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, any rotational movement must be small. However, cysteine trapping experiments on structurally related γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) incorporating introduced cysteines in the pore concluded that adjacent subunits experienced large contra-rotations during channel activation (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The total rotational movement, which was proposed to be around 120°, is not easily reconciled with other studies. Specifically, Horenstein et al. (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) showed that αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs recombinantly expressed in Xenopus oocytes were locked in the open state by the application of an oxidising agent. Western blots of αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs expressed in HEK293 cells revealed that βT6′C subunits were cross-linked in the open state but not in the closed state. The authors concluded that adjacent βT6′C subunits underwent a contrarotation from the closed to the open states so that their T6′C side chains moved into close enough proximity to permit disulfide bond formation without blocking current flow. In apparent contrast, an electrophysiological analysis of the effects of oxidizing and reducing agents on the same GABAAR subunits recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells suggested that 6′ cysteines efficiently formed disulfide bonds in the closed state and in the desensitized state (13Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44845-44853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that the functional properties of identical αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs vary dramatically between the Xenopus oocyte and the HEK293 cell expression systems. We initially postulated that the HEK293 cell electrophysiology results could be reconciled with the HEK293 cell biochemical cross-linking experiments if closed state disulfide bond formation involves intrasubunit, rather than intersubunit, cross-inks. The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular basis of closed state disulfide bond formation in HEK293-expressed αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs. This may provide new insights into closed state structure, side chain orientation, and side chain mobility in this critical region of the pore. Mutagenesis of GABAAR cDNAs—The rat GABAAR α1 and γ2 subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector and the rat β1 subunit cDNA was subcloned into the pIRES2-EGFP plasmid vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of these cDNAs was performed using the QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol to introduce single codon mutations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Using the same technique, insertions encoding FLAG (DYKDDDDK) and myc (EQKLISEEDL) epitopes were incorporated at amino acid position 4 of the mature α1 and β1 subunit coding sequences, respectively. The successful incorporation of all mutations was confirmed by automated sequencing of the complete coding sequence. Western Blotting—HEK293 cells were transfected with the appropriate cDNAs using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The α and β subunit cDNAs were transfected in a 1:1 ratio. However, to generate γ subunit-containing GABAARs, the α, β, and γ subunit cDNAs were transfected in a 1:1:3 ratio. At around 72 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with a solution containing 100 μm copper sulfate and 400 μm phenanthroline (100:400 μm Cu:phen) in the presence or absence of 100 μm GABA. After 30-min incubation with gentle rocking at room temperature, the cells were again washed twice with PBS. They were then treated for 30 min with either PBS only or PBS plus 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). After a final wash with PBS, 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer at 4 °C was added to the dishes, and cells were harvested with a rubber policeman. The homogenization buffer contained: 320 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH adjusted to 7.4 at 4 °C), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitors EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). After harvesting, the cells were homogenized on ice using a Dounce homogenizer (50 stokes) followed by several passages through a hypodermic syringe fitted with a 30-gauge needle. The resultant homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g (4 °C) to precipitate out nuclei and unbroken cells. This centrifugation procedure was repeated and the supernatant was separated from the pellet. The supernatant was next centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The small resultant pellet contained the crude membrane fraction. Enrichment of solubilized receptor in this fraction was confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). A 40-μl volume of solubilization buffer was added to this pellet, and the resulting suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to extract integral membrane proteins. The solubilization buffer contained: 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH adjusted to 7.4 at 4 °C), 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Complete Mini Protease Inhibitors EDTA-free, adjusted to pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Then 40 μl of 2 × SDS loading buffer (no bromphenol blue/no DTT) containing 10 m urea was added, and the sample was heated at 65 °C for 20 min and stored at –20 °C. Sample concentrations were analyzed from 10-μl aliquots using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). The remaining sample was diluted to 100 μl total volume to yield final concentrations of 5 m urea, 2% SDS, bromphenol blue and, where appropriate, 10 mm DTT. The samples were again heated at 65 °C for 15 min immediately prior to SDS-PAGE separation. Then 100 μg of total protein from each sample was loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out for 1 h using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 3 Cell. Protein bands were subsequently transferred to PVDF membrane by electrotransfer for 1 h using a Bio-RaD mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell. PVDF membranes were blocked for 1 h with 3.5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and processed with either anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or anti-myc polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) and subsequently with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. PVDF membranes were developed using Super Signal West Pico (Pierce). An Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biotech, Lincoln, NE) was used for direct quantitation of Western blots. For this assay, the Western blots were developed essentially as described previously but with the following exceptions. The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (BioTrace NT; Pall Corp.), and the membrane was subsequently blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer. All antibodies were diluted into Odyssey Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 for use in the incubation step. IRDye 880 CW-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and IRDye 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse were used as secondary antibodies. The two epitopes were simultaneously observed using two-color detection, and images of the membrane were analyzed using Odyssey software. Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transfected with wild type (WT) or mutant α, β and γ subunit cDNAs using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. When co-transfecting α and β subunits, their respective cDNAs were combined in a ratio of 1:1, although α, β and γ subunits were transfected in a ratio of 1:1:3. After exposure to transfection solution for 24 h, cells were washed twice using the culture medium and used for recording over the following 24–72 h. The cells were observed using an inverted fluorescent microscope and currents were measured using the whole cell patch clamp configuration. Cells were perfused by a control solution that contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate hematocrit tubing (Vitrex, Modulohm, Denmark) and heat-polished. Pipettes had a tip resistance of ∼1.5 MΩ when filled with the standard pipette solution which contained (in mm): 145 CsCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. After establishment of the whole cell configuration, cells were voltage-clamped at –40 mV, and membrane currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier and pCLAMP9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The cells were perfused by a parallel array of microtubular barrels through which solutions were gravity-induced. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (19–22 °C). Data Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean of three or more independent experiments. The Hill equation, fitted using a non-linear least squares algorithm (Sigmaplot 9.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA), was used to calculate the saturating current magnitude (Imax), half-maximal concentration (EC50) and Hill coefficient (nH) values for GABA activation. Statistical significance was determined by paired or unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate, with p < 0.05 representing significance. All Western blots are representative of at least three independent experiments. Electrophysiological Properties of αβ GABAARs—Sample GABA dose-response relationships for the WT and mutant GABAAR subunit combinations investigated in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. The averaged dose-response curves are presented in Fig. 1B, with mean parameters of best fit displayed in Table 1. There was no evidence for tonic activity in any of the mutant GABAARs investigated. There was no systematic variation in resting whole-cell resistance in cells expressing any of these receptors, and 10 μm picrotoxin had no significant effect on base-line currents in cells expressing robust GABA-activated currents (n = 5 cells expressing each subunit combination). In all electrophysiological and biochemical experiments undertaken in the present study, GABAARs were activated by a 100 μm concentration of GABA, which was saturating at all receptors.TABLE 1GABA activation properties of GABAARs investigated in this studyGABAARGABA EC50nHImaxμmnAαWTβWT3.8 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.28.4 ± 1.7αT6′CβT6′C10.4 ± 2.31.0 ± 0.25.4 ± 1.9αT6′CβWT2.8 ± 0.60.8 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.4αWTβT6′C0.7 ± 0.30.6 ± 0.16.1 ± 2.7αT6′C,C233S,C292SβWT3.7 ± 0.51.4 ± 0.25.8 ± 1.6αT6′C,C233S,C292SβT6′C5.3 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.4αWTβWTγWT11.6 ± 1.61.5 ± 0.210.1 ± 1.9αWTβT6′CγWT6.3 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.113.4 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab It is also apparent in Fig. 1A that GABAARs incorporating T6′C mutations exhibit an increased desensitization rate. The mean time constants of desensitization in the presence of 100 μm GABA for the three relevant receptors were as follows: αT6′CβT6′C, 133 ± 9 ms; αWTβT6′C, 107 ± 12 ms; αT6′CβWT, 421 ± 33 ms (all averaged from five cells). Such rapid desensitization means that it is difficult to apply oxidizing or reducing reagents selectively to the open state in either biochemical or electrophysiological experiments. As shown previously (13Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44845-44853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the αWTβWT GABAAR sustains a constant current magnitude when stimulated repeatedly with saturating GABA pulses. Although 100:400 μm Cu:phen applied in the closed or open states had no effect on current magnitude, a 2-min application of 10 mm DTT in the closed state caused a weak transient potentiation that is most likely a pharmacological action (13Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44845-44853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, the αT6′CβT6′C GABAAR exhibited a spontaneous decline in current magnitude over time that was accelerated by the application of Cu:phen (Fig. 2A). In all experiments described in Fig. 2, the displayed recordings commenced directly following a 1-min application of 10 mm DTT. This reduction in current magnitude did not reverse spontaneously but was completely reversed by a 1 min application of DTT (Fig. 2, A and B). We thus conclude that T6′C residues participate in disulfide bonds that lock the channel closed. To isolate the subunit involved in this cross-linking, we investigated the effects of Cu:phen and DTT on the αWTβT6′C and αT6′CβWT GABAARs. As shown in the sample traces in Fig. 2A and summarized in Fig. 2B, the effect of Cu:phen and DTT on current magnitude in the αWTβT6′C GABAAR was not significantly different to that observed in the αT6′CβT6′C GABAAR. This strongly suggests that β subunit 6′ cysteines are major contributors to disulfide bond formation in the closed state. The magnitude of the Cu:phen-induced inhibition of αT6′CβWT GABAARs was substantially diminished, although it remained statistically significant (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that αT6′C subunits may also be incorporated into spontaneously formed or Cu:phen-mediated disulfide bonds. We hypothesized that the results of Fig. 2 might be explained by intrasubunit disulfide formation in the closed state. The rat α1 subunit contains endogenous cysteines at position 233 in TM1 and at 292 in TM3, whereas the rat β1 subunit contains an endogenous cysteine at position 288 in TM3. To test for the involvement of the endogenous α subunit cysteines in disulfide bond formation, we created the triple mutant αT6′C, C233S, C292S subunit. The αT6′C, C233S, C292SβWT GABAAR was found to be completely insensitive to both Cu:phen and DTT (Fig. 2B). Since the αWTβWT GABAAR was also insensitive to these compounds, we cannot exclude the possibility that one or both of the endogenous cysteines forms disulfide bonds with T6′C in the α subunit. However, the large spatial separation between T6′ and the endogenous cysteines renders such an interaction unlikely in correctly folded, functional GABAARs (14Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Of course, the results could also be explained by αT6′C subunits cross-linking with each other via their 6′ cysteines or with the β subunit via its endogenous C288 residue. Western blotting (see below) was used to investigate this possibility further. Western Blotting ofαβ GABAARs—Western blotting experiments using anti-myc epitope antibody to identify tagged β subunits revealed that the αWTβT6′C and αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs efficiently formed dimers in both the absence and presence of GABA, whereas the αWTβWT and αT6′CβWT GABAARs did not form dimers under either condition (Fig. 3A). The blot in Fig. 3A was generated in the absence of NEM, which is often used to alkylate free sulfhydryls to prevent disulfide formation following protein structural disruption during the protein purification procedure. However, as seen in Fig. 3B, β subunit dimer bands were also seen in the closed state in the presence of 10 mm NEM. These dimers were not observed, however, when DTT treatment was included following oxidation and during SDS-PAGE sample preparation (Fig. 3C). Indeed, while dimer bands were observed in all samples containing βT6′C subunits in the absence of DTT, the intensity of dimer bands was substantially decreased in all samples following treatment with DTT (Fig. 3D). The disappearance of dimer band in the presence of DTT is consistent with the reduction of intersubunit disulfide bonds. To quantify these changes, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for direct quantification of band intensity using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. In two separate experiments, an approximate 6-fold difference in the intensity of the dimer band was observed between samples treated with and without DTT (Fig. 4). A slight increase in the intensity of the monomer band in the presence of DTT was also observed. Since variations in GABAAR protein concentrations between individual samples are to be expected, a more reliable measure is the ratio of dimer and monomer band intensities in each sample. Thus, while there is 10-fold more dimer in the absence of DTT, there is more monomer than dimer after reduction of the intersubunit disulfide cross-links with DTT. Taken together with the electrophysiology results, these observations strongly suggest that βT6′C subunits cross-link in the closed state via their 6′ cysteines and that this results in either channel block or in an inability of the receptors to open. The blot shown in Fig. 4 was also probed with an anti-FLAG epitope antibody to identify the α subunit. No discernible difference was observed between samples treated with DTT and those not treated with DTT. Direct quantification revealed no DTT-sensitive dimer bands indicating that α subunit 6′ cysteines do not participate in subunit dimerization. Hence, our results show that subunit dimerization occurs efficiently between β subunits via their 6′ cysteines and that α subunit 6′ cysteines do not contribute to subunit dimerization. These results are in accordance with the electrophysiological properties of the same receptors expressed in the same expression system (Fig. 2).FIGURE 4Direct quantification of the effects of sample reduction on subunit dimerization of αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs. Quantification was performed on scans of individual lanes containing αT6′CβT6′C GABAAR protein treated with DTT or without DTT. The positions of the quantified bands are indicated with white boxes (upper box, dimer; lower box, monomer). The size and position of the boxes used to quantitate the βT6′C dimer bands were retained for quantification of the α subunit. The integrated intensity values (with background correction) for each band were tabulated and normalized relative to the intensity of the monomer in the presence of DTT. The data are presented as bar graphs of relative intensity for each band in each lane. The results indicate an approximate 6-fold decrease in β subunit dimer band intensity in the presence of DTT. A slight increase in β monomer band intensity was also observed in the presence of DTT. Since substantial variation in GABAAR protein between lanes is a possibility, these results should be interpreted with care. A more meaningful comparison involves the ratio of intensities between bands in a single lane. This analysis provides significant evidence both that the dimer band is DTT-sensitive and that the relative amounts of dimer and monomer depend on the REDOX environment. The results with the α subunit indicate no discernible difference in either band between samples treated with DTT and those not treated with DTT. Although several additional bands of low intensity were observed with anti-FLAG antibody at high molecular weights, these were not DTT-sensitive and were also observed in untransfected samples and are therefore nonspecific. A and B, are the results from two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3E shows that αT6′C-containing receptors migrate at a slightly faster rate than αWT-containing receptors. This faster migration rate was abolished in αT6′C, C233S, C292SβWT GABAARs and by DTT treatment (data not shown). This result provides some support for the conclusion from electrophysiological data (Fig. 2, C and D) that α subunit 6′ cysteines may form intrasubunit disulfides with an endogenous α subunit cysteine. Electrophysiology and Western Blotting of αβγ GABAARs—As αβ GABAARs exist predominantly in a 2α:3β stoichiometry (15Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), β-β subunit dimers are theoretically possible between either adjacent or non-adjacent subunits. Because the present study shows that β subunit dimerization results in pore closure or block, the possibility of disulfide formation between non-adjacent β subunits cannot be ruled out. To determine whether non-adjacent β subunits are able to form disulfides via their 6′ cysteines, we investigated intersubunit disulfide bond formation in αβγ GABAARs, which have no adjacent β subunits (15Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Examples of the effects of 100:400 μm Cu:phen on αWTβWTγWT and αWTβT6′CγWT GABAARs are presented in the left panel of Fig. 5A. Although a 60 s application of Cu:phen transiently decreased current magnitude in both receptors, it had no irreversible effect. Results of similar experiments averaged from five cells expressing each GABAAR are summarized in Fig. 5A (right panel). These plots, which compare the magnitudes of currents measured 2 min after Cu:phen treatment relative to those of control currents, provide strong evidence that disulfide bond formation does not occur in γ subunit-containing GABAARs. The expression of the γ subunit was confirmed in two ways. First, because incorporation of γ subunits confers diazepam sensitivity to recombinant GABAARs (15Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 16Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. Le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Thompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we quantitated the effect of a 1 μm diazepam concentration on currents activated by 1 μm GABA in the in the αWTβWTγWT GABAAR. A sample result is presented in Fig. 5C (left). The results averaged from 3 cells (Fig. 5C, right) confirm that γ subunit expression confers diazepam sensitivity onto recombinant GABAARs. The same diazepam concentration had no significant effect in five cells expressing αWTβWT GABAARs. We could readily infer the presence of γWT subunits in αWTβT6′CγWT GABAARs as they removed the fast desensitization that was otherwise seen in their absence (data not shown). As a second method of confirmation, we probed cells expressing putative αWTβT6′CγWT GABAARs with an antibody for the γ2 subunit. As shown in Fig. 5D, antibody labeling was specific for the receptor incorporating the γ2 subunit. Finally, Western blotting confirmed the absence of dimer bands in αWTβT6′CγWT GABAARs (Fig. 5E). Summary of Results—The main conclusion of this study is that adjacent β subunits dimerize efficiently in the closed state via disulfide bond formation between their respective 6′ cysteines. This effectively locks the receptors into the closed state. Because αT6′CβT6′C and αWTβT6′C GABAARs desensitize rapidly (with time constants in the order of 100 ms) it was not possible to reliably apply oxidising or reducing agents in the open state. Hence it was not possible to establish whether disulfide bond formation could also occur in the open state. However, from previous electrophysiology results (13Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44845-44853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the present Western blot data, we conclude that dimers form in the desensitized state. Our results also suggest that endogenous transmembrane domain cysteines in αT6′C subunits may also contribute to disulfide formation. As αT6′C subunits do not dimerise with each other or with β subunits, such cross-links are most likely formed within individual α subunits. We did not investigate their molecular basis in this study. Comparison with Previous Results—A previous study also presented evidence for dimerization of adjacent β subunits (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, contrary to the present study, they concluded that dimerization resulted in the irreversible opening of the channel. The electrophysiological evidence for irreversible activation of αT6′CβT6′C GABAARs by Cu:phen was recorded from receptors recombinantly expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The drastic difference with the present results may be due to the different expression systems. Structures of transmembrane proteins may vary between HEK293 cell and Xenopus oocyte expression systems due to variations in the membrane lipid composition or the expression of cytoplasmic enzymes that control post-translational modifications, subunit folding or assembly. However, both studies performed Western blotting on the same receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. We have no explanation for the different results. The present study makes a case for closed state cross-link formation on the basis of both electrophysiological and Western blot experiments. A recent study demonstrated β subunit dimerization via 6′ cysteines in the absence of GABA in homomeric β3 GABAARs (17Chen L. Durkin K.A. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because these receptors gate spontaneously and the consequences of dimerization on receptor electrophysiological properties were not investigated, it was not possible to conclude whether dimerization occurred in the closed or open states or both. Nevertheless the result is illuminating as it shows that β subunit dimerization can occur in homomeric GABAARs. It has previously been thought that receptor subunit asymmetries were required to bring adjacent β subunit 6′ cysteines into sufficiently close proximity to permit dimerization (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Implications for Pore Structure and Gating—There are currently three structural models to explain how TM2 domains move to mediate Cys-loop receptor activation. Based on differences in electron density images of Torpedo nAChRs in the closed and open states, it was originally suggested that channel opening was mediated by a rotation of the TM2 domains around their long axes (10Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The most recent version of this model proposes a rotation of ∼15°, which is too small to significantly alter side chain exposure to the pore (18Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). A second study, which quantitated the reaction rates of protons with histidine side chains substituted sequentially for each TM2 residue in the muscle nAChR (11Cymes G.D. Ni Y. Grosman C. Nature. 2005; 438: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), concluded that the relative orientation of each residue with respect to the pore lumen did not change significantly as the channel opened and closed. This implies a parallel widening of the pore. A third study, based on the state dependence of zinc coordination by histidines substituted sequentially for nAChR pore-lining residues, concluded that channel opening was mediated by a rigid tilting motion of the TM2 domains around an axis parallel to the cell membrane that passes through the 6′ residue (9Paas Y. Gibor G. Grailhe R. Savatier-Duclert N. Dufresne V. Sunesen M. de Carvalho L.P. Changeux J.P. Attali B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15877-15882Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This model proposes no movement at the 6′ residue but a narrowing of the outer part of the pore and a widening of the inner part of the pore. A consistent feature of all three models is that activation involves no substantial change in the orientation of pore-lining residues to the pore lumen. The large 120° TM2 contrarotation proposed by Horenstein et al. (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) is inconsistent with all the above models and indeed prompted Cymes et al. to comment that it “might simply represent an orientation occupied with very low probability from which disulfide-bond formation proceeds extremely fast” (11Cymes G.D. Ni Y. Grosman C. Nature. 2005; 438: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By showing that 6′ disulfide formation occurs efficiently in the channel closed state, the present study questions the β subunit contrarotation model of activation (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), at least in HEK293 cell-expressed receptors. Nevertheless, it remains to be explained how adjacent β subunit 6′ cysteines can cross-link in the closed state. Since the present study investigated heteromeric GABAARs, our results can be explained by proposing that adjacent β subunits are oriented asymmetrically with their 6′ cysteines facing toward each other. This explanation is supported by evidence from the structurally related α1 homomeric GlyR. This receptor, which presumably has a symmetrical closed state structure by virtue of its homomeric subunit composition, does not cross-link via 6′ cysteines in either the closed or open states (13Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44845-44853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the observation of β subunit dimer formation in homomeric β3 GABAARs is difficult to reconcile with this conclusion. All three studies can be reconciled by proposing that α1 GABAAR subunits (and α1 GlyR subunits) are incapable of participating in 6′C-mediated cross-links with either themselves or with β GABAAR subunits. We propose that β subunits achieve cross-linking due to an unusually high thermal mobility rather than by either an asymmetry in the relative positioning of subunits in the closed state or by differences in modes of α and β subunit displacement. In support of this, evidence has previously been presented that the outer half of the GABAAR β subunit TM2 is more mobile than that of the α subunit (19Horenstein J. Riegelhaupt P. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We note, however, that the region around 6′ is thought to be less mobile than the extracellular half of the β subunit TM2. Despite this, evidence has been presented for random thermal motion of the GABAAR β subunit 6′ residue in the closed state (20Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We propose that a similar motion may result in the juxtapositioning of β subunit T6′C residues from adjacent subunits. While the results of the present study are consistent with the previous conclusion that β subunits are able to undergo large contrarotations (12Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), they do not lend support to the conclusion that these movements are associated exclusively with pore transitions to the open state. Nevertheless, because cross-linking of adjacent β subunits prevents the channels from opening, a movement of adjacent subunits relative to one another must be essential for channel gating. These may take the form of asymmetric movements (such as contrarotations of adjacent β subunits) or as asynchronies in the movement of adjacent subunits during gating. Asymmetries in collective subunit motions have previously been observed for 9′ residues during activation of the nAChR (21Mitra A. Cymes G.D. Auerbach A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conclusion—In conclusion, we show that adjacent β subunits in α1β1 GABAARs dimerise efficiently in the closed state via disulfide bond formation between their respective 6′ introduced cysteines. The dimerized receptors are thereby locked into the closed state. We propose that the 6′ cysteines are able to move into sufficiently close proximity for disulfide formation via relatively large amplitude thermal motions that are characteristic only of β subunits. As cross-links occur in both the absence and presence of GABA, we conclude that similar motions of β subunit TM2 segments occur in the closed and desensitized states, although the channel structures may be different. Because disulfide formation precludes channel activation, we conclude either that spontaneous β subunit movements or asymmetric movements of adjacent β subunits during activation are essential for channel activation. These results identify a novel feature of GABAAR gating that may be important for understanding the activation mechanism of these receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2002772712,"Three recent studies report on the olfactory mechanisms used for gender identification in Drosophila and on the olfactory receptors stimulated by the pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate. This pheromone activates specific olfactory receptors that suppress the courtship of males with other males, promote the sexual receptivity of females, and participate in the formation of memories about prior courtship experiences. Three recent studies report on the olfactory mechanisms used for gender identification in Drosophila and on the olfactory receptors stimulated by the pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate. This pheromone activates specific olfactory receptors that suppress the courtship of males with other males, promote the sexual receptivity of females, and participate in the formation of memories about prior courtship experiences. Social communication and recognition used in identifying possible sexual partners and effecting subsequent reproductive behavior in insects are mediated largely by sensing pheromones with the olfactory nervous system. Three papers published concurrently in Nature and Current Biology provide new and detailed information about the specific olfactory receptors engaged by pheromones, the olfactory-receptor neurons that express them, and the initial neural pathways activated for several different sex-specific behaviors expressed during courtship of Drosophila. One pheromone of particular importance for all three papers is 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a lipid thought to be released at low levels from the cuticle of male flies to attract other flies into a small population aggregate. It is also synthesized in the male's ejaculatory bulb and transferred to the recipient female during copulation. van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007van der Goes van Naters W. Carlson J.R. Curr. Biol. 2007; (in press. Published online March 15, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (242) Google Scholar report the results of a systematic study of the electrophysiological response properties of the tricoid sensilla on the antenna of Drosophila when stimulated with odors derived from food sources, fermentation products, cVA, and other flies. Male flies have ∼170 and females ∼140 of these sensilla that consist of three different subtypes (T1, T2, and T3) localized to the distolateral part of both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the antennae (Figure 1; Shanbhag et al., 1999Shanbhag S.R. Müller B. Steinbrecht R.A. Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1999; 28: 377-397Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These olfactory sense organs are small porous hairs through which odors can pass to excite the dendrites of between one and three different olfactory-receptor neurons that reside at the base of each hair. No strong responses were obtained from these olfactory organs using dozens of compounds derived from food extracts or fermentation products. Rather, these sensilla responded strongly to the odors derived from other flies. The T1 class of sensilla (which has only a single neuron per hair) responded strongly to male extracts but not to virgin female extracts, and the T2 and T3 classes of sensilla (which have two and three neurons per hair, respectively) responded equally to both extracts. These experiments identify the trichoid sensilla as the sensory organs programmed for gender recognition during the approach of another fly (Figure 1). Twelve of the 60 known Drosophila olfactory-receptor genes are expressed within olfactory-receptor neurons that innervate the trichoid sensilla (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1535-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). van der Goes van Naters and Carlson tested these 12 receptors for their response properties in vivo by directing their expression individually to an olfactory-receptor neuron genetically mutant for its own endogenous receptor (empty neuron), using odors from males, virgin females, mated females, and cVA to stimulate these reconstituted olfactory-receptor neurons. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the response properties of the receptors when tested in a female or a male neuron, indicating that the responses are independent of the gender of the neuron, even though the receptors may be involved in gender recognition. Four of the tested receptors (Or47b, Or65a, Or67d, and Or88a) responded strongly to male odors, and two of these (Or47b and Or88a) also responded to odors of virgin females. The T1 subclass of trichoid sensilla is known to express the Or67d receptor and the T3 subclass the Or47b, Or65a, and Or88a receptors (Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1535-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, Ha and Smith, 2006Ha T.S. Smith D.P. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8727-8733Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The T2 subclass of sensilla express the Or23a and Or83c receptors. It is unclear why Or23a and Or83c failed to produce responses when tested in the empty neuron, but perhaps the test neuron fails to have some of the necessary accessory components for the activity of these specific receptors. For instance, the odorant-binding protein, Lush, has been reported to be required for T1 sensilla to respond to cVA (Xu et al., 2005Xu P. Akkinson R. Jones D.N.M. Smith D.P. Neuron. 2005; 45: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The male-specific pheromone cVA was also tested as an odorant against the four receptors. Two of the four receptors (Or65a and Or67d) responded strongly to cVA. Interestingly, odors extracted from mated females also activated these two receptors, whereas virgin female extracts did not. Mated females probably adopt part of the pheromone profile of males, since cVA is transferred during copulation. Overall, the data published by van der Goes van Naters and Carlson are compatible with the notion that maleness is detected by the activation of Or67d, Or65a, Or47b, and Or88a in all classes of the trichoid sensilla and femaleness by the activation of Or47b and Or88a in the T3 sensilla, perhaps along with the lack of activation of Or67d and Or65a. Amina Kurtovic, Alexandre Widmer, and Barry Dickson (Kurtovic et al., 2007Kurtovic A. Widmer A. Dickson B.J. Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) focused on the pheromone cVA and Or67d, providing evidence that cVA serves a dual purpose, participating in sexual communication in both males and females through the activation of Or67d. Mutant flies missing the Or67d receptor completely lack the normal electrophysiological response induced in the T1 tricoid sensilla induced by cVA. Behaviorally, the mutant males court virgin females with the same vigor as wild-type males, indicating that cVA/Or67d interactions do not significantly influence the initial courtship activity of males with virgin females in this test (Figure 2). In contrast, the loss of Or67d activity led to a 3-fold increase in the low level of male courtship normally exhibited by wild-type males (Figure 2). This suggests that the normal function of the Or67d receptors in males is to detect cVA emitted from nearby males, to participate in ascertaining gender, and to suppress the physiological urges underlying courtship. The role of cVA as the ligand for Or67d function in male courtship suppression was tested by pairing males with virgin females painted with cVA. Normal males strongly avoided the cVA-laced virgin females, whereas males missing Or67d did not. Normal courtship behavior was restored in mutants by replacing Or67d gene function in the olfactory-receptor neurons that normally express it. Females that are mutant for the Or67d receptor also exhibit abnormal courtship behavior. They showed about a 50% decrease in receptivity to the courtship advances of wild-type males, suggesting that the cVA/Or67d receptor pathway promotes sexual receptivity in females upon detecting cVA emitted from courting males (Figure 2). However, females without the Or67d receptor have significant sexual receptivity, indicating that the cVA/Or67d pathway is not the sole mechanism by which females become receptive to courting males. Results from other clever experiments further argue that the cVA/Or67d receptor pathway is sufficient for suppressing male courtship. Receptors from either the silkmoth Bombyx mori or tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens were expressed in male flies, and female Drosophila virgins were painted with pheromones from these insects thought to be involved in sex recognition. Drosophila males that express the silkmoth receptor in the Or67d neurons exhibited reduced courtship only to females painted with the silkmoth pheromone, and those expressing the tobacco hornworm receptor exhibited reduced courtship only to females expressing the tobacco hornworm receptor. Aki Ejima, Leslie Griffith and collaborators (Ejima et al., 2007Ejima A. Smith B.P.C. Lucas C. van der Goes van Naters W. Miller C.J. Carlson J.R. Levine J.D. Griffith L.C. Curr. Biol. 2007; (in press. Published online March 15, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) offer yet another function for cVA in conditioned behavioral responses from courtship activity. In flies, male courtship that fails to culminate in copulation leads to a reduction in subsequent courtship attempts, but this reduction is specific to the age and sexual status of the female that is courted initially. If the initial courtship object is an immature virgin that rejects the male by kicking and running away, subsequent courtship is reduced for immature virgins but not for mature virgins or mature mated females. Similarly, if the initial courtship object is a mature virgin, subsequent courtship is reduced only for mature and not immature females. However, if the initial partner selected by the male is a mature and already mated female that rejects the male by kicking and extruding her ovipositor, courtship is reduced for all types of females (Ejima et al., 2005Ejima A. Smith B.P.C. Lucas C. Levine J.D. Griffith L.C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 194-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This “generalized” and learned reduction in courtship activity produced when using mature and mated females for the conditioning of males is due to the association of an aversive pheromonal cue with a courtship object (another fly). Ejima, Griffith, and collaborators identified the pheromone that produces this generalized learning as cVA by analyzing the constituents of hydrocarbon extracts of mature and mated females and testing them to determine which constituents would produce the behavioral response when presented along with a training object. cVA was found to be sufficient for producing generalized learning. How is cVA sensed during male:mated female courtship to produce the generalized reduction in courtship behavior? The authors tested the role of the two known cVA receptors (Or67d and Or65a) identified by van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007van der Goes van Naters W. Carlson J.R. Curr. Biol. 2007; (in press. Published online March 15, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (242) Google Scholar by blocking synaptic release from the olfactory-receptor neurons that express the receptors with the expression of tetanus toxin in these cells. They quantified the effect by measuring the initial courtship of the blocked males to mature virgin females in a test chamber laced with the odor of cVA. Normal males exhibited a strong reduction in courtship activity in the presence of cVA. Surprisingly, blocking the synaptic activity of the Or67d neurons in the courting males did not completely abrogate the effectiveness of cVA as one might expect, indicating that the Or67d neurons are not the sole mediators of the cVA-induced reduction in male courtship activity. Blocking the synaptic activity of the Or65a olfactory-receptor neurons abolished the effectiveness of cVA, indicating that this receptor and Or65a olfactory-receptor neurons are involved in the cVA-induced reduction in male courtship activity. The identification of Or65a, but not Or67d, in mediating the reduction in male courtship activity by cVA at first appears to stand at odds with the results of Kurtovic et al., 2007Kurtovic A. Widmer A. Dickson B.J. Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, which show that cVA is less potent in reducing male courtship activity in mutants of Or67d. However, it seems likely that both receptors are involved. Mutation of Or67d only partially blocks the effectiveness of cVA in reducing male courtship, suggesting the existence of a pathway separate from cVA/Or67d in suppressing male courtship activity (Kurtovic et al., 2007Kurtovic A. Widmer A. Dickson B.J. Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This could be the cVA/Or65a pathway. In addition, the expression of TNT in Or67d neurons appears to slightly reduce the effectiveness of cVA in suppressing courtship (Ejima et al., 2007Ejima A. Smith B.P.C. Lucas C. van der Goes van Naters W. Miller C.J. Carlson J.R. Levine J.D. Griffith L.C. Curr. Biol. 2007; (in press. Published online March 15, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The Ejima studies are thus consistent with the model that strong cVA pulses emitted from mated females by ovipositor extrusion during courtship attempts are detected by the Or67d and Or65a receptors of the courting males and become associated with the courtship object, leading to a subsequent suppression in courtship activity (Figure 2). The new information that we have learned from these three studies is that the trichoid sensilla along with the olfactory-receptor neurons Or67d, Or65a, Or47b, and Or88a appear to be the dominant part of the Drosophila olfactory system in gender detection and initiating sex-specific courtship behaviors (Figure 1, Figure 2). In this sense, the trichoid sensilla and their receptors are broadly similar to the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of mammals, which is a chemosensory system that senses pheromonal cues and is involved in gender discrimination, although recent studies indicate that pheromone detection in mammals is not an exclusive property of the VNO but is also mediated by the main olfactory epithelium (Dulac and Wagner, 2006Dulac C. Wagner S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The olfactory receptor neurons that express the Or67d and Or65a receptors are known to project axons into the antennal lobe glomeruli DA1 and DA1, DL3, DC1, VA1, and DA4m, respectively (Figure 2; Couto et al., 2005Couto A. Alenius M. Dickson B.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1535-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, Ejima et al., 2007Ejima A. Smith B.P.C. Lucas C. van der Goes van Naters W. Miller C.J. Carlson J.R. Levine J.D. Griffith L.C. Curr. Biol. 2007; (in press.

Nature. 2007; 446: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The second-order neurons in the antennal lobe send information to at least two third-order brain areas, the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn (Davis, 2004Davis R.L. Neuron. 2004; 44: 31-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, both DA1 and VA1 are sexually dimorphic, being larger in males (Kondoh et al., 2003Kondoh Y. Kaneshiro K.Y. Kimura K. Yamamoto D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2003; 270: 1005-1013Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), consistent with a sex-specific function. Although this is an impressive beginning, there remains a large void between knowing that cVA activates the OR67d and OR65a receptors, which in turn activate second-order neurons in the antennal lobe, and how behavior subsequently emerges from this initial activity. Filling the gap in knowledge about circuitry, the information processing that occurs in each successive neural station, and how these processes ultimately produce behavioral responses will be a large task for the future. Generalization of Courtship Learning in Drosophila Is Mediated by cis-Vaccenyl AcetateEjima et al.Current BiologyApril 03, 2007In BriefReproductive behavior in Drosophila has both stereotyped and plastic components that are driven by age- and sex-specific chemical cues. Males who unsuccessfully court virgin females subsequently avoid females that are of the same age as the trainer. In contrast, males trained with mature mated females associate volatile appetitive and aversive pheromonal cues and learn to suppress courtship of all females. Here we show that the volatile aversive pheromone that leads to generalized learning with mated females is (Z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA).
