https://openalex.org/W2120156669,"Eukaryotic cells contain assemblies of RNAs and proteins termed RNA granules. Many proteins within these bodies contain KH or RRM RNA-binding domains as well as low complexity (LC) sequences of unknown function. We discovered that exposure of cell or tissue lysates to a biotinylated isoxazole (b-isox) chemical precipitated hundreds of RNA-binding proteins with significant overlap to the constituents of RNA granules. The LC sequences within these proteins are both necessary and sufficient for b-isox-mediated aggregation, and these domains can undergo a concentration-dependent phase transition to a hydrogel-like state in the absence of the chemical. X-ray diffraction and EM studies revealed the hydrogels to be composed of uniformly polymerized amyloid-like fibers. Unlike pathogenic fibers, the LC sequence-based polymers described here are dynamic and accommodate heterotypic polymerization. These observations offer a framework for understanding the function of LC sequences as well as an organizing principle for cellular structures that are not membrane bound."
https://openalex.org/W2134791174,"We generated a high-quality reference genome sequence for foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The ∼400-Mb assembly covers ∼80% of the genome and >95% of the gene space. The assembly was anchored to a 992-locus genetic map and was annotated by comparison with >1.3 million expressed sequence tag reads. We produced more than 580 million RNA-Seq reads to facilitate expression analyses. We also sequenced Setaria viridis, the ancestral wild relative of S. italica, and identified regions of differential single-nucleotide polymorphism density, distribution of transposable elements, small RNA content, chromosomal rearrangement and segregation distortion. The genus Setaria includes natural and cultivated species that demonstrate a wide capacity for adaptation. The genetic basis of this adaptation was investigated by comparing five sequenced grass genomes. We also used the diploid Setaria genome to evaluate the ongoing genome assembly of a related polyploid, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum)."

Formation of such granules was emulated by treatment of mouse brain extracts and human cell lysates with a biotinylated isoxazole (b-isox) chemical. Deep sequencing of the associated RNAs revealed an enrichment for mRNAs known to be recruited to neuronal granules used for dendritic transport and localized translation at synapses. Precipitated mRNAs contain extended 3' UTR sequences and an enrichment in binding sites for known granule-associated proteins. Hydrogels composed of the low complexity (LC) sequence domain of FUS recruited and retained the same mRNAs as were selectively precipitated by the b-isox chemical. Phosphorylation of the LC domain of FUS prevented hydrogel retention, offering a conceptual means of dynamic, signal-dependent control of RNA granule assembly."

Network analysis of how normal and oncogenic signaling can be rewired by drugs may provide opportunities to target tumors with high specificity and efficacy. Using targeted inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways, combined with DNA-damaging chemotherapy, we report that time-staggered EGFR inhibition, but not simultaneous coadministration, dramatically sensitizes a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cells to genotoxic drugs. Systems-level analysis-using high-density time-dependent measurements of signaling networks, gene expression profiles, and cell phenotypic responses in combination with mathematical modeling-revealed an approach for altering the intrinsic state of the cell through dynamic rewiring of oncogenic signaling pathways. This process converts these cells to a less tumorigenic state that is more susceptible to DNA damage-induced cell death by reactivation of an extrinsic apoptotic pathway whose function is suppressed in the oncogene-addicted state."

The genetic basis of biotechnologically relevant traits, including drought tolerance, photosynthetic efficiency and flowering control, is also highlighted. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), a member of the Poaceae grass family, is an important food and fodder crop in arid regions and has potential for use as a C4 biofuel. It is a model system for other biofuel grasses, including switchgrass and pearl millet. We produced a draft genome (∼423 Mb) anchored onto nine chromosomes and annotated 38,801 genes. Key chromosome reshuffling events were detected through collinearity identification between foxtail millet, rice and sorghum including two reshuffling events fusing rice chromosomes 7 and 9, 3 and 10 to foxtail millet chromosomes 2 and 9, respectively, that occurred after the divergence of foxtail millet and rice, and a single reshuffling event fusing rice chromosome 5 and 12 to foxtail millet chromosome 3 that occurred after the divergence of millet and sorghum. Rearrangements in the C4 photosynthesis pathway were also identified."
https://openalex.org/W1990473825,"The virulence mechanisms that allow pathogens to colonize the intestine remain unclear. Here, we show that germ-free animals are unable to eradicate Citrobacter rodentium, a model for human infections with attaching and effacing bacteria. Early in infection, virulence genes were expressed and required for pathogen growth in conventionally raised mice but not germ-free mice. Virulence gene expression was down-regulated during the late phase of infection, which led to relocation of the pathogen to the intestinal lumen where it was outcompeted by commensals. The ability of commensals to outcompete C. rodentium was determined, at least in part, by the capacity of the pathogen and commensals to grow on structurally similar carbohydrates. Thus, pathogen colonization is controlled by bacterial virulence and through competition with metabolically related commensals."
https://openalex.org/W2051545676,"We show that amino acid covariation in proteins, extracted from the evolutionary sequence record, can be used to fold transmembrane proteins. We use this technique to predict previously unknown 3D structures for 11 transmembrane proteins (with up to 14 helices) from their sequences alone. The prediction method (EVfold_membrane) applies a maximum entropy approach to infer evolutionary covariation in pairs of sequence positions within a protein family and then generates all-atom models with the derived pairwise distance constraints. We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins. With the rapid rise in large-scale sequencing, more accurate and more comprehensive information on evolutionary constraints can be decoded from genetic variation, greatly expanding the repertoire of transmembrane proteins amenable to modeling by this method."
https://openalex.org/W2100538674,"Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is fundamental to energy balance and is also relevant for humans. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate adipogenesis, and, here, we describe a role for BMP8B in the direct regulation of thermogenesis. BMP8B is induced by nutritional and thermogenic factors in mature BAT, increasing the response to noradrenaline through enhanced p38MAPK/CREB signaling and increased lipase activity. Bmp8b(-/-) mice exhibit impaired thermogenesis and reduced metabolic rate, causing weight gain despite hypophagia. BMP8B is also expressed in the hypothalamus, and Bmp8b(-/-) mice display altered neuropeptide levels and reduced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), indicating an anorexigenic state. Central BMP8B treatment increased sympathetic activation of BAT, dependent on the status of AMPK in key hypothalamic nuclei. Our results indicate that BMP8B is a thermogenic protein that regulates energy balance in partnership with hypothalamic AMPK. BMP8B may offer a mechanism to specifically increase energy dissipation by BAT."

https://openalex.org/W2040328099,"The Real McCoy Some secreted proteins are phosphorylated, the most prominent example being the milk protein casein, but the enzymes that catalyze such phosphorylation have not been identified. (The proteins known as “casein kinases” are in fact cytosolic proteins and do not mediate physiological phosphorylation of casein.) Tagliabracci et al. (p. 1150 , published online 10 May) searched for a human protein with the characteristics expected of a secretory protein kinase and identified Fam20C. Mutations in the gene encoding Fam20C cause defects in bone formation. Furthermore, the consensus sequence for Fam20C phosphorylation was found in several secreted proteins that function in biomineralization. Thus, Fam20C appears to be the “real” casein kinase and to function in bone physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2139039510,"The presence of ribonucleotides in genomic DNA is undesirable given their increased susceptibility to hydrolysis. Ribonuclease (RNase) H enzymes that recognize and process such embedded ribonucleotides are present in all domains of life. However, in unicellular organisms such as budding yeast, they are not required for viability or even efficient cellular proliferation, while in humans, RNase H2 hypomorphic mutations cause the neuroinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Here, we report that RNase H2 is an essential enzyme in mice, required for embryonic growth from gastrulation onward. RNase H2 null embryos accumulate large numbers of single (or di-) ribonucleotides embedded in their genomic DNA (>1,000,000 per cell), resulting in genome instability and a p53-dependent DNA-damage response. Our findings establish RNase H2 as a key mammalian genome surveillance enzyme required for ribonucleotide removal and demonstrate that ribonucleotides are the most commonly occurring endogenous nucleotide base lesion in replicating cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007433513,"T loops and telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures pose a potential threat to genome stability and must be dismantled to permit efficient telomere replication. Here we implicate the helicase RTEL1 in the removal of telomeric DNA secondary structures, which is essential for preventing telomere fragility and loss. In the absence of RTEL1, T loops are inappropriately resolved by the SLX4 nuclease complex, resulting in loss of the telomere as a circle. Depleting SLX4 or blocking DNA replication abolished telomere circles (TCs) and rescued telomere loss in RTEL1−/− cells but failed to suppress telomere fragility. Conversely, stabilization of telomeric G4-DNA or loss of BLM dramatically enhanced telomere fragility in RTEL1-deficient cells but had no impact on TC formation or telomere loss. We propose that RTEL1 performs two distinct functions at telomeres: it disassembles T loops and also counteracts telomeric G4-DNA structures, which together ensure the dynamics and stability of the telomere.

RTEL1 disassembles T loops to maintain telomere integrity In RTEL1−/− cells, T loop resolution by SLX4 removes the telomere as a circle RTEL1 and BLM operate in separate pathways to prevent telomere fragility G-quadruplex DNA structures are a major source of telomere fragility Telomeres are complex nucleoprotein structures, which function to maintain and protect the ends of linear chromosomes. Mammalian telomeres are composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG sequences, which terminate in a 3′ single-stranded overhang (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Telomere-repeat length can be maintained by the action of telomerase or by an alternative telomere length (ALT) maintenance mechanism that utilizes homologous recombination in 10% of cancer cells (Bryan et al., 1997Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Pozza L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Evidence for an alternative mechanism for maintaining telomere length in human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines.Nat.

Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts.Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Telomere function is also critically dependent on shelterin, a protein complex comprising telomere-specific binding proteins including TRF1, TRF2, and POT1 that function to regulate telomerase and protect the chromosome end (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Visualization of vertebrate telomeres by electron microscopy revealed that telomeres frequently adopt a lasso-like configuration called a T loop (Griffith et al., 1999Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop.Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). T loop structures also exist in other eukaryotes (Cesare et al., 2003Cesare A.J. Quinney N. Willcox S. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. Telomere looping in P. sativum (common garden pea).Plant J. 2003; 36: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Muñoz-Jordán et al., 2001Muñoz-Jordán J.L. Cross G.A. de Lange T.

C. elegans telomeres contain G-strand and C-strand overhangs that are bound by distinct proteins.Cell. 2008; 132: 745-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and their formation requires both homologous recombination (HR) and shelterin components (Verdun and Karlseder, 2006Verdun R.E. Karlseder J. The DNA damage machinery and homologous recombination pathway act consecutively to protect human telomeres.Cell. 2006; 127: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The T loop is therefore believed to result from strand invasion of the 3′ single-stranded telomeric end into subtelomeric duplex TTAGGG repeats, which results in a displacement loop (D loop) intermediate at the site of strand invasion (Amiard et al., 2007Amiard S. Doudeau M. Pinte S. Poulet A. Lenain C. Faivre-Moskalenko C. Angelov D. Hug N. Vindigni A. Bouvet P. et al.A topological mechanism for TRF2-enhanced strand invasion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that T loops protect the chromosome end from degradation and promiscuous DNA-repair activities (de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar), but evidence that T loops form at all telomeres and perform a protective function is currently lacking. Irrespective of the nature of T loops, these structures must be removed to permit telomere replication, but the mechanistic basis of T loop disassembly remains unclear (Gilson and Géli, 2007Gilson E. Géli V. How telomeres are replicated.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Fragile sites are specific chromosomal loci that exhibit gaps or breaks when cells are subjected to low doses of aphidicolin, which induces replication stress (Durkin and Glover, 2007Durkin S.G. Glover T.W. Chromosome fragile sites.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Fragile sites are hot spots for deletions and other chromosome rearrangements and are associated with an increased frequency of HR (Glover and Stein, 1987Glover T.W. Stein C.K. Induction of sister chromatid exchanges at common fragile sites.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 41: 882-890PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, telomeres have been identified as aphidicolin-induced fragile sites (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). TRF1 and the DNA helicases RTEL1 and BLM are required to prevent telomere fragility, but how they do so is uncertain (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). It was proposed that TRF1, RTEL1, and BLM may facilitate telomere replication by removing telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of telomeric G4-DNA structures to telomere fragility has not been addressed. RTEL1 (regulator of telomere length) is a helicase first identified by genomic mapping of loci that control telomere-length differences between M. musculus and M. spretus (Zhu et al., 1998Zhu L. Hathcock K.S. Hande P. Lansdorp P.M. Seldin M.F. Hodes R.J. Telomere length regulation in mice is linked to a novel chromosome locus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RTEL1 plays an essential role in genome stability as knockout mice are embryonic lethal and cells derived from these mice exhibit impaired proliferation, chromosomal abnormalities, and telomere loss, but the molecular basis of this defect remains unclear (Ding et al., 2004Ding H. Schertzer M. Wu X. Gertsenstein M. Selig S. Kammori M. Pourvali R. Poon S. Vulto I. Chavez E. et al.Regulation of murine telomere length by Rtel: an essential gene encoding a helicase-like protein.Cell. 2004; 117: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). RTEL1 was also recently identified in a genome-wide association study as a susceptibility locus for glioma, highlighting its importance for genome integrity (Egan et al., 2011Egan K.M. Thompson R.C. Nabors L.B. Olson J.J. Brat D.J. Larocca R.V. Brem S. Moots P.L. Madden M.H. Browning J.E. Ann Chen Y. Cancer susceptibility variants and the risk of adult glioma in a US case-control study.J.

Delattre J.Y. et al.Genome-wide association study identifies five susceptibility loci for glioma.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). RTEL1 was also independently identified as an antagonist of HR with functional similarity to the yeast antirecombinase Srs2 (Marini and Krejci, 2010Marini V. Krejci L. Srs2: the “Odd-Job Man” in DNA repair.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2010; 9: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because human RTEL1 exhibits D loop dissociation activity in vitro, it was proposed that the phenotypes associated with RTEL-1/RTEL1 deficiency reflect a defect in dismantling recombination intermediates (Barber et al., 2008Barber L.J. Youds J.L. Ward J.D. McIlwraith M.J. O'Neil N.J. Petalcorin M.I. Martin J.S. Collis S.J. Cantor S.B. Auclair M. et al.RTEL1 maintains genomic stability by suppressing homologous recombination.Cell. 2008; 135: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, Youds et al., 2010Youds J.L. Mets D.G. McIlwraith M.J. Martin J.S. Ward J.D. ONeil N.J. Rose A.M. West S.C. Meyer B.J. Boulton S.J. RTEL-1 enforces meiotic crossover interference and homeostasis.Science. 2010; 327: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but how this function contributes to tumorigenesis is not known. In this work, we have investigated the underlying cause of telomere dysfunction in RTEL1-deficient cells. We present evidence that RTEL1 is essential for the disassembly of T loops during DNA replication. Failure to dismantle T loops in RTEL1-deficient cells leads to rapid changes in telomere length and telomere loss as a result of catastrophic telomere processing by the SLX4 nuclease complex, which resolves the T loop as a circle. We define a general mechanism of telomere circle (TC) formation as we show that the SLX4 nuclease complex is also responsible for the formation of TCs that arise in ALT cells and in cells overexpressing the dominant-negative TRF2ΔB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RTEL1 and BLM operate in genetically distinct pathways to counteract telomere fragility, and we establish that telomeric G4-DNA structures are a major source of telomere fragility in RTEL1-deficient cells. Thus, our findings define the mechanistic basis of T loop disassembly and provide insight into the source and prevention of telomere fragility, which reflect two distinct activities of RTEL1 at telomeres. To investigate the telomere function of mammalian RTEL1, we established a conditional allele of the mouse RTEL1 gene that permits Cre-mediated deletion of exon 7, resulting in the premature termination of the RTEL1 coding sequence (Wu et al., 2007Wu X. Sandhu S. Ding H. Establishment of conditional knockout alleles for the gene encoding the regulator of telomere length (RTEL).Genesis. 2007; 45: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Infection of RTEL1F/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a Cre-expressing adenovirus resulted in the loss of the floxed RTEL1 allele and elimination of the RTEL1 protein within 72 hr (Figures 1A and 1B ). Cre-mediated deletion of RTEL1 resulted in reduced proliferative capacity, induction of senescence, and accumulation of sister chromatid breaks on 11% of chromosomes per metaphase (Figure S1 available online). Analysis of metaphases in RTEL1F/− MEFs by telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 96 hr after Cre-infection also revealed various striking telomere abnormalities (Figures 1C and S1). In wild-type (WT) cells, telomere FISH signals are present on each individual sister chromatid end, and the intensity of the FISH signal is comparable between each sister chromatid. Following conditional inactivation of RTEL1, the intensity of the telomere FISH signal was significantly reduced or increased on a given sister chromatid end relative to the other sister, suggestive of a rapid alteration in telomere length (Figures 1C and 1D). We also detected a high incidence of chromosomes in RTEL1−/− cells that lacked a detectable telomere FISH signal on one or both sister chromatid ends, indicative of complete telomere loss (Figures 1C and 1D). In agreement with a recent report (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we also detected a high incidence of fragile telomeres following inactivation of RTEL1 that manifests as sister chromatid ends with multiple spatially separated telomere FISH signals (Figures 1C and 1D). Analysis of telomere length by quantitative telomere FISH confirmed that loss of RTEL1 leads to rapid alteration in the mean telomere length, which included a statistically significant increase in both short and long telomeres (Figure 1E) (Ding et al., 2004Ding H. Schertzer M. Wu X. Gertsenstein M. Selig S. Kammori M. Pourvali R. Poon S. Vulto I. Chavez E. et al.Regulation of murine telomere length by Rtel: an essential gene encoding a helicase-like protein.Cell. 2004; 117: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because inactivation of either RTEL1 or TRF1 confers a fragile telomere phenotype (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we performed a direct comparison of telomere phenotypes in conditional knockout MEFs. Inactivation of RTEL1 resulted in loss of the telomere FISH signal on 18 ± 2 chromosome ends per metaphase. This contrasted with the loss of less than 2 ± 1 telomeres per metaphase in RTEL1+/− and TRF1−/− cells (Figure 1F). Confirming a recent report, inactivation of either TRF1 or RTEL1 resulted in 17 ± 2 and 12 ± 3 fragile telomeres per metaphase, respectively (Figure 1G) (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). RTEL1-deficient cells also showed a significant induction of the DNA-damage response at telomeres, although this phenotype was not as strong as previously reported in TRF1-deficent cells (Figure S1) (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Our data reveal that inactivation of RTEL1 results in the accumulation of several distinct telomere abnormalities, including rapid changes in telomere length, telomere loss, and telomere fragility. Although telomere fragility is a phenotype observed in both RTEL1- and TRF1-deficient cells (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), the telomere-length heterogeneity and loss of telomeres are only seen following inactivation of RTEL1. This raises the possibility that the phenotype of RTEL1-deficient cells may reflect at least two distinct roles for RTEL1 at telomeres. RTEL1 was previously identified as an antirecombinase that acts to constrain HR by disassembling D loop intermediates (Barber et al., 2008Barber L.J. Youds J.L. Ward J.D. McIlwraith M.J. O'Neil N.J. Petalcorin M.I. Martin J.S. Collis S.J. Cantor S.B. Auclair M. et al.RTEL1 maintains genomic stability by suppressing homologous recombination.Cell. 2008; 135: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the ability of RTEL1 to disassemble preformed D loops during conventional HR reactions may have been co-opted to dismantle T loop structures that are believed to form at telomeres when the 3′ single-stranded end of the telomere invades into double-stranded telomere repeats to form a lasso-like structure (Griffith et al., 1999Griffith J.D.

Shelterin: the protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). To determine whether RTEL1 is capable of disrupting a T loop structure in vitro, we employed a T loop assay developed by Verdun and Karlseder (Verdun and Karlseder, 2006Verdun R.E. Karlseder J. The DNA damage machinery and homologous recombination pathway act consecutively to protect human telomeres.Cell. 2006; 127: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this assay, a radiolabeled telomere repeat fragment containing a single-stranded DNA end was shown to undergo strand invasion into a telomere repeat containing plasmid to form a T loop in the presence of cell extracts (Figure S2A ). Critically, T loop formation required HR factors as well as the shelterin components TRF1 and TRF2 as their depletion from the extract abolished T loop formation in vitro (Verdun and Karlseder, 2006Verdun R.E.

To determine whether RTEL1 impacts on T loop formation in this assay, we generated extracts from control cells and cells induced to express either the WT or the ATPase dead mutant (K48R) of RTEL1 (Figure S2B). T loop structures were readily detected as a slower-migrating band on agarose gels in control extracts (-Tet; Figure S2C, lanes 3 and 5) but not when either the extract or the plasmid substrate was omitted (Figure S2C, lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, T loops formed in cell extracts expressing the K48R mutant of RTEL1 (Figure S2C, lane 6) but not in extracts expressing WT RTEL1 (Figure S2C, lane 4). Additionally, T loops only formed with telomere repeat fragments containing a 3′ single-stranded end (Figure S2C, lanes 3 to 6) but not with a 5′ single-stranded end (Figure S2C, lanes 7–10), which conforms to the physiological orientation of strand invasion by HR. These results demonstrate that RTEL1 can disassemble or prevent the formation of T loops in vitro, and this requires its ATPase activity. This finding raised the possibility that telomere loss in RTEL1-deficient cells may reflect a failure to efficiently dismantle T loops in vivo. We speculated that the rapid loss of telomeres in the absence of RTEL1 could arise if persistent T loops were inappropriately processed to produce a TC. Previous studies have shown that TCs form at a high frequency in cells that overexpress the dominant-negative TRF2ΔB and also in ALT cells, which maintained telomeres by recombination in the absence of telomerase (Henson et al., 2009Henson J.D.

Homologous recombination generates T-loop-sized deletions at human telomeres.Cell. 2004; 119: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To determine whether TCs also accumulate following inactivation of RTEL1, we developed a TC amplification assay based on a previous method used to detect TCs in plants (Zellinger et al., 2007Zellinger B. Akimcheva S. Puizina J. Schirato M. Riha K. Ku suppresses formation of telomeric circles and alternative telomere lengthening in Arabidopsis.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 163-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this assay, a telomere-specific oligonucleotide is annealed with denatured genomic DNA and subject to rolling circle amplification by Phi29 polymerase. The amplified telomere products are resolved on denaturing gels and detected by telomere repeat Southern blot (Figure 2A ). The product of TC amplification can be distinguished from linear telomere repeat fragments (TRFs) by the fact that TRFs are significantly retarded on gel (Zellinger et al., 2007Zellinger B. Akimcheva S. Puizina J. Schirato M. Riha K. Ku suppresses formation of telomeric circles and alternative telomere lengthening in Arabidopsis.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 163-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Specificity of the TC amplification is based on the resistance of circular DNA to treatment with exonuclease V (ExoV) compared to linear TRFs that are degraded by ExoV (Zellinger et al., 2007Zellinger B. Akimcheva S. Puizina J. Schirato M. Riha K. Ku suppresses formation of telomeric circles and alternative telomere lengthening in Arabidopsis.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 163-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a proof of principle, we used the TC amplification assay on TRF2ΔB-overexpressing cells and in VA13 ALT cells, which confirmed the presence of TCs as previously reported (Figure 2B) (Henson et al., 2009Henson J.D. Cao Y. Huschtscha L.I. Chang A.C. Au A.Y. Pickett H.A. Reddel R.R. DNA C-circles are specific and quantifiable markers of alternative-lengthening-of-telomeres activity.Nat.

Homologous recombination generates T-loop-sized deletions at human telomeres.Cell. 2004; 119: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To determine whether telomere loss in RTEL1-deficient cells correlates with the accumulation of TCs, we employed the TC amplification assay on conditional RTEL1F/− MEFs. A low basal level of Phi29-dependent TCs was detected in untreated RTEL1F/− cells. In contrast, very high levels of Phi29-dependent TCs were detected in RTEL1-deficient cells 96 hr post-treatment with Cre (Figure 2C). Importantly, incubation of genomic DNA with ExoV prior to Phi29 rolling circle amplification abolished the linear TRF signal but had no effect on TCs, confirming that the amplified products arise from circular species (Figure 2D). To examine the dynamics of TC formation following inactivation of RTEL1, we performed a time course analysis following RTEL1 inactivation. Phi29-dependent TCs were readily detected 24 hr after Cre-infection of RTEL1F/− cells and increased progressively up to 96 hr after Cre-infection to levels exceeding those observed in VA13 ALT cells, which acted as a positive control (Figure 2E). Thus, TCs rapidly accumulate following inactivation of RTEL1, which suggests that telomere loss results from excision of the telomere as a circle within two to three cell cycles. The fragile telomeres that accumulate in TRF1-deficient cells resemble common fragile sites as both events are respectively increased and induced following treatment with aphidicolin, which inhibits DNA polymerase and blocks replication (Durkin and Glover, 2007Durkin S.G. Glover T.W. Chromosome fragile sites.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L.

Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). To examine the impact of replication inhibition on the telomere phenotype of RTEL1-deficient cells, we examined metaphases of RTEL1-proficient and -deficient MEFs treated with a low concentration of aphidicolin (0.2 μM). Aphidicolin treatment led to a modest induction of telomere fragility in RTEL1-proficient cells (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and a substantial increase in the number of fragile telomeres in RTEL1-deficient cells, corresponding to an increase from 11 ± 3 fragile telomeres per metaphase showing fragility without treatment to 21 ± 2 following treatment with aphidicolin (Figure 3A ). These results suggest that the fragile telomeres arising following inactivation of RTEL1 resemble common fragile sites, as is the case in TRF1-deficient cells (Sfeir et al., 2009Sfeir A. Kosiyatrakul S.T. Hockemeyer D. MacRae S.L. Karlseder J. Schildkraut C.L. de Lange T. Mammalian telomeres resemble fragile sites and require TRF1 for efficient replication.Cell. 2009; 138: 90-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). To investigate the impact of replication inhibition on the accumulation of TCs in RTEL1-deficient cells, we examined TC formation in RTEL1-proficient and -deficient cells following treatment with aphidicolin. Strikingly, aphidicolin treatment (5 μM) completely abolished Phi29-dependent TC amplification following inactivation of RTEL1 (Figure 3B). TC formation was also abolished in RTEL1-deficient cells following treatment either with a lower concentration of aphidicolin (0.5 μM) or with hydroxyurea (3 mM), which stalls replication by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (Figure 3C). If telomere loss in RTEL1-deficient cells results from excision of the T loop as a circle then aphidicolin treatment should also suppress the frequency of telomere loss following RTEL1 inactivation. Indeed, aphidicolin treatment led to a substantial reduction in the frequency of telomere loss in RTEL1-deficient cells, corresponding to a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction from 12 ± 5 telomere loss per metaphase in untreated RTEL1−/− cells to 4.5 ± 1.8 telomere loss per metaphase following treatment with aphidicolin, which is comparable to the telomere loss observed in RTEL1-proficient cells (Figure 3D). These results suggest that loss of telomeres in RTEL1-deficient cells results from excision of the telomere as a circle, which requires active DNA replication. We next focused our efforts toward understanding the mechanism of TC formation and telomere loss in RTEL1 null cells. We reasoned that a persistent T loop could be cleaved at the site of strand invasion by a structure-specific nuclease and repaired as a crossover, which would result in loss of the telomere as a circle. Intriguingly, the human SLX4 nuclease complex was recently shown to associate with telomeres based on proteomics of isolated chromatin (PICh) segments data (Déjardin and Kingston, 2009Déjardin J.

https://openalex.org/W2065668692,"A key step during crop domestication is the loss of seed shattering. Here, we show that seed shattering in sorghum is controlled by a single gene, Shattering1 (Sh1), which encodes a YABBY transcription factor. Domesticated sorghums harbor three different mutations at the Sh1 locus. Variants at regulatory sites in the promoter and intronic regions lead to a low level of expression, a 2.2-kb deletion causes a truncated transcript that lacks exons 2 and 3, and a GT-to-GG splice-site variant in the intron 4 results in removal of the exon 4. The distributions of these non-shattering haplotypes among sorghum landraces suggest three independent origins. The function of the rice ortholog (OsSh1) was subsequently validated with a shattering-resistant mutant, and two maize orthologs (ZmSh1-1 and ZmSh1-5.1+ZmSh1-5.2) were verified with a large mapping population. Our results indicate that Sh1 genes for seed shattering were under parallel selection during sorghum, rice and maize domestication."
https://openalex.org/W1968324646,"The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2070989134,"Localized protein synthesis requires assembly and transport of translationally silenced ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), some of which are exceptionally large. Where in the cell such large RNP granules first assemble was heretofore unknown. We previously reported that during synapse development, a fragment of the Wnt-1 receptor, DFrizzled2, enters postsynaptic nuclei where it forms prominent foci. Here we show that these foci constitute large RNP granules harboring synaptic protein transcripts. These granules exit the nucleus by budding through the inner and the outer nuclear membranes in a nuclear egress mechanism akin to that of herpes viruses. This budding involves phosphorylation of A-type lamin, a protein linked to muscular dystrophies. Thus nuclear envelope budding is an endogenous nuclear export pathway for large RNP granules."

https://openalex.org/W2113849086,"The Arc/Arg3.1 gene product is rapidly upregulated by strong synaptic activity and critically contributes to weakening synapses by promoting AMPA-R endocytosis. However, how activity-induced Arc is redistributed and determines the synapses to be weakened remains unclear. Here, we show targeting of Arc to inactive synapses via a high-affinity interaction with CaMKIIβ that is not bound to calmodulin. Synaptic Arc accumulates in inactive synapses that previously experienced strong activation and correlates with removal of surface GluA1 from individual synapses. A lack of CaMKIIβ either in vitro or in vivo resulted in loss of Arc upregulation in the silenced synapses. The discovery of Arc's role in ""inverse"" synaptic tagging that is specific for weaker synapses and prevents undesired enhancement of weak synapses in potentiated neurons reconciles essential roles of Arc both for the late phase of long-term plasticity and for reduction of surface AMPA-Rs in stimulated neurons."

In particular, the velocity is almost certainly slower than the fast magnetosonic speed, with no bow shock forming ahead of the heliosphere, as was widely expected in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2009954049,"Cilia are essential for fertilization, respiratory clearance, cerebrospinal fluid circulation and establishing laterality. Cilia motility defects cause primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, MIM244400), a disorder affecting 1:15,000-30,000 births. Cilia motility requires the assembly of multisubunit dynein arms that drive ciliary bending. Despite progress in understanding the genetic basis of PCD, mutations remain to be identified for several PCD-linked loci. Here we show that the zebrafish cilia paralysis mutant schmalhans (smh(tn222)) encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 103 protein (Ccdc103), a foxj1a-regulated gene product. Screening 146 unrelated PCD families identified individuals in six families with reduced outer dynein arms who carried mutations in CCDC103. Dynein arm assembly in smh mutant zebrafish was rescued by wild-type but not mutant human CCDC103. Chlamydomonas Ccdc103/Pr46b functions as a tightly bound, axoneme-associated protein. These results identify Ccdc103 as a dynein arm attachment factor that causes primary ciliary dyskinesia when mutated."

We now report the paradoxical finding that this powerful oncogene can also act as a suppressor of cell motility, invasiveness and metastasis. Overexpression of MYC stimulated proliferation of breast cancer cells both in culture and in vivo as expected, but inhibited motility and invasiveness in culture, and lung and liver metastases in xenografted tumours. We show further that MYC represses transcription of both subunits of αvβ3 integrin, and that exogenous expression of β3 integrin in human breast cancer cells that do not express this integrin rescues invasiveness and migration when MYC is downregulated. These data uncover an unexpected function of MYC, provide an explanation for the hitherto puzzling literature on the relationship between MYC and metastasis, and reveal a variable that could influence the development of therapies that target MYC."

Here we identified MET as an RCP-binding protein and showed that mutant p53 promoted MET recycling. Mutant p53-expressing cells were more sensitive to hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand for MET, leading to enhanced MET signalling, invasion and cell scattering that was dependent on both MET and RCP. In cells expressing the p53 family member TAp63, inhibition of TAp63 also lead to cell scattering and MET-dependent invasion. However, in cells that express very low levels of TAp63, the ability of mutant p53 to promote MET-dependent cell scattering was independent of TAp63. Taken together, our data show that mutant p53 can enhance MET signalling to promote cell scattering and invasion through both TAp63-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) exemplifies one major arm of such chaperone systems present from bacteria to mammals (Lindquist and Craig, 1988Lindquist S. Craig E.A. The heat-shock proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). Its high abundance in unstressed eukaryotic cells emphasizes its importance in normal physiology. Indeed, Hsp90 associates with diverse proteins like steroid receptors, kinases, and transcription factors and helps them mature to active conformations with the aid of a cohort of cochaperones such as p23 and Cdc37 (Taipale et al., 2010Taipale M. Jarosz D.F. Lindquist S. HSP90 at the hub of protein homeostasis: emerging mechanistic insights.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Additionally, the chaperone is instrumental in assembling multiprotein complexes such as RNA polymerase II (pol II) in cytoplasm (Boulon et al., 2010Boulon S. Pradet-Balade B. Verheggen C. Molle D. Boireau S. Georgieva M. Azzag K. Robert M.-C. Ahmad Y. Neel H. et al.HSP90 and its R2TP/Prefoldin-like cochaperone are involved in the cytoplasmic assembly of RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 912-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hsp90 utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis for iteratively binding structurally labile parts of specific proteins and maintaining proteins like steroid receptors in an active conformation (Echeverria and Picard, 2010Echeverria P.C. Picard D. Molecular chaperones, essential partners of steroid hormone receptors for activity and mobility.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The finding that many tumorigenic proteins require functional Hsp90 brought this chaperone into prominence as an attractive anticancer target (Trepel et al., 2010Trepel J. Mollapour M. Giaccone G. Neckers L. Targeting the dynamic HSP90 complex in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Several drugs that inhibit Hsp90 ATPase activity, based on protoypes such as radicicol and geldanamycin, have since been successfully evaluated in clinical trials (Workman et al., 2007Workman P. Burrows F. Neckers L. Rosen N. Drugging the cancer chaperone HSP90: combinatorial therapeutic exploitation of oncogene addiction and tumor stress.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2007; 1113: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). At the organismal level, compromised Hsp90 activity during development leads to generation of novel phenotypes, owing to pre-existing genetic or epigenetic variants (Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998Rutherford S.L. Lindquist S. Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution.Nature. 1998; 396: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), or transposon-mediated generation of new variants (Specchia et al., 2010Specchia V. Piacentini L. Tritto P. Fanti L. D'Alessandro R. Palumbo G. Pimpinelli S. Bozzetti M.P. Hsp90 prevents phenotypic variation by suppressing the mutagenic activity of transposons.Nature. 2010; 463: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A central position occupied by Hsp90 in cellular networks thus allows this chaperone to link genotypes with phenotypes, broadly affecting development, disease, and ultimately evolution. There is, however, a major disconnect between known molecular actions of Hsp90 and its functional role in areas of biomedical and evolutionary importance. Although most effects of Hsp90 inhibition are attributed to its action on cytosolic proteins, its role in the nucleus is only beginning to be appreciated. The chaperone has been implicated in a signal-dependent disassembly of transcriptional regulatory complex (Freeman and Yamamoto, 2002Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Disassembly of transcriptional regulatory complexes by molecular chaperones.Science. 2002; 296: 2232-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), nucleosomal removal in yeast (Floer et al., 2008Floer M. Bryant G.O. Ptashne M. HSP90/70 chaperones are required for rapid nucleosome removal upon induction of the GAL genes of yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and activation of histone methyltransferase SMYD3 in mammalian cells (Hamamoto et al., 2004Hamamoto R. Furukawa Y. Morita M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Curiously, Hsp90 has been shown to interact with and stabilize Trithorax (Trx), an important component of the epigenetic memory system (Tariq et al., 2009Tariq M. Nussbaumer U. Chen Y. Beisel C. Paro R. Trithorax requires Hsp90 for maintenance of active chromatin at sites of gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In Drosophila salivary glands, Hsp90 was shown to colocalize with Trx on chromatin, suggesting a direct role of Hsp90 at the site of gene activity. Moreover, the chaperone is known to associate with and regulate HIV promoter in infected cells (Vozzolo et al., 2010Vozzolo L. Loh B. Gane P.J. Tribak M. Zhou L. Anderson I. Nyakatura E. Jenner R.G. Selwood D. Fassati A. Gyrase B inhibitor impairs HIV-1 replication by targeting Hsp90 and the capsid protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39314-39328Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), stressing the need to investigate the general role of Hsp90 at transcription units in the genome. Transcriptional control is at the heart of development and is altered in most pathological conditions such as infection and cancer. RNA pol II-mediated transcription is regulated at various levels. Genome-wide data sets emerging in the last few years have identified promoter-proximal pausing of pol II as a key rate-limiting step in regulation of a large fraction of genes (Muse et al., 2007Muse G.W.

A block to elongation is largely responsible for decreased transcription of c-myc in differentiated HL60 cells.Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), pausing occurs after the pol II complex initiates transcription close to the promoter but halts shortly thereafter, making about 30–60 base-long RNAs. The presence and quantity of such short RNAs correlate well with paused pol II genome wide (Nechaev et al., 2010Nechaev S. Fargo D.C. dos Santos G. Liu L. Gao Y. Adelman K. Global analysis of short RNAs reveals widespread promoter-proximal stalling and arrest of Pol II in Drosophila.Science. 2010; 327: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A stable transcription bubble as judged by permanganate footprinting readily demonstrates the transcriptional competence of paused pol II (Giardina et al., 1992Giardina C. Pérez-Riba M. Lis J.T. Promoter melting and TFIID complexes on Drosophila genes in vivo.Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2190-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Two factors act in concert to induce pausing of the pol II complex—DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor composed of Spt4/5 proteins) and NELF (negative elongation factor consisting of NELF-A, B, D, and E) (Wu et al., 2003Wu C.-H. Yamaguchi Y. Benjamin L.R. Horvat-Gordon M. Washinsky J. Enerly E. Larsson J. Lambertsson A. Handa H. Gilmour D.

Mechanistic details of the pausing process, however, are only beginning to be unfurled. Recruitment of P-TEFb phosphorylates pol II and the DSIF complex and releases paused pol II into the productive elongation phase, with the consequent rapid gene induction (Kim and Sharp, 2001Kim J.B. Sharp P.A. Positive transcription elongation factor B phosphorylates hSPT5 and RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain independently of cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase.J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) show paused pol II at their promoters even before stimulation; and the genes undergo rapid activation upon external signals. Recent data indicate that as many as 30% of all genes are regulated by this mechanism, constituting a major pathway by which cellular physiology is altered during development and disease (Nechaev and Adelman, 2011Nechaev S.

Acta. 2011; 1809: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this study, we establish a functional link between chromatin-associated Hsp90 and pausing of pol II. We find that Hsp90 preferentially binds transcription start sites (TSS) that exhibit pol II pausing. Hsp90 controls expression of these target genes by stabilizing NELF complex and thus regulating paused pol II at these loci. We demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of this molecular link in mammalian cells that respond to environmental agents, thus presenting a novel function of this versatile chaperone fundamental to cellular physiology. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using antibodies against Hsp90 in Drosophila melanogaster S2-DRSC cells to map the chromatin-binding sites of this chaperone. We identified around 10,000 binding sites at a high resolution across the genome. About 50% of binding sites or “peaks” coincided with annotated genes, whereas the rest were found in gene-free regions of the genome. A representative example of the chromatin landscape of Hsp90 is shown in Figure 1A . Binding of Hsp90 to these peak regions was sensitive to two structurally distinct Hsp90 inhibitors—radicicol and geldanamycin (Figures 1B and 1C). This confirmed that ATPase activity is required for chromatin association of the chaperone and ruled out technical artifacts in our ChIP experiments. We validated Hsp90 binding by two distinct antibodies (Figure 1B), both of which recognized a single band of the size identical to recombinant pure Hsp90 in western blots of cell extracts (Figure S1A available online). Additionally, there was a high correlation between enrichment of Hsp90 within the peak regions obtained from two biologically independent ChIP-seq experiments (Figures 1A and S1B). Thus, we present here a genome-wide chromatin profile of Hsp90, better defining the subcellular localization of the predominantly cytosolic chaperone.Figure S1Validation of Hsp90 ChIP-Seq, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of S2 cell extract and recombinant Hsp90 purified from E. coli.

In our high-resolution ChIP-seq data, we confirmed a chromatin-based interaction between Trx and Hsp90 reported earlier (Tariq et al., 2009Tariq M. Nussbaumer U. Chen Y. Beisel C. Paro R. Trithorax requires Hsp90 for maintenance of active chromatin at sites of gene expression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Around 80% of the total 5,488 Trx-binding sites were also targeted by Hsp90 with a strong correlation between the enrichment of the two proteins at these co-occupied regions (Figure S1D). Because Hsp90 occupies many more genomic regions than Trx, we sought to find a more general role of Hsp90 in transcription. We assessed this by calculating the average intensity of Hsp90 ChIP signals around 500 bp of TSS. This metagene analysis showed a strong enrichment of Hsp90 near the TSS (Figure 1D). Of the total 9,193 nonoverlapping and unique TSS in the D. melanogaster genome, around 2,384 were targeted by Hsp90, suggesting a role of Hsp90 in transcription of a large fraction of the genome. Target genes included loci encoding transcription factors such as c-Myc (Figure 2A ), signaling proteins like Notch, homeobox-containing proteins (Hox), and loci responsive to external stimuli (Figure S2A ; Table 1). Genes representing important biological processes such as development and stress response were enriched, as judged by gene ontology analysis (Figure S1E).Figure S2Hsp90 Targets Promoters of Coding and Noncoding Genes, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–D) Genome browser views of Traf4 (A), miRNA-278 (B), Hsp26 (C), and Hsp70Ba (D) loci depicting Hsp90 ChIP signal across the respective gene.

Induction of a heat shock factor 1-dependent stress response alters the cytotoxic activity of hsp90-binding agents. Clin. Cancer Res. 6, 3312–3318.Google Scholar), inhibition of Hsp90 led to an upregulation of the hsp70B transcripts (all four isoforms measured together). However, Hsp90 was required for their optimal induction upon heat shock—depletion of Hsp90 activity resulted in a decrease in gene activation. Hsp90 is known to undergo extensive nuclear localization under stressful conditions (Akner et al., 1992Akner, G., Mossberg, K., Sundqvist, K.G., Gustafsson, J.A., and Wikström, A.C. (1992).

There is a large variance in response of genes to radicicol represented by the large scatter of values along the y axis. Nonetheless, the median can still be seen to be higher for Hsp90 target genes compared to all genes at both the indicated time points. Importantly, the statistical estimate of the means shows a very large difference between Hsp90 targets and all genes (Figure S2G). Given that a large proportion of Hsp90 peaks colocalized with TSS of annotated genes, we wondered whether Hsp90-binding sites in nonannotated parts of the genome (Figure 1A) also coincided with transcriptional activity. By a massive amplification of cDNA ends (MACE), in an earlier study we had mapped TSS in S2 cells in gene-free regions of the genome (Enderle et al., 2011Enderle D. Beisel C. Stadler M.B. Gerstung M. Athri P. Paro R. Polycomb preferentially targets stalled promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thirty percent of around 3,000 such TSS from the nonannotated genome overlapped with Hsp90 peaks. Moreover, Hsp90 was also bound to the origins of primary transcripts coding for microRNA (pri-miRNA), two such cases are shown in Figures 2B and S2B. Intriguingly, Hsp90 was bound to the promoter of its own gene, Hsp83 (Figure 2C). Radicicol treatment caused a rapid upregulation of transcription of Hsp83 (Figure 2D), accompanied by elevated nuclear Hsp90 protein levels (Figure S2E), suggesting a feedback control circuit of Hsp90 operating at chromatin. Additionally, Hsp90 also bound promoters of several heat shock loci, and the chaperone was required for their optimal induction (see Figures S2C, S2D, and S2F for further details). The putative function of Hsp90 in the regulation of target promoters was tested by quantifying coding transcripts and pri-miRNA levels upon inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity by radicicol. Many Hsp90 target genes such as c-myc, p53, and Posterior sex combs (Psc) showed altered levels of expression within 30 min of Hsp90 inhibition (Figure 2E). Conversely, most of the Hsp90 nontarget genes did not change their expression (Figure 2E). Among the noncoding targets, treatment with radicicol caused upregulation of three out of four pri-miRNAs tested in this study (Figure 2F). To comprehensively characterize the global repertoire of transcriptional alterations caused by Hsp90 inhibition, we deep sequenced transcriptomes (RNA-seq) of S2 cells exposed to radicicol for 15 min, 30 min, and 1 hr. The short time of Hsp90 inhibition minimized secondary effects caused by modulation of important transcriptional regulators that are themselves Hsp90 targets. At these time points, Hsp90 target genes showed a robust and highly significant upregulation as compared to all the genes in the genome (p value < 7 × 10−7, Wilcoxon test; Figures 2G, S2G, and S2H; Table S1). Taken together, our results identified immediate changes in the transcriptomes of cells caused by an impaired Hsp90 function at promoters of several coding and noncoding genes. What role might Hsp90 play at the TSS of a third of total genes? The upregulation of Hsp90 target genes by radicicol shown by RNA-seq experiments suggests a repressive role of the chaperone. Digital expression data obtained from the same S2-DRSC cell line (Enderle et al., 2011Enderle D. Beisel C. Stadler M.B. Gerstung M. Athri P. Paro R. Polycomb preferentially targets stalled promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), however, correlated only weakly with Hsp90 ChIP signal assessed by enrichment of Hsp90 ChIP over input (Figure 3A ; Spearman coefficient of 0.004), ruling out a simple repressive function. The large set of heat shock loci as Hsp90 targets suggested another possible connection: these loci are kept transcriptionally poised by RNA pol II that is paused immediately downstream of TSS (Gilmour and Lis, 1986Gilmour D.S. Lis J.T. RNA polymerase II interacts with the promoter region of the noninduced hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster cells.Mol. C"
https://openalex.org/W2023571913,"The fluorinated analog of deoxycytidine, Gemcitabine (Gemzar), is the main chemotherapeutic drug in pancreatic cancer, but survival remains weak mainly because of the high resistance of tumors to the drug. Recent works have shown that the mucin MUC4 may confer an advantage to pancreatic tumor cells by modifying their susceptibility to drugs. However, the cellular mechanism(s) responsible for this MUC4-mediated resistance is unknown. The aim of this work was to identify the cellular mechanisms responsible for gemcitabine resistance linked to MUC4 expression. CAPAN-2 and CAPAN-1 adenocarcinomatous pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines were used to establish stable MUC4-deficient clones (MUC4-KD) by shRNA interference. Measurement of the IC50 index using tetrazolium salt test indicated that MUC4-deficient cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine. This was correlated with increased Bax/BclXL ratio and apoptotic cell number. Expression of Equilibrative/Concentrative Nucleoside Transporter (hENT1, hCNT1/3), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1/2) and Multidrug-Resistance Protein (MRP3/4/5) was evaluated by quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) and western blotting. Alteration of MRP3, MRP4, hCNT1 and hCNT3 expression was observed in MUC4-KD cells, but only hCNT1 alteration was correlated to MUC4 expression and sensitivity to gemcitabine. Decreased activation of MAPK, JNK and NF-κB pathways was observed in MUC4-deficient cells, in which the NF-κB pathway was found to have an important role in both sensitivity to gemcitabine and hCNT1 regulation. Finally, and in accordance with our in vitro data, we found that MUC4 expression was conversely correlated to that of hCNT1 in tissues from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This work describes a new mechanism of PC cell resistance to gemcitabine, in which the MUC4 mucin negatively regulates the hCNT1 transporter expression via the NF-κB pathway. Altogether, these data point out to MUC4 and hCNT1 as potential targets to ameliorate the response of pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1984079222,"Autophagy is a catabolic process that allows cellular macromolecules to be broken down and recycled as metabolic precursors. The influence of non-coding microRNAs in autophagy has not been explored in colon cancer. In this study, we discover a novel mechanism of autophagy regulated by hsa-miR-502-5p (miR-502) by suppression of Rab1B, a critical mediator of autophagy. A number of other miR-502 suppressed mRNA targets (for example, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) are also identified by microarray analysis. Ectopic expression of miR-502 inhibited autophagy, colon cancer cell growth and cell-cycle progression of colon cancer cells in vitro. miR-502 also inhibited in-vivo colon cancer growth in a mouse tumor xenografts model. In addition, the expression of miR-502 was regulated by p53 via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. The expression of miR-502 was downregulated in colon cancer patient specimens compared with the paired normal control samples. These results suggest that miR-502 may function as a potential tumor suppressor and therefore be a novel candidate for developing miR-502-based therapeutic strategies."

Concordantly, Fmr1-deficient mice show neural deficits also found in patients with FXS (The Dutch-Belgian Fragile X Consortium, 1994The Dutch-Belgian Fragile X ConsortiumFmr1 knockout mice: a model to study fragile X mental retardation.Cell. 1994; 78: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). However, FMRP target mRNAs and their role in human neurodevelopment are not as well understood. The study of human FMRP function may also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms and neural circuits affected in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are highly comorbid with FXS (Rogers et al., 2001Rogers S.J. Wehner D.E. Hagerman R. The behavioral phenotype in fragile X: symptoms of autism in very young children with fragile X syndrome, idiopathic autism, and other developmental disorders.J. Dev. Behav. Pediatr. 2001; 22: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). ASDs are a group of complex developmental syndromes characterized by impairments in social communication and language development, and repetitive behaviors. Multiple lines of evidence point to the dysfunction of neocortical circuits involved in social, emotional, and language processing in ASDs (Geschwind and Levitt, 2007Geschwind D.H. Levitt P.

Although no overt neuroanatomical alterations have been linked to the autistic brain, there is emerging evidence of abnormal organization of cortical minicolumns (Casanova et al., 2002Casanova M.F.

Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). Whether the molecular mechanisms altered in ASDs are associated with the development of specific human cortical circuits, including minicolumns, remains unknown. Here, we report that FMRP binds human neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1, also known as nNOS) mRNA and increases its translation in the developing neocortex in a species-dependent manner. NOS1 produces the gaseous signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO), which plays important roles in the development and function of the nervous system (Bredt and Snyder, 1994Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Nitric oxide: a physiologic messenger molecule.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, Garthwaite, 2008Garthwaite J. Concepts of neural nitric oxide-mediated transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2783-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Our study of NOS1 posttranscriptional regulation was instigated by our observation of a marked discrepancy between the midfetal human neocortex expression patterns of NOS1 mRNA, which is widespread, and NOS1 protein, which is restricted to layer- and region-specific subpopulations of pyramidal neurons. These include layer 5 (L5) subcortically-projecting neurons with an alternating minicolumnar arrangement in the frontoparietal operculum (FOp). The FOp encompasses the prospective Broca's area and orofacial motor cortex, regions involved in speech production and language comprehension (Keller et al., 2009Keller S.S. Crow T. Foundas A. Amunts K. Roberts N. Broca's area: nomenclature, anatomy, typology and asymmetry.Brain Lang. 2009; 109: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After our screen for RNA-binding proteins revealed that FMRP is abundantly bound to human NOS1 mRNA, we found that FMRP interacts with sequences in the NOS1-coding region that contain G-quartet (GQ) motifs and leads to increased NOS1 protein expression. These motifs are absent from mouse Nos1 mRNA, and replacing the GQ-containing region of human NOS1 with the mouse orthologous sequence abrogates FMRP-dependent activation of translation. Concordantly, neocortical NOS1 protein levels are dramatically reduced in human FXS, but not Fmr1-deficient mice. Thus, we identified a species-dependent posttranscriptional regulation of human NOS1 by FMRP in specific neocortical circuits during column development and synaptogenesis, and showed it to be altered in FXS. The current research stems from our unexpected observation that strong NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity, a reliable histoenzymatic marker of NOS (Dawson et al., 1991Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Fotuhi M. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nitric oxide synthase and neuronal NADPH diaphorase are identical in brain and peripheral tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our comprehensive analysis of pre- and postnatal postmortem brains ranging from 8 postconceptional weeks (PCW) to adulthood identified transient expression of NOS1/NADPH-d in two layer- and region-specific populations of pyramidal neurons with a predominant localization to somata and apical dendrites (Figures 1A–1C ; see Figure S1A available online). Specifically, morphologically immature pyramidal neurons expressing NOS1 were present in the middle of the CP corresponding to the future L5 exclusively in the ventrolateral frontal cortex of the FOp and the dorsal part of the anterior insula starting around 15 PCW. One week later, NOS1+ pyramidal neurons were also found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and adjacent dorsolateral frontoparietal cortex in the upper CP corresponding to the future L2 and L3. NOS1 expression in both of these regions was also temporally regulated. The ACC L2/L3 expression of NOS1 was maintained at high levels throughout the late fetal ages, and decreased during early infancy (Figures 1B and S1A; data not shown). In contrast, L5 expression of NOS1 occurred in two waves. First, the L5 expression was restricted to the FOp, and started at 15 PCW, peaked at 18–20 PCW, and was rapidly downregulated at approximately 23 PCW, after which a small number of NOS1+ pyramidal neurons were present in the ventral part of the anterior insula. Second, sparse pyramidal NOS1 expression was present throughout neocortical L5 in the weeks immediately prior to birth and was progressively downregulated after birth (Figures 1B and S1A; data not shown). Thus, in developing pyramidal neurons, NOS1 expression is precisely regulated, exhibiting temporal, laminar, and regional specificity.Figure S1Spatiotemporal Expression of NOS1 in the Developing Human Neocortex, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) NADPH-d histochemistry (15, 20, and 24 PCW) or NOS1 immunohistochemistry (37 PCW and postnatal day (P) 10) of the human developing ACC and FOp.

Diffuse neuropil labeling, observed in all areas of the neocortical plate at 15 PCW, progressively decreased in the following weeks and persisted at low levels. In the ACC, intense staining of L2/L3 pyramidal neurons started at 15 PCW and persisted continuously until early infancy, when it was downregulated. In the FOp, labeling of L5 pyramidal neuron columns (asterisks) started at 15 PCW, peaked at 18-20 PCW (see also Figure 1A), and was sharply downregulated by 24 PCW. A second wave of L5 pyramidal expression occurred without apparent regional specificity or clear columnar organization in the few weeks immediately prior to birth and was downregulated during early infancy. Therefore, pyramidal NOS1 expression in the developing human neocortex was transient, and layer- and region-dependent.(B) Bilateral distribution of NADPH-d+ pyramidal neurons.

In more caudal sections, their domain shifted dorsally. Sections, both more rostral and caudal, without pyramidal NADPH-d staining were not included in the figure. Further analysis of the midfetal FOp L5 NOS1+ pyramidal neurons revealed that they were arranged vertically into alternating arrays of intensely (NOS1+) and lightly (NOS1−) stained pyramidal neurons (Figures 1A and 1C) resembling previously described ontogenetic columns (Rakic, 1988Rakic P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). In contrast the ACC L2/L3 NOS1+ pyramidal neurons were more densely distributed (Figure 1D; FOp L5, 67.86 ± 5.66 cells per 1,000 μm2; ACC L3, 178.57 ± 27.95 cells per 1,000 μm2; p = 4.12 × 10−5) and lacked this alternating columnar arrangement (Figure 1E; nearest neighbor distance between cell clusters: FOp L5, 27.87 ± 5.26 μm; ACC L3, 15.75 ± 4.68 μm; p = 4.24 × 10−9). In contrast to midgestation, perinatal NOS1+ L5 neurons did not exhibit columnar organization (Figure S1A). Because the FOp is structurally and functionally lateralized (Keller et al., 2009Keller S.S. Crow T. Foundas A. Amunts K. Roberts N. Broca's area: nomenclature, anatomy, typology and asymmetry.Brain Lang. 2009; 109: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we investigated whether L5 NOS1+ columns exhibited left-right asymmetry in two whole midfetal brains (18 and 20 PCW). Serial reconstruction confirmed the two separate domains of NOS1+ pyramidal neurons in the FOp and ACC of both hemispheres (Figures 1F and S1B) and provided approximate total numbers of FOp NOS1+ columns (18 PCW: 41,380; and 20 PCW: 45,150). Although the number of NOS1+ columns was not significantly different between the left and right hemispheres (p = 0.569), the distribution of NOS1+ columns showed an asymmetric trend, peaking more rostrally in the right hemisphere, in both brains. Thus, the columnar organization of NOS1+ neurons in the midfetal FOp L5 is bilaterally present. To molecularly characterize the identity of NOS1+ neurons, we examined their expression of neuronal subtype markers. In the midfetal FOp L5, markers of subcortically-projecting pyramidal neurons, BCL11B (CTIP2) and FEZF2 (FEZL, ZFP312) (Chen et al., 2005Chen J.G. Rasin M.R. Kwan K.Y. Sestan N.

NOS1+ neurons also coexpressed FOXP2 (Figure 2E), a gene altered in a developmental disorder characterized by impaired speech and linguistic deficits (Lai et al., 2001Lai C.S. Fisher S.E. Hurst J.A.

In contrast, SATB2, a marker of upper-layer corticocortical pyramidal neurons (Britanova et al., 2008Britanova O. de Juan Romero C. Cheung A. Kwan K.Y. Schwark M. Gyorgy A. Vogel T. Akopov S.

Consistent with this, we observed vimentin (VIM)-positive radial glial fibers in between but not within NOS1+ columns (Figure S2A ). This suggests that glial-guided migration of upper-layer neurons occurs via corridors formed between L5 neuronal columns. In the ACC, all L2/L3 NOS1+ neurons coexpressed SATB2 (Figure S2B), confirming their upper-layer identity and distinction from the FOp L5 NOS1+ neurons.Figure S2Analysis of NOS1+ Neurons in the Human Midfetal Neocortex by Immunofluorescent Staining and Immuno-EM, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Immunofluorescent staining for NOS1 (green), vimentin (VIM, red), and DAPI (blue) in L5 of 20 PCW human FOp.

https://openalex.org/W2080085175,"Autophagy is a conserved, self-digestion process that is activated in response to nutrient limitation but acting also as an alternative death mechanism under certain conditions. It is accompanied by the progressive formation of vesicle structures from autophagosomes to autophagolysosomes orchestrated by autophagy effectors (Atg proteins) and modulators (that is, mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin as a negative regulator). Malignant gliomas are highly resistant to current therapies that induce apoptosis, thus induction of the alternative cell death is an attractive strategy. We demonstrate that cyclosporine A (CsA, an immunophilin/calcineurin inhibitor) induces cell death with some apoptotic features but also accompanied by the appearance of numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles, immunostained for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and autophagy markers. The induction of ER stress in glioma cells by CsA was evidenced by detection of unfolded protein response activation (phosphorylation of PERK, accumulation of IRE1α) and accumulation of ER stress-associated proteins (BIP and CHOP). Formation of the acidic vesicular organelles, increase of autophagic vacuoles, GFP-LC3 punctation (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) and LC3-II accumulation upon CsA treatment confirmed activation of autophagy. Decrease of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, p70S6K1 and its downstream target S6 ribosomal protein demonstrate inhibition of mTOR signaling by CsA. Salubrinal and silencing of PERK and IRE1α partially blocked CsA-induced accumulation of LC3-II. It suggests that ER stress precedes CsA-induced autophagy. Surprisingly, silencing of autophagy effectors ULK1, Atg5 or Atg7 increased the level of active caspases 3, 7 and PARP degradation in CsA-treated cells. Our results demonstrate that CsA induces both apoptosis and autophagy in malignant glioma cells via induction of ER stress and inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway, however autophagy is cytoprotective in this context."
https://openalex.org/W2040693319,"Despite the clear major contribution of hyperlipidemia to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the developed world, the direct effects of lipoproteins on endothelial cells have remained obscure and are under debate. Here we report a previously uncharacterized mechanism of vessel growth modulation by lipoprotein availability. Using a genetic screen for vascular defects in zebrafish, we initially identified a mutation, stalactite (stl), in the gene encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (mtp), which is involved in the biosynthesis of apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins. By manipulating lipoprotein concentrations in zebrafish, we found that ApoB negatively regulates angiogenesis and that it is the ApoB protein particle, rather than lipid moieties within ApoB-containing lipoproteins, that is primarily responsible for this effect. Mechanistically, we identified downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), which acts as a decoy receptor for VEGF, as a key mediator of the endothelial response to lipoproteins, and we observed VEGFR1 downregulation in hyperlipidemic mice. These findings may open new avenues for the treatment of lipoprotein-related vascular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1975153105,"Cdt1, a protein critical for replication origin licensing in G1 phase, is degraded during S phase but re-accumulates in G2 phase. We now demonstrate that human Cdt1 has a separable essential mitotic function. Cdt1 localizes to kinetochores during mitosis through interaction with the Hec1 component of the Ndc80 complex. G2-specific depletion of Cdt1 arrests cells in late prometaphase owing to abnormally unstable kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachments and Mad1-dependent spindle-assembly-checkpoint activity. Cdt1 binds a unique loop extending from the rod domain of Hec1 that we show is also required for kMT attachment. Mutation of the loop domain prevents Cdt1 kinetochore localization and arrests cells in prometaphase. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy indicates that Cdt1 binding to the Hec1 loop domain promotes a microtubule-dependent conformational change in the Ndc80 complex in vivo. These results support the conclusion that Cdt1 binding to Hec1 is essential for an extended Ndc80 configuration and stable kMT attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1992454248,"Chromosome 1p36.23 is frequently deleted in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). miR-34a localizes in this region. Our experiments found that miR-34a was often deleted and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was frequently amplified in genomic DNA of 55 GBMs using single-nucleotide polymorphism DNA microarray. Notably, we found that the mean survival time was significantly shortened for patients whose GBMs had both EGFR amplification and miR-34a deletion. Expression of miR-34a was significantly lower in GBM samples compared with normal brain tissue. Forced expression of miR-34a in GBM cells decreased their ability to migrate and profoundly decreased their levels of cyclin-A1, -B1, -D1, and -D3, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase and increased expression of cyclin kinase inhibitor proteins (p21, p27). Also, human GBM cells (U251) stable overexpressing mir-34a formed smaller tumors when growing as xenografts in immunodeficient mice compared with wild-type U251 GBM cells. Furthermore, the protein expression of EGFR decreased in the cells with forced overexpression of miR-34a. Additional studies showed that mir-34a targeted Yin Yang-1 (YY1) and YY1 is a transcription factor that can stimulate the expression of EGFR. Thus, our data suggest that miR-34a acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting growth of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo associated with moderating the expression of cell-cycle proteins and EGFR. Moreover, we discovered for the first time that both deletion of miR-34a and amplification of EGFR were associated with significantly decreased overall survival of GBM patients."

The canonical inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase subunit β (IKK-β)–nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-κB1) pathway has been well documented to promote insulin resistance; however, the noncanonical NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)–NF-κB2 pathway is not well understood in obesity. Additionally, the contribution of counter-regulatory hormones, particularly glucagon, to hyperglycemia in obesity is unclear. Here we show that NIK promotes glucagon responses in obesity. Hepatic NIK was abnormally activated in mice with dietary or genetic obesity. Systemic deletion of Map3k14, encoding NIK, resulted in reduced glucagon responses and hepatic glucose production (HGP). Obesity is associated with high glucagon responses, and liver-specific inhibition of NIK led to lower glucagon responses and HGP and protected against hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in obese mice. Conversely, hepatocyte-specific overexpression of NIK resulted in higher glucagon responses and HGP. In isolated mouse livers and primary hepatocytes, NIK also promoted glucagon action and glucose production, at least in part by increasing cAMP response element-binding (CREB) stability. Therefore, overactivation of liver NIK in obesity promotes hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance by increasing the hyperglycemic response to glucagon and other factors that activate CREB."
https://openalex.org/W2052562816,"A main obstacle to overcome during the treatment of tumors is drug resistance to chemotherapy; emerging studies indicate that a key factor contributing to this problem is the acidic tumor microenvironment. Here, we found that LASS2 expression was significantly lower in drug-resistant Michigan Cancer Foundation-7/adriamycin (MCF-7/ADR) human breast cancer cells than the drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells, and low expression of LASS2 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Our results showed that the overexpression of LASS2 in MCF-7/ADR cells increased the chemosensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin (Dox), whereas LASS2 knockdown in MCF-7 cells decreased the chemosensitivity. Cell-cycle analysis revealed a corresponding increase in apoptosis in the LASS2-overexpressing cells following Dox exposure, showing that the overexpression of LASS2 increased the susceptibility to Dox cytotoxicity. This effect was mediated by a significant increase in pHe (extracellular pH) and lysosomal pH, and more Dox entered the cells and stayed in the nuclei of cells. In nude mice, the combination of LASS2 overexpression and Dox significantly inhibited the growth of xenografts. Our findings suggest that LASS2 is involved in chemotherapeutic outcomes and low LASS2 expression may predict chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W2166635906,"Understanding color vision requires knowing how signals from the three classes of cone photoreceptor are combined in the cortex. We recorded from individual neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys while an automated, closed-loop system identified stimuli that differed in cone contrast but evoked the same response. We found that isoresponse surfaces for half the neurons were planar, which is consistent with linear processing. The remaining isoresponse surfaces were nonplanar. Some were cup-shaped, indicating sensitivity to only a narrow region of color space. Others were ellipsoidal, indicating sensitivity to all color directions. The major and minor axes of these nonplanar surfaces were often aligned to a set of three color directions that were previously identified in perceptual experiments. These results suggest that many V1 neurons combine cone signals nonlinearly and provide a new framework in which to decipher color processing in V1."

The impact of acetylation on other cellular functions remains relatively uncharacterized. We explored the budding yeast acetylome with a functional genomics approach, assessing the effects of gene overexpression in the absence of lysine deacetylases (KDACs). We generated a network of 463 synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) interactions involving class I and II KDACs, revealing many cellular pathways regulated by different KDACs. A biochemical survey of genes interacting with the KDAC RPD3 identified 72 proteins acetylated in vivo. In-depth analysis of one of these proteins, Swi4, revealed a role for acetylation in G1-specific gene expression. Acetylation of Swi4 regulates interaction with its partner Swi6, both components of the SBF transcription factor. This study expands our view of the yeast acetylome, demonstrates the utility of functional genomic screens for exploring enzymatic pathways, and provides functional information that can be mined for future studies.

Class I includes Rpd3, Hos1, and Hos2, and class II contains Hda1 and Hos3; these two classes are zinc-dependent KDACs. Class III enzymes, the sirtuins, use NAD+ as a cofactor for the deacetylase reaction (Shore, 2000Shore D. The Sir2 protein family: A novel deacetylase for gene silencing and more.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Rpd3 exists in two large macromolecular complexes, Rpd3(L) and Rpd3(S), which share the core subunits Rpd3, Sin3, and Ume1 (Carrozza et al., 2005Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T.

Hda1 forms a heterotetrameric complex with two regulatory subunits, Hda2 and Hda3 (Wu et al., 2001Wu J. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Suka N. Grunstein M. HDA2 and HDA3 are related proteins that interact with and are essential for the activity of the yeast histone deacetylase HDA1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The HDA complex coregulates some genes with Rpd3, but also influences expression of a distinct group of genes (Bernstein et al., 2000Bernstein B.E.

Although loss of either RPD3 or HDA1 is tolerated, deletion of both KDACs results in cell death (Lin et al., 2008Lin Y.Y. Qi Y. Lu J.Y. Pan X. Yuan D.S. Zhao Y. Bader J.S. Boeke J.D.

USA. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The other class I and II KDACs have received much less scrutiny. Hos2 appears to activate gene expression by restoring RNA polymerase-disrupted chromatin to a permissive state (Wang et al., 2002Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast.Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Hos3 is the only class I/II KDAC that is insensitive to Tricostatin-A (TSA), an inhibitor of deacetylases (Carmen et al., 1999Carmen A.A. Griffin P.R. Calaycay J.R. Rundlett S.E. Suka Y. Grunstein M.

In the past decade, acetylation has been shown to regulate proteins other than histones (Glozak et al., 2005Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E.

The genomic tools available in yeast provide an opportunity to systematically explore the acetylome and add functional information to our view of KAT/KDAC regulation. For example, synthetic genetic array (SGA) technology automates the analysis of genetic interactions in yeast and has been used to extensively map interactions between deletion alleles of nonessential genes (Baryshnikova et al., 2010Baryshnikova A.

Charting the genetic interaction map of a cell.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). SGA has also been used to systematically assess synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) interactions (Sopko et al., 2006aSopko R. Huang D. Preston N. Chua G. Papp B. Kafadar K. Snyder M. Oliver S.G. Cyert M. Hughes T.R. et al.Mapping pathways and phenotypes by systematic gene overexpression.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). SDL interactions result when increased gene expression levels have little effect on the growth of a wild-type cell but produce a clear phenotype, such as lethality, in a specific mutant background (Kroll et al., 1996Kroll E.S.

Hyperactivation of an opposing biological pathway or perturbation of protein complex stoichiometry may also result in SDL (Sopko et al., 2006bSopko R. Papp B. Oliver S.G. Andrews B.J. Phenotypic activation to discover biological pathways and kinase substrates.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1397-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and this can facilitate identification of new connections to a specific biological process (Measday et al., 2005Measday V.

Cheng B. et al.Systematic yeast synthetic lethal and synthetic dosage lethal screens identify genes required for chromosome segregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the SDL interaction network for class I and II KDACs in yeast. Analysis of the network, combined with secondary biochemical tests, has allowed us to extend the list of acetylated proteins in yeast nearly 5-fold. To demonstrate the utility of this resource, we characterized one potential KDAC target identified in our rpd3Δ SDL screen in detail. Acetylation of the cell-cycle transcription factor Swi4 regulates its function in vivo, uncovering a new aspect of G1 transcription control in yeast. Our study expands the view of KDAC function and provides a valuable resource for predicting functional relationships in pathways regulated by KDACs. In addition, the data set captures functional information that cannot be revealed by biochemical surveys of the proteome. To perform whole-genome SDL screens, we introduced deletions of genes encoding class I and II KDACs into an arrayed collection of yeast strains, each conditionally overexpressing a unique gene (Sopko et al., 2006aSopko R. Huang D. Preston N. Chua G. Papp B. Kafadar K. Snyder M. Oliver S.G. Cyert M. Hughes T.R. et al.Mapping pathways and phenotypes by systematic gene overexpression.Mol.

Overexpression phenotypes were measured with automated software using colony size as a proxy for cell fitness, an approach that we have validated in other large-scale genetic interaction screens (Baryshnikova et al., 2010Baryshnikova A.

Genes whose overexpression resulted in a colony size reduction of > 20% compared to wild-type were independently confirmed (Figure S1 available online). A subset of interactions was confirmed in the presence of the KDAC inhibitor, TSA, showing that SDL interactions can result due to the loss of KDAC catalytic activity (Table S1). Our screens identified 463 SDL interactions (Figure 1A and Table S2) involving 374 unique genes, enriched for diverse processes including cell polarity and morphogenesis, protein sorting to the Golgi, endosome and vacuole, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, peroxisome biogenesis, and drug/ion transport (Table 1). The SDL network includes genes encoding members of protein complexes (Figure 1A, black lines) and components of common pathways (Figure 1A, red lines), suggesting that acetylation may target protein complexes as well as coregulate many pathways, consistent with observations made in human acetylome studies (Choudhary et al., 2009Choudhary C.

See also Figure S1 and Tables S1–S4. Deletion of either RPD3 or HDA1 caused a significant fitness defect in standard conditions, and our screens in rpd3Δ and hda1Δ mutants produced the highest number of SDL interactions among KDAC mutants (244 and 168 interactions, respectively), consistent with other large-scale experiments showing an inverse relationship between degree of genetic interaction and fitness of a mutant strain (Costanzo et al., 2010Costanzo M. Baryshnikova A. Bellay J. Kim Y. Spear E.D. Sevier C.S. Ding H. Koh J.L. Toufighi K. Mostafavi S. et al.The genetic landscape of a cell.Science. 2010; 327: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Because Rpd3 and Hda1 regulate a number of common genes (Bernstein et al., 2000Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Genomewide studies of histone deacetylase function in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), we expected some overlap between the interactions in the rpd3Δ and hda1Δ screens. Indeed, 57 SDL interactions were shared between the two KDACs (∼34% of HDA1 and ∼23% of RPD3 interactions [p < 2.54 × 10−34]). Consistent with significant nonoverlapping roles for each KDAC, the majority of SDL interactions appear to be unique to each deacetylase (Figure 1A). The SDL hits in each KDAC screen were enriched for distinct biological processes (Table S3), a property also observed in experiments assessing chromatin acetylation in the absence of KDACs (Robyr et al., 2002Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Microarray deacetylation maps determine genome-wide functions for yeast histone deacetylases.Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Given that KDACs regulate transcription through deacetylation of histones, a subset of SDL interactions may result from aberrant transcription in the absence of KDACs. For example, in some cases, overexpression of the gene from the GAL promoter together with the overexpression of the endogenous copy of the same gene due to histone hyperacetylation might lead to protein levels that are high enough to cause toxicity. To address this point, we compared our KDAC-SDL profiles to the gene expression profiles of rpd3Δ and hda1Δ mutants (Bernstein et al., 2000Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Genomewide studies of histone deacetylase function in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Less than 4% of the genes that caused toxicity when overexpressed (12/244 genes in rpd3Δ and 6/168 genes in hda1Δ) were differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in the absence of the KDAC (Bernstein et al., 2000Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Genomewide studies of histone deacetylase function in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar; Table S4, 2-fold cut-off]. Furthermore, SDL interactors of RPD3 and genes transcriptionally regulated by Rpd3 were enriched for distinct biological processes (Figures 1B and 1C). These results suggest that most SDL interactions do not reflect indirect effects resulting from defects in gene expression caused by the deletion of KDACs. Negative genetic interactions, such as synthetic sickness (SS) or lethality (SL), occur when the observed fitness of a double mutant is more severe than expected, given the fitness of the two single mutants (Mani et al., 2008Mani R. St. Onge R.P. Hartman J.L.t. Giaever G. Roth F.P. Defining genetic interaction.Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3461-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Our published SL/SS data set (Costanzo et al., 2010Costanzo M. Baryshnikova A. Bellay J. Kim Y. Spear E.D. Sevier C.S. Ding H. Koh J.L. Toufighi K. Mostafavi S. et al.The genetic landscape of a cell.Science. 2010; 327: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar) includes 497 unique negative genetic interactions involving deletion alleles of class I and II KDACs. Of the 463 genes that were SDL in the absence of a KDAC, 14 were also SS/SL with the same KDAC (Table S5). Seven of these encode components of multiprotein complexes, consistent with the prediction that perturbation of stoichiometry gives rise to haploinsufficient phenotypes (Veitia, 2002Veitia R.A. Exploring the etiology of haploinsufficiency.Bioessays. 2002; 24: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For example, Hda1 functions in a tetrameric complex (Carmen et al., 1996Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. HDA1 and HDA3 are components of a yeast histone deacetylase (HDA) complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2001Wu J. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Suka N. Grunstein M.

USA. 2001; 98: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and either overexpression or deletion of HDA1 caused lethality in the absence of RPD3; overexpression of HDA1 may mimic the deletion phenotype by disrupting HDA complex stoichiometry (Pap"
https://openalex.org/W2085507259,"The authors studied AMPAR-mediated currents in cerebellar stellate cells from stargazer mice, which lack the prototypical TARP stargazin (γ-2). They report that calcium-permeable AMPARS can localize at synapses in the absence of stargazin; moreover, mEPSCs mediated by TARPless AMPARs were also detected in these cells following knockdown of their only other TARP, γ-7. Dynamic regulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) is important for normal synaptic transmission, plasticity and pathological changes. Although the involvement of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) in trafficking of calcium-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs) has been extensively studied, their role in the surface expression and function of CP-AMPARs remains unclear. We examined AMPAR-mediated currents in cerebellar stellate cells from stargazer mice, which lack the prototypical TARP stargazin (γ-2). We found a marked increase in the contribution of CP-AMPARs to synaptic responses, indicating that, unlike CI-AMPARs, these can localize at synapses in the absence of γ-2. In contrast with CP-AMPARs in extrasynaptic regions, synaptic CP-AMPARs displayed an unexpectedly low channel conductance and strong block by intracellular spermine, suggesting that they were 'TARPless'. As a proof of principle that TARP association is not an absolute requirement for AMPAR clustering at synapses, miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by TARPless AMPARs were readily detected in stargazer granule cells following knockdown of their only other TARP, γ-7."
https://openalex.org/W2117484287,"CrkL is a key signaling protein that mediates the leukemogenic activity of Bcr-Abl. CrkL is thought to adopt a structure that is similar to that of its CrkII homolog. The two proteins share high sequence identity and indistinguishable ligand binding preferences, yet they have distinct physiological roles. Here we show that the structures of CrkL and phosphorylated CrkL are markedly different than the corresponding structures of CrkII. As a result, the binding activities of the Src homology 2 and Src homology 3 domains in the two proteins are regulated in a distinct manner and to a different extent. The different structural architecture of CrkL and CrkII may account for their distinct functional roles. The data show that CrkL forms a constitutive complex with Abl, thus explaining the strong preference of Bcr-Abl for CrkL. The results also highlight how the structural organization of the modular domains in adaptor proteins can control signaling outcome."

In this study, we report that the proinflammatory cytokine prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces the malignant SN12C, but not benign HK2 kidney cell invasion. The PGE2 increases SN12C cell invasion through a signal pathway that encompasses EP2 and EP4, Akt, small GTPase RalA and Ral·GTP inactivator RGC2. The results support the idea that targeted interference of EP2/EP4 signal to RalA·GTP may provide benefit to patients diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021257306,"Emerging evidence demonstrates that RUNX3 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Inactivation of RUNX3 in mice results in spontaneous mammary gland tumors, and decreased or silenced expression of RUNX3 is frequently found in breast cancer cell lines and human breast cancer samples. However, the underlying mechanism for initiating RUNX3 inactivation in breast cancer remains elusive. Here, we identify prolyl isomerase Pin1, which is often overexpressed in breast cancer, as a key regulator of RUNX3 inactivation. In human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer samples, expression of Pin1 inversely correlates with the expression of RUNX3. In addition, Pin1 recognizes four phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in RUNX3 via its WW domain. Binding of Pin1 to RUNX3 suppresses the transcriptional activity of RUNX3. Furthermore, Pin1 reduces the cellular levels of RUNX3 in an isomerase activity-dependent manner by inducing the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RUNX3. Knocking down Pin1 enhances the cellular levels and transcriptional activity of RUNX3 by inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of RUNX3. Our results identify Pin1 as a new regulator of RUNX3 inactivation in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1991286391,"The genesis and unique properties of the lymphovascular tumor embolus are poorly understood largely because of the absence of an experimental model that specifically reflects this important step of tumor progression. The lymphovascular tumor embolus is a blastocyst-like structure resistant to chemotherapy, efficient at metastasis and overexpressing E-cadherin (E-cad). Conventional dogma has regarded E-cad as a metastasis-suppressor gene involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, within the lymphovascular embolus, E-cad and its proteolytic processing by calpain and other proteases have a dominant oncogenic rather than suppressive role in metastasis formation and tumor cell survival. Studies using a human xenograft model of inflammatory breast cancer, MARY-X, demonstrated the equivalence of xenograft-generated spheroids with lymphovascular emboli in vivo with both structures demonstrating E-cad overexpression and specific proteolytic processing. Western blot revealed full-length (FL) E-cad (120 kDa) and four fragments: E-cad/NTF1 (100 kDa), E-cad/NTF2 (95 kDa), E-cad/NTF3 (85 kDa) and E-cad/NTF4 (80 kDa). Compared with MARY-X, only E-cad/NTF1 was present in the spheroids. E-cad/NTF1 was produced by calpain, E-cad/NTF2 by γ-secretase and E-cad/NTF3 by a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). Spheroidgenesis and lymphovascular emboli formation are the direct result of calpain-mediated cleavage of E-cad and the generation of E-cad/NTF1 from membrane-associated E-cad rather than the de novo presence of either E-cad/NTF1 or E-cad/CTF1. E-cad/NTF1 retained the p120ctn-binding site but lost both the β-catenin and α-binding sites, facilitating its disassembly from traditional cadherin-based adherens junctions and its 360° distribution around the embolus. This calpain-mediated proteolysis of E-cad generates the formation of the lymphovascular embolus and is responsible for its unique properties of increased homotypic adhesion, apoptosis resistance and budding."
https://openalex.org/W2035394214,"B-cell leukemia 3 (Bcl-3) is a member of the inhibitor of κB family, which regulates a wide range of biological processes by functioning as a transcriptional activator or as a repressor of target genes. As high levels of Bcl-3 expression and activation have been detected in different types of human cancer, Bcl-3 has been labeled a proto-oncogene. Our study uncovered a markedly upregulated Bcl-3 expression in human prostate cancer (PCa), where inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Elevated Bcl-3 expression in PCa was dependent on the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6-mediated STAT3 activation. Microarray analyses, using Bcl-3 knockdown in PCa cells, identified the inhibitor of DNA-binding (Id) family of helix-loop-helix proteins as potential Bcl-3-regulated genes. Bcl-3 knockdown reduced the abundance of Id-1 and Id-2 proteins and boosted PCa cells to be more receptive to undergoing apoptosis following treatment with anticancer drug. Our data imply that inactivation of Bcl-3 may lead to sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy in PCa treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2155558486,"Inactivation of the LIM-homeodomain 2 gene (Lhx2) results in a severe defect in specification of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). However, the ramifications of lack of Lhx2-dependent OSN specification for formation of the primary olfactory pathway have not been addressed, since mutant mice die in utero. We have analyzed prenatal and postnatal consequences of conditionally inactivating Lhx2 selectively in OSNs. A cell-autonomous effect is that OSN axons cannot innervate their target, the olfactory bulb. Moreover, the lack of Lhx2 in OSNs causes unpredicted, non-cell-autonomous phenotypes. First, the olfactory bulb shows pronounced hypoplasia in adults, and the data suggest that innervation by correctly specified OSNs is necessary for adult bulb size and organization. Second, absence of an olfactory nerve in the conditional mutant reveals that the vomeronasal nerve is dependent on olfactory nerve formation. Third, the lack of a proper vomeronasal nerve prevents migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cells the whole distance to their final positions in the hypothalamus during embryo development. As adults, the conditional mutants do not pass puberty, and these findings support the view of an exclusive nasal origin of GnRH neurons in the mouse. Thus, Lhx2 in OSNs is required for functional development of three separate systems.—Berghard, A., Hägglund, A.-C., Bohm, S., and Carlsson, L.

https://openalex.org/W2017197065,"The role of adhesion-associated actin-binding proteins in cell migration is not well defined. In mouse fibroblasts we screened for focal adhesion-associated proteins that were isolated with collagen-coated beads and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. We identified flightless I (FliI) as an actin-binding protein in focal adhesion fractions, which was verified by immunoblotting. By confocal microscopy most FliI was distributed throughout the cytosol and in focal adhesions. By sedimentation assays and in vitro binding assays, we found that FliI associates with actin filaments and actin monomers. Assays using purified proteins showed that FliI inhibits actin polymerization and caps but does not sever actin filaments. Cells with FliI knockdown or cells overexpressing FliI migrated more or less rapidly, respectively, than wild-type controls. Compared with controls, cells with FliI knockdown were less adherent than wild-type cells, exhibited reduced numbers of focal adhesions containing activated β1 integrins and vinculin, and exhibited increased incorporation of actin monomers into nascent filaments at focal adhesions. These data indicate that FliI regulates cell migration through its localization to focal adhesions and its ability to cap actin filaments, which collectively affect focal adhesion maturation.—Mohammad, I., Arora, P.

https://openalex.org/W2082701553,"Lethal giant larvae proteins have key roles in regulating polarity in a variety of cell types and function as tumour suppressors. A transcriptional programme initiated by aberrant Snail expression transforms epithelial cells to potentially aggressive cancer cells. Although progress in defining the molecular determinants of this programme has been made, we have little knowledge as to how the Snail-induced phenotype can be suppressed. In our studies we identified the human lethal giant larvae homologue 2, Hugl-2, (Llgl2/Lgl2) polarity gene as downregulated by Snail. Snail binds E-boxes in the Hugl-2 promoter and represses Hugl-2 expression, whereas removal of the E-boxes releases Hugl-2 from Snail repression. We demonstrate that inducing Hugl-2 in cells with constitutive Snail expression reverses the phenotype including changes in morphology, motility, tumour growth and dissemination in vivo, and expression of epithelial markers. Hugl-2 expression reduced the nuclear localization of Snail and thus binding of Snail to its target promoters. Our results placing Hugl-2 within the Snail network as well as its ability to suppress Snail carcinogenesis identifies Hugl-2 as a target molecule driving cascades, which may have preventative and therapeutic promise to minimize cancer progression."
