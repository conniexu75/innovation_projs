https://openalex.org/W2061344417,"Clinical observations show that there is considerable individual variability in the response to the addictive properties of drugs. This individual variability needs to be taken into account in animal models of addiction. Like humans, only some rats readily self-administer low doses of psychostimulants. The individual animals at risk can be identified on the basis of their response to environmental or pharmacological challenges. This predisposition to develop self-administration can be induced by repeated treatment with amphetamine. These results may help elucidate the neurobiological basis of addiction liability observed in both rats and humans."

Vesicle size, surface charge, or permeability can be readily adjusted by varying the ratio of anionic to cationic surfactant. Vesicle formation apparently results from the production of anion-cation surfactant pairs that then act as double-tailed zwitterionic surfactants. These vesicles are quite stable in comparison to conventional vesicles prepared by mechanical disruption of insoluble liquid crystalline dispersions."
https://openalex.org/W2078254067,"Interaction of antigen in the proper histocompatibility context with the T lymphocyte antigen receptor leads to an orderly series of events resulting in morphologic change, proliferation, and the acquisition of immunologic function. In most T lymphocytes two signals are required to initiate this process, one supplied by the antigen receptor and the other by accessory cells or agents that activate protein kinase C. Recently, DNA sequences have been identified that act as response elements for one or the other of the two signals, but do not respond to both signals. The fact that these sequences lie within the control regions of the same genes suggests that signals originating from separate cell membrane receptors are integrated at the level of the responsive gene. The view is put forth that these signals initiate a contingent series of gene activations that bring about proliferation and impart immunologic function."

Council (NRC) Committee on the Mapping and Sequencing
of the Human Genome, on which the present authors
served, recommended a staged mapping and sequencing project
with early emphases on physical mapping of human DNA, mapping and sequencing of the genomes of model organisms, and the development of sequencing technology (1). As the Committee's recommendations on physical mapping are beginning to be implemented on a substantial scale, it is timely to review these recommendations in the light of recent technical advances. In particular, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (2), a method that has only come
into widespread use during the past 2 years, seems to us to offer a path toward a physical map that largely circumvents two problems that were prominent in the NRC Committee's discussions. One of these was the difficulty of merging mapping data gathered by diverse methods in different laboratories into a consensus physical map. The second was the logistics and expense of managing the huge collections
of cloned segments on which the mapping data would depend
almost absolutely."

https://openalex.org/W2000946764,"Both interleukin-1 (IL-1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induce proliferation of cultured fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. These polypeptide mediators are released by activated macrophages and other cell types in response to injury and are thought to have a role in tissue remodeling and a number of pathologic processes. Analysis of the kinetics of [3H]thymidine incorporation by cultured fibroblasts demonstrated that the response to IL-1 is delayed approximately 8 hours relative to their response to PDGF. IL-1 transiently stimulated expression of the PDGF A-chain gene, with maximum induction after approximately 2 hours. Subsequent synthesis and release of PDGF activity into the medium was detected as early as 4 hours after IL-1 stimulation, and downregulation of the binding site for the PDGF-AA isoform of PDGF followed PDGF-AA secretion. Antibodies to PDGF completely block the mitogenic response to IL-1. Therefore, the mitogenic activity of IL-1 for fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells appears to be indirect and mediated by induction of the PDGF A-chain gene."

https://openalex.org/W2008213128,"The CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus contain a high density of adrenal corticosteroid receptors. By intracellular recording, CA1 neurons in slices from adrenalectomized rats have been found to display a markedly reduced afterhyperpolarization (that is, the hyperpolarizing phase after a brief depolarizing current pulse) when compared with their sham controls. No differences were found for other tested membrane properties. Brief exposure of hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized rats to glucocorticoid agonists, 30 to 90 minutes before recording, greatly enhanced the afterhyperpolarization. In addition, glucocorticoids attenuated the norepinephrine-induced blockade of action potential accommodation in CA1 neurons. The findings indicate that glucocorticoids can reduce transmitter-evoked excitability in the hippocampus, presumably via a receptor-mediated genomic action."
https://openalex.org/W2039308050,"Embryos of the shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus are remarkably resistant to infection by the fungus Lagenidium callinectes, a recognized pathogen of many crustaceans. An Alteromonas sp. bacterial strain consistently isolated from the surface of the embryos, produces 2,3-indolinedione (isatin), a compound that inhibits the pathogenic fungus. If exposed to the fungus, bacteria-free embryos quickly die, whereas similar embryos reinoculated with the bacteria or treated only with 2,3-indolinedione live well. The commensal Alteromonas sp. bacteria protect shrimp embryos from fungal infection by producing and liberating the antifungal metabolite 2,3-indolinedione."
https://openalex.org/W1555351713,"Abstract Ca2+ mobilization by hormones, ionomycin, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) were studied to determine whether Ca2+ release is a continuous or a quantal process. Hormone-mediated Ca2+ release occurs only during the first 2-4 s of stimulation. Stimulation of acini with a maximal hormone concentration following stimulation with a submaximal concentration resulted in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) increase and 45Ca efflux. The peak [Ca2+]i increase induced by a maximal concentration of agonist was nearly constant when cells were prestimulated with a submaximal dose for 1-15 min. Submaximal hormone concentrations release only a fraction of intracellular 45Ca2+, after which intracellular Ca2+ content remains constant. The partially released stores remain depleted until cell stimulation is terminated, at which time the stores reload with Ca2+. For comparison, increasing concentrations of ionomycin resulted in increasing rates of Ca2+ release. Each ionomycin concentration released all the Ca2+ from intracellular stores. We therefore conclude that hormone-evoked Ca2+ release is a quantal rather than a continuous process. In permeabilized cells, increasing concentrations of Ins-1,4,5-P3 resulted in an increased fraction of Ca2+ release. No submaximal Ins-1,4,5-P3 concentration was capable of releasing all the Ins-1,4,5-P3-mobilizable Ca2+. Therefore, it appears that the quantal properties of hormone-evoked Ca2+ release reflect the quantal properties of Ins-1,4,5-P3-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores."
https://openalex.org/W1532146312,"Ascorbic acid stimulates collagen gene expression in cultural fibroblasts (Lyons, B. L., and Schwartz, R. L. (1984) Nucleic Acids Res. 12, 2569-2579), but the mechanisms responsible for this effect are poorly understood. In the presence of the transitional metal iron, ascorbic acid could induce lipid peroxidation with the formation of reactive aldehydes. Since another aldehyde, acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, also stimulates collagen transcription in cultured fibroblasts (Brenner, D. A., and Chojkier, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem 262, 17690-17696), we investigated whether ascorbic acid induces lipid peroxidation in cultured cells and if this is the mechanism by which ascorbic acid stimulates collagen gene expression. Ascorbic acid (0.2 mM) induced lipid peroxidation in cultured human fibroblasts judging by the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and carbonyl groups, and by the presence of malondialdehyde- and 4-hydroxynonenal-protein adducts. Ascorbic acid stimulated (2-3-fold) the net production of collagen relative to total proteins, the levels of procollagen alpha 1 (I) mRNA and the transcription of this gene. Inhibition of the ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation in cultured human fibroblasts with alpha-tocopherol (50 microM) or methylene blue (10 microM) prevented the stimulation of collagen gene expression. The addition of malondialdehyde (200 microM), a product of lipid peroxidation, to cultured human fibroblasts also increased 2-3-fold collagen production and procollagen alpha 1 (I) mRNA levels. Thus, ascorbic acid induces lipid peroxidation and reactive aldehydes and this step may be necessary for the stimulation of collagen gene expression by ascorbic acid in cultured human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2002264389,"Adrenal steroids bind specifically to hippocampal neurons under normal conditions and may contribute to hippocampal cell loss during aging, but little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms by which they may change hippocampal cell functions. In the present studies, adrenal steroids have been shown to modulate a well-defined membrane conductance in hippocampal pyramidal cells. The calcium-dependent slow afterhyperpolarization is reduced in hippocampal slices from adrenalectomized rats, and it is increased after in vivo or in vitro administration of the adrenal steroid, corticosterone. Calcium action potentials are also reduced in adrenalectomized animals, indicating that the primary effect of corticosteroids may be on calcium conductance. The afterhyperpolarization component reduced by adrenalectomy is greater in aged rats than in young rats, suggesting that, with aging, there is an increased effect of corticosteroids on some calcium-mediated brain processes. Because elevated concentrations of intracellular calcium can be cytotoxic, these observations may increase the understanding of glucocorticoid involvement in brain aging as well as of the normal functions of these steroids in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2069717883,"Exogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) decreases food intake and causes satiety in animals and man. However, it has not been established that endogenous CCK causes satiety or whether the response is mediated by peripheral-type (CCK-A) or brain-type (CCK-B) receptors. The development of potent and selective antagonists for CCK-A (MK-329) and CCK-B (L-365,260) receptors now allows these issues to be addressed. The CCK-A antagonist MK-329 and the CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 increased food intake in partially satiated rats and postponed the onset of satiety; however, L-365,260 was 100 times more potent than MK-329 in increasing feeding and preventing satiety. These results suggest that endogenous CCK causes satiety by an agonist action on CCK-B receptors in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2044563284,"Human malignant cells secrete low molecular size proteins that attract peripheral blood monocytes and may be responsible for the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages observed in vivo. Similar chemotactic proteins are secreted by cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. The predominant monocyte chemoattractants produced by tumor cells of differing origin were demonstrated to be related to smooth muscle cell-derived chemotactic factor. Thus, a single class of chemotactic proteins is produced by different cell types, which suggests a common mechanism for the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages. These results are significant in view of the potential of macrophages to affect tumor growth."

These proteins bind to isolated linear DNA, and genomic footprinting analyses indicate that they are bound to DNA in nuclei. In supercoiled plasmids at low pH, some of these DNA sequences adopt triple-helical structures which, if they form in vivo, could significantly affect chromatin structure. The nuclear proteins described here, and not necessarily the deformed conformation of the DNA, may be responsible for maintaining a potentially inducible promoter structure before transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1581676497,"We have recently identified a typical enhancer, termed GPEI, located about 2.5 kilobases upstream from the transcription initiation site of the rat glutathione transferase P gene. Analyses of 5' and 3' deletion mutants revealed that the cis-acting sequence of GPEI contained the phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate responsive element (TRE)-like sequence in it. For the maximal activity, however, GPEI required an adjacent upstream sequence of about 19 base pairs in addition to the TRE-like sequence. With the DNA binding gel-shift assay, we could detect protein(s) that specifically binds to the TRE-like sequence of GPEI fragment, which was possibly c-jun.c-fos complex or a similar protein complex. The sequence immediately upstream of the TRE-like sequence did not have any activity by itself, but augmented the latter activity by about 5-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1553920646,"Feedback repression of the genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor and several enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is mediated by 25-hydroxycholesterol and other oxysterols. In this study, we have cloned a rabbit cDNA encoding an oxysterol-binding protein that may play a role in this regulation. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed a protein of 809 amino acids with two distinctive features: 1) a glycine- and alanine-rich region (63% of 80 residues) at the NH2 terminus, and 2) a 35-residue leucine zipper motif that may mediate the previously observed oligomerization of the protein. When transfected into simian COS cells, the rabbit cDNA produced a protein that exhibited the same affinity and specificity for sterols as the previously purified hamster liver protein. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the rabbit cDNA encodes both the 96- and 101-kilodalton forms of the oxysterol-binding protein that were previously observed. The availability of an expressible cDNA for the oxysterol-binding protein should help elucidate its role in sterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1973852930,"To investigate the molecular basis of the interaction between the T cell receptor and the MHC class I antigen in an allogeneic response, a soluble counterpart of the murine class I molecule, H-2Kb, was genetically engineered. Cells secreting this soluble molecule, H-2Kb/Q10b, inhibited stimulation of an H-2Kb-reactive T cell hybridoma by cells transfected with H-2Kbm10, a weak stimulus, but not by H-2Kb- or H-2Kbm6-transfected cells. Soluble purified H-2Kb/Q10b protein also blocked T cell stimulation. In addition, a peptide from the wild-type H-2Kb molecule spanning the region of the bm10 mutation specifically inhibited activation of the T cell hybridoma by H-2Kbm10 cells, thus suggesting that amino acid residues 163-174 of H-2Kb define a region important for T cell receptor binding. An estimate for the Kd of the T cell receptor for soluble H-2Kb/Q10b was 10(-7) M, while the Kd for soluble peptide 163-174 was 10(-4) M."

https://openalex.org/W1663153597,"Microtubule-disrupting drugs (nocodazole, colchicine) and cytochalasin D, which inhibits the polymerization of the actin microfilaments, were used to study the role of the cytoskeleton in protein secretion in the polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. Two proteins were analyzed. The gp 80 glycoprotein complex, which in untreated cells is sorted into the apical pathway and lysozyme, which is released randomly at both cell surfaces in transfected MDCK cells. Our results show that cytochalasin D has no influence on the transport of the gp 80 complex and lysozyme to either cell surface. However, in the presence of nocodazole or colchicine the secretion of both proteins at the apical cell surface is reduced by 50% with a concomitant increase in the basolateral release. These data suggest that microtubules are necessary for an efficient secretion of proteins at the apical cell surface of MDCK cells. In regard to the yet unresolved discrepancy concerning the involvement of microtubules in the transport of membrane proteins to the apical surface of MDCK cells, our results are consistent with the data of Rindler et al. (Rindler, M. J., Ivanov, I. E., and Sabatini, D. D. (1987) J. Cell. Biol. 104, 231-241) who observed a nonpolarized delivery of the influenza virus hemagglutinin in the presence of nocodazole or colchicine."

Unexpectedly, the expression of the alternative splicing was found to be temperature-dependent, for missplicing in cellula is effectively abolished at 31 degrees C and gradually increases to 100% at 39 degrees C. In contrast, in a similar patient harboring a substitution in the obligatory GT dinucleotide of the 5' splice site of intron 6, complete outsplicing of exon 6 sequences was found at all temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1598745691,"The redistribution of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) from a cytosolic or a loosely associated membrane compartment to a more integral membrane compartment is stimulated by Ca2+ in vitro. This event is thought to be necessary for activation of the enzyme. To determine whether such a redistribution of protein kinase C occurs following hormonally stimulated increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+, we measured [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]PDB) binding to protein kinase C in intact 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. The muscarinic agonist carbachol causes a 2-fold increase in [3H]PDB binding. This increase is transient, peaking at 1 min and returning toward control levels by 5 min. Scatchard analysis of [3H]PDB binding in the presence of carbachol reveals a 2-fold increase in the Bmax and no change in the KD compared to control values. This increase in Bmax likely represents a redistribution of protein kinase C to the membrane because [3H]PDB binding in intact cells is predominantly to membrane-associated enzyme. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, and two other Ca2+-mobilizing hormones, bradykinin and histamine, mimic the effects of carbachol. Furthermore, when hormone-sensitive Ca2+ stores are depleted by prior agonist treatment, the carbachol-induced increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and [3H]PDB binding are completely blocked. Under these conditions, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and diacylglycerol (DAG) formation are not inhibited. We also examined the time course of DAG accumulation in response to carbachol. DAG is not yet significantly elevated when the increase in [3H]PDB binding is maximal. Furthermore, [3H]PDB binding has returned to control levels when DAG concentrations are maximally elevated. These data suggest that hormone-stimulated increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ cause a marked and rapid redistribution of protein kinase C which precedes any significant increase in DAG. Our findings also demonstrate that [3H]PDB binding to intact cells may be a useful measure of the ability of Ca2+-mobilizing hormones to affect protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1583664336,"Abstract In normal rat kidney fibroblasts, retinoic acid increases the level of epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding and synergizes with EGF and transforming growth factor-beta to stimulate anchorage-independent growth. We now demonstrate that retinoids act by increasing the rate of transcription of the EGF receptor gene, resulting in elevated mRNA levels. No effect of retinoic acid on EGF receptor mRNA half-life, measured after actinomycin D treatment, was observed. In the same system, EGF was also able to increase expression of its own receptor through an elevation in mRNA levels. These effects were specific since retinoids and EGF did not alter transcript levels for fibronectin, alpha-tubulin, or beta 2-microglobulin. These results demonstrate that the EGF receptor gene is a target for regulation by multiple growth-stimulating factors."
https://openalex.org/W1584398295,"Abstract It has recently been appreciated that thrombin induces the retraction of endothelial cells resulting in an alteration of the integrity of the monolayers. We studied thrombin-induced changes in cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i) using microfluorometry of fura-2-loaded single cells, cell topography (scanning electron microscopy), and cytoskeleton (rhodamine phalloidin) in endothelial cells. Thrombin caused an initial and sustained phase of an increase in Ca2+i. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished both phases of Ca2+i response. Sustained phase of thrombin effect required extracellular calcium. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with indomethacin protracted the sustained phase, whereas a lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid curtailed it. Thrombin caused a marked retraction of confluent endothelial cells coincident with the sustained phase of Ca2+i response. This was paralleled by the formation of gaps in F-actin distribution at the periphery of the cells. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with nordihydroguaiaretic acid blunted the thrombin-induced cell retraction. Microinjection of various putative messengers into the endothelial cells showed that initial Ca2+ mobilization is not sufficient to account for sustained elevation of Ca2+i. The sustained response required microinjection of phospholipase A2 or co-injection of phospholipase A2 with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or CaCl2, further implying that thrombin receptor(s) can be coupled to both phospholipases C and A2. Sustained elevation of Ca2+i was a necessary prerequisite for the thrombin-induced changes in endothelial cell topography."
https://openalex.org/W1594346891,"Abstract We have cloned the genomic DNA encoding rat osteocalcin and have isolated fragments in the 5' flanking region which mediate the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) on osteocalcin gene transcription. Approximately 3 kilobase pairs of the osteocalcin gene's 5' flanking region, including the promoter and transcription start site, were fused to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Transfection into ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells demonstrated low level basal expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The expression increased markedly in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3; induction was observed at doses as low as 10(-11) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity increased as early as 16 h after stimulation with 10(-9) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Basal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in ROS 24/1 and 25/1 cells was much lower than in ROS 17/2.8 cells. In these two cell lines, there was little induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in the presence of 10(-9) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Deletion studies of the 5' flanking region demonstrated two regions that contribute to the induction by 1,25-(OH)2D3. Deletion of a 650-base pair fragment ending 1.4 kilobase pairs upstream from the initiator ATG led to an 80% decrease in responsiveness. Removal of an additional 1.1 kilobase pairs, leaving a 300-base pair promoter containing fragment obliterated responsiveness to 1,25-(OH)2D3."

https://openalex.org/W1652070020,"Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a carcinogen in humans and rodents which has eluded mechanistic clarification of its carcinogenic action. In vitro and in vivo, binding of DES to DNA has been found previously, but covalent DNA adducts could not be identified. In this study, the nature of binding was investigated by 32P-postlabeling, a rapid and highly sensitive assay for covalent DNA damage, to distinguish between a genotoxic or epigenetic mechanism of carcinogenesis by DES. A unique and distinct DNA adduct pattern was observed in kidney, liver, uterus (or testes) of female (or male, respectively) Syrian hamsters treated with a single injection of DES (200 mg/kg body weight). This set of DNA adducts closely matched patterns generated in vitro by reaction of diethylstilbestrol-4',4''-quinone with DNA or 2'-deoxyguanosine 3'-monophosphate. The major and several minor DES-DNA adducts in vivo had identical chromatographic mobilities in 11 different solvent systems with corresponding adducts obtained in vitro. The major adduct spot, generated in vitro by reaction of diethylstilbestrol-4',4''-quinone and DNA, was chemically unstable (half-life at 37 degrees C: 4-5 days). The persistence in vivo of these DNA modifications was low (biological half-life: 14 h) presumably because of chemical instability in concert with DNA repair. After injection of identical dosages of DES, adduct concentrations were 4-6-fold higher in females than in males. These results demonstrate that DES is capable of covalently modifying DNA. Moreover, diethylstilbestrol-4',4-quinone is the major reactive metabolic intermediate responsible for the genotoxic activity of DES. Tumors are expected to arise only in rapidly dividing cells due to the short biological lifetimes of DES-DNA adducts."
https://openalex.org/W1489268371,"The mouse gene encoding adrenal steroid 11β-hydroxylase (11β-OHase) has been cloned and the nucleotide sequence of its 5′ end has been determined. The coding regions sequenced are homologous (75%) to the sequence of bovine 11β-OHase cDNA. The 5′-flanking region of the 11β-OHase gene contains a potential cAMP response element (TGACGTGA) located 56 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site (position −56) and two motifs at positions −249 and −148 which are similar to an element postulated to be required for the expression of 21-hydroxylase. Transfection of mouse Y1 adrenocortical tumor cells and MA-10 testicular Leydig cells with plasmids containing the 11β-OHase promoter linked to a growth hormone reporter gene showed that the 11β-OHase promoter can direct cell-specific expression. Deletion analyses of the 5′-flanking region suggest that multiple sequence elements, one of which is located between positions −425 and −338 and a second between positions −338 and −123, interact to produce full levels of promoter activity. Mutant Y1 cells defective in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity do not express growth hormone driven by the 11β-OHase promoter, indicating that expression of 11β-OHase in Y1 cells requires an intact cAMP second messenger system. Moreover, mutation of the putative cAMP response element at position −56 abolishes expression. These experiments thus present a useful system for the investigation of cis-acting elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of 11β-OHase."
https://openalex.org/W2106856557,"The binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its plasma membrane receptor results in the stimulation of a tyrosyl residue-specific protein kinase, which has been shown to be part of the receptor. The mechanism by which EGF binding give rise to the stimulation of kinase activity is not understood in detail; however, a number of recent studies have implicated receptor dimerization or oligomerization in this process. We prepared Triton X-100 extracts of A431 cells in which the concentration of EGF receptors was on the order of 10(-7) M. When samples of the extracts were incubated with or without EGF and then treated with the high-yield cross-linking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), covalent receptor dimers could be detected in high yield in samples that had been treated with both EGF and BS3, whereas only monomeric receptor was detected in untreated samples or in samples that had been treated with either EGF or BS3. The yield of receptor dimers trapped by cross-linking correlated with the stimulation of autophosphorylation by EGF and with the concentration of EGF present. EGF-induced receptor dimers were also efficiently cross-linked in highly purified receptor preparations, suggesting that EGF-induced dimerization is a process intrinsic to the receptor, requiring no additional accessory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1531075088,"Saponin-treated liver cells and a microsomal fraction were used to characterize the mechanism of the Ca2+ release induced by different bile acids. The saponin-treated cells accumulated 0.8–1 nmol/mg of protein of the medium Ca2+ in a nonmitochondrial, high affinity, and inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-sensitive Ca2+ pool. Three of five bile acids tested, lithocholate and the conjugates taurolithocholate and taurolithocholate sulfate, released 85% of the Ca2+ pool within 45–60 s and with ED50 from 16 to 28 µM. Ins(1,4,5)P3 released 80% from the same Ca2+ pool with an ED50 of 0.3 µM. The Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase inhibitor vanadate (1 mM) had no effect on the Ca2+ released by the bile acids and Ins(1,4,5)P3. The Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding antibiotic neomycin (1 mM) and the receptor competitor heparin (16 µg/ml) abolished the releasing effect of Ins(1,4,5)P3 but had no effect on the bile acid-mediated Ca2+ release. The 45Ca2+ accumulated by the microsomal fraction (8 nmol of 45Ca2+/mg of protein) was released by the bile acids within 45–90 s and with an ED50 of 17 µM. In contrast, the bile acids had no effect on the Ca2+ permeability of other natural and artificial membranes. The resting 45Ca2+ influx of intact cells (0.45 nmol/mg of protein/min), the 45Ca2+ accumulated by mitochondria (2–13 nmol of 45Ca2+/mg of protein), and the 45Ca2+ trapped in sonicated phosphatidylcholine vesicles (5 mM 45Ca2+) were not altered by the different bile acids. These results suggest that the Ca2+ release initiated by lithocholate and its conjugates results from a direct action on the Ca2+ permeability of the Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive pool. It is not mediated by Ins(1,4,5)P3 or via activation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor, and it is specific for the membrane of the internal pool."
https://openalex.org/W1618959544,"To determine how changing forms of class II major histocompatibility complex proteins and associated Ii molecules in intracellular compartments of human B lymphocytes might regulate or catalyze antigen processing or presentation, we analyzed immunoprecipitates of such molecules from subcellular fractions of [35S]methionine pulse-chase-labeled, 3-day-activated B lymphocytes after homogenization and distribution in Percoll density gradients. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates of subcellular fractions demonstrated: 1) progressive sialic acid addition to class II major histocompatibility complex beta chains and Ii but not to gamma 2, gamma 2', gamma 3, gamma 3' (p35), or p41 and its satellites; 2) association of p35 and p41 with class II complexes at 30-60 min after pulse labeling; 3) cleavage of an immature form of Ii without sialic acid at 15-30 min after pulse labeling to a COOH-terminal, 25,000-dalton fragment, p25, with a 60-90-min half-life; 4) the presence of Ii-related p29 at only 30-min chase times; 5) an effect of chloroquine or monensin, at maximal nontoxic doses, to increase (a) the time for associations of p35 and p41 with class II complexes and (b) the half-life of p25, which was then formed from Ii at reduced levels. In addition, while the half-lives of class II alpha and beta chains and Ii were comparable within intracellular fractions of any one density, in intracellular fractions of intermediate densities the complexes appeared to be longer lived (much greater than 6 h) than in lighter fractions (2-3-h half-lives)."
https://openalex.org/W1622962331,"A mouse liver genomic library was probed with a 450-base pair AccI----3' gene-specific fragment of a mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell proteoglycan cDNA to isolate 15-18-kilobase (kb) genomic clones containing the gene that encodes the peptide core of mouse secretory granule proteoglycans. Based on the nucleotide sequences of its 2.0-3.5-kb subcloned fragments, this mouse gene consists of three exons. The first exon contains 41 base pairs of untranslated nucleotides that are present in the 5' region of the transcript and also encodes the hydrophobic 25-amino acid signal peptide. The second exon encodes a 48-amino acid sequence that would be predicted to be the N terminus of the peptide core after the signal peptide has been removed in the endoplasmic reticulum. The third exon encodes a 79-amino acid sequence that includes the 15 amino acids immediately preceding an alternating serine-glycine 21-amino acid sequence for glycosaminoglycan attachment, and the subsequent C-terminal 43 amino acids; this exon also contains the 424 untranslated nucleotides present in the 3' region of the transcript. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses were performed to determine the transcription initiation site of the mouse gene. Rat-1 fibroblasts were cotransfected with the selectable marker pSV2 neo and a lambda clone (lambda MG-PG1) to obtain two rat-1 fibroblast cell lines that had the mouse secretory granule proteoglycan gene integrated into their genomes. RNA blot analysis of both cell lines revealed the presence of the 1.0-kb secretory granule proteoglycan peptide core mRNA transcript, indicating that lambda MG-PG1 contained the entire mouse secretory granule proteoglycan peptide core gene including some of the regulatory elements in its promoter region. The gene that encodes the peptide core of mouse secretory granule proteoglycans is the first proteoglycan gene to have its complete exon/intron organization determined and to be transfected and expressed in another cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1575024488,"Abstract The structural significance of C-terminal amphiphilic alpha-helix of human interleukin-2 has been investigated using principles of protein design. Employing disulfide-mediated semi-synthesis, several multiple residue substitution patterns were studied in order to provide rapid insight into the most appropriate features to incorporate into fully recombinant proteins. Substitutions directed toward both stabilization and destabilization of the helix resulted in proteins with modulated bioactivity. Circular dichroism verified the conformational integrity and thermal stability of the derivatives. The biologic characteristics of each derivative were evaluated in the standard murine CTLL-2 assay and compared to activities exhibited in both human T-cell bioactivity and binding assay. A strategy for the design of protein ligand agonists and antagonists without knowledge of receptor contact residues is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1607923587,"A two-step procedure was found to be useful for the efficient refolding of a complex protein, ovotransferrin. In the first step, the reduced and denatured form of the protein was incubated at a low temperature in a nondenaturing buffer containing reduced glutathione; in the second step, the reduced form was reoxidized at a higher temperature in the presence of oxidized glutathione. Under these conditions, the fully reduced forms of ovotransferrin and its half-molecules were almost quantitatively reoxidized to regain iron-binding abilities and conformations, very similar to the native form. The circular dichroism spectra revealed that at low temperatures the fully reduced forms have partially folded conformations, which are fluctuating like molten globule states. The reoxidization kinetics compared between whole ovotransferrin and the two half-molecules supported independent refolding of the N- and C-terminal domains."
https://openalex.org/W1784202161,"The effects of the isoquinoline sulfonamides, a class of synthetic protein kinase inhibitors, namely 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H7), N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide dihydrochloride (H8), N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide dihydrochloride (H9), and N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide hydrochloride (HA1004), on the lytic activity of in vivo-produced (H-2b anti-H-2d alloimmune) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were investigated. The hierarchy of inhibition of lysis shown by these compounds resembled that of their inhibition of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme (protein kinase C). H7 has the highest affinity for protein kinase C (Hidaka, H., Inagaki, M., Kawamoto, S., and Sasaki, Y. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5036–5041) and gave the greatest inhibition of lysis by CTL. HA1004 has the weakest affinity for protein kinase C and gave very little inhibition of lysis, whereas H8 and H9 showed intermediate inhibition of lysis. In addition, the effect of the isoquinoline sulfonamides on cellular proliferation was examined. Interestingly, the pattern of inhibition observed for both lymphocytes and tumor cells closely mimicked the effects of these compounds on protein kinase C activity. These results demonstrate that modulation of an early biochemical signal affects both short-term (e.g. CTL-mediated lysis) and long-term (e.g. cellular proliferation) events. These data provide further evidence for the integral role of protein kinase C in the activation of the lytic signal in CTL. In addition, suggestive evidence is provided that protein kinase C, or some other enzyme with similar sensitivity to the isoquinoline sulfonamides, plays an important role in cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1549842787,"Clones resistant to 3-deazaaristeromycin, a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, were selected from a nucleoside kinase-deficient derivative of the WIL-2 human B-lymphoblastoid cell line. The resistant clones took up 3-deazaaristeromycin and showed no alteration in the level of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activity or in the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by 3-deazaaristeromycin. However, they displayed markedly elevated S-adenosylmethionine content during growth in 3-deazaaristeromycin and, following prolonged selection, enhanced export of S-adenosylhomocysteine. As a result they maintained a high ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine and thus were resistant to the inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine turnover and transmethylation caused by 3-deazaaristeromycin. Expanded S-adenosylmethionine pools declined over several weeks of nonselective growth, suggesting a metabolic adaptation rather than a mutational mechanism. No alterations in S-adenosylmethionine synthetase activity were found in the 3-deazaaristeromycin-resistant clones. S-Adenosylhomocysteine export appeared to be carrier-mediated and largely unidirectional. The resistant clones showed a 5-fold increased rate of S-adenosylhomocysteine export compared with parental cells, but a similar Km for intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine, estimated to be approximately 1 mM. Our results highlight the opposing effects of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine on transmethylation and suggest that the ability to elevate S-adenosylmethionine pools and to export S-adenosylhomocysteine may provide for homeostatic control of transmethylation in lymphoid cells when S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activity is limited."
https://openalex.org/W1505839290,"We have generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5E10 which recognizes an antigen localized to dense core vesicles (DCVs) in the atrial gland of Aplysia californica. mAb5E10 immunoprecipitates an abundant 57-kDa glycoprotein (atrial gland granule-specific antigen, AGSA) which is a soluble component of atrial gland DCVs. Electron microscopy reveals that AGSA immunoreactivity is restricted to the region between the dense core, which contains neuropeptide immunoreactivity, and the membrane of atrial gland DCVs. AGSA was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, and the amino acid sequences of both N-terminal and internal cyanogen bromide fragments were determined. This information was used to isolate a 2.8-kilobase cDNA which encodes a 47-kDa protein. The predicted amino acid sequence contains the micro-sequenced peptides, an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, and four N-linked glycosylation sites, but does not contain any significant homologies to database sequences. Northern blots and light level immunocytochemistry demonstrate that the AGSA gene is specifically expressed in the atrial gland. The identification of a protein localized to the cortex of DCVs suggests that this region has a specialized role in the function of these vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1605148153,"Phosphoinositide turnover is known to play an important role in intracellular free calcium homeostasis through the inositol trisphophate-mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores. We find that the other product of phosphoinositide turnover, 1,2-diacylglycerol, elicits an increase in intracellular free calcium in HL60 cells which is due, at least in part, to release of calcium from intracellular stores. This effect is specific for calcium, since intracellular sodium and potassium levels and cellular volume were unaffected. Concomitant with the intracellular calcium increase, we find an increase in cellular inositol trisphosphate levels, suggesting that the effect of diacylglycerol on calcium may be mediated by inositol trisphosphate. Diacylglycerols also stimulate calcium efflux. This stimulation is not simply due to the increase in intracellular calcium. These effects appear not to be mediated through stimulation of a phorbol ester-activatable protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) since phorbol esters do not elicit an increase in cytoplasmic free calcium or an increase in calcium efflux."
https://openalex.org/W1489185803,"Quantitative electron microscope autoradiography has been used to define the macromolecular composition of the interferon-induced human lupus-type inclusions (LI) in the human B lymphoblastoid cell line, Daudi. LI were first apparent in Daudi cell cultures 12 h after the addition of 100 units/ml of the purified recombinant human leukocyte interferon, IFLrA. Radiolabels were added at this time and allowed to incorporate over the following 12 h during which an estimated greater than 99% of the LI material present at 24 h was formed. The LI-incorporated radiolabels were present only during this discrete 12-h period after the interferon activation of LI cell pathways in order to detect LIs de novo synthesized macromolecular components. The estimate relative specific activities of the LI-incorporated radiolabels were: choline at 4.042, mannose at 2.631, uridine at 0.664, glucosamine at 0.578, and amino acids at 0.477. With thymidine the estimated LI specific activity was 0.000. LI isolated from whole cells retained the tubular elements and the interwoven membrane network. These results provide direct evidence that the interferon-induced Daudi cell LI are de novo synthesized complexes of ribonucleoprotein and membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1594445618,"We have evaluated the methylation state of the T cell receptor beta chain gene (TcR beta) in freshly isolated human large granular lymphocyte (LGL) and T cell DNA in order to investigate the relationship between LGL and T cells with regard to methylation of this region of genomic DNA. In addition, we wished to determine whether hypomethylation of specific regions of the beta chain gene DNA might account for the production of only a nonfunctional 1.0-kilobase (kb) TcR beta mRNA transcript in LGL. Our analysis indicates that the heterogeneous pattern of methylation seen in LGL DNA lies predominantly in the J beta 1 region of the TcR beta DNA structure. The CCGG sequences located at the beginning of the HTF island (CG-rich region) in the J beta 2 region are nonmethylated in both LGL and at least half of the T cell DNA, suggesting that the HTF island is nonmethylated in both LGL and T cell DNA. In addition, specific methylation differences between T cell and LGL DNA can be detected 0.7 kb 3' to the last exon of C beta 1, just 5' to the first exon and within the second exon of the C beta 2 region. The heterogeneous methylation state of the TcR beta J beta 1 region in LGL DNA may be due to and a result of the differential use of the J beta 1 segment for generation of the nonfunctional 1.0-kb mRNA in LGL. These results and our previous studies (Sakamoto, S., Ortaldo, J. R., and Young, H. A. (1988) J. Immunol. 140, 654-660 and Sakamoto, S., and Young, H. A. (1988) Nucleic Acid Res. 16, 2149-2163) indicate that DNA methylation may be one method by which functional gene expression is controlled in specific lymphoid cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W1521789301,"The effects of anions on chromatin aggregation may be classified into three categories. First, monovalent anions, glutamate, acetate, chloride, and thiocyante, follow the lyotropic series in their effects on both H1 histone displacement and chromatin aggregation. Second, alkyl carboxylates and dicarboxylates differ in their ability to induce chromatin aggregation depending on charge density, suggesting possible interference by bulky alkyl chains with neutralization (screening) of closely spaced positive protein charges. Third, the multivalent anions, citrate3- and SO42-, bind tightly to histone and disrupt nucleosomes and thus interfere with chromatin aggregation. Substantial differences in chromatin aggregation were observed with different species of anions. At salt concentrations of 0-500 mN and pH 7.0, as much as 70% of the chromatin could be induced to aggregate by monosodium glutamate and sodium acetate, whereas only 10% or less was precipitated by NaSCN, Na2SO4, and Na3citrate. The physiological anion composition of the nucleus is not known; however, the anion effects discussed in the present work suggest a potential for regulation of chromatin condensation in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1606117029,"Normal murine B lymphocytes are not known to be effectors of the Fc receptor-mediated, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In contrast, we report here that highly purified splenic B cells from mammary tumor-bearing mice develop the potential of lysing antibody-coated target cells. These lymphocytes are characterized by being G-10 nonadherent, nylon wool adherent, sIg+, FcR+, Thy 1.2-, asialo GM1-, and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes of both chromosomes are rearranged. The lytic reaction is characterized by a noninterdigitating binding and by the appearance of endocytotic vesicles in the target cells. Nuclear disintegration occurs 18 h after initial effector-target cell conjugate formation. At such time, only minor cytoplasmic membrane alterations are evident. The emergence of killer B cells in tumor-bearing hosts indicates that all lymphoreticular cell types bearing Fc receptors are capable of mediating ADCC."
