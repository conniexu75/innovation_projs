https://openalex.org/W2146319740,"The contractile and inflammatory actions of the cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are thought to be mediated through at least two distinct but related CysLT G protein-coupled receptors. The human CysLT1 receptor has been recently cloned and characterized. We describe here the cloning and characterization of the second cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, CysLT2, a 346-amino acid protein with 38% amino acid identity to the CysLT1 receptor. The recombinant human CysLT2 receptor was expressed in Xenopusoocytes and HEK293T cells and shown to couple to elevation of intracellular calcium when activated by LTC4, LTD4, or LTE4. Analyses of radiolabeled LTD4 binding to the recombinant CysLT2 receptor demonstrated high affinity binding and a rank order of potency for competition of LTC4 = LTD4 ≫ LTE4. In contrast to the dual CysLT1/CysLT2 antagonist, BAY u9773, the CysLT1 receptor-selective antagonists MK-571, montelukast (SingulairTM), zafirlukast (AccolateTM), and pranlukast (OnonTM) exhibited low potency in competition for LTD4 binding and as antagonists of CysLT2receptor signaling. CysLT2 receptor mRNA was detected in lung macrophages and airway smooth muscle, cardiac Purkinje cells, adrenal medulla cells, peripheral blood leukocytes, and brain, and the receptor gene was mapped to chromosome 13q14, a region linked to atopic asthma."

https://openalex.org/W2114711950,"Opiate tolerance and dependence are major clinical and social problems. The anti-opiate neuropeptides FF and AF (NPFF and NPAF) have been implicated in pain modulation as well as in opioid tolerance and may play a critical role in this process, although their mechanism of action has remained unknown. Here we describe a cDNA encoding a novel neuropeptide Y-like human orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), referred to as HLWAR77 for which NPAF and NPFF have high affinity. Cells transiently or stably expressing HLWAR77 bind and respond in a concentration-dependent manner to NPAF and NPFF and are also weakly activated by FMRF-amide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide) and a variety of related peptides. The high affinity and potency of human NPFF and human NPAF for HLWAR77 strongly suggest that these are the cognate ligands for this receptor. Expression of HLWAR77 was demonstrated in brain regions associated with opiate activity, consistent with the pain-modulating activity of these peptides, whereas the expression in adipose tissue suggests other physiological and pathophysiological activities for FMRF-amide neuropeptides. The discovery that the anti-opiate neuropeptides are the endogenous ligands for HLWAR77 will aid in defining the physiological role(s) of these ligands and facilitate the identification of receptor agonists and antagonists."

https://openalex.org/W2333853059,"The nuclear phosphoprotein c-Jun is a major component of the AP-1 transcription factor, whose activity is augmented by many oncogenes. An important mechanism to stimulate AP-1 function is N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun at the serine residues 63 and 73 by the c-JunN-terminal kinases (JNKs). Mice and cells harboring a mutant allele of c-jun, which has the JNK phosphoacceptor serines changed to alanines (junAA), were used to determine the function of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation (JNP) during oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. JunAA immortalized fibroblasts expressing v-ras and v-fos showed reduced tumorigenicity in nude mice, but the efficiency of v-src transformation was unaffected by the lack of JNP. To assess the significance of JNP in tumour development in vivo, two transgenic mouse tumour models were employed. Skin tumour development caused by constitutive activation of the ras pathway by K5-SOS-F expression and c-fos-induced osteosarcoma formation were impaired in mice lacking JNP. Inhibition of JNP may, therefore, be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit tumour growth in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1982768284,"Growing evidence suggests that certain cell cycle regulators also mediate neuronal death. Of relevance, cyclin D1-associated kinase activity is increased and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a substrate of the cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complex, is phosphorylated during K+ deprivation-evoked death of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors block this death, suggesting a requirement for the cyclin D1/Cdk4/6-Rb pathway. However, the downstream target(s) of this pathway are not well defined. The transcription factor E2F-1 is regulated by Rb and is reported to evoke death in proliferating cells when overexpressed. Accordingly, we examined whether E2F-1 was sufficient to evoke death of CGNs and whether it was required for death evoked by low K+. We show that adenovirus-mediated expression of E2F-1 in CGNs results in apoptotic death, which is independent of p53, dependent upon Bax, and associated with caspase 3-like activity. In addition, we demonstrate that levels of E2F-1 mRNA and protein increase during K+ deprivation-evoked death. The increase in E2F-1 protein is blocked by the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol. Finally, E2F-1-deficient neurons are modestly resistant to death induced by low K+. These results indicate that E2F-1 expression is sufficient to promote neuronal apoptosis and that endogenous E2F-1 modulates the death of CGNs evoked by low K+.

A greater understanding of the cellular signaling pathways that regulate neuronal apoptosis may lead to novel therapeutic targets for these and other neuropathologies. However, the pathways that regulate neuronal death are not fully delineated. The cell cycle is regulated through a complex series of events controlled through the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 and their obligate binding partners, the cyclins (8Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a growing body of work has implicated these CDKs in some instances of neuronal death. This evidence includes both in vivo and in vitroup-regulation of the activity and/or the expression of cyclin-CDK complexes during neuronal death. For example, levels of cyclin D and B and activity of Cdk2 and Cdk4 increase during PC12 cell death evoked by trophic factor deprivation (9Gao C.Y. Zelenka P.S. Exp.

Finally, pharmacological CDK inhibitors and/or expression of dominant negative Cdk4/6 inhibit death of neurons by DNA damage (16Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8747-8756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the above evidence implicates cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 in neuronal death, the downstream effector(s) of the activated complex are unclear. It has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor Rb, a substrate of Cdk4/6, is phosphorylated in response to β-amyloid (19Giovanni A. Wirtz-Brugger F. Keramaris E. Slack R. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19011-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), K+ deprivation (17Padmanabhan J. Park D.S. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Rb is also capable of protecting neurons from DNA damage-induced death when overexpressed (21Park D.S. Morris E.J. Bremner R. Keramaris E. Padmanabhan J. Rosenbaum M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While this evidence suggests Rb involvement, the manner by which Rb controls neuronal death is not fully delineated. The function of Rb within the nervous system is complex, and it probably plays a role in both cell cycle control and differentiation (22Slack R.S. Miller F.D. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4302) Google Scholar). Although Rb interacts with a large number of proteins, its regulation of E2F members is best characterized (24Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). E2F-1 is a transcription factor that, along with its heterodimeric partner DP1/2, plays a pivotal role in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (25Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 26Wu C.L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Binding of Rb to the E2F-1-DP complex inhibits transcriptional activity either through sequestration of active E2F-1 complexes or formation of active transcriptional repressor complexes. Phosphorylation of Rb by CDKs results in loss of Rb-E2F-1 binding, loss of repression, and promotion of transcriptional activity (24Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several groups have reported that E2F-1 can induce apoptosis in proliferating cells when overexpressed (27Asano M. Nevins J.R. Wharton R.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1422-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Fueyo J. Gomez-Manzano C. Yung W.K. Liu T.J. Alemany R. McDonnell T.J. Shi X. Rao J.S. Levin V.A. Kyritsis A.P. Nat.

Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this death can be inhibited by Rb (30Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Previous evidence demonstrated that dominant negative DP-1 can block neuronal death evoked by DNA damage (21Park D.S. Morris E.J. Bremner R. Keramaris E. Padmanabhan J. Rosenbaum M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and β-amyloid (19Giovanni A.

These results have led us to hypothesize that E2F-1 may also be capable of signaling apoptosis in neurons. In order to further test this model and extend our observations of E2F-1 involvement in neuronal death, we determined whether E2F-1 expression alone was sufficient to evoke death in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). We presently show that expression of E2F-1 evokes death of CGNs in a manner dependent upon Bax and independent of p53. We also examined whether E2F-1 was required for death of CGNs evoked by K+withdrawal, a model of death known to activate the Cdk4/6-Rb pathway (17Padmanabhan J. Park D.S. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8747-8756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate increased E2F-1 mRNA and protein levels following K+ withdrawal and a delay of death in E2F-1-deficient CGNs. Primary CGN cultures were prepared from 7–9-day postnatal mice as described previously (31Cregan S. MacLaurin J. Craig C. Robertson G. Nicholson D. Park D. Slack R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were maintained in complete medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) containing 2 mmglutamine, 25 mm glucose, 0.02 mg/ml gentamycin (Sigma), 10% dialyzed FBS) supplemented with K+ to a final concentration of 25 mm. An equal number of neurons (in any given experiment) were plated in 24-well dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) at a density of 500,000 cells/well. The antimitotic cytosine-arabinoside (10 μm final concentration; Sigma), which kills dividing cells, was added 18–24 h after plating to reduce the amount of glia cells in the culture. Cytosine-arabinoside administered at these doses had no toxic effects on CGNs. Recombinant adenovirus expressing human E2F-1 or LacZ (multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 6 or 10 as indicated) was added to cell suspensions immediately before plating. K+deprivation was performed 7 days after plating by washing each well twice with 750 μl of complete medium (final K+concentration of 5 mm) and then incubating in 1 ml of complete medium (5 mm K+ final). Control cells were washed similarly with 5 mm K+ medium and then maintained in 1 ml of complete medium containing 25 mmK+. Cells exposed to flavopiridol were washed as above with complete medium containing 5 mm K+ and 1 μm flavopiridol and then maintained in 1 ml of this same medium for the indicated times. CD-1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Bax- and p53-deficient neurons were obtained from pups derived from heterozygous parents maintained on a C57BL6 genetic background. E2F-1-deficient neurons were obtained from pups produced by mating heterozygous or heterozygous and homozygous mice from a B6/129 background. For each experiment, neurons from heterozygote or wild type littermates were used as control. Each animal was genotyped prior to dissection. Genotyping of Bax mice was performed as described previously (32Knudson C. Tung K. Tourtelotte W. Brown G. Korsmeyer S. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). E2F-1 was genotyped using GGATATGATTCTTGGACTTCTTGG (E2F-1–5′), CTAAATCTGACCACCAAACGC (E2F-1–3′), and CAAGTGCCAGCGGGGCTGCTAAAG (PGKB) primers. The primers were used in one PCR to amplify an untargeted 170-bp fragment and a targeted 230-bp fragment. PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C, 1 min (1 cycle): 94 °C, 5 s; 92 °C, 45 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min (30 cycles); 72 °C, 5 min. p53 animals were genotyped using GTATCTGGAAGACAGGCAGAC (O-p53–1) and TGTACTTGTAGTGGATGGTGG (O-p53–2) primers to detect the wild type allele (450 bp) and TATACTCAGAGCCGGCCT (O-p53-X7) and TTCCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATC (O-neo-2) primers to detect the targeted allele (533 bp). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 5 min (1 cycle): 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min (30 cycles). At the indicated time points, medium was aspirated and cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.1× PBS, pH 7.4, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 0.15 mm KH2P04, 13.5 mmNaCl, 0.25 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 g/100 ml cetyldimethylethylammonium bromide). This solution disrupts cell membranes while nuclei remain intact and distinguishable under light microscopy (17Padmanabhan J. Park D.S. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8747-8756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl was loaded onto a hemacytometer, and the number of healthy intact nuclei were counted, while those displaying blebbing, disruption of nuclear membrane, or phase bright bodies were excluded. The percentage of surviving neurons is expressed relative to the number of neurons in uninfected or non-K+-deprived wells plated at the same time as the experimental wells. Each data point is the mean ± S.E. from three samples. Alternatively, neurons were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and incubated with Hoescht 33258 (0.25 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with 1× PBS, the percentage of shrunken and condensed nuclei was assessed. Each data point is the mean ± S.E. from three samples. At the indicated time points, cells were washed three times in cold 1× PBS and then processed in a lysis buffer as described previously (35Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30663-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and sonicated for 3 s. The samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm on an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. Supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was assayed using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Equivalent protein (3.5 μg) for each sample was incubated with DEVD-AFC (BIOMOL) in a buffer as described (35Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30663-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the increase in fluorescence at 505 nm was measured using an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. Measurements were performed on Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrometer with a slit width setting of 10 and integration time of 3 s. DEVD-AFC cleavage activity was determined by plotting the change in fluorescence over time. The slope of the curve was then determined and set as DEVD-AFC cleavage activity (in arbitrary units). At the indicated time points following either infection or K+ deprivation, neurons were washed in 1× PBS and then collected in solubilization buffer (0.0625 m Tris, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Protein was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously. Membranes were then probed with anti-E2F-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibody. Neuronal cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing three times for 10 min in 1× PBS, polyclonal E2F-1 antibody (1:500 in 1× PBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to cells for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 1× PBS, Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to cells for 1 h and then washed with 1× PBS. Cells were then washed three times in 1× PBS and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. β-Galactosidase staining was performed as described (31Cregan S. MacLaurin J. Craig C. Robertson G. Nicholson D. Park D. Slack R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rat brains using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNAs were reverse transcribed from 4 μg of total RNA. The same amount of cDNAs was subsequently used for PCR amplification for a total of 25 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min of each cycle. These optimal amplification conditions and cycle numbers were determined experimentally to ensure specific and linear signal generation. Expression of β-actin mRNA was used as a standard to quantify the relative amount of expression of E2F-1 as described previously (36Hou S. Tu Y. Buchan A. Huang Z. Preston E. Rasquinha I. Robertson G. MacManus J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mouse-specific E2F-1 PCR primers (GACTGTGACTTTGGGACC and TGTTCACCTTCATTCCC) and actin primers (AACACCCCAGCCATGTACGTAG and GTGTTGGCATAGAGGTCTTTACGG) were used to generate an E2F-1 product of 434 bp and a β-actin fragment of 509 bp. The PCR products were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel, photographed, and quantified by scanning laser densitometry. The authenticity of the PCR products was confirmed by cloning into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequencing using an automated ABI373A DNA sequencer. We first examined whether expression of E2F-1 was sufficient to induce death of CGNs. CGNs cultured from neonates (CD-1) were infected with recombinant adenoviral constructs expressing E2F-1 or LacZ as a control. As shown in Fig. 1, 4 days following infection, expression of E2F-1 resulted in 70% reduction in survival compared with control noninfected neurons, while infection with LacZ resulted in only 9% reduction in survival. Western blot analyses confirmed increased expression of E2F-1 in E2F-1-infected cultures (Fig.2 H). With higher exposure of the identical blot, a low level of endogenous E2F-1 was observed in control cultures (data not shown). E2F-1 expression was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2, A–D). We found that 62% of the neurons in E2F-1 infected cultures present at day 4 stained for E2F-1 (Fig. 2 G). The lower number of E2F-1-positive neurons compared with dying neurons, as assessed by nuclear counts, is probably a result of some E2F-1-expressing cells having died and lifted off the plate prior to fixation. Staining for β-galactosidase verified 75% expression in LacZ-infected cultures (Fig. 2, E–G). CGNs infected with E2F-1-expressing adenovirus died with nuclear signs of apoptosis (Fig. 3, A andB). Quantification of Hoescht staining shows that 40% of the neurons in E2F-1-infected cultures and 5% of LacZ-infected cultures displayed condensed and/or fragmented nuclei (Fig.3 C).Figure 2Expression of E2F-1 and β-galactosidase in CGNs. Neurons were infected (m.o.i. = 10) with E2F-1 (A and B) or LacZ (C and D) at the time of plating and fixed after 4 days in culture. Cultures were stained for E2F-1 (A–D) and visualized by immunofluorescence (A and C) or phase microscopy (B and D).

Of relevance, several reports have indicated that CGN death evoked by either low K+ concentration or p53 overexpression requires Bax activity (31Cregan S. MacLaurin J. Craig C. Robertson G. Nicholson D. Park D. Slack R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37McGinnis K.M. Gnegy M.E. Wang K.K. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether Bax was required for E2F-1-mediated neuronal death by comparing the effects of E2F-1 expression in neuronal cultures obtained from Bax-deficient mice and littermate controls. As shown in Fig.4, Bax-deficient neurons expressing E2F-1 were significantly more resistant to death as compared with Bax wild type littermates (88% survival for Bax (−/−) versus 36% for Bax (+/+) 4 days following infection). Bax-deficient neurons infected with E2F-1 displayed healthy soma and intact processes typical of healthy neurons, while neurons from Bax wild type littermates infected with E2F-1 show degenerating processes and apoptotic bodies (Fig. 4, B–D). The resistance of Bax-deficient neurons to E2F-1-induced death indicates that Bax acts downstream of the E2F-1 death signal. One model by which Bax mediates death involves its ability to facilitate the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which leads to formation of the apoptosome complex and subsequent caspase activation (39Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4788) Google Scholar, 40Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether Bax-dependent E2F-1-induced death was associated with caspase activation, we measured caspase-3-like activity in Bax null and wild type littermates infected with E2F-1 or LacZ adenovirus. Caspase-3-like activity was measured by DEVD-AFC cleavage activity. CGNs from Bax (+/+) and (+/−) mice showed a 7–8-fold increase in DEVD-AFC cleavage activity 4 days after infection with E2F-1 (Fig. 5). DEVD-AFC cleavage activity, however, is not detected in Bax-deficient CGNs expressing E2F-1. These results indicate that death of CGNs induced by E2F-1 expression is associated with increased caspase-3-like activity and that this activity is dependent on Bax. Multiple reports in proliferating cells have indicated that E2F-1-mediated death can be a p53-dependent (29Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Schwarz J.K. Nevins J.R. J.

In addition, E2F-1-dependent neuronal death in vivo due to Rb deficiency can be either p53-dependent or p53-independent according to neuronal type (44Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T.

In order to establish the relevance of p53 in E2F-1-induced neuronal death, we examined whether p53 (−/−) neurons were resistant to E2F-1 expression. We found that neurons from p53-deficient and heterozygous mice displayed no significant differences in survival in response to E2F-1 expression (Fig. 6). This indicates that p53 is not required for death of CGNs induced by E2F-1 expression and that the activation of Bax-mediated death signals occurs independently of p53. The above studies indicate that E2F-1 expression is sufficient to cause neuronal death. We next asked whether E2F-1 was involved in a CGN model of death in which E2F-1 itself is not the death stimulus. To address this question, we examined the requirement for E2F-1 in K+ deprivation-induced death of CGNs. In this death paradigm, CGNs die apoptotically when switched from medium containing a high K+ concentration (25 mm) to medium with a low K+ concentration (5 mm) (47D. Mello S. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 48Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J.

Moreover, similar to our results with E2F-1 overexpression, K+ deprivation-induced death is dependent upon Bax and induces caspase-3-like activity (38Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 50Marks N. Berg M.J. Guidotti A. Saito M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We first determined whether E2F-1 was required for death of CGNs evoked by K+ deprivation. CGNs from E2F-1-deficient animals displayed a small but significant delay of death compared with neurons from heterozygous E2F-1 littermates. The effect was most significant 12 h following deprivation, with 68% of E2F-1 (−/−) neurons surviving versus 39% survival for E2F-1 (+/−) (Fig.7). Consistent with this observed protection, E2F-1 transcripts increase during CGN death induced by K+ withdrawal, as determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. We detected increases in E2F-1 message as early as 1 h following the induction of K+ deprivation (Fig.8 A). As an internal control, β-actin message was co-amplified with E2F-1. The densitometric ratio of E2F-1 to β-actin increases approximately 3-fold at 1 h and plateaus 12 h following K+ deprivation (Fig.8 B). Combined data from three independent experiments shows that E2F-1 transcript levels increase 4-fold over base line within 6 h of K+ deprivation (Fig. 8 C). Because the E2F-1 gene is itself regulated by E2F activity (51Lavia P. Jansen-Durr P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), our data suggests a deregulation of E2F-1 transcriptional complexes.Figure 8E2F-1 mRNA transcripts increase during K+ deprivation.

Here we demonstrate that the Aurora2 protein is degraded rapidly after G2/M phase release in mammalian cells. Aurora2 protein has a rapid turnover rate with a half-life of approximately 2 h. In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major mechanism for the targeted degradation of unstable proteins. The treatment of mammalian cells with proteasome inhibitors blocks Aurora2 degradation. Furthermore, Aurora2 is polyubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro using anaphase-promoting complex (APC). These results demonstrate that Aurora2 protein is turned over through the APC-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Oncogene (2000) 19, 2812 - 2819"

The amino terminus of SMN tightly associates with Gemin2, whereas the carboxyl-terminal conserved YG domain is necessary for self-association and interaction with the core snRNP Sm proteins (19Liu Q.

SnRNPs are formed in the cytoplasm where the core Sm proteins bind to the Sm site on U snRNA, and following hypermethylation of the m7G cap to a 2,2,7-trimethyl-gaunosine (m3G) cap the snRNP is transported to the nucleus (24DeRobertis E.M.

Using oocyte injections, it was demonstrated that the SMN·Gemin2 complex plays a role in spliceosomal snRNP assembly that takes place in the cytoplasm. Injection of Gemin2-specific monoclonal antibodies inhibited, whereas injection of SMN-specific monoclonal antibodies stimulated, snRNP biogenesis (31Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells SMN deleted of the amino-terminal 27 amino acids (SMNΔN27) functions as a dominant negative mutant sequestering the SMN complex in large cytoplasmic and nuclear bodies (32Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). SMNΔN27 causes accumulation of Sm proteins and U snRNA in the cytoplasm, suggesting that this mutant blocks snRNP assembly prior to cap hypermethylation and nuclear import. In vitro SMN stimulates, whereas SMNΔN27 and anti-SMN antibodies inhibit, splicing following preincubation in nuclear extracts, demonstrating that SMN may have a role in nuclear regeneration of snRNPs (32Pellizzoni L.

Taken together these data suggest that the SMA phenotype is caused by a motor neuron-specific response to defects in the cytoplasmic assembly and/or nuclear cycling of the splicing machinery. The biogenesis of U6 snRNP is different from that of the other snRNPs. Unlike other snRNAs, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, U6 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (37Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Science. 1991; 254: 1462-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, U6 does not leave the nucleus (38Vankan P. McGuigan C. Mattaj I.W.

In yeast it has been shown that Lsm4p, Lsm6p, and Lsm7p directly contact the U6 snRNA as measured by ultraviolet light cross-linking experiments (45Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Lsm·U6 RNA complex is relatively salt-labile and dissociates in the presence of competitor RNA, suggesting that the interaction between Lsm and U6 snRNA is more dynamic in nature than that of the Sm core snRNPs, which are extremely stable (44Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Here we have mapped the regions on the Sm proteins that are responsible for SMN binding. We show that oligomerized SMN interacts with the arginine- and glycine-containing carboxyl-terminal regions of SmB, SmD1, and SmD3. Surprisingly, we found that SMN also interacts directly with several of the Lsm proteins. We suggest that the SMN complex has a role in the assembly and/or regeneration of Lsm-containing complexes, including the U6 snRNP. All plasmids for expression of Sm and Lsm proteins and deletions or fragments thereof were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA with specific primers containing restriction sites for subcloning. Expressed sequence tag cDNA clones encoding Lsm2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -8 (IMAGE clone 1168053, IMAGE clone 278511, ATCC clone 160595, IMAGE clone 2368661 (a kind gift from Bertrand Seraphin), IMAGE clone 925894, and IMAGE clone 2325387, respectively) were obtained and subcloned into pET vectors (Novagen). All constructs used were confirmed by automated DNA cycle sequencing. All [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were producedin vitro using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). All Sm and Sm peptide fragments were produced from pET vectors with (His)6-T7 tag (see Fig.4 A, below). SMN, SMNY272C (tyrosine at position 272 changed to cysteine), SMNΔYG (deleted of the carboxyl-terminal 26 amino acids), and SMNΔEx7 (deleted of amino acids encoded by exon 7) were produced from myc-pcDNA3. These myc tag constructs produce two bands, because translation starts at both themyc tag ATG and the native SMN ATG.Figure 4Carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domains of SmD1 and -D3, but not that of SmB, are sufficient for SMN interaction.

Following elution from Ni2+columns all (His)6-T7-tagged proteins were extensively dialyzed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at −20 °C. For oligomerized GST-SMN/SMN production, two 500-ml cultures, one expressing GST-SMN and one expressing (His)6-T7-SMN, were induced and incubated at 17 °C with shaking for 16 h. The cultures were centrifuged, and each cell pellet was recovered in 20 ml of resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and one tablet per 50 ml of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Resuspended cells were mixed and lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the lysate was incubated with mild agitation at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and oligomers of SMN were purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purification of GST-SMN/SMN in this manner produces immobilized oligomerized SMN, which binds to SmB, -D1, and -D3 similarly to the previously reported oligomerized SMN (23Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Prior to use, all recombinant proteins were visualized on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels to confirm purity and lack of degradation. All binding reactions were carried out in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and one tablet per 50 ml of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated 1–2 h at 4 °C followed by five washes with 1 ml of binding buffer. All binding assays employed glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized GST fusion proteins (1–2 μg). (His)6-T7-tagged fusion proteins (0.5–0.7 μg) were used for direct binding assays, and for binding of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, 8 μl of each translation mixture was used. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting with the T7 tag antibody (Novagen) or autoradiography. Among the eight core Sm proteins, three of them, SmD1, -D3 and -B, have been shown to avidly interact with oligomerized SMN, and only SmB has been shown to interact directly with SMN (23Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To determine if SmD1 and -D3 can also directly interact with SMN, we produced recombinant (His)6-T7-tagged SmD1 and -D3. As shown in Fig. 1 A, these proteins bound directly to immobilized GST-SMN/SMN but not to GST alone. In the reverse experiment, (His)6-T7-tagged SMN bound GST-SmD1 and GST-SmD3 but not GST alone (Fig. 1 B) demonstrating that SmD1 and -D3 interact directly with SMN. To determine if, as is the case with SmB, SMN mutations found in some SMA patients are deficient in SmD1 and SmD3 interactions, we tested the ability of in vitro produced, [35S]methionine-labeled, SMN and SMN mutants to interact with GST, GST-SmD1, and GST-SmD3. Fig. 1 C shows that SMN but not SMN deleted of amino acids encoded by exon 7 (SMNΔEx7), SMN deleted of the YG box (SMNΔYG), or SMN with tyrosine at position 272 changed to cysteine (SMNY272C) bound GST-SmD1 and GST-SmD3. No binding with GST alone was observed (data not shown). Thus, as is the case with SmB, SMN binds directly to SmD1 and -D3, and SMN mutants reduce these interactions. The Sm protein sequence requirements for SMN interaction have not been elucidated. From visual inspection of the primary sequence of the human Sm proteins we observed that those proteins, which interact most strongly with SMN (SmB, -D1, and -D3), contain extended carboxyl termini. Further examination revealed that the carboxyl termini of these proteins contain clusters of glycine and arginine residues (Fig. 2). Most strikingly, SmD1 contains nine contiguous glycine-arginine (GR) repeats. SmD3 contains fewer arginine and glycine residues but is markedly arginine- and glycine-rich. SmB contains a very extended carboxyl terminus, which is most noticeably proline-rich but also contains five GRG and three GMR repeats. Because the Sm proteins that interact weakly (or not at all) with SMN do not contain carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domains, we tested whether these domains of SmD1, -D3, and -B were responsible for SMN interaction. We deleted the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich regions and analyzed the ability of these deletions to interact with recombinant GST-SMN/SMN. These deletions did not eliminate any portion of Sm motifs 1 or 2 common to all Sm proteins (Figs. 2 and 3 A). Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 99 or 139 amino acids of SmB (SmBΔc99 and SmBΔc139, respectively) abolished SMN binding. Deletion of 29 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of SmD1 (SmD1Δc29) and 32 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of SmD3 (SmD3Δc32) also abolished SMN interaction (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the arginine- and glycine-rich domains of SmB, -D1, and -D3 are necessary for interaction with SMN. To determine whether the arginine- and glycine-rich Sm protein sequences are sufficient for interaction with SMN, carboxyl-terminal fragments were produced separately. In the case of SmB, the carboxyl-terminal 99 (SmBc99) and 139 (SmBc139) amino acids were translated in vitro and SMN binding was assayed. Fig. 4 Ashows that these peptides did not bind SMN (see “Discussion”). SmD1 carboxyl-terminal 79 (SmD1c79) and 54 (SmD1c54) amino acids and SmD3 carboxyl-terminal 83 (SmD3c83) and 58 (SmD3c58) amino acids were also translated in vitro and tested for binding to immobilized SMN. All of the SmD1 and SmD3 carboxyl-terminal fragments bound SMN with avidities comparable to that of the full-length proteins (Fig.4 B) and did not bind GST alone (data not shown). In the reverse experiment we fused GST to the carboxyl-terminal 29 and 32 amino acids of SmD1 (GST-SmD1c29) and SmD3 (GST-SmD3c32), respectively. These peptides were produced as recombinant proteins and assayed for interaction with wild type SMN and SMN mutants (SMNΔEx7, SMNY272C, and SMNΔYG). Wild type SMN bound the GST fusion proteins, whereas two of the SMN mutants (SMNΔEx7 and SMNΔYG) showed greatly reduced or undetectable binding (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, under these conditions SMNY272C has only slightly reduced affinity for the carboxyl termini of SmD1 and -D3. GST-SmD1c29 and GST-SmD3c32 interact directly with (His)6-T7-tagged SMN (data not shown). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domains of SmD1 and -D3 are sufficient for SMN interaction and, like the full-length SmD1 and -D3 proteins, have markedly reduced affinity for SMN deleted of Ex7 or the YG box. It has recently been shown that the human U6 snRNP contains Sm-like proteins (Lsm) instead of the Sm proteins found in the U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNPs (42Seraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 43Salgado-Garrido J. Bragado-Nilsson E. Kandels-Lewis S. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3451-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 44Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because the Lsm proteins may function in a similar manner to the core Sm proteins, we were interested to determine if the Lsm proteins can also interact with SMN. To facilitate these experiments we obtained cDNA clones corresponding to the human Lsm2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -8 proteins. These proteins were then produced by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine and tested for binding to SMN. Lsm2, -4, -6, and -7 bound immobilized SMN, with Lsm4 exhibiting higher affinity than the other binders under the assay conditions used (Fig.5 A). None of these Lsm proteins bound GST alone (data not shown). Interestingly, only one of the Lsm proteins, Lsm4, has an arginine- and glycine-rich carboxyl domain (Fig. 2). To confirm a direct interaction between Lsm4 and SMN and to determine if, like Sm proteins, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 interacts with SMN, recombinant GST fusions of full-length Lsm4 (GST-Lsm4), Lsm4 deleted of the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids (GST-Lsm4Δc54), and the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids of Lsm4 (GST-Lsm4c54) were produced separately. As shown in Fig. 5 B, GST-Lsm4 and GST-Lsm4c54 bound SMN with similar avidities, whereas deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 54 amino acids greatly reduced SMN binding. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 is necessary and sufficient for direct interaction with SMN. Because SMN mutants found in SMA patients affect interaction with Sm proteins, we tested their ability to interact with Lsm4. Fig. 5 C show that these SMN mutations abolished the binding to Lsm4. We demonstrate that SMN directly interacts with SmD1 and -D3, and mutants that alter the YG domain of SMN greatly reduce these interactions (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that peptides encompassing the YG box specifically compete for SmB interaction (19Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that the tudor domain of SMN is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the Sm proteins. It has also been shown that a point mutation in the tudor domain, which changes a glutamate residue at position 134 to lysine (E134K), reduces Sm interaction (47Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These inconsistent data can be explained if SMN self-association through the YG domain results in the formation of a high affinity Sm binding site, which includes amino acids found in the tudor domain, the YG domain, and possibly other regions of the protein (23Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Regardless of deletion mapping results designed to find the Sm binding site on SMN, it remains clear that SMN mutations found in SMA patients are deficient in Sm protein interaction. We show that arginine- and glycine-rich domains found at the carboxyl termini of SmB, -D1, and -D3 are necessary for SMN interaction. We further demonstrate that SmD1 and -D3 carboxyl termini with relatively uninterrupted arginine-glycine repeats are also sufficient for SMN interaction. In contrast, SmB has GRG and GMR repeats spread throughout the 151 amino acids from the end of Sm motif 2 to the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2). This region, when expressed without the Sm domain, is not sufficient for SMN interaction. This result can be explained if the three-dimensional structure of SmB brings the GRG/GMR repeats into close proximity to form a surface for SMN interaction, and deletion of the Sm domain disrupts this fold. It is possible that this region forms an arginine- and glycine-rich binding surface that is structurally similar to the correspondingly shorter regions of SmD1 and -D3. Crystal structures of heterodimers of SmD3-SmB and SmD1-SmD2 show that the tertiary structure of the Sm domains contains an amino-terminal α-helix followed by a bent five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (48Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the SmB-SmD3 structure did not include amino acids carboxyl-terminal to Sm motif 2, and the carboxyl terminus of SmD1 was not ordered in the crystal structure of SmD1-SmD2. In light of the present work it will be interesting to determine the structure of the carboxyl-terminal regions of SmB, -D1, and -D3, and it is possible that these regions remain unstructured until bound by SMN. We show that the carboxyl termini of SmD1 and -D3 are sufficient for interaction with SMN. It is striking that such a small region that, in the case of SmD1, is comprised almost exclusively of arginine-glycine repeats (Fig. 2) is responsible for SMN interaction. This suggests that SMN interacts with any arginine-glycine repeat sequence of sufficient length. However, this is not the case, because heteronuclear RNP A1 and A2, which have regions containing RGG repeats, do not interact with SMN (data not shown). Electron microscopy (49Kastner B. Bach M.

Prior to snRNP assembly, cytoplasmic Sm proteins appear to form SmD1-SmD2 and SmB-SmD3 dimers and SmE-SmF-SmG trimers (50Raker V.A. Plessel G. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 53Lehmeier T. Raker V. Hermann H. Luhrmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2076-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The capacity of SMN to interact with at least one component of each of the pre-snRNP Sm complexes (or particularly efficiently with at least the two SmB and SmD complexes) suggests that SMN serves as a scaffold on which the seven-membered snRNP ring forms. SMN readily oligomerizes in vitro (23Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and is found in large oligomers in cellular extracts (19Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 21Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Oligomeric SMN interaction with non-Sm motif carboxyl-terminal regions of SmB, -D1, and -D3 will likely not interfere with Sm-Sm and Sm-snRNA interactions required for proper snRNP assembly, thus supporting our speculation that SMN can serve as a scaffold for proper snRNP assembly. Gemin3 and Gemin4, two components of the SMN complex, bind subsets of the Sm proteins. Gemin3 binds SmB, -D2, and -D3, whereas Gemin4, similar to SMN, binds SmB, -D1, -D2, -D3, and -E (20Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The series of SmB, -D1, and -D3 deletion mutants used to map the SMN binding site on these Sm proteins was used in interaction studies with GST-Gemin3 and GST-Gemin4. Although these studies did not exhaustively map the Sm protein sequences required for these interactions, they did demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich sequences of SmB, -D1, and -D3 are dispensable for interaction with Gemin3 and Gemin4 (data not shown). Thus, SMN interacts with the same Sm proteins bound by Gemin3 and Gemin4 but on different regions of the Sm proteins. The SMN complex is, therefore, likely to have a firm multivalent grip on the Sm proteins during snRNP assembly. We also report here a novel set of interactions between SMN and Lsm proteins (Fig. 5). The carboxyl terminus of Lsm4 contains an arginine- and glycine-rich domain that, when expressed on its own, is sufficient for direct interaction with SMN (Fig. 5 B). We further show that SMN interacts with Lsm2, -6, and -7. These proteins have no carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain and, thus, are likely have a different mode of SMN binding. By analogy with the crucial role of the SMN complex in cytoplasmic snRNP assembly and SMN interaction with Sm proteins, the interaction with Lsm proteins suggests that SMN likewise functions in the assembly of U6 snRNP. The fact that SMN interacts with at least two of the Lsm proteins and the similarities in the size and overall shape of Lsm and Sm cores (44Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 49Kastner B. Bach M. Luhrmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1710-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggest that SMN also serves as a scaffold for Lsm core assembly. This also brings up the possibility that SMN plays a more direct and more extensive role in splicing. Because the Lsm-U6 snRNA interaction is less stable than that of the Sm core with U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs, it has been suggested that the Lsm proteins play a more dynamic role in splicing (44Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given SMN′s role in splicing (32Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), it is possible that SMN functions in the rearrangement of the Lsm proteins during splicing. In yeast, Lsm proteins have recently been shown to have a role in mRNA decay. Specifically, there appears to be a complex of Lsm1–7 involved in mRNA degradation in the cytoplasm and a complex of Lsm2–8 involved in splicing in the nucleus (55Tharun S. He W. Mayes A.E. Lennertz P. Beggs J.D. Parker R. Nature. 2000; 404: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that SMN also has a role in RNA degradation in the cytoplasm. The role of SMN in Lsm function is currently being investigated. We originally cloned SMN by interaction with the RGG box of heteronuclear RNP U, and from this work it now emerges to be a general theme that SMN interacts with arginine- and glycine-rich domains. RGG boxes are often found in RNA binding proteins (56Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 57Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the role of SMN in assembly of RNPs. Finally, we note that arginines in RGG boxes are often subject to dimethyl arginine modification (58Beyer A.L. Christensen M.E. Walker B.W. LeStourgeon W.M. Cell. 1977; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 59Boffa L.C. Karn J. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is possible that these arginine- and glycine-rich domains in Sm proteins are similarly modified, and this could serve to modulate their interactions with SMN and to regulate snRNP assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2075749768,"The functions of aminotelopeptide and N-terminal cross-linking of collagen I were examined. Acetic acid-soluble collagen I (ASC) was purified from neonatal bovine skin and treated with three kinds of proteases. The amino acid sequencing analysis of the N terminus showed that ASC contained a full-length aminotelopeptide. Pepsin and papain cleaved the aminotelopeptide of the α1 chain at the same site and the aminotelopeptide of the α2 chain at different sites. Proctase-treated ASC lost the whole aminotelopeptide, and the N-terminal sequence began from the tenth residue inside the triple helical region. The rates of fibril formation of pepsin-treated ASC and proctase-treated ASC were the same and were slower than that of ASC. The denaturation temperatures, monitored by CD ellipticity at 221 nm, of ASC, pepsin-treated, or papain-treated collagens were the same at 41.8 °C. Proctase-treated ASC showed a lower denaturation temperature of 39.9 °C. We also observed the morphology of the collagen fibrils under an electron microscope. The ASC fibrils were straight and thin, whereas the fibrils of pepsin-treated ASC were slightly twisted, and the fibrils from papain- and proctase-treated ASC were highly twisted and thick. When the collagen gel strength was examined by a modified method of viscosity-measurement, ASC was the strongest, followed by pepsin-treated ASC, and papain- and proctase-treated ASCs were the weakest. These results suggest that the aminotelopeptide plays important roles in fibril formation and thermal stability. In addition, the functions of intermolecular cross-linking in aminotelopeptides may contribute to the formation of fibrils in the correct staggered pattern and to strengthening the collagen gel."

Recently, we found a novel Ca2+-conducting channel that is likely to be a native store-operated channel responsible for capacitative Ca2+ influx and contraction in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). 2E.

Bolotina, submitted for publication. Poor cation selectivity of this 3-pS channel distinguishes it from the CRAC channel (6Kerschbaum H.H.

Sci. 1993; 707: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and although it resembles some channels from the TRP family, none of them described so far has such low single channel conductance (8Friel D.D.

Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar). These 3-pS nonselective cation channels rarely opened in resting SMC but were activated upon depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores induced by either chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA or by thapsigargin (TG)-induced inhibition of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Neither excision of membrane patches from resting (untreated) SMC nor a variety of second messengers (including Ca2+, InsP3, InsP4, GTPγS, cAMP, cGMP, ATP, and ADP) activated these channels in inside-out membrane patches. These native 3-pS channels provide a powerful new tool to address the mechanism of activation of these channels in SMC and specifically the link to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. In previous work, partially purified extracts of calcium influx factor (CIF) frompmr1 yeast, which are genetically deficient in SERCA (and therefore depleted in organellar Ca2+), were shown to evoke Ca2+ influx when injected into Xenopus oocytes and to activate ICRAC when introduced via a patch pipette into Jurkat cells (12Csutora P.

Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We also addressed the question of whether or not the channel is already present in the plasma membrane of resting SMC or if the channel is delivered and incorporated into the membrane only upon depletion of the stores (19Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We show that the 3-pS channels are immediately activated in inside-out membrane patches by the putative CIF extracted from either SERCA-deficient pmr1 yeast or from human platelets with depleted Ca2+ stores. This is the first evidence of direct activation of native store-operated channels in inside-out membrane patches by a putative CIF that was chemically extracted or obtained in bioassay from different cell types following depletion of their Ca2+ stores. SMC were isolated from mouse thoracic aorta as described before2 using collagenase (4 mg/ml), elastase (2 mg/ml), and trypsin inhibitor (2 mg/ml), (1-h treatment at 37 °C), placed on coverslips in 1% Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplied with 1% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2–5 days. Under these conditions, SMC attached to the coverslips and spread slightly attaining a spindle-like shape but did not divide. These SMC stained positively for α-actin. Single channel currents were recorded in inside-out membrane patches from resting (unstimulated) SMC as recently described (21Hirakawa Y. Gericke M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1732-H1744PubMed Google Scholar) with a low noise Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, pipettes were coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning Corp.) and polished to a resistance of 10–20 MΩ (when filled with high sodium pipette solution). pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and stored for later analysis. Representative traces of single channel currents were later additionally filtered at 100–200 Hz for better visual resolution of a 3-pS single channel on the figures. Liquid junction potential was corrected. Experiments were conducted at 20–22 °C. The open channel probability (NP o) was analyzed and plotted over time to illustrate the time-course of channel activity. The amplitude of single channel currents was analyzed using all-point histograms or amplitude histograms obtained from the event list, because both methods gave the same single channel current amplitude in our experiments as was described before.2 Standard bath solution contained: 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Pipette solution contained: 140 mm NaCl, 10 mmtetraethylammonium chloride, 0.2 mm EGTA (pH 7.4). In some experiments Ca2+ (1 or 10 mm) was added to the pipette or bath solutions (instead of EGTA). The pipette solutions contained 100 μm niflumic acid and 100 nm iberiotoxin to suppress Ca2+-dependent Cl− and K+ currents, respectively. In control experiments neither of these inhibitors affected 3-pS channels or TG-induced Ca2+ influx in SMC.2 Acid extracts from wild type andpmr1 mutant yeast were prepared as described previously (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Human platelets were obtained from the regional Red Cross following 5–7 days of storage. Unstimulated platelets were kept at room temperature. The Ca2+ stores in platelets were depleted by either TG (2 μm, 20 min), overnight hypothermic treatment (4 °C), or by a combination of both stimuli. Acid extracts from platelets were prepared as described previously (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A starting platelet count of about 1011 cells yielded crude extract, which corresponded to ∼5 × 1011platelets/ml. CIF extracts were diluted 1:30 and applied at a final concentration corresponding to about 1.7 × 1010platelets/ml. Anion exchange HPLC purification of the crude extracts was performed using a Keystone Scientific Partisil 10 SAX column eluted with a linear salt and pH gradient from 5 to 750 mm(NH4)H2PO4 and from pH 2.8 to 3.7, respectively. CIF activities were assayed by microinjection of extracts into fura-2 loaded albino Xenopus laevis oocytes as described (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were measured on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope through a 10x UplanAPO objective, NA = 0.17, equipped with a rapid excitation filter changer alternating between 340 and 380 nm (Ludl Electronics) and a CCD camera (Sensys, Photometrics). Changes in fluorescence were analyzed in a 600 × 400 μm area of the oocyte close to the injection site. Data are expressed as the 340/380 nm ratio. Human platelets were concentrated from platelet-rich plasma and filtered through Sepharose-2B gel into regular HEPES buffer: 137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mmglucose, 3.8 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm aspirin, 6 milliunits/ml apyrase. Filtered platelets were transferred into an intracellular solution containing: 110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm KH2CO3, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.1), 2 mm Mg-ATP, ATP-regenerating system (creatine phosphate 5 mm creatine phosphokinase 15 units/ml) and permeabilized with 50 μg/ml saponin for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in saponin-free intracellular solution. Within the next 30 min the suspension of permeabilized platelets was added to the chamber (at a concentration of ∼1.75 × 109 platelets/ml) containing an inside-out membrane patch excised from SMC. Before application to the membrane patches, each preparation of permeabilized platelets was tested for TG (1 μm)-induced emptying of their stores which was monitored as described earlier (22Trepakova E.S. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Approximately 1011 platelets (filtered as described above) were exposed to +4 °C for 12 h, then concentrated into 3 ml of standard bath solution used for patch-clamp (see above), and sonicated in a Branson sonifier at 40 watts, 4 times for 5 s (at +4 °C). Lysate was centrifuged at +4 °C for 25 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and used during the day. It was applied to inside-out membrane patches at a concentration corresponding to ∼2.5 × 109 cells/ml. All the drugs were from Sigma. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. withn showing the number of experiments in the text. Statistical significance was assessed using the t test and ANOVA (analysis of variance). Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. To assess the possible mechanism of activation of the 3-pS nonselective cation channels, the inside-out membrane patches with little or no single channel activity were excised from resting SMC. Application of CIF extracts from genetically modified (SERCA-deficient)pmr1 yeast (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (at a final concentration corresponding to ∼4.5 × 108 cells/ml) to the cytoplasmic side of membrane patch immediately activated 3-pS channels in 16 of 18 experiments (Fig. 1). Although the single channel currents were very small (about 0.3 pA at 100 mV), they could be clearly resolved (Fig. 1 a). The histograms of the current amplitude (Fig. 1 b) revealed the presence of several (two to five) channels with the same current amplitude in each membrane patch. Fig. 1 c shows an example of CIF-activated single channel currents in an inside-out membrane patch recorded at different membrane potentials with all-point histograms showing single channel current amplitudes. CIF-activated channels had the same electrophysiological characteristics as those previously described for the native 3-pS channel activated by BAPTA and TG in intact SMC.2 The I/V relationship of the CIF-activated channel (Fig. 1 d) was linear with a slope conductance of 3.3 ± 0.4 pS (n = 7) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and 3.2 ± 0.2 pS (n = 6) and 3.1 ± 0.4 pS (n = 3) in the presence of 1 and 10 mm of Ca2+, respectively. The dependence on membrane potential of the NP o of CIF-activated channels, which did not change at negative, but significantly increased at high positive membrane potentials (Fig. 1 d), was identical to that of native store operative 3-pS channels.2Thus, CIF extracts activated 3-pS channels with the properties indistinguishable from the channels activated by TG and/or BAPTA in intact SMC. In contrast, similar extracts from wild-type yeast, which do not produce CIF (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), did not activate 3-pS channels in inside-out membrane patches (in four of four experiments). We also sought a relatively abundant mammalian source for CIF preparations. In recent publications we described capacitative Ca2+ influx in human platelets and showed its SERCA-dependent regulation by nitric oxide (22Trepakova E.S. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because of these results and the availability of relatively large quantities of platelets, we initiated a series of experiments to determine if a CIF similar to that derived from yeast (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) could also be produced by human platelets and if it also activates 3-pS channels in excised membrane patches from SMC. The first series of experiments was designed to bioassay CIF produced by human platelets during depletion of their Ca2+ stores. The cytoplasmic side of an inside-out membrane patch from SMC was exposed to suspension of permeabilized platelets (Fig.2 a), and the activity of the 3-pS channel was monitored before and during TG-induced depletion of the platelets' Ca2+ stores. Fig. 2 b shows that the addition of permeabilized platelets alone (1.75 × 109 platelets/ml) did not activate channels in the patch (NP o was 0.010 ± 0.006 before and 0.011 ± 0.004 after addition of platelets). However, the subsequent addition of TG to permeabilized platelets activated 3-pS channels in the isolated patch (in five of six experiments), and at the peak of activity NP o reached 0.23 ± 0.06 (at −100 mV, n = 5). The time course and peak activity of the channels in this bioassay system were similar to the time course of TG-induced channel activation in cell-attached patches in intact SMC.2 The channel could be blocked by a high concentration of La3+ (2 mm) applied from the cytoplasmic side (n = 5, Fig. 2 b). The addition of TG to inside-out patches in the absence of platelets did not produce activation of 3-pS channels (n = 12). Thus, it appears that upon depletion of Ca2+ stores, a factor is produced and released from the platelets through their permeabilized plasma membrane that is capable of activating 3-pS channels in isolated membrane patches. In another series of experiments, to avoid the use of TG, platelets were activated by exposure to low temperature, and the lysates prepared from the platelets were applied to inside-out membrane patches from SMC. Application of the lysate at concentration equivalent to ∼2.5 × 109 platelets/ml to inside-out membrane patches immediately activated 3-pS channels in 8 of 12 experiments (Fig. 2 c). When diluted 10 times (equivalent to 2.5 × 108 cells/ml) the same lysate was without an effect in five of five experiments. Next, acid extracts were prepared from platelets and partially purified as described previously (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To test if extracts from platelets whose stores were depleted either by TG or exposure to cold (23Oliver A.E. Tablin F. Walker N.J. Crowe J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have similar CIF activity as those obtained from SERCA-deficient yeast, platelet extracts were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and Ca2+ influx was assessed. As shown in Fig.3 a, extracts from activated platelets caused a time-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ that spread across the oocyte from the point of injection similar to that described for CIF derived from yeast and Jurkat cells (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 b shows that the Ca2+rise strictly depended on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and was maximal in response to extracts from platelets that had been activated by both TG and exposure to cold. Extracts prepared similarly but from nonactivated platelets showed no significant Ca2+ rise in the same assay (Fig.3 b). To determine if CIF extracts from platelets could also activate 3-pS channels, they were applied (at concentration equivalent to 1.7 × 1010 platelets/ml) to inside-out membrane patches from resting SMC. Fig. 3 c shows that partially purified extract prepared from resting platelets (no. 5) did not activate any channels in the patch (n = 9). However, the subsequent addition of extracts from TG-treated platelets (no. 1) immediately activated 3-pS channels in five of seven membrane patches (Fig.3 c). Importantly, when CIF extract was applied at a concentration equivalent to 1.7 × 1010 platelets/ml (nearly 10 times higher than used in permeabilized platelet bioassay),NP o of 3-pS channels reached 0.96 ± 0.19 (at -100 mV, n = 5), which was about four times higher than NP o under similar conditions in the bioassay experiments (Fig. 2 c). The activity of the channels in the presence of CIF extracts from platelets was so high that even at negative membrane potentials more than one single channel current level was observed (Fig. 3 d). We then determined if further purification steps of the acid extract from platelets would provide evidence for a single molecular species capable of inducing Ca2+ influx in oocytes and also activating single 3-pS channels in membrane patches isolated from SMC. The partially purified acid extracts from activated platelets utilized in Fig. 3 were subjected to anion exchange HPLC. The absorbance at 262 nm of the column effluent is shown in Fig.4 a. Initially, pooled fractions were tested for activity in the oocyte assay, and eventually two half-minute fractions (no. 49 and 50 shown in the insetin Fig. 4 a) were found to activate Ca2+ influx in oocytes (Fig. 4 b). Fraction no. 51 was found to have no activity in the oocyte assay (Fig. 4 b). When these same fractions were applied to inside-out membrane patches isolated from SMC, fraction no. 51 caused no activation of 3-pS channels (Fig.4 c). However, the subsequent addition of fraction no. 50 immediately activated 3-pS channels, and their activity was so high that up to three single channel current levels could be seen even at negative membrane potentials (Fig. 4, c and d, in five of six experiments). This study demonstrates for the first time that CIF from mammalian and yeast cells with depleted Ca2+ stores directly activates native 3-pS cation channels, which in intact SMC are activated by Ca2+ store depletion. The results presented here allow us to address several important issues related to the mechanism of store-operated Ca2+ influx in vascular SMC and possibly in other cell types. Strong evidence was obtained that finalized the proof that the 3-pS channel in vascular SMC is a native store-operated channel. Indeed, this Ca2+-conducting channel is activated in intact SMC following depletion of their stores (achieved by intracellular Ca2+ chelation with BAPTA or TG-induced inhibition of SERCA-dependent Ca2+ uptake).2Demonstration of the direct activation of 3-pS channels by CIF produced upon depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (but not other known second messengers) establishes a store-dependent mechanism for 3-pS channel activation in SMC. Our experiments also directly demonstrate that a native SOC is constitutively present in plasma membrane of SMC. For its activation it does not need to be delivered to or incorporated into the plasma membranes following depletion of the stores, as was previously proposed (19Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, 3-pS channels were inactive in silent membrane patches isolated from resting SMC, but up to five channels were immediately activated when CIF was applied to the inside of the membrane patches. Interestingly, after activation in intact SMC, 3-pS channels remain active even when excised from SMC, implying that activation of the channels results in a stable modification rather than in an easily reversible interaction that is common to a variety of second messengers. Excision from the cell may also eliminate the mechanisms responsible for channel deactivation. Similarly persistent activity has been recently reported for a store-operated current (ISOC) in macro patches excised from Xenopusoocytes (19Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Several attractive models for store-dependent regulation of plasma membrane channels have been proposed and supported by strong experimental evidence in nonexcitable cells (for recent reviews see Refs. 4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 5Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, and 24Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although all models still face unresolved questions and the mechanism of SOC regulation remains obscure. Our study for the first time provided solid evidence for a CIF-mediated mechanism of store-operated Ca2+ entry at the level of single store-operated channels activated by CIF in isolated membrane patches. CIF with identical biological activities was found to be produced upon store depletion in both yeast and human platelets. Importantly, CIF activates single SOC in isolated membrane patches independently of whether it is released by permeabilized platelets during store depletion or chemically extracted from platelets after store depletion. The results with permeabilized platelets dismiss the concern about the possible induction of nonphysiological activity as a result of chemical extraction. They also clearly show, at least for the native SOC from SMC, that the direct physical coupling of this SOC to intracellular Ca2+ stores during their depletion is not required for channel activation. The question that remains open is whether the mechanism of SOC regulation is the same for different store-operated channels and different cell types. Strong arguments against a CIF-based model of SOC activation have been previously raised by some experimental data that were apparently inconsistent with a freely diffusible and long lived messenger traveling from Ca2+ stores to the plasma membranes (19Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Petersen C.C.H. Berridge M.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 599-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other recent data have provided compelling evidence for the importance of secretory processes and vesicle docking and/or membrane fusion in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx (19Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,27Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, direct interaction between the InsP3 receptor and the TRP3 channel has been described (11Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K.

Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and calls into question the role of a diffusible CIF in activation of store-operated channels (24Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although multiple mechanisms of activation of Ca2+ influx in different cell types are possible, it remains attractive to consider new unifying models that could account for much of the presently available experimental data. For instance, it is possible that in intact cells vesicular transport and/or docking, rather than simple diffusion, is required to deliver CIF from depleted Ca2+ stores to the vicinity of the plasma membrane. Physiological process could be more complicated than the free diffusion observed upon injection of exogenous CIF into the cell. Another possibility could be that a portion of CIF-producing sarcoplamic/endoplasmic reticulum needs to be docked near the plasma membrane for sufficient levels of CIF to escape sequestration or cytoplasmic degradation to reach and activate SOC. Also, cytoplasmic CIF and not Ca2+ store depletion per se might be necessary for altering the association of the InsP3 receptor with TRP channels. In any case, our data show that a putative CIF is sufficient for the activation of native SOC in isolated membrane patches. It is our strong hope that the utilization of excised membrane patches containing single SOC will facilitate further investigations of the molecular identity of CIF and aid in the elucidation of the processes responsible for activation of store-operated Ca2+influx.

https://openalex.org/W2317712623,"Bloom's syndrome (BS) is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased risk to develop cancer of all types. BS cells are characterized by a generalized genetic instability including a high level of sister chromatid exchanges. BS arises through mutations in both alleles of the BLM gene which encodes a 3′–5′ DNA helicase identified as a member of the RecQ family. We developed polyclonal antibodies specific for the NH2- and COOH-terminal region of BLM. Using these antibodies, we analysed BLM expression during the cell cycle and showed that the BLM protein accumulates to high levels in S phase, persists in G2/M and sharply declines in G1, strongly suggestive of degradation during mitosis. The BLM protein is subject to post-translational modifications in mitosis, as revealed by slow migrating forms of BLM found in both demecolcine-treated cells and in mitotic cells isolated from non-treated asynchronous populations. Phosphatase treatment indicated that phosphorylation events were solely responsible for the appearance of the retarded moieties, a possible signal for subsequent degradation. Together, these results are consistent with a role of BLM in a replicative (S phase) and/or post-replicative (G2 phase) process."
https://openalex.org/W2077435537,"We have studied a possible role of extracellular zinc ion in the activation of p70S6k, which plays an important role in the progression of cells from the G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with zinc sulfate led to the activation and phosphorylation of p70S6k in a dose-dependent manner. The activation of p70S6k by zinc treatment was biphasic, the early phase being at 30 min followed by the late phase at 120 min. The zinc-induced activation of p70S6k was partially inhibited by down-regulation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-responsive protein kinase C (PKC) by chronic treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but this was not significant. Moreover, Go6976, a specific calcium-dependent PKC inhibitor, did not significantly inhibit the activation of p70S6k by zinc. These results demonstrate that the zinc-induced activation of p70S6k is not related to PKC. Also, extracellular calcium was not involved in the activation of p70S6k by zinc. Further characterization of the zinc-induced activation of p70S6k using specific inhibitors of the p70S6k signaling pathway, namely rapamycin, wortmannin, and LY294002, showed that zinc acted upstream of mTOR/FRAP/RAFT and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), because these inhibitors caused the inhibition of zinc-induced p70S6k activity. In addition, Akt, the upstream component of p70S6k, was activated by zinc in a biphasic manner, as was p70S6k. Moreover, dominant interfering alleles of Akt and PDK1 blocked the zinc-induced activation of p70S6k, whereas the lipid kinase activity of PI3K was potently activated by zinc. Taken together, our data suggest that zinc activates p70S6k through the PI3K signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2036444216,"A novel mammalian galectin cDNA (ovgal11) was isolated by representational difference analysis from sheep stomach (abomasal) tissue infected with the nematode parasite, Haemonchus contortus. The mRNA is greatly up-regulated in helminth larval infected gastrointestinal tissue subject to inflammation and eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistological analysis indicates that the protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of upper epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. The protein is also detected in mucus samples collected from infected abomasum but not from uninfected tissue. The restricted and inducible expression of ovgal11 mRNA and limited secretion of the protein support the hypothesis that OVGAL11 may be involved in gastrointestinal immune/inflammatory responses and possibly protection against infection.

Bowles V.M. Meeusen E.N.T. Adv. Parasitol. 2000; 45: 181-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the coordinated events leading to leukocyte migration are being elucidated (primarily through the isolation of CC chemokines), there still remains a great deal to be defined regarding the response of infected tissue during allergic-type immune reactions and the recruitment of inflammatory cells across epithelial surfaces. Sheep have been used successfully in many immunological studies to analyze the immune response of large animals, including humans. The advantages of using this animal model are the comparable size and closer physiological and phylogenetic relationship with humans compared with rodent models. Haemonchus contortus is a natural nematode parasite of sheep that inhabits the abomasum (gastric stomach). Challenge infection of immunized sheep can result in massive infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils within abomasal tissue (1Balic A. Bowles V.M. Meeusen E.N.T. Adv. Parasitol. 2000; 45: 181-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pfeffer A. Douch P.G. Shaw R.J. Gatehouse T.K. Rabel B. Green R.S. Shirer C.L. Jonas W.E. Bisset S. Int. J. Parasitol. 1996; 26: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating that this tissue may be a good source of inflammatory molecules associated with allergic-type immune responses. The aim of the present study was to identify molecules that are specifically up-regulated in tissues subjected to intense allergic-type reactions compared with unstimulated control tissues. Hence representational difference analysis (RDA;1 see Refs. 3Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 4Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar) was chosen to isolate genes with up-regulated expression within H. contortus immunized and challenged abomasal tissue. A differentially expressed cDNA clone was isolated that is clearly up-regulated in infected abomasum and intestine supporting eosinophil infiltration, compared with uninfected tissue. This clone exhibits most similarity to a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins called galectins, particularly within the putative carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), but not with sufficient overall homology to be classified as the ovine homologue of one of the ten presently identified galectins. To conform to the current nomenclature regarding galectin family members this clone has been named ovgal11 (5Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Given the tissue distribution of OVGAL11 expression, and its homology to other proteins that play an immunomodulatory role, it is anticipated that OVGAL11 will be involved in the immune response of mammals to infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Nematode-free adult Merino sheep (Ovis aries wethers) were immunized by oral infection with 4,000 L3 larvae of the nematode, H. contortus, once a week for 9 weeks, drenched with levamisole (10 ml/sheep; Nilverm; Cooper's Animal Health, North Ryde, NSW, Australia), and maintained nematode-free for nine weeks. They were then challenged with 1 × 106 ex-sheathed H. contortus L3 larvae by direct injection into the abomasal lumen after surgically exposing the abomasum and were killed 2 days later (I2). Another group of adult sheep were infected orally with 5,000 L3 larvae each week for 12 weeks, drenched, and rested for 12 weeks before being challenged orally with 5 × 104L3 larvae and were killed 3 (I3) or 5 (I5) days later. Control sheep were treated equally but received phosphate-buffered saline instead of larvae at the last challenge. Samples of abomasal tissue were collected for histology and RNA preparation. Tissues from primary H. contortus infections of Merino sheep were obtained by orally infecting 3-month-old worm-free sheep once with 1–5 × 104 H. contortus L3 larvae and sacrificing them 3 or 5 days post-infection. Control sheep were uninfected. Tissue was collected for RNA preparation and histology. In addition, mucus was collected from the abomasum of these sheep for Western blot analysis by carefully scrapping mucus off the surface of the mucosa. Mucus was diluted 1/3 (w/v) with citrate buffer (10 mm citric acid, pH 5), spun at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored −20 °C. Adult Merino sheep were orally infected with ∼1 × 105 L3 larvae of the intestinal parasite, Trichostrongylus vitrinus, and sacrificed 3 days later. Samples were collected from small and large intestine for RNA preparation and histology. Intestinal samples from uninfected sheep were taken as controls. Mesenteric lymph nodes associated with the intestinal tissue were also collected for mRNA preparation. Mature non-lactating Merino ewes were primed by weekly intramammary infusions of ∼5 × 103 ex-sheathed H. contortus L3 larvae in 5 ml of sterile saline for 4–5 weeks as described previously (6Greenhalgh C.J. Jacobs H.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 7Rainbird M.A. Macmillan D. Meeusen E.N.T. Parasite Immunol. ( Oxf. ). 1998; 20: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ewes were then rested for 3–4 weeks before being challenged by intramammary infusion of ∼5 × 103 ex-sheathedH. contortus L3 larvae and were killed 4 days later, when large numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils are known to be present in the tissues (6Greenhalgh C.J. Jacobs H.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other ewes were not primed but were challenged with one intramammary infusion of ∼5 × 103 ex-sheathedH. contortus L3 larvae or were primed but not challenged. Control sheep received one intramammary infusion of sterile saline alone. Unprimed leukocyte populations were also induced by a single infusion of H. contortus larvae in the mammary glands of ewes orally infected with ∼80 metacereariae of the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica (7Rainbird M.A. Macmillan D. Meeusen E.N.T. Parasite Immunol. ( Oxf. ). 1998; 20: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and mammary tissues were collected 2 days later. Lung tissues with eosinophilic inflammation were obtained from sheep naturally infected with the small lung worm, Muellerius capillaris, as diagnosed by the presence of small nodules in the lung tissue and detection of nematodes in tissue sections. Histological examination demonstrated extensive infiltration of eosinophils and eosinophilic granulomas into the lung tissue of infected ewes. MAL of H. contortus sensitized and challenged (primed), or liver fluke infected and H. contortus challenged (unprimed) ewes, were collected 4 and 2 days post-challenge, respectively, by infusing 7 ml of sterile saline into the teat canal of the gland and then retrieving the fluid by gently milking the gland (6Greenhalgh C.J. Jacobs H.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 7Rainbird M.A. Macmillan D. Meeusen E.N.T. Parasite Immunol. ( Oxf. ). 1998; 20: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells within the MAL were spun down and washed three times with sterile saline before being resuspended directly into guanidinium thiocyanate solution for RNA preparation. Some of the unprimed leukocytes were cultured for 5 or 24 h with 100 ng/ml of recombinant human interleukin 5 (IL-5; Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA) before RNA extraction (7Rainbird M.A. Macmillan D. Meeusen E.N.T. Parasite Immunol. ( Oxf. ). 1998; 20: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The proportion of eosinophils in these MAL cells, as assessed by Giemsa-stained cytospots, varied from 52–92%. Monocytes and lymphocytes constituted the remainder of the cell population (5–32 and 3–16%, respectively). Lung worm infected or control sheep were sacrificed, and the lung and heart were removed from the chest cavity. Approximately 500 ml of saline was poured down the trachea, the lung was massaged for ∼2 min to ensure an even distribution of saline, and the saline/BAL fluid mixture was then drained from the lung. The procedure was repeated once. The saline/BAL fluid mix was centrifuged, and pelleted cells were washed twice before being used for RNA preparation. Cytospot analysis indicated that eosinophils represented 8% of cells in the BAL in infected sheep, whereas none were present in control sheep. Total RNA was purified from tissues using a standard guanidinium thiocyanate, phenol/chloroform extraction (8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 0.1–1 g of tissue, 0.5–1 ml of packed larvae, or ∼1 × 108 cells were used for RNA preparation. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the total RNA using Dynal beads as instructed by the manufacturer (Dynal, Melbourne, VIC, Australia). RDA was performed as described previously (3Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 4Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). RNA prepared from uninfected abomasal tissue was used as the driver. RNA prepared from the abomasal tissue of a sheep infected with H. contortus, collected 2 days post-challenge, was used as the tester. Double stranded cDNA was produced using the SuperScript™ Choice System (Life Technologies, Inc.). The double stranded cDNA was digested with Sau3A, ligated to annealed adaptors, and amplified by PCR (3Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Three rounds of subtractive hybridization PCRs were completed before three individual PCR bands were subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using the Big Dye sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 5′-end of the full-length ovgal11 cDNA was isolated using the 5′/3′-RACE kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and two specific primers (SP1, 5′ TCTGCCACTCCCGTCCGTGAAAG and SP2, 5′ ATGGAATGTTGCCGCCTTGCCCAG; see Fig. 1). Approximately 2 μg of total RNA prepared from an abomasum sample collected 3 days post-H. contortus challenge was used as the template for the reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction. As negative controls, a no-template RT sample and a no-tail cDNA sample were also used as templates in the subsequent PCRs. PCR products generated by the second round (nested) PCRs were subcloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using the Big Dye sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two RT-PCR primers were designed within the putative 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of ovgal11(ovgal115′-UTR; 5′ TTTCAACAGGGAAGAAAGGCCC andovgal113′-UTR; 5′ ATGAATTCGATCTTCCGCCCC). Approximately 1.25 μg of H. contortus infected abomasum total RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription. 2–10 μl of the RT mix was used as a template for 30 PCR cycles. The PCR products were sequenced directly using Big Dye (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) automated sequencing after being extracted from agarose gels by the Bresaspin gel purification kit (Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia). Northern blots were prepared as described previously (9Fourney R.M. Mlyakoshi J. Day III, R.S. Paterson M.C. Focus. 1988; 10: 5-6Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of total RNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fixed using 50 mm NaOH-soaked filter paper and UV treatment for 2–3 min. Membranes were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 7% SDS (w/v), 2 mm EDTA).32P-Labeled cDNA probes were generated from the RDA clone using Klenow and the Giga-prime kit (Bresatec). Probes were allowed to hybridize to the membranes in Church buffer overnight at 65 °C. The membranes were washed at high stringency in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37–45 °C. Kodak BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) was then exposed to the membranes for 1–24 h, or Fuji XAR film (Fuji Photo Film, Osaka, Japan) was exposed for 16–48 h. RT-PCR was used to amplify an ovgal11 cDNA containing the full coding region from total RNA extracted from H. contortus immunized and challenged abomasum collected 2 days post-challenge. The RT-PCR primers utilized contained restriction enzyme sites for subcloning into an expression vector and incorporated 11 nucleotide changes to alter 7 codons to those preferred in Escherichia coli(ovgal115′, 5′ AGGATCCATGGATAGCCTGCCGAACCCGTACCTG andovgal113′, 5′ TAGCGGCCGCTTACAGGGTATCCACGCTAGTCAG; altered nucleotides are shown in bold). The cDNA was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the GST fusion vector pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protease-deficient E. coli strain BL21 was then used to express the GST·OVGAL11 fusion protein as described in the GST Gene Fusion System manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, expression of the fusion protein was induced for 2 h at 30 °C with 0.1 mm IPTG once 100-ml cell cultures had reached a density of A 600 = 0.7. The fusion protein was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (Sigma) and cleaved from GST using PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purity of the recombinant protein preparation was confirmed by Coomassie-stained reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To generate polyclonal serum, rabbits were immunized three times intramuscularly at monthly intervals with ∼45 μg of purified recombinant OVGAL11 emulsified in, initially, 50% Freund's complete adjuvant and, subsequently, 50% Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). Serum was collected 21 days after the final immunization. The specificity and activity of the polyclonal antiserum was confirmed by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (not shown). Proteins from recombinant protein fractions, mucus, and tissue samples were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (MSI, Melbourne, Australia) by electroblotting at 100 V for 1 h (10Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with 1/100–1/1000 dilutions of primary antiserum for 90 min at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA)) for 30 min, signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fuji XAR film was exposed to the strips for 10–30 s. Rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-7 antiserum and polyclonal antiserum raised against an IL-10·GST fusion protein were used as negative controls. Histology samples were taken from all mammary, lung, intestine, and abomasum tissue samples from which RNA was extracted. They were fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin and processed to paraffin. 5 μm tissue sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin-Y (H&E). The sections were examined under the microscope, and the numbers of eosinophils infiltrating the mucosa were noted. 4–5-μm sections of Optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tek; Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN)-embedded, frozen tissue blocks were cut and fixed in 95% ethanol for 10 min at 4 °C or 5-μm sections of 100% ethanol fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by adding DAKO peroxidase blocking reagent. Primary polyclonal serum (diluted 1/500) was incubated with the slides for 1–2 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. A 1/100 dilution of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG; DAKO) was incubated with the slides for 1–2 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. Conjugate antibody was detected by incubating slides with 1.5 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. RDA was used to amplify cDNAs expressed at greater levels in H. contortus immunized and infected abomasum compared with uninfected abomasum. This resulted in the amplification of three predominant bands. Each band was subcloned individually, and at least eight clones were sequenced from each. This led to the identification of 12 different cDNAs. A BlastN search of all the nucleotide sequences revealed that one of the cDNA amplified, a 365-bp fragment, was most closely related to galectins (TableI). This cDNA, which represented 12% of the total number of clones sequenced, demonstrated marked differential expression by Northern blot analysis in infected and uninfected abomasum and was studied further. Given that this cDNA was isolated from a whole animal model of helminth infection, the initial characterization of the molecule has been conducted in whole animal infection models. Isolation of murine and human homologues ofovgal11 may make tissue culture-based systems more amenable to the study of this molecule in the future.Table INucleotide and amino acid identities between known galectins and ovgal11SpeciesNameNucleotide identityAmino acid identity%%Humanchromosome 1948.08Humangalectin 1041.8834.30Mousepartial galectin 1055.12 1-aThese identities are probably over-estimates of the total nucleotide identity given that the partial galectin 10 clones used in the comparison correspond to the highly conserved CRD.Orangutanpartial galectin 1052.20 1-aThese identities are probably over-estimates of the total nucleotide identity given that the partial galectin 10 clones used in the comparison correspond to the highly conserved CRD.Humangalectin 442.9529.20Rabbitgalectin 338.0329.20Humangalectin 9 variant38.6827.74Ratgalectin 537.1825.55Humangalectin 738.8925.55Humangalectin 938.8924.80Piggalectin 423.36Mousegalectin 643.1622.63H. contortusgalectin 138.2522.63Ratgalectin 736.5422.63Humangalectin 840.3821.90Piggalectin 216.06Sheepgalectin 116.06Ratgalectin 131.8416.06Cowgalectin 115.33Humangalectin 328.8515.33Humangalectin 114.60Nucleotide and amino acid identities between the genes/proteins indicated and the entire coding sequence of ovgal11.

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide and amino acid identities between the genes/proteins indicated and the entire coding sequence of ovgal11. The identities were calculated from multiple sequence alignments. From comparison to other galectins, a putative translation of the nucleotide sequence was performed. Using this putative reading frame a stop codon was found at the 3′-end of the clone only 14 bp upstream of the Sau3A restriction enzyme site that was used in the RDA. This stop codon is considered to be a preferred mammalian stop codon (11Tate W.P. Poole E.S. Horsfield J.A. Mannering S.A. Brown C.M. Moffat J.G. Dalphin M.E. McCaughan K.K. Major L.L. Wilson D.N. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, it was anticipated that the entire 3′-coding region was contained within the RDA product. However the 5′-end of the coding region did not contain an in-frame initiation codon (ATG) and therefore was considered incomplete. 5′-RACE was utilized to isolate the remaining 5′-sequence. The 5′-RACE resulted in a PCR product of 195 bp that contained 66 bp of overlap with the original RDA sequence (not including the SP2 primer). The 5′-RACE product appears to contain the remaining coding sequence. An in-frame ATG codon is found 42 bp downstream from the first nucleotide (Fig. 1), and it is contained within an almost perfect Kozak sequence (12Salamov A.A. Nishikawa T. Swindells M.B. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The short (41 bp) 5′-untranslated region of the cDNA contains an E box consensus sequence 30 bp downstream of the first nucleotide (Fig. 1). Comparison to the consensus sequence matrices in Mat inspector v2.2 2This program is available via the World Wide Web. indicate that this E box may be bound by the Class A basic helix loop helix transcription factor AP4. Preliminary analysis of the ovgal11 gene has demonstrated that it displays a similar genomic organization to that of other galectins. A partial genomic clone was amplified by PCR and found to contain an intron of 549 bp (not shown). The position of the intron (300 bp downstream from the putative translation start site; see Fig.1) matches that reported for prototype galectins (13Dyer K.D. Handen J.S. Rosenberg H.F. Genomics. 1997; 40: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given reports of strong transcriptional regulatory elements within the introns of other genes, including galectin 3 (14Raimond J. Rouleux F. Monsigny M. Legrand A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have also searched this intronic sequence for regulatory elements. Mat inspector v2.2 identified many potential regulatory sites. These include a Class B E box that may be bound by upstream stimulating factor, myc/max, or other Class B helix loop helix transcription factors and an AP1 consensus sequence. The sequence of the entire putative coding region of ovgal11was confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products from three sheep (GenBank™ accession number AF252548). One of the three sheep (also used in 5′-RACE) was found to contain the following 6 nucleotide substitutions when compared with the two other clones isolated: G126 to C126, G205 to C205, C212 to T212, T215 to C215, G216 to C216, and T384 to G384(Fig. 1). Three of these six nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid substitutions in the predicted amino acid sequence, Ala29to Pro29, Trp55 to Ser55, and Gly59 to Arg59. Given that the other two clones are identical, their predicted amino acid sequence is presented (Fig.1). The presence of natural polymorphisms within ovgall11 is consistent with the fact that, unlike rats and mice, which are greatly in-bred species, sheep, even within the same breed, are known to be genetically diverse. The predicted amino acid sequence (OVGAL11) encoded by the mRNA is 137 amino acids long. Blast searches of both the full nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences confirm that this clone is related to the family of galectins but not with sufficient identity to be considered the ovine homologue of a known galectin. Hence, the clone was considered to be a novel member of the galectin family and was named ovgal11. Galectins are sugar-binding proteins that all share a CRD. Of the known galectins, the predicted amino acid sequence of ovgal11 shows most homology to a prototype galectin called galectin 10 (overall nucleotide identity ∼42% and amino acid identity ∼34%; see Table I and Fig.2). Galectin 10 is also known as the Charcot-Leyden crystal and is an eosinophil lysophospholipase that may also be present in basophils. Unlike the other known galectins, galectin 10 only exhibits weak binding to lactose, and an endogenous ligand for its putative CRD has not yet been identified (15Dyer K.D. Rosenberg H.F. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Leonidas D.D. Elbert B.L. Zhou Z. Leffler H. Ackerman S.J. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The nucleotide Blast search also identified a human genomic clone isolated from chromosome 19. Part of this genomic clone corresponds to the human galectin 10 gene (positions 10343–17535); however, a sequence 19,497 bp downstream of this gene also demonstrates similarity to the clone (Table I). This putative gene is not considered to be the human homologue of the sheep clone, because it demonstrates only 48% nucleotide identity, whereas the galectins compared across species are usually well conserved (e.g. sheep and human galectin 1 share 87% amino acid identity, rat and human galectin 7 share 73% nucleotide identity, and human and rat galectin 1 share 62% nucleotide identity). No signaling peptide to target OVGAL11 to intracellular or extracellular locations has been identified in the putative amino acid sequence. A eukaryotic transmembrane domain prediction program (TM predict)2 indicates that the protein does not span a membrane. A putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site (position 120; SVK), two putative casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (positions 65 and 133; TFTD and TSVD, respectively), and a cell attachment sequence (position 127; RGD) have been recognized by a PROSITE data base search (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar).2 Despite the homology of ovgal11 to human galectin 10, expression of this clone within eosinophils was not detected by Northern blot hybridization. No expression was detected in total RNA extracted from any leukocyte population studied regardless of the percentage of eosinophils present, whether they were obtained from BAL (Fig.3 C) or from the mammary lavage of nematode challenged ewes, or were stimulated with IL-5 (Fig.3 A). No expression was detected in any mammary tissue regardless of the level of eosinophil infiltration found in those tissues (Fig. 3 B). Ovgal11 mRNA transcripts were not detected in total RNA prepared from adult H. contortus or L3 larvae indicating that the clone was of sheep, and not parasite, origin (Fig. 3 A). This was subsequently confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). In contrast, ovgal11 expression within 12 of 13 infected abomasal tissue samples of sensitized sheep was easily detected by Northern blot analysis at 2, 3, and 5 days post-challenge (Fig.3 D). In this experiment, none of the 8 controls had detectable levels of ovgal11 mRNA. The one infected abomasal sample in which expression could not be detected had very poor eosinophil infiltration, no detectable tissue larvae, and a large number of intraepithelial mast cells, indicating that rapid rejection of the nematode larvae through degranulation of mast cells may have occurred in this sheep (1Balic A. Bowles V.M. Meeusen E.N.T. Adv. Parasitol. 2000; 45: 181-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, expression was only detectable in those infected abomasum samples that supported tissue infiltration by large numbers of eosinophils. However, there did not appear to be a direct correlation between eosinophil numbers and the level ofovgal11 expression. There was no detectable expression within lymph nodes collected from the same infected abomasum tissue or control abomasum tissues (not shown). Northern blot analysis of abomasum samples detected strongovgal11 expression in the immunized sheep by 2 days post-infection (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast strong expression in abomasum samples obtained from naive sheep after primary infection with H. contortus was not detected until 5 days post-infection (Fig. 3 E). Significantly increased lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration in these primary infected sheep was also not apparent until day 5 post-infection (18Balic A. Bowles V.M. Meeusen E.N.T. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2000; 75: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this group of sheep very low levels of ovgal11 mRNA in two of three control samples were also detected when longer exposures were used (not shown). High ovgal11 mRNA levels were detected within the small intestine of sheep infected with T. vitrinus larvae (Fig.3 E). Histology confirmed that this tissue was also supporting eosinophil infiltration. T"
https://openalex.org/W2329946576,"Angiogenesis was identified as an early consequence of myc gene overexpression in two models of retroviral lymphomagenesis. Avian leukosis virus (ALV) induces bursal lymphoma in chickens after proviral c-myc gene integration, while the HB-1 retrovirus carries a v-myc oncogene and also induces metastatic lymphoma. Immunohistochemical studies of the effects of increased c-myc or v-myc overexpression revealed early angiogenesis within myc-transformed bursal follicles, which persisted in lymphomas and metastases. Abnormal vessel growth was consistently detected within 13 days after transplantation of a few myc-overexpressing progenitors into ablated bursal follicles, suggesting that these angiogenic changes may support the initial expansion of tumor precursors, as well as later stage lymphomagenesis. Conditioned media from myc-overexpressing B cell lines promoted proliferation of vascular endothelium in vitro, while media from B cells expressing low myc levels showed little effect. Moreover, ectopic myc overexpression in the low myc B cell lines increased production of the endothelial growth activity, indicating that myc induces secretion of angiogenic factors from B cells. These findings demonstrate that myc overexpression in lymphocytes generates an angiogenic phenotype in vitro as well as in vivo. Oncogene (2000)."
https://openalex.org/W2058495945,"Multiple families of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE) have been described, and the regulated expression of these genes in cells is complex. Although cAMP is known to control the expression of certain PDE in cells, presumably reflecting a system of feedback on cAMP signaling, relatively little is known about the influence of non-cAMP signaling systems on PDE expression. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism by which activators of the protein kinase C (PKC)-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade regulate phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and assess the functional consequences of this effect. Whereas a prolonged elevation of cAMP in VSMC resulted in a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent induction of expression of two PDE4D variants (PDE4D1 and PDE4D2), simultaneous activation of both the cAMP-PKA and PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascades blunted this cAMP-mediated increase in PDE4D expression. By using biochemical, molecular biological, and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that this PDE4D-selective effect of activators of the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade was mediated through a mechanism involving altered PDE4D mRNA stability and markedly attenuated the cAMP-mediated desensitization that results from prolonged activation of the cAMP signaling system in cells.

Cyclic nucleotide-mediated signaling is terminated either when the stimulus for generation of cAMP or cGMP is removed or when cyclic nucleotides are hydrolyzed. Hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP is catalyzed by members of a multigene family of enzymes called cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE).1 In mammals, 10 individual families of PDE have been described with each classified on the basis of molecular sequence, substrate selectivity, and inhibitor sensitivity (1Beavo J.A.

Each PDE family has been shown to comprise several individual genes, each of which can be alternatively processed to yield several different mRNA. In most instances members of several PDE families are expressed in individual cells, with differential subcellular targeting, and selective regulation by phosphorylation by various protein kinases emerging as important factors in determining their individual roles (5Juilfs D.M. Soderling S. Burns F. Beavo J.A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 67-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol.

Due to the important role played by both cAMP and cGMP in the regulation of myocardial contractility and blood vessel relaxation, the PDE present in these tissues have received a considerable amount of attention as therapeutic targets (9Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 10Polson J.B. Strada S.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Members of at least four PDE families (PDE1, PDE3, PDE4, and PDE5) have been shown to contribute to termination of cyclic nucleotide signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (10Polson J.B. Strada S.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whereas enzymes of the PDE1 and PDE5 families hydrolyze cGMP, members of the PDE1, PDE3, and PDE4 families catalyze the breakdown of cAMP. A large body of evidence supports important roles for PDE3 and PDE4 in the regulation of cAMP-mediated effects in VSMC, and much of this evidence is consistent with the idea that these enzymes regulate separate, although overlapping, cAMP pools in cells (10–26). Thus, a strong correlation exists between the increase in cAMP which occurs as a result of the pharmacological inhibition of PDE3 activity and inhibition of VSMC contractions (10Polson J.B. Strada S.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 11Lugnier C. Schoeffter P. Le Bec A. Strouthou E. Stoclet J.C. Biochem.

In contrast, although pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 raises VSMC cAMP levels, and PDE4 inhibitors inhibit VSMC proliferation (16Souness J.E. Hassall G.A. Parrott D.P. Biochem.

In this context, dual-selectivity PDE3/PDE4 inhibitors may prove useful agents in cells expressing members of both these enzyme families (9Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol.

Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In both human and rat four distinct genes encode PDE4 enzymes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), with each, as a result of alternate splicing or the use of alternate promoters, giving rise to multiple variants (7Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recently, a significant amount has been elucidated concerning the regulation of PDE4 activity and expression in cells. Indeed, it is now clear that selective PDE4 variants can be regulated by transcriptional and/or by post-translational mechanisms (7Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Presumably reflecting a form of negative feedback for cAMP signaling, phosphorylation and activation of certain PDE4 variants by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) have been reported (7Conti M.

Although a mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a PDE4B variant had no functional consequences (34Lenhard J.M. Kassel D.B. Rocque W.J. Hamacher L. Holmes W.D. Patel I. Hoffman C. Luther M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade has recently been shown to affect PDE4D3 activity, perhaps in a cell-dependent manner (32Liu H.

While in HEK293 cells, ERK2-mediated phosphorylation led to a transient inhibition of PDE4D3 activity (33Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and activation of the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in rat aortic VSMC activated and translocated particulate PDE4D3 to the cytosol of these cells (32Liu H.

In addition to this acute effect of cAMP elevation, more prolonged increases in cellular cAMP have been shown to bring about marked increases in PDE4 activity in several cell types (18Rose R.J.

Interestingly, although these treatments always result in elevated levels of PDE4 activity, thePDE4 gene responsible appears to be cell type-specific. For example, while incubation with forskolin decreased the expression level of PDE4A and increased that of PDE4D in Jurkat cells (40Erdogan S. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a similar treatment of selected monocyte cell lines resulted in marked elevations in PDE4A expression and increases, or decreases, in PDE4D expression (38Verghese M.W. McConnell R.T. Lenhard J.M. Hamacher L. Jin S.-L.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1164-1171PubMed Google Scholar, 39Manning C.D. Mclaughlin M.M. Livi G.P. Cieslinski L.B. Torphy T.J. Barnette M.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 810-818PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, changes in PDE4B expression have also been reported following treatment with cAMP-elevating agents. Thus, treatment of rats with a prostacyclin analogue caused a marked increase, and decrease, in myocardial PDE4B and PDE4D, respectively (42Kostic M.M. Erdogan S. Rena G. Borchert G. Hoch B.

Recently, we have begun to investigate the role of cAMP in controlling PDE4 activity and expression in VSMC (18Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Liu H. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Palmer D. Tsoi K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a result of these studies, we recently reported that the two PDE4D variants expressed in rat aortic VSMC, PDE4D3 and PDE4D5, were activated following phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) (32Liu H. Maurice D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a selective PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade-mediated phosphorylation of the particulate fraction of PDE4D3 in these cells was shown to increase the efficiency with which this enzyme was phosphorylated by PKA and to result in the translocation of this particulate PDE4D3 (32Liu H. Maurice D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we have investigated the impact of the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade on the effects of prolonged increases in cAMP elevation on PDE4D activity and expression in VSMC. We show that a prolonged increase in cAMP results in a marked increase in the expression of two short variants of thePDE4D gene (PDE4D1 and PDE4D2) and that activation of the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade blunts this increase. Our data are discussed in the context of the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade having a biphasic effect on PDE4D activity in VSMC, increasing it in the short term, but decreasing it in the long term, and are consistent with a paradigm in which PDE4D activity and expression are subject to regulation by multiple and overlapping signaling systems. Tissue culture reagents (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, calf serum, HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), trypsin-EDTA), SuperScript reverse transcriptase, and Taq DNA polymerase were from Life Technologies Inc. Radioactive products were from NEN Life Science Products, (5′-[14C]AMP, [14C]cAMP, [3H]cAMP, and [α-32P]dCTP). Ro 20-1724 and cilostamide were from Calbiochem, and isobutylmethylxanthine, forskolin, and 8-Br-cAMP were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick MA). Tris-HCl, benzamidine, EDTA, EGTA, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, and NaCl were from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA), and leupeptin, Affi-Gel 601, Dowex 50 (200–400 mesh), alumina, and the columns supports were from Bio-Rad. The BCA protein assay and bovine serum albumin were from Pierce. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and purchased from Fisher. PDE4D-specific monoclonal antibody was provided by ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA). Primary cultures of rat aortic VSMC were prepared as described previously (18Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). VSMC were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 8 mm HEPES buffer, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For all experiments, cells were used between passages 4 and 12. Culture media were removed and replaced with fresh culture media supplemented with either (i) forskolin (0.1–100 μm), (ii) 8-Br-cAMP (0.01–1 mm), (iii) PMA (0.1–100 nm), (iv) angiotensin II (0.1–1.0 μm), or (v) vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)). At the end of the incubation period, treated cells were washed with HBSS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and harvested in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. Cells were removed from the flask by scraping. Cellular debris and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The 1,000 × g supernatant was transferred to microtubes and stored at 4 °C until assayed for cAMP PDE activity (see below). For some experiments cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared. In these instances, rat aortic VSMC were lysed as described above except that Triton X-100 was excluded from the lysis and the 1,000 × g supernatant subjected to a further centrifugation step (132,000 × g). cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was assayed as described previously (18Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing 5 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 μmol of MgCl2, 10 nmol of EGTA, and 0.1 nmol of [3H]cAMP containing 55,000–80,000 dpm for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction were terminated by addition of 50 μl of 0.5m ice-cold EDTA (pH 7.4) supplemented with 5′-[14C]AMP (1,800 dpm). Samples were diluted with 0.3 ml of HEPES-NaCl buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 8.5)) prior to purification of the product of the reaction, 5′-[3H]AMP. 5′-[3H]AMP and 5′-[14C]AMP were recovered by chromatography using a polyacrylamide-boronate gel column (Affi-Gel 601, 1-ml bed volume), and the purified 5′-[3H]AMP was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, corrected for recovery of 5′-[14C]AMP, normalized to the total protein used in the assay, and the total activity expressed as pmol min−1 mg−1 of protein. Total protein concentration of each sample was determined using the BCA Protein Assay system from Pierce, according to the manufacturer's methodology using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In experiments in which the impact of forskolin, PMA, AngII, or a combination of these agents on VSMC cAMP levels was determined, the method of Maurice et al. (43Maurice D.H. Lee R.M. Haslam R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, confluent cultures of VSMC were incubated for 16 h with fresh culture media supplemented with 10 μCi ml−1 [3H]hypoxanthine. Radiolabeled cells were rinsed with fresh medium and incubated with either (i) forskolin (0.1–10 μm), (ii) PMA (100 nm), (iii) angiotensin II (100 nm), or combinations of forskolin (0.1–10 μm) and PMA (100 nm) or angiotensin II (100 nm) in 0.5 ml for 5 min. Similarly, when increases in VSMC cAMP levels caused by isoproterenol were measured, VSMC were incubated for 16 h with fresh culture media supplemented with 10 μCi ml−1 [3H]hypoxanthine and forskolin (10 μm), PMA (100 nm), or both forskolin and PMA for 16 h. Radiolabeled cells were rinsed with fresh medium and incubated with isoproterenol (0.01 μm-1.0 μm), Ro 20-1724 (10 μm), Zardaverine (10 μm), or combinations of these agents for 5 min. In all cases, reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following addition of recovery markers, [14C]cAMP (700 dpm), [3H]cAMP was isolated and purified by column chromatography on alumina and Dowex 50 and quantitated by liquid scintillation. The corrected [3H]cAMP present in individual samples was expressed as a percentage of the total [3H] present in the cells in that sample. RNA purification and RT-PCRs were carried out as described previously (19Liu H. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was purified from cultured rat aortic VSMC (5–10 × 106 cells), using a single step procedure, Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc). First strand cDNA was generated from 5 to 10 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT)18 (Cortec, Kingston, Ontario) to prime the reverse transcription (SuperScript Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase). Amplification reactions were performed using Taq DNA polymerase with 1–10 μl of the first strand reaction (total volume 100 μl) and 20 pmol each of PDE4D splice variant-specific sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers. Conditions for PCR were 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for a number of cycles that were determined empirically to allow linear amplification of the relevant template (PDE4D3 (22–30 cycles), PDE4D1 (25–31 cycles), or PDE4D2 (27–32 cycles)). In some experiments, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP was added to assist in quantitating amounts of PCR products generated. All PCRs were carried out with the same antisense primer (5′-CGCTAGTACAATGTCAATGGCC-3′) and one sense primer specific for the required PDE4D gene splice variant PDE4D3 (5-TCCTGGATATGTTTCGATGTGG-3′), PDE4D2 (5′-ACGGCCTCCAACAAGTTCAAG-3′), and PDE4D1 (5′-AAGCGCTTAAGAACTGAGTCC). Amplification of RNA encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5′-AGCATCAAAGGTGGAAGAATG-3′; 5′-GGTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT-3′) served as a control. When stability of PDE4D gene products was assessed, RNA was purified from forskolin-treated rat aortic VSMC at 10-min intervals following addition of actinomycin D (4 μm) for a total of 280 min and processed as described above. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Amounts of PDE4D RNA amplified were determined by scanning densitometry using Corel Photo-Paint 8.0 software as per manufacturer's recommendations and liquid scintillation counting of isolated bands. VSMC cultures incubated with compounds of interest were homogenized in a buffer consisting of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. These samples (5–20 μg of total homogenate protein or of protein from isolated subcellular fractions) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and the membranes were blocked by incubation with TBST (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% powdered Nonfat milk for 1 h. Blots were incubated with an appropriate dilution of PDE4D antibody for 1–2 h and rinsed three times with TBST. Rinsed blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h and then rinsed with TBST, and immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence as per manufacturer's recommendations. When available, purified recombinant human PDE4D1 or PDE4D3 (ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA) was used to determine the specificity of the antiserum and for comparison of molecular masses. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Within each experiment, values were means from three individual determinations for each experimental condition. Statistical differences between cAMP PDE activities or between [3H]cAMP levels were determined using the Student's t test for either paired or unpaired samples, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Consistent with our previous work (18Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Liu H. Maurice D.H. Br. J.

By using a selective inhibitor of PDE3 (cilostamide, 1 μm) or of PDE4 (Ro 20-1724, 10 μm) to measure these activities, a 16-h incubation of VSMC with forskolin (10 μm) caused increases of 210 ± 22 and 108 ± 17% in PDE3 (not shown) and PDE4 (Table I), respectively. Recently, we reported that both the cytosolic PDE3A as well as the particulate PDE3B were increased in rat aortic VSMC following prolonged increases in cAMP (19Liu H. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Changes in cytosolic and particulate PDE4 activities were also noted in our experiments (TableI). Although some of the increase in PDE4 at short times could be due to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 (32Liu H. Maurice D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), since the increases using our treatment protocol were inhibited by addition of either actinomycin D or cycloheximide, a role for de novomRNA and protein synthesis was established (TableII).Table IIncubation of rat aortic VSMC with forskolin increases cAMP PDE activityFractionTimecAMP PDE activityTotalPDE4hpmol/min/mg1,000 × gsupernatant0100.0 ± 2.367.0 ± 1.34113.1 ± 1.91-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.72.4 ± 2.78146.2 ± 3.11-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.90.9 ± 1.91-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.16240.5 ± 12.41-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.120.6 ± 4.51-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.100,000 × gsupernatant087.1 ± 2.360.8 ± 2.3495.1 ± 3.264.4 ± 3.78105.2 ± 4.31-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.70.9 ± 2.11-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.16165.7 ± 9.11-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.112.7 ± 7.31-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.100,000 × gparticulate040.3 ± 2.325.3 ± 1.1461.6 ± 1.91-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the presence or absence of Ro 20–1724.30.8 ± 1.91-ap < 0.05 when compared with 0-h time point in the pre"

Although recent studies have suggested the possible role of a zinc finger transcription factor, GATA-6, in the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the downstream gene targeted by GATA-6 is unknown. The expression of smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain (Sm-MHC) provides a highly specific marker for the differentiated phenotype of VSMCs as well as the smooth muscle cell lineage. Here, we show that GATA-6 bound to a GATA-like motif (−810/−805) within the rat Sm-MHC promoter in a sequence-specific manner and activated this promoter through this site. In addition, we show that the transcriptional coactivator p300 associated with GATA-6 during the transcription of the Sm-MHC gene. A p300/GATA-6 complex in VSMCs was up-regulated by induction of the quiescent phenotype. A wild-type E1A, which interferes with endogenous p300, but not a mutant E1A defective for p300 binding, markedly down-regulated the expression of endogenous Sm-MHC in quiescent-phenotype VSMCs. These studies provide the first identification of a functionally important GATA-6 binding site within a smooth muscle-specific promoter and suggest a role for p300 in the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in VSMCs as a coactivator of GATA-6.

Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The proliferating SMCs within thickened arterial intima are phenotypically altered compared with normal medial SMCs (3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 8White S. Martin A. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1252-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Babij P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These alterations include decreased expression of proteins characteristic of differentiated SMCs, including the smooth muscle isoforms of contractile proteins (reviewed in Ref.3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Because the expression of these isoforms is closely correlated with the phenotypic state of VSMCs and the growth properties of the cells, it is of fundamental importance to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the expression of smooth muscle-specific proteins in order to understand vascular pathology. Our understanding of muscle gene expression has been greatly advanced in recent years by the identification of several key ciselements and trans factors that regulate cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific transcription (10Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yu Y.-T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B.

However, little is known about the myogenic program that controls smooth muscle-specific gene expression. Recently, a zinc finger protein, GATA-6, which is expressed in VSMCs, was cloned (13Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GATA-6 is a member of the GATA family of transcription factors which comprises six members. The GATA-1/2/3 subfamily is expressed in the hematopoietic cell lineage, and each of these regulates a unique lineage-specific developmental program (14Simon M.C. Nat Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GATA-4/5/6 genes encode a subfamily of factors that are expressed in the cardiovascular system and endodermal derivatives (14Simon M.C. Nat Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Jiang Y. Evans T. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 16Laverriere A.C. MacNeil C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, GATA-6 is the only member of the GATA family that is expressed in VSMCs (17Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 18Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and its expression in VSMCs is rapidly down-regulated upon mitogen stimulation (13Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of GATA-6 in proliferating VSMCs induces cell cycle arrest (20Perlman H. Suzuki E. Simonson M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13713-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These data suggest that GATA-6 plays a role in the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in VSMCs. However, the downstream smooth muscle-specific gene targeted by GATA-6 has yet to be identified. Cell type-specific gene expression is established through the combinatorial action of restricted and more widely expressed transcription factors. The architecture of a regulatory element directs the assembly of these factors into higher-order structures that ultimately determine the transcriptional readout. Recently, we reported that adenovirus E1A oncoprotein represses the GATA-5-dependent transactivation of a promoter derived from the cardiac-restricted atrial natriuretic factor gene. This repression was correlated with the interaction of E1A with p300, indicating that p300 participates in GATA-5-dependent transactivation (21Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). p300 proteins are transcriptional coactivators that communicate between transactivators binding on enhancer DNA and the basal transcriptional complex formed on the promoter near the transcription initiation site (22Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. Decaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The members of this family, which thus far include p300 and the cAMP-response element binding protein binding protein (CBP), interact directly with components of the basal transcriptional apparatus (e.g. TFIIB and TATA-binding protein (23Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 24Yuan W.

Moran E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar)) and diverse enhancer-binding proteins. The interaction of p300 and GATA proteins and a possible role of GATA-6 in VSMC differentiation suggest the hypothesis that p300 mediates smooth muscle-specific gene expression. For the preceding reasons, in the present study we investigated the roles of p300 and GATA-6 in smooth muscle-specific transcription. For this purpose, we utilized a promoter derived from a gene encoding smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain (Sm-MHC), a well characterized smooth muscle-specific contractile protein (3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). In addition to the usefulness of this protein as a highly specific marker for the smooth muscle lineage, the expression of Sm-MHC is decreased or absent in proliferating, dedifferentiated VSMCs (8White S. Martin A. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1252-C1258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Biol.

Once SMCs in the neointima of atherosclerotic vessels cease proliferating, they re-express the SM1 Sm-MHC isoform (28Kuro-o M. Nagai R. Nakahara K. Katoh H. Tsai R.C. Tsuchimochi H. Yazaki Y. Ohkubo A. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3768-3773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Sm-MHC gene provides a potentially useful promoter for studying the regulation of the SMC differentiation state and the factors involved in specifying the proliferative or quiescent/differentiated SMC phenotype. We present data showing that GATA-6 binds a conserved GATA-like motif within the rat Sm-MHC promoter in a sequence-specific manner and that p300 and GATA-6 cooperate in activating the Sm-MHC promoter. The involvement of p300 in Sm-MHC gene transcription as a coactivator of GATA-6 provides further insights into the transcriptional program that directs phenotype modulation of VSMCs. The plasmid construct pSm-MHC-CAT, consisting of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by the 1346 bp of the rat Sm-MHC gene promoter (29Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B.

Owens (University of Virginia, Charlottesville). Site-directed mutagenesis of the distal (−810/−805) GATA element in the context of the 836-bp rat Sm-MHC promoter was performed by amplifying part of the Sm-MHC sequence with polymerase chain reaction (pmutSm-MHCluc). The corresponding wild type Sm-MHC promoter with the same length was also generated by polymerase chain reaction (pwtSm-MHCluc). pRSVluc and pRSVCAT contain the luciferase (luc) gene and the CAT gene driven by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat sequences, respectively (30Hasegawa K.

COS7 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then transfected with a total of less than 5 μg of DNA in 60-mm plates using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After a 5-h incubation with DNA-LipofectAMINE complex, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and further incubated in the medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for luciferase and CAT assays as described (30Hasegawa K. Mayers M.B. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously from COS7 cells transfected with phGATA-6 and from either proliferating or differentiated-phenotype VSMCs. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were designed based on the rat Sm-MHC upstream sequences that contained a GATA-like motif (−815/−810 relative to the transcription start site).

Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE (1× TBE, 100 mm Tris, 100 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Primary human aortic VSMCs were obtained from Kurabo Industries Ltd. and cultured in medium provided by the manufacturer with epithelial growth factor (0.5 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (2 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), and 5% fetal bovine serum. VSMCs (passages 6) were washed twice with serum-free media and then transfected with 2 μg of DNA in 60-mm plates using lipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After a 3-h incubation with DNA-PLUS-LipofectAMINE complex, VSMCs were cultured in low-serum medium (1% fetal bovine serum) in the absence of growth factors to induce the differentiated phenotype. 48 h later, these cells were harvested with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μm aprotinin) for subsequent Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS7 cells transfected with 10 μg of pCMVwtp300 and 2 μg of phGATA-6. Aliquots of the extracts containing 1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated using anti-mouse GATA-6 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a corresponding amount of normal rabbit IgG in low stringency buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 16 h at 4 °C and incubated with protein G (Sigma) beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), heated to 95 °C for 2 min, electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (6%), transferred to an Immobilon membrane, reacted with monoclonal antibodies against human p300 (a mixture of RW128, RW105, and RW109 antibodies, Upstate Biotechnology), and then detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoreseach Laboratories). Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting for Sm-MHC and β-actin was performed using aliquots (10 μg of protein) of cell lysates prepared from VSMCs transfected with pwtE1A, pdel2-36E1A, or CMVβgal. Both primary antibodies were obtained from Dako Laboratories. Western blotting for E1A was performed as described previously (21Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J.

Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test where appropriate, with a probability value of less than 0.05 taken to indicate significance. We could not find a consensus GATA motif (WGATAR) within the 1346-bp region of the rat Sm-MHC promoter sequence by a computer search. It has been shown that GATA factors can bind to “WGATTR” as well (17Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 18Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We found this GATA-like motif at sequences −810/−805 and −709/−704 relative to the transcription start site. This motif is conserved between humans and rats. To determine whether the distal GATA-like motif (−810/−805) in the rat Sm-MHC promoter can interact with GATA-6, EMSAs were performed. Nuclear extracts prepared from COS7 cells overexpressing GATA-6 were probed with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the distal GATA-like motif (−810/−805) in the presence or absence of competitor DNAs (Fig.1). Competition EMSAs revealed that a retarded band represented specific binding (Fig. 1, lane 2), as evidenced by the fact that it was competed out by a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 1, lane 3). The retarded band was absent in nuclear extracts prepared from COS7 cells overexpressing β-galactosidase as a control (Fig. 1, lane 1). In contrast to the competition by the wild type Sm-MHC GATA site, the gel shift could not be competed out by an oligonucleotide containing the distal GATA-like motif (−810/−805), at which point mutations had been introduced (Fig. 1, lane 4). The retarded band also could not be competed out by an oligonucleotide containing the proximal GATA-like motif (−709/−704) (data not shown). To further confirm that the retarded band represents an interaction of the probe with GATA-6, we performed supershift experiments. The retarded band was strongly supershifted by anti-GATA-6 antibody (Fig. 1, lane 6) but not by either anti-GATA-4 antibody (Fig. 1, lane 7) or normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 1, lane 5). Thus, GATA-6 can bind to the GATA-like motif (−810/−805) within the rat Sm-MHC promoter in a sequence-specific manner. To determine whether a forced expression of GATA-6 can transactivate the rat Sm-MHC promoter via the distal GATA site, we performed transient transfection experiments using COS7 cells. We co-transfected a luciferase expression vector driven by the 836-bp wild type Sm-MHC promoter (pwtSm-MHCluc) or the Sm-MHC promoter with a mutation in the distal GATA site (pmutSm-MHCluc) with eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding 0.5 or 2.0 μg of GATA-6 expression vector (phGATA-6). The total amount of DNA was kept constant by co-transfecting pCMVβ-gal. The transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfected pRSVCAT activity. As shown in Fig.2, the expression of GATA-6 resulted in the activation of the wild type Sm-MHC promoter, and this activation was significantly reduced by the distal GATA site mutation that ablates GATA-6 binding. These findings demonstrate that GATA-6 transactivation of the Sm-MHC promoter is dependent on an intact GATA sequence. To examine the role of the GATA site in VSMCs of proliferative and differentiated phenotypes, VSMCs were co-transfected with 3 μg of pwtSm-MHCluc or pmutSm-MHCluc and 0.6 μg of pRSVCAT. Then, these cells were cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum with growth factors to maintain the proliferative phenotype or in a low serum (1%) medium in the absence of growth factors to induce differentiated phenotype. 48 h later, the cells were collected and luciferase activities normalized with co-transfected pRSVCAT activity were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in the proliferative phenotype of VSMCs, mutation of the GATA element within the Sm-MHC promoter decreased the promoter activity by only 12%. In the differentiated phenotype, however, the mutation decreased the activity more than 40%. Thus, the GATA element may play a more important role in the maintenance of the transcriptional activity of the Sm-MHC promoter in the differentiated phenotype of VSMCs than in the proliferative phenotype. To determine whether GATA-6 and p300 associate in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitations followed by Western blotting. COS7 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding p300 (pCMVwtp300) and one encoding GATA-6 (phGATA-6) or β-galactosidase as a control (pCMVβ-gal) (Fig.3). 48 h later, nuclear extracts derived from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-p300 antibody as a positive control (Fig. 3, lane 1), normal rabbit IgG (lane 2) as a negative control, or an anti-GATA-6 antibody (lanes 3 and4). Western blotting using the anti-p300 antibody showed that the anti-GATA-6 antibody did not coprecipitate p300 protein from nuclear extracts expressing p300 alone (lane 3). However, the anti-GATA-6 antibody (lane 4) but not normal rabbit IgG (lane 2) coprecipitated p300 protein from nuclear extracts expressing both p300 and GATA-6, even after extensive washing. Thus, p300 interacted with GATA-6. To examine possible functional cooperation between GATA-6 and p300, we performed transient transfection assays in COS7 cells. We cotransfected a CAT expression vector driven by the 1346-bp Sm-MHC promoter region together with a eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding GATA-6 alone or in combination with a vector encoding p300. The transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfected pRSVluc activity. 48 h later, we measured the Sm-MHC reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 4, the coexpression of p300 and GATA-6 induced a marked (22-fold) stimulation of expression of the reporter above the levels observed with either GATA-6 or p300 alone (2.9- and 6.6-fold, respectively). Therefore, the transcription regulatory activity of GATA-6 is markedly enhanced by p300. A small fragment of p300 (1514–1922) lacks the transactivation ability shown by Gal4 reporter assays (24Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) but retains the ability to interact with GATA factors (21Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, this small fragment acts as a dominant negative mutant (21Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of p300 in the GATA-6-mediated transactivation of the Sm-MHC promoter, we cotransfected a Sm-MHC reporter plasmid into COS7 cells together with the GATA-6 expression vector alone, or in combination with a vector encoding the dominant negative mutant of p300 (pCMV1514–1922p300). 48 h later, we measured the Sm-MHC reporter activity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, a significant reduction in the GATA-6-dependent reporter activity was specifically induced by the coexpression of the dominant negative mutant. These results suggest the requirement of endogenous p300 in GATA-6-dependent transcription. To determine whether Sm-MHC GATA binding activity is modulated depending on the phenotype of VSMCs, EMSAs were performed. Nuclear extracts prepared from VSMCs with either proliferating (Fig. 5A, lane 1) or differentiated (Fig. 5, A, lanes 2–6and B, lanes 1–4) phenotype were probed with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the Sm-MHC GATA site in the presence or absence of competitor DNAs. The induction of the differentiated phenotype was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-smooth muscle-specific actin antibody. As shown in Fig.5 A, competition EMSAs revealed that a retarded band represented specific binding, as evidenced by the fact that it was competed out by an excess of unlabeled Sm-MHC GATA oligonucleotide (lanes 3 and 4) but not by the same amount of an oligonucleotide containing the Sm-MHC GATA site with a mutation (lanes 5 and 6). To further confirm that the retarded band represents an interaction of the probe with GATA-6, we performed supershift experiments. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the retarded band was supershifted by anti-GATA-6 antibody (lane 3) but not by anti-GATA-4 antibody (lane 2). Furthermore, the retarded band was supershifted by anti-p300 antibody (lane 4), suggesting that GATA-6 formed a complex with p300 in VSMCs with the differentiated phenotype. Notably, the amount of the specific complex containing p300 and GATA-6 markedly increased in nuclear extracts from VSMCs with the differentiated phenotype (Fig.5 A, lane 2) as compared with those from VSMCs with the proliferating phenotype (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). To investigate the role of endogenous p300 in differentiated-phenotype VSMCs, we performed Western blotting after expressing adenovirus E1A 12S oncoprotein or an E1A 12S mutant protein with an amino-terminal deletion resulting in loss of its ability to bind to p300. Differentiated-phenotype VSMCs were transfected with pwtE1A, pdel2-36E1A, or pCMVβ-gal as a control. Whole cell extracts were obtained from these cells and subjected to Western blotting using an anti-Sm-MHC antibody. As shown in Fig.6, the expression of Sm-MHC was markedly reduced in VSMCs transfected with a wild type E1A expression vector (lane 2) as compared with cells transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector (lane 1). However, transfection with E1Adel2-36, encoding a mutant defective for p300 binding, minimally affected the expression of the Sm-MHCz (lane 3). In contrast, VSMC expression of ubiquitously expressed β-actin was altered by neither wild type E1A nor mutant E1A. We checked the expression of E1A in VSMCs transfected with an expression vector encoding wild type or mutant E1A, or that encoding β-galactosidase as a control. As shown in Fig. 6, wild type and mutant E1A were abundantly and similarly expressed in VSMCs transfected with a correspondent expression vector. There was no E1A expression detectable in VSMCs transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector. These findings suggest that endogenous p300 in differentiated-phenotype VSMCs plays a role in the maintenance of smooth muscle-specific Sm-MHC expression. Determining the molecular mechanisms of VSMC differentiation is important for the understanding of vascular disease, because VSMCs can undergo a dedifferentiation process referred to as phenotypic modulation in response to vascular injury. Phenotypically modulated VSMCs are proliferative and express low levels of contractile proteins. However, the precise mechanisms that mediate transcriptional regulation during this process are poorly understood. It has been shown that a zinc finger transcription factor, GATA-6, is expressed in VSMCs and is rapidly down-regulated when VSMCs are induced to proliferate (13Suzuki E. Evans T. Lowry J. Truong L. Bell D.W. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Genomics. 1996; 38: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, GATA-6 induces cell cycle arrest with a concomitant increase in the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (20Perlman H. Suzuki E. Simonson M. Smith R.C. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13713-13718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that GATA-6 is involved in the promotion of the quiescent phenotype in VSMCs. However, the downstream gene targeted by GATA-6 is unknown. Sm-MHC expression is highly restricted to differentiated phenotype VSMCs and provides a useful marker for this phenotype. By a computer search, we found two GATA-like motifs (−810/−805 and −709/−704) within the rat Sm-MHC promoter. These motifs are conserved in rats and humans, suggesting their functional importance. EMSAs in the present study demonstrated that GATA-6 bound the distal GATA-like motif (−810/−805) in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, activation of this promoter by GATA-6 was significantly reduced by the mutation of this element. Although these data do not rule out the possibility that GATA-6 binds other sequences within this promoter, they provide the first identification of a functionally important GATA-6 binding site within a smooth muscle-specific promoter. Cell type-specific gene expression is established through the combinatorial actions of restricted and more widely expressed transcription factors. The p300 protein is a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional coactivator and is involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle differentiation (21Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Previous studies, including ours (21Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), demonstrated that p300 interacts with a zinc finger domain of GATA transcription factors. Because zinc finger regions are highly conserved among members of the GATA family, it seemed likely that p300 might be able to interact with GATA-6 as well. We showed that p300 interacted with GATA-6 and markedly augmented the GATA-6-dependent transcription of the Sm-MHC promoter. The marked potentiation of GATA-6-dependent transactivation by p300 indicates that p300 participates in the transactivation mediated by the interaction between GATA-6 and the Sm-MHC GATA element. Because p300 is found in complexes containing TFIIB and TATA-binding protein, the interaction between p300 and GATA-6 suggests that p300 serves as a link between GATA-6 and the basal transcriptional complex during transactivation. This feature of p300 defines it as a transcriptional coactivator for GATA-6 in the transcription of the Sm-MHC gene. The involvement of p300 in VSMC differentiation was further suggested by experiments that used the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein to interfere with p300. A wild type E1A but not a mutant E1A, which had lost the ability to interact with p300, was able to inhibit the endogenous expression of Sm-MHC in differentiated-phenotype VSMCs. Taken together, these findings suggest a role for p300 in the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype in VSMCs as a coactivator of GATA-6. EMSA experiments provide evidence, albeit indirect, that p300 interacts with GATA-6 in differentiated-phenotype VSMCs. A nuclear complex containing p300 and GATA-6 was markedly up-regulated during the induction of the differentiated phenotype. However, neither the expression level of p300 nor of GATA-6 differed between the proliferating and differentiated-phenotype VSMCs (data not shown). These findings suggest that phenotype modulation regulates p300 and/or GATA-6 post-translationally and alters the interaction between these two proteins. At present, the precise mechanisms that regulate this interaction are unclear. Interestingly, Kitabayashi and colleagues (34Kitabayashi I. Eckner R. Arany Z. Chiu R. Gachelin G. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that changes in the phosphorylation status of p300 are correlated with retinoic acid-induced terminal differentiation of embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. They found that p300/differentiation regulatory factor-containing complexes exist in F9 cells and bind their target DNA sequences. They speculated that differently phosphorylated forms of p300 might reflect a dual role for this protein in positive and negative regulation of transcription, with unphosphorylated p300 correlated with a repressive activity of the protein toward the c-jun promoter in undifferentiated cells. In this model, upon stimulation of cells with retinoic acid, p300 would become hyperphosphorylated and transcriptionally active. p300 hyperphosphorylation also occurs in calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation (35Missero C. Colautti E. Eckner R. Chiu J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although the regulation of the interaction between p300 and GATA-6 might involve a more complex scenario, it would be of particular interest to determine the possible role of p300 phosphorylation status in VSMC differentiation."

Previously, it has been shown that Semliki Forest virus Nsp3 (482 amino acids) is a phosphoprotein, and, in the present study, we have mapped its major phosphorylation sites. Mass spectrometric methods utilized included precursor ion scanning, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry used in conjunction with on-target alkaline phosphatase digestions, and tandem mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional peptide mapping was applied to separate tryptic32P-labeled phosphopeptides of Nsp3. Radiolabeled peptides were then subjected to Edman sequencing, and phosphoamino acid analysis. In addition, radiolabeled Nsp3 was cleaved successively with cyanogen bromide and trypsin, and microscale iron-chelate affinity chromatography was used to enrich phosphopeptides. By combining these methods, we showed that Nsp3 is phosphorylated on serine residues 320, 327, 332, 335, 356, 359, 362, and 367, and is heavily phosphorylated on peptide Gly338–Lys415, which carries 7–12 phosphates distributed over its 13 potential phosphorylation sites. These analytical findings were corroborated by constructing a Nsp3 derivative devoid of phosphorylation.

In viral systems, the phosphorylation of specific proteins modulates virus replication and virus-host interactions (1Leader D.P Katan M. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1441-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, the phosphorylation of the P protein in several negative-strand RNA viruses has been found to be essential for the viral transcription activity (2Barik S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6570-6574Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,3Chattopadhyay D. Banerjee A.K. Cell. 1987; 49: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Alphaviruses, such as Semliki Forest virus (SFV),1 Sindbis virus (SIN), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses capable of causing disease in mammals including man. The RNA genome of SFV (total length ∼11.5 kilobases) codes for two polyproteins, nonstructural and structural. The nonstructural polyprotein (P1234), is autoproteolytically cleaved into the four nonstructural proteins Nsp1–Nsp4 (reviewed in Refs. 4Kääriäinen L. Takkinen K. Keränen S. Söderlund H. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 7: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, studies have shown that SFV Nsp1 has nucleotide methylation and viral mRNA capping functions (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Nsp2 was found to be the autoprotease responsible for the cleavage of the nonstructural polyprotein (8Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4653-4664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an RNA helicase (9Gomez de Cedrón M. Ehsani N. Mikkola M. Garcia J. Kääriäinen L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 48: 19-22Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and an RNA triphosphatase (10Vasiljeva L. Merits A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17281-17287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As for Nsp4, protein sequence homology with other viral proteins of known function suggests that Nsp4 is the catalytic subunit of the SFV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (11Barton D.J. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas functions have been determined for the other nonstructural proteins, the function of Nsp3 remains poorly characterized. Studies of SIN polyprotein processing intermediates containing Nsp3 have shown that it is essential for the synthesis of negative-strands during the early phase of RNA replication (12Lemm J.A. Rümenapf T. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 13Shirako Y. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1874-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SIN Nsp3 has been reported to putatively affect the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA encoding the virus structural proteins (14Wang Y.-F. Sawicki S.G. Sawicki D.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15LaStarza M.W. Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5781-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that N-terminal regions of alphavirus Nsp3s are highly conserved sharing significant similarity with rubella virus, hepatitis virus E, and coronavirus sequences (16Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent genomic analysis has revealed that sequences related to the Nsp3 N-terminal domain are widely found in bacteria, animals, and plants (17Pehrson J. Fuji R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The conservation of this region during evolution suggests an important and basic function for this domain, which for the moment remains unclear. In contrast, the C-terminal region of Nsp3 is not conserved among alphaviruses and varies both in sequence and in length from 134 aa in Middelburg virus to 246 aa in O'nyong-nyong virus (5Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, some similarities do exist in the C-terminal domains of alphaviruses, e.g. all are rich in acidic residues, as well as in serine and threonine, and devoid of any predicted secondary structure. It appears that Nsp3 is the only alphavirus nonstructural protein, which is modified by phosphorylation (18Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Li G. La Starza M.W. Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. Rice C.M. Virology. 1990; 179: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis of SFV Nsp3 (total of 482 aa) showed that serine and threonine residues are phosphorylated in the approximate ratio of 2:1 (18Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but the exact positions of phosphorylated Nsp3 residues have not been reported. The identification of phosphorylation sites in Nsp3 is important for a number of reasons including: determining whether Nsp3 phosphorylation sites are constant or changed during virus evolution, mapping potential changes in phosphorylation patterns during alphavirus infection in different tissues, and determining potential phosphorylation sites for future mutagenesis studies. Furthermore, because information regarding phosphorylation sites in SFV Nsp3 represents the first systematic mapping of such sites in alphaviruses, it would represent a model for other related pathogenic viruses. Detailed characterization of protein phosphorylation is hampered by the low amount of material available for analysis, and by the fact that the stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation is often very low,i.e. the phosphopeptides exist as a minor fraction in a large background of unphosphorylated peptides. Advances in ionization methodologies (electrospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)) have made biological mass spectrometry effective and sensitive enough for studying posttranslational protein modifications (20Annan R.S. Carr S.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recently, mass spectrometric methods for phosphorylation analysis after SDS-PAGE separation have been described (22Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although mass spectrometry has become a very efficient tool in the identification of phosphopeptides, problems still remain. For example, when a peptide contains multiple phosphates and many potential phosphorylation sites, the site-specific identification of phosphorylated residues is often limited by the fact that multiply phosphorylated peptides are likely to produce very complex collision-induced decomposition (CID) spectra, or ionize poorly in the positive ion mode. SFV Nsp3 is a challenging molecule for phosphorylation studies, since it has relatively high number of potential phosphorylation sites (39 Ser and 35 Thr residues), and the protein is somewhat resistant to enzymatic cleavage. However, by using the mass spectrometric methods along with two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and Edman sequencing, we were able to map the major, if not all, phosphorylation sites of Nsp3. Based on these results, we constructed a deletion/point mutation derivative of Nsp3, which could not be phosphorylated as judged by loss of 32P incorporation, thus further supporting the validity of phosphorylation site analysis. Deletion and point mutations were made in the NSP3 coding region, which was originally cloned into plasmid pTSF3 under the control of the T7 promoter (24Peränen J. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A deletion mutant, which had amino acids between 342 and 369 of Nsp3 removed, was made using PCR with the following primers: 1, 5′-CTCAAGCTTATGCACCCGCGCGGCCTAGTCG-3′; 2, 5′-ATCACCATGGCACCATCCTACAGAGTTAAG-3′; 3, 5′-TCGTAGTCCAAGTCAAACCCTCGTAACGACCGATC-3′; 4, 5′-TGGACTACGAGCCAATGGCTCCCATAGTAGTGACGG-3′. The PCR products were purified and used as templates in a second round of PCR with primers 2 and 4. Serine residues 320, 327, 332, and 335 were mutated to alanine by using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (U.S.E. kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Nsp3 mutant containing both the 343–368 deletion and the four point mutations was designated Nsp3Δ26+4S→4A. All sequence alterations were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa cell monolayers were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml streptomycin and penicillin. The modified vaccinia virus Ankara was kindly provided by Dr. B. Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and virus stocks were made as described previously (25Wyatt L.S. Moss B. Rozenblatt S. Virology. 1995; 210: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). HeLa cell dishes that were 80–90% confluent were infected with virus using 20–50 plaque-forming units/cell. After a 45-min adsorption period, the cells were washed, and transfected using Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), the pTSF3 plasmid or its derivatives, and Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection mixtures of 7 μg of DNA in 12 μl of Lipofectin, and 10 μg of DNA in 50 μl of Lipofectin were used for 60- and 100-mm plates, respectively. After 3–4 h, the transfection mixture was replaced with medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 1–3 h at 37 °C. For in vivo labeling, transfected cells were washed twice at 2 h after transfection with Dulbecco's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, after which methione/cysteine-free or phosphate-free medium was added. Cells were labeled at 3 h after transfection either with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Redivue PRO-mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with 300–1000 μCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per plate. After 3–5 h at 37 °C, cells were washed carefully, harvested, and lysed in 1% SDS. HeLa cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS, 10 mm sodium fluoride (Merck), and a protease inhibitor mixture at a recommended concentration (Complete™; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After shearing the DNA by drawing the lysate repeatedly through a 27-gauge needle, the proteins were denatured by boiling, and Nsp3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Nsp3 rabbit antiserum, as described previously (18Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF; Immobilon, Millipore) as described previously (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide mapping analysis, samples were alkylated in 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EDTA, and 20 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by using an imaging system (Fuji BAS 1500). Immunoprecipitated Nsp3 was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The Nsp3 band, corresponding to approximately 1 μg of protein (20 pmol), was excised and destained by rinsing the gel pieces twice in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile (ACN) for 45 min at 37 °C. Gel pieces were then dehydrated with 100% ACN and vacuum-dried. Gel pieces were rehydrated in 10 μl of 0.1m NH4HCO3, 10% ACN containing 40 ng/μl trypsin (modified trypsin, sequencing grade, Promega). The trypsin digestion was performed overnight. The samples were desalted by miniature reversed-phase chromatography column as described previously (22Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) using POROS R2 (Perseptive Biosystems) as absorbent. The sample was eluted with 2 μl of 0.5% ammonia in 50% methanol directly to the nanoelectrospray needle. Approximately 5 μg (100 pmol) of 32P-labeled Nsp3 was obtained from a dried gel piece, as described above. Cleavage with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) was performed with 5 mg/ml CNBr in 70% trifluoroacetic acid in the dark for 18 h at room temperature. The peptides were extracted once with 150 μl of aqueous 50% ACN for 30 min at 37 °C, and twice with 150 μl of 5% formic acid in 50% ACN for 45 min at 37 °C. The supernatants were combined and lyophilized. To reduce the amount of CNBr in samples before reversed-phase HPLC, samples were dissolved in 100 μl of deionized water, and lyophilized. This treatment was repeated three times. The peptides were dissolved in 1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to 37 °C reversed-phase HPLC. Peptides resulting from CNBr digestion were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a 1 × 20-mm C-1 column (TMS-C1, 300 Å, 5 μm; Tosoh Corp.) by elution with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5–100% in 60 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min, and the elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Fractions were taken at 1-min intervals, and 0.3-μl aliquots were spotted on a PVDF membrane, air-dried, and analyzed for 32P radioactivity by phosphoimaging. After reversed phase chromatography of CNBr-digested Nsp3, fractions containing radioactivity were combined into three pools corresponding to their elution time from the C-1 column. Pool 1 contained early eluting radioactive fractions, pool 2 middle eluting fractions, and pool 3 consisted of late eluting components. Each pool was lyophilized and dissolved in 50 μl of digestion buffer (0.1 mNH4HCO3 in 10% ACN) containing 0.05 μg/μl trypsin. The digestion was performed at 37 °C for 18 h, after which fractions were lyophilized and dissolved into 10 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Half of each trypsin-digested pool was subjected to separation by reversed-phase HPLC on a 0.3 × 20-mm C-8 column (Vydac C8, 300 Å, 9 μm). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of ACN (5–100% in 60 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, and elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 206 nm. Fractions were collected every 2 min, and radioactive fractions were identified by phosphoimaging. To enrich for phosphorylated peptides, tryptic peptides made from CNBr-digested Nsp3 were applied to a miniature Fe3+ column consisting of 0.5 μl of POROS MC (Perseptive Biosystems) packed into a gel-loader pipette tip. The column was equilibrated with 30 μl of equilibration buffer (2:1 v/v mixture of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 3.1, and acetonitrile). One microliter of tryptic/CNBr-digested peptides from all three pools were combined, which represented 10% of the total sample and 10 pmol of Nsp3 protein starting material, diluted 1:10 in equilibration buffer, and passed through the column. The column was washed with 20 μl of equilibration buffer, and washed again with 20 μl of equilibration buffer diluted 1:10 in H2O. Peptides were eluted with 5 μl of 0.5% ammonia in 50% methanol and directly applied to the MALDI target plate, as 1-μl fractions. After MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis of fractions from Fe3+-chromatography, in both positive and negative ion mode, the samples (prepared on the MALDI target plate with 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP) matrix, as described below) were dissolved in 0.5 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.9, containing 0.01 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP, New England Biolabs). Samples were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a high humidity chamber to prevent drying. Dephosphorylation was stopped by the addition of 0.5 μl of ACN, and samples were immediately dried in vacuo to allow for proper crystallization of the matrix. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Biflex™ time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. The Fe3+-affinity chromatography fractions, as well as products from the phosphatase reactions were analyzed both in the linear negative ion delayed extraction mode, and reflector positive ion delayed extraction mode, using THAP, 3 mg/ml in acetonitrile with 20 mm aqueous diammonium citrate, 1:1, by volume, as the matrix. Samples were prepared as described previously (26Nyman T.A. Kalkkinen N. Tolo H. Helin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 15: 485-493Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and all mass spectra were externally calibrated with angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropic hormone corticotropin-like intermediate peptide. The Nsp3 phosphopeptides isolated by reversed phase chromatography were analyzed in the reflector positive ion delayed extraction mode using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 30% acetonitrile as the matrix. Samples were prepared by mixing 0.5 μl of eluate with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix on the target plate, and dried under a gentle stream of warm air. Mass spectra were calibrated as above. Electrospray ionization (ESI) precursor ion scan mass spectra were obtained using an API 365 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Ontario, Canada) with a nanoelectrospray source installed. Q1 scans were acquired with 0.1-Da step width and a dwell time of 1 ms, at 1-unit resolution. Precursor ion scans were acquired with a step width of 0.5 Da, and a dwell time of 50 ms. The resolution was set to transmit a mass window of 4 Da, the collision gas used was nitrogen, and the collision energy was set to 150 V. Electrospray ionization product ion mass spectra were collected using a Micromass Q-TOF quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) with a nanoelectrospray source installed. Product ion scans were acquired with a Q1 resolution set to transmit a mass window of 5 Da. The doubly charged parent ions [M + 2H]2+ were selectively transmitted by the first mass analyzer and directed into the collision cell containing argon as the collision gas. Collision energies were adjusted for each experiment individually. 32P-Labeled Nsp3 or its derivatives were immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted either onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. PVDF membrane was dried prior to detection by phosphoimaging, but the nitrocellulose membrane was kept moist during the localization of the bands by placing it into a plastic bag. The membrane pieces were excised and saturated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 360 at 37 °C for 1 h. The membrane pieces were washed several times with 10% ACN, and the protein was digested with trypsin in 50 mmNH4HCO3 in 10% ACN. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the buffer was evaporated by several rounds of lyophilization, and the tryptic peptide mixture was dissolved in 5 μl of 128 mm ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8.9, and the entire sample was spotted onto a 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. The first dimension, thin layer electrophoresis (TLE), was performed at 1.0 kV for 24 min in the same buffer. The plate was then air-dried overnight, after which ascending chromatography was performed in n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:acetic acid:water at 15:10:3:12, v/v/v/v. The plate was air-dried, and phosphopeptides were detected by phosphoimaging. Phosphopeptides localized on TLC plates were recovered from the plate by elution with a solution of formic acid, acetic acid, water, 25:78:897 v/v/v, pH 1.9. The 32P content of each sample was determined by Cerenkov counting. One-tenth of each sample volume was analyzed by phosphoamino acid analysis, and rest of each sample was subjected to Edman degradation as described by Blume-Jensen et al. (27Blume-Jensen P. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.-H. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14192-14200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Peptides were coupled to Sequelon-AA membranes, and Edman degradation was performed on an ABI sequencer model 477A. Released phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives from each cycle were spotted on TLC plates, and the radioactivity was quantified by digital imaging after the subtraction of background. Since only a small amount of Nsp3 is synthesized in cells during SFV infection, we used vaccinia-aided transfection to produce sufficient quantities of Nsp3 for phosphorylation analysis. HeLa cells were first infected with the modified vaccinia virus Ankara, which has been engineered to express T7 RNA polymerase (25Wyatt L.S. Moss B. Rozenblatt S. Virology. 1995; 210: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Infected cells were then transfected with a plasmid encoding SFV Nsp3 under the control of the T7 promoter. Nsp3 was isolated from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation, liberated from the immunoprecipitation affinity matrix by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and further purified by SDS-PAGE. The Nsp3 band visualized on the gel was subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel and desalted using microscale reversed-phase chromatography. Peptide mixtures were eluted directly into a nanospray needle and subjected to mass analysis using a triple quadrupole instrument, which provides high sensitivity for precursor ion scanning. The Q 1 scan displayed in Fig.1 A was acquired in the negative ion mode, and it shows a distribution of several signals, indicating good recovery of peptides. A precursor ion scan ofm/z (mass/charge) 79 in the negative ion mode is displayed in Fig. 1 B, and it shows two major peaks at m/z852 and 916, which were tentatively identified as [M − 2H]2− of peptides Val308–Arg322and Val308–Lys323, respectively (for sequence, see Fig. 1 D). Each peak appear to carry a single phosphate moiety. Signals at m/z 568 and 610 were identified as [M − 3H]3− counterparts for the 852 and 916 species. In Fig. 1 B, a series of short peaks (bump-like signals) can be seen between m/z 600 and 1200, and are tentatively identified as a charge series m/z [M − 14H]14− to [M − 8H]8− of peptide Gly338–Lys415. This peptide appears to carry 7–12 phosphates distributed over its 13 potential phosphorylation sites. This assignment was confirmed by double-digestion data as well as site-specific mutation data, as shown below. In Fig. 1 B(inset), a close-up of the [M − 11H]11−species is shown. Fig. 1 C shows the results from an product ion scan, using a quadrupole-time of flight instrument, done on 853.44 [M + 2H]2+ ion (Fig. 1 B). Using CID analysis, the peptide produced a clear Y-ion series, which allowed for both the identification of the peptide as Val308–Arg322with one phosphate moiety, and the assignment of phosphorylation at Ser320. An expansion of region 450–650 (Fig.1 C) shows ions Y3 ( m/z 439.22), Y4 (m/z 538.31), and Y5 ( m/z 637.33), which are diagnostic of phosphorylation at Ser320, and would be absent if the phosphorylation occurred either at residues Ser317 or Thr314. Furthermore, the peptide at 917,49 [M + 2H]2+ was analyzed by CID MS, and found to be peptide Val308–Lys323, and it also showed Ser320 to be phosphorylated (data not shown). At this point it was evident that the other phosphopeptides observed in the precursor ion scan could not be further analyzed by mass spectrometry alone (see “Discussion”). As suggested by the precursor ion scan experiment carried out on the tryptic digest of Nsp3, peptide Gly338–Lys415 carries 7–12 phosphates, and has a calculated molecular weight between 8838 and 9238 Da. Such large peptide was not amenable to site-specific phosphorylation analysis by mass spectrometry, so in order to reduce the size of this peptide (which contains two methionines), 5 μg (100 pmol) of 32P-labeled Nsp3 was digested in-gel with CNBr, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography (Fig. 2 A). Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and 0.3 μl of each fraction was spotted to PVDF membrane for autoradiography (Fig.2 A). The resulting peptides were pooled into three pools according to the elution of radioactivity, and each pool was digested with trypsin. After trypsin digestion, an aliquot of each pool, corresponding to 50 pmol of Nsp3, was separated by microscale RP chromatography, and again fractions were collected, with part of each fraction being subjected to autoradiography. Radioactive fractions were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in both positive and negative ion modes in order to identify phosphopeptide candidates. From RP chromatography done on pool 1 (Fig. 2 B), a series of peptides (1938.0, 2018.0, 2098.0, 2178.0, and 2258.0; [M − H]−, average mass), could be discerned, each separated by 80 Da. According to mass alone, the peptides could not be assigned directly to Nsp3 sequence, even taking into consideration phosphorylation, and possible modifications introduced by CNBr digestion (e.g. acid cleavage, oxidation of tryptophans, conversion of methione to homoserine (Hser) without chain cleavage). Signal 1938.8 [M + H]+ (monoisotopic mass), which is the smallest species in this series, was chosen for CID MS analysis, because it would most likely produce the least complex CID MS spectrum compared with other more phosphorylated peptides. A product ion scan of 969.9 [M + 2H]2+ was acquired using a quadrupole-time-of-flight instrument, and upon CID the peptide produced a mixed y- and b-ion series, which together identified the peptide as Ser356–Met372. The methione at position 372 was found to be in the open homoserine form (not as in lactone form). This molecular species did not contain phosphates, and it was found to carry an acrylamide adduct on residue Cys363(Cys-propio"
https://openalex.org/W2322168524,"LNCaP prostatic cancer cells are characterized by having a PTEN mutation, low levels of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and no IRS-1, one of the major substrates of the IGF-IR. The absence of IRS-1, an activator of PI3-kinase, is compensated in these cells by the mutation in PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase. However, IGF-IR signaling in the absence of IRS-1 can cause cell differentiation and growth arrest. We hypothesized that these three characteristics may not be unrelated, specifically that, together, they may favor the metastatic spread of prostatic cancer cells without decreasing their growth potential. In support of this hypothesis, we report here that: (1) IRS-1 expression increases cell adhesion and decreases cell motility; (2) over-expression of the IGF-IR, in the absence of IRS-1, causes growth arrest and (3) a combination of IGF-IR and IRS-1 restores the transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells. These findings suggest a mechanism by which prostatic cancer cells can achieve metastatic potential without interfering with their growth potential. Oncogene (2000)."

https://openalex.org/W2315084821,"Steroid hormones play key roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in targeting tissues. However, in advanced cancers, the steroid hormone regulation is frequently attenuated through a yet unknown mechanism even in the presence of functional steroid hormone receptors. We investigate the functional role of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in the hormone-refractory growth of human prostate tumors. Initial studies demonstrate that the androgen-responsive phenotype of human prostate cancer cells associates with a low phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) level of ErbB-2, which is regulated by cellular prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a protein tyrosine phosphatase. In prostate cancer cells, the p-Tyr level, but not the protein level, of ErbB-2 inversely correlates with the androgen-responsiveness of cell proliferation. Androgen-stimulated cell growth concurs with a down-regulation of cellular PAcP, an elevated p-Tyr level of ErbB-2, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, only the ErbB-2 inhibitor AG 879, but not the EGFR inhibitor AG 1478, abolishes androgen-induced cell proliferation. Forced expression of ErbB-2 can also attenuate androgen promotion of cell growth. Data taken collectively conclude that in human prostate cancer cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 regulated by cellular PAcP plays a key role in regulating androgen-mediated proliferation signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2320930918,"von Hippel-Lindau disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome. Mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene predispose individuals to highly vascularized tumors. However, VHL-deficient mice die in utero due to a lack of vascularization in the placenta. To resolve the contradiction, we cloned the Drosophila VHL homologue (d-VHL) and studied its function. It showed an overall 50% similarity to the human counterpart and 76% similarity in the crucial functional domain: the elongin C binding site. The putative d-VHL protein can bind Drosophila elongin C in vitro. During embryogenesis, d-VHL is expressed in the developing tracheal regions where tube outgrowth no longer occurs. Reduced d-VHL activity (using RNA interference methodology) caused breakage of the main vasculature accompanied by excessive looping of smaller branches, whereas over-expression caused a general lack of vasculature. Importantly, human VHL can induce the same gain-of-function phenotypes. VHL is likely involved in halting cell migration at the end of vascular tube outgrowth. Loss of VHL activity can therefore lead to disruption of major vasculature (as in the mouse embryo), which requires precise cell movement and tube fusion, or ectopic outgrowth from existing secondary vascular branches (as in the adult tumors).

We found a substantial increase in cyclin E mRNA, accompanied by increased production of cyclin E protein and cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity in multiple myeloma and lymphoma cells following irradiation. Cyclin E expression increased early in a time and dose-dependent manner, with a three-fold induction reached 8 h following gamma-irradiation. Run-on analyses indicated a predominantly transcriptional regulation of cyclin E. Stable overexpression of cyclin E, but not cyclin D1, sensitized IM-9 cells to gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis; in contrast, a dominant-negative Cdk2, prevented apoptosis. Irradiation of cyclin E overexpressing cells led to an enhanced caspase activation and exposure of the phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane, two key markers of apoptosis, events which were completely abolished in cells expressing a dominant-negative Cdk2. This study identifies cyclin E as a target for activation by ionizing radiation and which plays a functional role in apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. Oncogene (2000) 19, 2828 - 2835"
https://openalex.org/W2320374658,"Core Binding Factor (CBF) is required for the development of definitive hematopoiesis, and the CBF oncoproteins AML1-ETO, TEL-AML1, and CBFbeta-SMMHC are commonly expressed in subsets of acute leukemia. CBFbeta-SMMHC slows the G1 to S cell cycle transition in hematopoietic cells, but the mechanism of this effect is uncertain. We have sought to determine whether inhibition of CBF-mediated trans-activation is sufficient to slow proliferation. We demonstrate that activation of KRAB-AML1-ER, a protein containing the AML1 DNA-binding domain, the KRAB repression domain, and the Estrogen receptor ligand binding domain, also slows G1, if its DNA-binding domain is intact. Also, exogenous AML1 overcame CBFbeta-SMMHC-induced inhibition of proliferation. Representational difference analysis (RDA) identified cdk4 RNA expression as an early target of KRAB-AML1 activation. Inhibition of CBF activities by KRAB-AML1-ER or CBFbeta-SMMHC rapidly reduced endogenous cdk4 mRNA levels, even in cells proliferating at or near control rates as a result of exogenous cdk4 expression. Over-expression of cdk4, especially a variant which cannot bind p16INK4a, overcame cell cycle inhibition resulting from activation of KRAB-AML1-ER, although cdk4 did not accelerate proliferation when expressed alone. These findings indicate that mutations which alter the expression of G1 regulatory proteins can overcome inhibition of proliferation by CBF oncoproteins. Oncogene (2000)."

Thus, cGMP is able to influence Ca2+ homeostasis (1Twort C. van Breemen C. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Willmott N.J. Asselin J. Galione A.

( Lond. ). 1998; 511: 80-81Google Scholar), and likewise the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+([Ca2+] c )1may influence cGMP levels (4Ignarro L.J. Harbison R.G. Wood K.S. Kadowitz P.J. J.

Hidaka H. Nairn A.C. Intracellular Signal Transduction. 1st Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1996: 29-48Google Scholar). Acting in concert, these second messengers mediate many signaling events from phototransduction to contractile activity in smooth muscle (7Feresenko E.E. Kolesnikov S.S. Lyubarsky A.L. Nature. 1985; 313: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 8Gold G.H. Nakamura T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 312-316Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Rüegg J.C.

Ca2+ homeostasis is governed by the net flow of Ca2+ into and out of the cytosol. For Ca2+ to act as a signal, its cytosolic concentration is kept low through constant extrusion at the plasma membrane and the sequestration of Ca2+ into intracellular stores (11Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 12Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. DeSmedt H. Droogmans G. Declerck I. Casteels R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 191-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Initiation of a Ca2+ signal involves either the activation of influx or the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (13Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar, 14Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The key sites for control of Ca2+ homeostasis are therefore located on the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (14Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The means by which the [Ca2+] c is regulated at the plasma membrane is through Ca2+ influx channels and extrusion through the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase pump (PMCA) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum contains the Ca2+-ATPase pump (SERCA) responsible for sequestration of Ca2+ along with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) or ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels. There is a considerable amount of evidence for the nonuniformity of intracellular Ca2+signals. These take the form of microdomains (15Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pozzan T. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 40: 339-358Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Ca2+waves (16Jaffe L.F. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), polarized responses (17Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and effects limited to the plasma membrane (18Graier W.F. Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Hill B.J.F. Fleischhacker E. Hoebel B.G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This localization of the key processes involved in Ca2+ homeostasis supports the generation of complex spatial and temporal patterns of Ca2+ signaling. These are necessary if Ca2+ is to fulfill its role as a multitasking second messenger. Likewise, cGMP formation is not spread uniformly within cells as revealed by its distinct particulate and cytosolic sources (20Mittal C.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 115: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The guanylate cyclase domain of the particulate enzyme is contained within natriuretic peptide receptors at the plasma membrane (21Waldman S.A. Rapoport R.M. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14332-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chinkers M.D. Garbers L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H. Goeddel D.V. Schultz S.

Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The soluble guanylate cyclase is stimulated by NO (4Ignarro L.J. Harbison R.G. Wood K.S. Kadowitz P.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 237: 893-900PubMed Google Scholar, 25Braughler J.M. Mittal C.K. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12450-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diffusion of cGMP will be limited by the presence of five different ubiquitously expressed phosphodiesterases (PDE1, -2, -3, -5, and -9) involved in the hydrolysis of cGMP (20Mittal C.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 115: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Waldman S.A. Rapoport R.M. Murad F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15559-15564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Some phosphodiesterases and their isomers are soluble, while others are plasma membrane-bound (4Ignarro L.J. Harbison R.G. Wood K.S. Kadowitz P.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 237: 893-900PubMed Google Scholar, 27Beavo J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1988; 22: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar). The separate subcellular sources of cGMP offer the possibility of localized elevation of cGMP within a cell, putatively under the plasma membrane or within the cytosol. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of the cytosolic and particulate pools of cGMP on Ca2+ homeostasis in ECV304 human epithelial cells. We therefore examined the effects on [Ca2+] c of elevated cGMP using the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and compared its actions with the effects of cGMP elevated by brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP acts on both NP-A and NP-B receptors and is thus able to stimulate particulate guanylate cyclase activity (21Waldman S.A. Rapoport R.M. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14332-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also investigated how the decay of the [Ca2+] c transients, cation influx, and extrusion of Ca2+ are affected by elevated cGMP. We find not only that the particulate and soluble guanylate cyclases modulate [Ca2+] c through different Ca2+ homeostatic mechanisms but that activation of the particulate and not the soluble guanylate cyclase is coupled to the inhibition of Ca2+ efflux. We also find that NO-stimulated soluble guanylate cyclase and not the particulate guanylate cyclase is involved in the stimulation of Ca2+ sequestration into the intracellular Ca2+ stores. We therefore provide evidence for the control of Ca2+ homeostasis by localized elevation of cGMP in ECV304 epithelial cells. In addition, we define a new role for natriuretic peptides as circulating modulators of Ca2+efflux that act to potentiate existing Ca2+signals. Cells were grown on 22-mm glass coverslips for 48 h and then loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM in the presence of 0.0125% pluronic F127 at 37 °C for 45 min. The bathing medium was Na+-HEPES buffered physiological saline (HPS) composed of 145 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, and 1 mmCaCl2. All reagents were purchased from Merck or Sigma. All cGMP-elevating agents were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Coverslips were transferred to a chamber warmed at 37 °C and held on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope. Cells were alternatively excited at 340- and 380-nm wavelengths by means of a PTI D101 dual excitation light source. The 510-nm emission was detected by an ICCD camera (Photonic Science). Digital images were then analyzed by Image Master software for Windows (PTI). [Ca2+] c was calculated by calibrating the photometric 340/380-nm ratio signal (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reagents and vehicle controls were added to cells by bolus addition to the sample chamber. Cells grown on 22-mm coverslips were bathed in HPS and excited at 340 and 360 nm. Instead of ratio images, the fluorescence intensity images were collected for analysis. The addition of 1 mm Mn2+ in the form of MnCl2 is indicated by the solid bar line above each trace (see Fig. 5). Cells grown in 80-cm2 flasks were treated with trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. They were then centrifuged for 2 min at 190 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in Na+-HEPES-buffered physiological saline made up in milliQ (Millipore, Ltd.) purified water where no Ca2+ had been added. Cells were then separated into 1-ml Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 s in a microcentrifuge, and resuspended in the same buffer. The procedure was repeated three times. Cells were then transferred to a sample chamber at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured using a PTI Deltascan dual excitation spectrofluorimeter exciting alternatively at 340 and 380 nm and collecting emission at 510 nm. [Ca2+] o was calculated by calibrating the photometric 340/380-nm ratio signal (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in HPS. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 2 min, they were incubated periods of 2–10 min in the presence of the different reagents tested. Cyclic GMP levels were determined using the nonacetylation method in a cGMP enzyme immunoassay system as described in the manual provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Biotrak cellular communication assays). The number of cells present in 1 ml of suspension for Ca2+ extrusion experiments was measured using a hemocytometer. Values presented are means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare data sets. Direct stimulation of the particulate guanylate cyclase was induced by bolus addition of 100 nm BNP to fura-2-loaded cells. In contrast, stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase was achieved by the addition of the NO donor SNP. The addition of BNP prior to 1 μm ATP caused about a 4-fold potentiation of the ATP-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c (Fig.1 A). The mean ATP-stimulated Δ[Ca2+] c between basal [Ca2+] c levels and peak [Ca2+] c in the presence of BNP was approximately 3 μm. This was significantly greater (p< 0.05) than the control 1 μm ATP response of approximately 600 nm (as indicated in Fig.1 D). In contrast, SNP was ineffective at enhancing the ATP-induced [Ca2+] c rise (Fig. 1 B). The mean Δ[Ca2+] c peak for this response was about 500 nm. This response was not significantly different (p < 0.05) from control ATP-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest that an endogenous increase in cGMP levels induced by activation of the particulate guanylate cyclase leads to the large enhancement of the ATP-stimulated [Ca2+] c response. The addition of the cGMP analogue Bt2cGMP to the sustained component of the ATP-evoked rise in [Ca2+] c caused an additional elevation in [Ca2+] c (Fig.1 C). This additional increase in [Ca2+] c (approximately 300 nm) occurs only upon the addition of the compound to the sustained component of the ATP-evoked rise in [Ca2+] c and not when added prior to stimulation by ATP (Fig. 1D). This effect is abolished by removal of Bt2cGMP from the medium, causing a restoration of [Ca2+] c levels to that of the sustained ATP-induced [Ca2+] c rise. These experiments show that Bt2cGMP only causes a moderate rise in [Ca2+] c in cells previously stimulated by ATP. The extent to which SNP and BNP were able to induce an increase in cGMP levels was measured by enzyme immunoassay and compared with the respective [Ca2+] c increases obtained in the presence of 1 μm ATP. The effects of both compounds were measured for different concentrations (0.5, 1, 100, 500, and 1000 nm for BNP and 0.5, 1, 100, 500, and 1000 μmfor SNP) and after 2-, 6-, and 10-min incubations. The resulting data were used to construct the cGMP/[Ca2+] c curves for each of the incubation periods (Fig.2, A, B, andC, respectively). Both SNP and BNP cause an increase in cGMP levels above that of control untreated cells. Despite its ability to raise cGMP levels, SNP did not induce the potentiation of the ATP-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c . The linear fit reveals that in the presence of SNP, cGMP increases are independent from [Ca2+] c . There is no significance difference at the p < 0.05 level between control ATP-stimulated [Ca2+] c rises and those in the presence of SNP for any concentration used or incubation time analyzed. Although at low concentrations BNP may cause a modest rise in cGMP (2–3 fmol/106 cells), it is still able to potentiate the [Ca2+] c rise induced by ATP, even at different incubation times. This effect is demonstrated by the nonlinear relationship between cGMP and [Ca2+] c in the presence of BNP. In some cases, particularly for the higher concentrations of BNP, the fura-2 dye reached saturation levels. These results show that both SNP and BNP cause an increase in cGMP levels, but only BNP is able to potentiate the ATP-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c . Although BNP activates the particulate guanylate cyclase contained within the NP-A and NP-B receptors, we considered whether BNP may enhance G-protein-coupled signal transduction in ATP-stimulated cells. If so, this could lead to an enhanced release of Ca2+ from the InsP3-sensitive stores, thereby causing the observed potentiation of the ATP-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c . We therefore investigated if InsP3-independent elevation of [Ca2+] c as induced by thapsigargin could also be potentiated by BNP. Thapsigargin is an inhibitor of the SERCA pump that causes a slow “leak” of Ca2+ from the stores independently of InsP3 production (29Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar). As predicted, the addition of 100 nm thapsigargin caused a gradual but sustained elevation in [Ca2+] c (Fig.3 A). The mean peak Δ[Ca2+] c value obtained for this control response was 889 ± 26 (n = 5). In the presence of BNP, the sustained increase in [Ca2+] c evoked by thapsigargin was enhanced (Fig. 3 B). The mean peak Δ[Ca2+] c value for this response was 1611 ± 142 nm (n = 3). This response was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the control response in the absence of BNP. The potentiation of the thapsigargin-evoked rise in [Ca2+] c caused by BNP was not due to an enhancement of Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores. These results therefore indicate that BNP may potentiate the [Ca2+] c rise in thapsigargin-stimulated cells independently from agonist activation. The results presented so far show that BNP and not SNP may potentiate the thapsigargin-induced rise in [Ca2+] c . However, stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase by SNP and the addition of analogues of cGMP to cells has been reported to cause a faster reuptake of [Ca2+] c into the intracellular Ca2+stores of a variety of cells including megakaryocytes (30Uneyama C. Uneyama H. Akaike N. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), cardiomyocytes (31Sabine B. Willenbrock R. Haase H. Karcewski P. Wallukat G. Dietz R. Krause E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and smooth muscle cells (32Murthy K.S. Mahkhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C1199-C1205Crossref Google Scholar). Since SNP did not potentiate the ATP-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c (Fig. 1 B), we examined whether it could influence replenishing of the Ca2+ stores. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm ATP in a Ca2+-free medium containing 500 μm EGTA. Extracellular EGTA would chelate any extracellular Ca2+ present in the medium and thus prevent Ca2+ influx. The initial increase in [Ca2+] c that occurs after the addition of ATP is due to the release of Ca2+ from the InsP3-sensitive stores (13Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar, 14Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). In the absence of any extracellular Ca2+, the response is transient. The subsequent decay in [Ca2+] c is due to a combination of Ca2+ efflux from the cells and reuptake into the stores. We analyzed the rate of decay of the response in the presence of ATP to determine whether there were any changes produced by the addition of SNP (Fig. 4, Aand B). The addition of 100 μm SNP caused a faster decay of the ATP-induced response (Fig. 4 B) when compared with the control response in the absence of SNP (Fig.4 A). The mean maximum rate of decay in control cells was 1.0 ± 0.2 nm/s (n = 4) (Fig.4 A). The mean rate of decay obtained in the presence of SNP was 1.7 ± 0.3 nm/s (n = 8) (Fig.4 B). This was significantly faster than the control cells (p < 0.05). We conclude from these experiments that activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase by SNP induces a faster reuptake of [Ca2+] c into the intracellular stores, since we show below that SNP does not affect Ca2+extrusion. We have shown that BNP may potentiate a [Ca2+] c rise induced by thapsigargin (Fig. 3 B). We therefore examined the effects of SNP and BNP on ATP-stimulated cation influx by performing Mn2+ quenches. The 340- and 360-nm fluorescence were recorded in fura-2-loaded cells. The 340-nm trace reflects the changes in [Ca2+] c that occur upon agonist stimulation. The 360-nm fluorescence represents the isosbestic point on the fura-2 excitation spectrum and does not change with respect to the degree of Ca2+ binding to the dye (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) but is sensitive to the presence of Mn2+ (33Simpson A.W.M. Stampfl A. Ashley C.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The 340-nm (dashed trace) and 360-nm (black trace) fluorescence intensities for a representative control 1 μm ATP response in the presence of 1 mmMn2+ are shown in Fig.5 A. The rate of quench of the 360-nm signal increases (fluorescence decreases) after the addition of the agonist. This occurs due to the activation of store-operated cation influx channels. The rate of Mn2+ quench after stimulation of cation influx was 0.46 ± 0.02 fluorescence units/s (n = 17). The 340-nm trace shows an increase in Ca2+ binding to the dye after agonist stimulation. In the presence of 100 nm BNP, the ATP-induced cation influx (Fig.5 B) is shown to be slower than the control (Fig.5 A). This represents a 53% reduction of cation influx (Fig. 5 D). These results suggest that BNP is not implicated in the enhancement of influx but that it is either directly or indirectly involved in the partial inhibition of cation influx. In comparison, the addition of 100 μm SNP had no effect on the ATP-evoked Mn2+ quench (Fig. 5, C andD). Activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase did not reduce or increase cation influx. SKF96365 (20 μm) was used as a negative control to show inhibition of cation influx (34Merrit J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). There are two main Ca2+ regulatory events that occur at the plasma membrane of cells: Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space and Ca2+ extrusion out of the cell. First, we examined the possibility that BNP could induce the potentiation of the ATP-evoked rise in [Ca2+] c by inhibiting the removal of [Ca2+] c from the cell. We used a protocol by which increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] o ) were directly measured from cell suspensions (containing about 2.3 × 106 cells in 1 ml of buffer) using 5 μm fura-2-free acid as an extracellular Ca2+ indicator. The buffer used was HPS containing about 60 nm free Ca2+. In control unstimulated cells (represented by the black trace in Fig. 6, Aand B), an increase in [Ca2+] o occurs immediately after transferring cells from room temperature to the measuring chamber warmed at 37 °C. This initial efflux gradually reaches a steady rate after about 300 s. Stimulation of Ca2+ efflux evoked by the addition of 1 μmATP (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 6, A andB) causes a further increase in the rate. Cells were incubated with either 100 nm BNP (Fig. 6 A,gray trace) or 100 μm SNP (Fig.6 B, gray trace) for 10 min at room temperature prior to the measurement of [Ca2+] o . In the presence of BNP, the initial efflux was inhibited by 88%, and the ATP-stimulated efflux was inhibited by 91%. In contrast to the effects of BNP, a 10-min incubation with SNP did not affect either initial or ATP-stimulated efflux (Fig. 6 B, gray trace). The same experimental procedure was used for another NO donor, SNAP, for comparison. SNAP (100 μm) did not affect either the initial or ATP-stimulated efflux, thereby confirming our results obtained with SNP (Fig. 6 C). In order to verify that the effects of BNP on the inhibition of efflux occur as a consequence of elevated cGMP, we used the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor Zaprinast (6Burns F. Zhao A.Z. Beavo J.A. Hidaka H. Nairn A.C. Intracellular Signal Transduction. 1st Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1996: 29-48Google Scholar). Zaprinast (10 μm), like BNP, inhibited the initial and ATP-stimulated efflux. This suggests that the inhibition of efflux by BNP is mediated by a cGMP-dependent pathway. The data including efflux values for Zaprinast are summarized in Fig. 6 C. These results indicate that BNP inhibits both initial and ATP-stimulated Ca2+ extrusion in a cGMP-dependent manner. Neither SNAP nor SNP shows any effect on efflux. The potentiation of the ATP or thapsigargin-stimulated rise in [Ca2+] c evoked by the addition of BNP (Figs. 1 A, 2 B, and3 B) may therefore be due to the inhibition of efflux. It has been established that most cells have two mechanisms by which Ca2+ may be extruded: the PMCA and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (11Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 12Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. DeSmedt H. Droogmans G. Declerck I. Casteels R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 191-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ca2+ extrusion by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is inhibited when cells are bathed in a low Na+-containing medium (12Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. DeSmedt H. Droogmans G. Declerck I. Casteels R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 50: 191-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Graier W.F. Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Hill B.J.F. Fleischhacker E. Hoebel B.G. Kostner G.M. Stureck M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 506: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of BNP on [Ca2+] c in cells bathed in a saline solution whereN-methyl-d-glucamine was the iso-osmotic substitute for Na+. Experiments were performed in 1 mm extracellular Ca2+. In the absence of Na+, the addition of 100 nm BNP caused an increase in resting [Ca2+] c of 592 ± 41 nm (n = 14) (Fig.7). These results contrast those obtained for cells washed in a normal physiological saline containing 145 mm Na+ and 1 mm Ca2+, where the addition of 100 nm BNP caused no apparent increase in resting [Ca2+] c (Fig. 1 A). SNP had no effect on basal [Ca2+] c in cells bathed in a medium lacking Na+ (Fig. 7, dashed trace). When similar experiments were performed in the absence of Na+, the addition of ATP to BNP-treated cells produced a response so large that the Ca2+ indicator saturated (data not shown), producing off scale data sets in the analysis software. The concept of spatial control of [Ca2+] c signals is well established, but comparable evidence for cGMP is lacking. This study reveals how cGMP synthesized at the plasma membrane inhibits Ca2+ extrusion via the PMCA, while cGMP generated in the cytosol increases Ca2+ uptake into the intracellular stores (data summarized in Fig. 8). Cyclic GMP has previously been shown to increase Ca2+sequestration into intracellular stores (1Twort C. van Breemen C. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, this effect is mediated via phosphorylation of phospholamban (35Raeymaekers L. Hofmann F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). At this stage, we cannot be certain of how cGMP elevated by SNP activates Ca2+ reuptake in ECV304 cells. Nonetheless, the specific source of cGMP appears to be important to this effect. SNP is effective at increasing Ca2+ reuptake (Fig. 4, A andB) but not at modulating efflux (Fig. 6 B). The lack of effect of SNP on efflux is corroborated by our results with another NO donor, SNAP (Fig. 6 C). It is possible that activating the particulate guanylate cyclase has some influence on Ca2+ sequestration, but any such effects are masked by the predominant actions of BNP on plasma membrane Ca2+fluxes. The addition of BNP dramatically potentiates the response to ATP (Figs.1 A and 2 B), reduces influx (Fig. 5, Band D), and inhibits efflux (Fig. 6, A andD). We therefore examined the relationship between the elevation of cGMP stimulated by either BNP or SNP and the potentiation of the ATP-evoked elevation of [Ca2+] c . Fig. 2reveals that after incubations of 2, 6, or 10 min with a guanylate cyclase activator, cGMP elevated by BNP causes a potentiation of the [Ca2+] c response, whereas when cGMP is elevated by SNP the effect on the [Ca2+] c response is negligible. When cGMP is elevated by BNP, only very modest increases in cGMP are needed in order to have a substantial effect on [Ca2+] c . Thus, it appears that activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase is disassociated from the potentiation of the [Ca2+] c signal, whereas elevation of cGMP by BNP is tightly coupled to the potentiation of the [Ca2+] c response. The data suggest that the two cGMP pools can act independently. We believe that the BNP-mediated reduction in influx is a consequence of the increased elevation of [Ca2+] c , especially adjacent to the plasma membrane. Both store-operated (36Zweifach A.

Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) show Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Evidence from luminescent and fluorescent indicators suggests that the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ can be greater than in the bulk cytosol (18Graier W.F. Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Hill B.J.F. Fleischhacker E.

Elevated subplasmalemmal Ca2+ has even been postulated as the control mechanism for regulating Ca2+ entry (41Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Van Breemen C. Chen Q. Laher I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 98-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the cGMP-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ efflux leads to an elevation of Ca2+ adjacent to the influx channels, hence causing some degree of inactivation. Inhibition of efflux and the resulting inhibition of influx may be energetically favorable during the maintained elevation of [Ca2+] c in stimulated cells. Lower overall fluxes would also help the termination of [Ca2+] c signals. The BNP-mediated increase in resting [Ca2+] c observed in the absence of extracellular Na+ (Fig. 7) suggests that the BNP-induced inhibition of efflux occurs via the PMCA rather than the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. This argument also applies to stimulated cells (Fig. 1 A). The ∼90% inhibition of efflux observed with BNP and Zaprinast applies to cells where efflux has been stimulated by either warming or the addition of ATP (Fig. 6 C). In unstimulated cells, BNP-sensitive efflux exerts a proportionally smaller effect on resting [Ca2+] c (before the ATP addition; Fig.1 A). The combination of other compensatory factors, such as Ca2+ buffering, Ca2+ sequestration, and Ca2+ efflux via the Na+/Ca2+exchanger (18Graier W.F. Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Hill B.J.F. Fleischhacker E.

Condrescu M. Reeves J.F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), may all influence resting [Ca2+] c . Only when the two efflux pathways are both impaired, as in the absence of extracellular Na+ (Fig.7), does resting [Ca2+] c increase. The ability of BNP to potentiate the response to thapsigargin shows that BNP potentiates an elevation of [Ca2+] c and not signal transduction events prior to Ca2+ release. Since the cGMP-specific PDE5 inhibitor Zaprinast also inhibits Ca2+ efflux, this further substantiates our argument that BNP-induced inhibition of Ca2+ efflux is mediated via cGMP. Although we have established that cGMP-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ extrusion occurs via the PMCA, we have not determined if its action is direct or as a result of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Results from earlier work on the heart (46Méry P.F. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1197-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), on smooth muscle (47Vrolix M. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Hofmann F. Casteels R. Biochem.

Res. 1979; 11: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) indicate that cGMP can also stimulate Ca2+ efflux. Whether efflux is stimulated or inhibited may depend on how the cGMP signal is transduced downstream of cGMP synthesis in a particular cell type. Further experimentation is needed to determine how cGMP modulates PMCA activity. The differential effects of cGMP elevation on Ca2+homeostasis and the importance of its location may serve as an explanation for the results obtained with Bt2cGMP. We have shown that the addition of Bt2cGMP only caused a moderate additional increase in the ATP-induced sustained rise in [Ca2+] c (Fig. 1 C). The potentiation observed with the analogue is not as prominent as that of BNP (Fig.1 A). This is probably because this agent acts uniformly throughout the cells, influencing both reuptake and efflux, thereby losing the more specific effects of localized cGMP. Natriuretic peptides are potent circulating vasodilators generated in the right atrium, brain, kidney, and endothelium (23Ruskoaho H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 479-602PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action we describe here represents a novel mechanism by which these hormones can exert their physiological actions. However, the NO-mediated effects on Ca2+ reuptake into the intracellular stores are quite distinct from the modulation of Ca2+efflux seen with BNP. These differential effects may be particularly important in cells continually exposed to either NO or natriuretic peptides (50Jin X-H. Siragy H.M. Guerrant R.L. Carey R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 51Hölschermann H. Noll T. Hempel A. Piper H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H91-H98PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we find that activation of the particulate guanylate cyclase leads to inhibition of Ca2+ efflux by the PMCA, a reduction in cation influx, and a marked potentiation of agonist-evoked elevation of [Ca2+] c . Activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase did not influence plasma membrane Ca2+fluxes but did increase Ca2+ reuptake into the intracellular stores. We have shown in this report that differential production of cGMP within a cell can cause distinct effects on [Ca2+] c , thus somewhat clarifying the complex interrelation between these two intracellular signaling molecules. The distinction between the different sources of cGMP is therefore necessary to evaluate the physiological and intracellular effects of this cyclic nucleotide in different cell types.

https://openalex.org/W2317451807,"Cyclin dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) activity is controlled by the binding of regulatory subunits and inhibitory factors, as well as tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. More recently the influence of calcium levels have been demonstrated. Using transient transfections in Jurkat cells, we observed specific binding between cdk4 and the calcium and calmodulin activated serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin with FK506 and cyclosporin A resulted in an overall increase in cdk4 kinase activity, suggesting that the phosphatase activity of calcineurin was inhibitory to the kinase activity of cdk4. In contrast, we were not able to observe a similar effect on the kinase activity of either cdk6 or cdk2, indicating that the phosphatase activity of calcineurin was specific for cdk4. In addition, using an in vitro phosphatase assay for calcineurin, we observed that the exogenous addition of calcineurin resulted in the dephosphorylation of cdk4, an event that downregulated the kinase activity of cdk4. Calcineurin could, therefore, play an opposing role to the action of the cyclin activating kinase complex, an enzyme that upregulates the kinase activity of cdk4, an important G0/G1 checkpoint element in mammalian cells."

These disorders are due to different genetic defects affecting transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and/or global genome repair (GGR), the nucleotide excision repair subpathways which remove UV-induced lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes or from the rest of the genome, respectively. After 20 J/m2 UV light, normal and GGR-defective XP-C fibroblasts showed rapid increase in p53, late induction of Mdm2 and no evidence of apoptosis even 96 h after irradiation. In contrast, in XP-A (defective in GGR and TCR), CS-A and CS-B (defective only in TCR) fibroblasts, the p53 increase was not followed by Mdm2 induction and the persistence of high levels of p53, due to the lack of its degradation by Mdm2, was associated with the appearance of apoptosis. Besides indicating that the persistence of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of active genes leads to apoptosis, these findings provide the first evidence that the lack of activation of Mdm2 plays a key role in the cascade of events leading to apoptosis."

Single-base deletions are among the most common replication errors (1Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8003-8011Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The intermediates for deletions and additions were initially suggested to result from slippage of the two DNA strands (2Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). When this occurs in a homopolymeric sequence, misaligned template-primers may be stabilized by correct base pairs (Fig.1 A). As the run length increases, there is a concomitant increase in the number of correct base pairs that can stabilize the misalignment. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 A for runs of 4, 6, and 8 template thymidine residues. There is also an increase in the distance between the 3′ terminus and the extra base and an increase in the number of possible intermediates that can form; only one intermediate is shown for each run length. These features predict that the single-base deletion error rate during DNA synthesis will increase as the length of homopolymeric runs increases. Previous studies have shown that the error rate of several DNA polymerases does indeed increase with increasing run length (reviewed in Ref. 3Kunkel, T. A., and Bebenek, K. (2000) Annu. Rev. Biochem.69, in pressGoogle Scholar), such that single-base deletion rates can substantially exceed single-base substitution error rates. The relationship between deletion rate and run length implies that an extra template nucleotide in a misaligned duplex template-primer resides some distance from the polymerase active site, and that deletion error rates may be affected by changes distal to the polymerase active site. This is supported by studies of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT)1 (4Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R. Luxon B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct.

These studies have shown that the rates of single-base deletions and additions in homopolymeric sequences are modulated by polymerase interactions with the DNA minor groove three to five base pairs upstream of the active site. Several distinct events may initiate formation of single-base deletion intermediates. Slippage of the template and primer strands has been suggested to occur during dissociation and/or reassociation of the DNA polymerase with the DNA (6Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12866-12874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

This idea is supported by a correlation between the processivity of polymerization and single-base deletion and addition error rates (reviewed in Ref. 3Kunkel, T. A., and Bebenek, K. (2000) Annu. Rev. Biochem.69, in pressGoogle Scholar). For those polymerases with intrinsic exonuclease activity, misalignments may form (8Fujii S. Akiyama M. Aoki K. Sugaya Y. Higuchi K. Hiraoka M. Miki Y.

Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during movement of the primer strand between the polymerase and the exonuclease active sites. Frameshift intermediates can also be corrected by exonucleolytic proofreading (9Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), albeit sometimes with lower efficiency that for base substitutions (10Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Kroutil L.C. Frey M.W. Kaboord B.F. Kunkel T.A. Benkovic S.J. J. Mol.

DNA polymerases also delete non-iterated template nucleotides during DNA synthesis. As an alternative to strand slippage, deletions of either iterated or non-iterated nucleotides may be initiated by nucleotide misinsertion (13Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Misinsertion is generally rare because the active site of a DNA polymerase is designed to accept geometrically equivalent Watson-Crick base pairs and to reject base pairs differing from this geometry (see Ref. 3Kunkel, T. A., and Bebenek, K. (2000) Annu. Rev. Biochem.69, in pressGoogle Scholar for a recent review). Occasional failure of geometric selection can result in a base substitution if a mismatched terminus is extended to leave a mismatched base pair in duplex DNA. However, misinsertion immediately followed by relocation of the primer strand can result in a misaligned template-primer containing an unpaired template-strand nucleotide adjacent to a correct terminal base pair that facilitates further polymerization (Fig. 1 B). The idea that misinsertion happens first, with the mismatched product then initiating a deletion mutation, is supported by several studies of DNA polymerases copying undamaged or damaged DNA. Polymerase structure-function studies indicate that nucleotide insertion fidelity depends on DNA polymerase interactions in the DNA minor groove in the active site (reviewed in Ref. 3Kunkel, T. A., and Bebenek, K. (2000) Annu. Rev. Biochem.69, in pressGoogle Scholar). Here we provide a further analysis of the misinsertion-primer relocation model by determining if altered DNA polymerase interactions with the DNA minor groove in the active site also influence single-base deletion error rates. We also consider a third model (Fig. 1 C) for the origin of single-base deletion intermediates. This model is suggested by comparison of the position of template strand nucleotides in the crystal structure of DNA polymerase β (pol β) in different conformations. The crystal structures of several DNA polymerases with and without substrates indicate that they are either in an “open” or a “closed” conformation (reviewed in Ref. 14Doublié S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the closed conformation, DNA polymerases are poised for catalysis with the base of the incoming nucleoside triphosphate hydrogen bonded to the templating base. For example, the crystal structures of the closed ternary pol β·DNA·ddCTP complexes (15Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 16Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) indicate that the templating guanine is correctly aligned and paired with a complementary incoming ddCTP. An important feature of the closed structure of pol β bound to a one-nucleotide DNA gap is that the next template base to be copied (i.e. one base 5′ to the templating base, designated n+1 in Fig. 2, panels A and B) is moved out of the DNA helix axis (Fig.2 A). The nucleotide is stabilized by a histidine side chain in the amino-terminal lyase domain (not shown) of pol β (see Ref. 17Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, for a review). This displacement gives polymerase side chains access to the minor groove at the growing end of the duplex, allowing correct alignment that depends on Arg283, located on α-helix N (Fig. 2 A) in the carboxyl-terminal subdomain of pol β. In a closed conformation, the side chain of Arg283 (purple ball-and-stick in Fig. 2 A) makes van der Waals contacts with the minor groove edge of the templating base and can form a hydrogen bond with the sugar of the n−1 template nucleotide. In contrast, in the open conformation (green in Fig. 2), the side chain of Arg283 does not interact with DNA (16Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 18Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, when pol β is bound to template-primer DNA and is in an open conformation, Arg283 cannot interact with the minor groove edge of the template nucleotide and the n+1 nucleotide is not stabilized by an aromatic side chain. In this case, the N3 atom of the template guanine (green “n” in Fig. 2 B) is moved 3.0 Å relative to its location in the closed complex (purple “n,” Fig. 2 B). This difference in location is similar to the 3.4 Å difference between the position of the N3 of the templating guanine in the closed complex compared with the position of the adjacent template base (n+1) of the open complex (Fig.2 B). This comparison suggests that as α-helix N rotates to a closed position, the incoming nucleotide (purple ddCTP in Fig. 2 B) could on occasion pair with the n+1 base, generating a single-base deletion intermediate (Fig.1 C). To test these ideas, here we compare the single-base deletion error rate of wild-type human pol β to those of mutants in which the Arg283 side chain has been changed to either lysine or alanine. These amino acid replacements alter interactions between pol β and the DNA minor groove such that the R283K and R283A mutants have strongly increased misinsertion rates (20Werneburg B.G. Ahn J.

Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This provides an opportunity to examine the importance to frameshift fidelity of DNA minor groove interactions at the active site. Moreover, the error specificity data can be interpreted within the context of the three models shown in Fig.1. As discussed below, we attempt to distinguish between these models through the use of specifically designed templates that permit detection of single-nucleotide deletions during synthesis to fill gapped DNA substrates similar to those used by pol β during base excision repair. The sources of all materials, including recombinant human pol β derivatives, and the preparation of gapped substrates have been described (10Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis reactions to fill gapped substrates and product analysis to determine error rates were performed as described (22Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Double stranded circular DNA substrates contained 6-nucleotide single-stranded template gaps in the coding sequence of the lacZ α-complementation sequence of M13mp2 (22Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These sequences are in the +1 reading frame, resulting in a colorless M13 plaque phenotype. When the products of gap-filling DNA synthesis are introduced into an Escherichia coliα-complementation strain and plated on indicator plates, polymerase errors that restore the correct reading frame are seen as blue revertants. The target sequences are located near the amino terminus of the LacZ gene that has a promiscuous amino acid composition, such that concomitant base substitutions (see below) do not limit the ability to detect frameshift errors as blue revertants. In an attempt to distinguish between the three models for deletion errors illustrated in Fig. 1, we first determined the single-base deletion error rates for wild-type pol β during copying of runs of three to eight template thymidines located within single-stranded gaps of >300 nucleotides (10Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The results (Table I, A) indicate that the deletion error rate increases with increasing run length. This relationship has also been observed with other DNA polymerases (3Kunkel, T. A., and Bebenek, K. (2000) Annu. Rev. Biochem.69, in pressGoogle Scholar) and is predicted by the model wherein misaligned intermediates in repetitive sequences are stabilized by correct base pairing, as in Fig. 1 A. In considering how misalignments might be initiated, note that all the substrates used in this analysis (Table I, A) contained a guanine as the 5′-template base flanking the run. In this case, single-base deletions initiated by misinsertion as is illustrated in Fig. 1 B, requires misinsertion of dCMP opposite the 5′-most T in the run followed by pairing of this dCMP with the flanking guanine. However, as the length of the run increases beyond four thymidines, the rate of single-base deletions (Table I, A) exceeds the previously measured misinsertion and stable misincorporation rates for T·dCMP mispairs (Table I, B and C). This implies that the majority of single-base deletions generated by wild-type pol β in homopolymeric sequences need not be initiated by misinsertion. The experiment was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The revertant frequencies of single-stranded DNAs used to construct the gapped substrates, but not copied in vitro, are all much lower than the values listed (10Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

C, rate of stable (i.e. misinsertion and extension) dCTP misincorporations by human pol β opposite template T (underlined) (25Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When the 3′-flanking template strand base is also a T, some portion of the T·dCMP mispairs could form via a dislocation mechanism (13Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), potentially overestimating the actual misinsertion rate. Next we tested the hypothesis that frameshift errors are modulated by polymerase interactions in the DNA minor groove that align the template base with the incoming dNTP. We compared the single-base deletion error rate of wild-type pol β to those of R283K and R283A mutants that have altered interactions with the minor groove in the active site. These experiments were conducted with substrates containing gaps of only 6 nucleotides, since the catalytic efficiency of the R283K and R283A mutant polymerases is reduced (18Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P.

Thus, they will not fill gaps of >300 nucleotides but readily filled one to five nucleotide gaps such as those typically encountered during base excision repair (18Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R.

DNA synthesis by wild-type pol β to copy a 5′-GTTTTA-3′ template sequence within a 6-nucleotide gap generated products with a revertant frequency of 37 × 10−4(Table II). This value is consistent with previous studies (24Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5787-5796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) indicating that pol β has lower frameshift fidelity than any of the eukaryotic DNA polymerases except pol η (26Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Synthesis by the R283K and R283A mutants generated revertant frequencies that were 16- and 38-fold higher, respectively, than for wild-type pol β (Table II). This suggests that the ability of pol β to prevent single-base deletions is modulated by the Arg283 side chain. Sequence analysis of 32 LacZrevertants generated by wild-type pol β showed that 31 had lost one of the T residues in the TTTT run (Fig.3), yielding an error rate of 150 × 10−5 for wild type pol β (i.e. one deletion for every 670 template thymidines copied). All revertants generated by the mutant polymerases were missing one thymidine (Fig. 3). One revertant from the R283K reaction with the 5′-GTTTTA-3′ substrate contained a T deletion in combination with a T → G transversion (Fig.3). Six of 30 revertants from the R283A reaction contained a T deletion in combination with a single-base substitution, and one contained a T deletion in combination with a tandem double-base substitution (Fig.3). The appearance of these base substitution errors in combination with the deletions is not unexpected, since the R283K and R283A mutant DNA polymerases have reduced base substitution fidelity (18Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The control value is for the single-stranded DNA used to construct the gapped substrates. The above studies involve a repetitive template sequence. Previous studies have shown that pol β also generates deletions of non-iterated nucleotides; these comprise 4–7% of all errors generated by wild-type pol β when copying undamaged DNA templates (25Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Opresko P.L. Sweasy J.B. Eckert K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Li S.X. Vaccaro J.A. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation at repetitive sequences, these non-iterated single-base deletions would seem less likely to be initiated by strand slippage. This is because a one-nucleotide slip at a non-iterated sequence would yield a template-primer containing both a terminal mismatch and an unpaired template-strand nucleotide (e.g. Fig. 1 A, last intermediate shown). To examine possible alternatives to the slippage model, we next measured the single-base deletion error rates of wild-type pol β and the R283K and R283A mutants when copying a non-iterated template sequence in a 6-nucleotide gap (Table II). The base substitution specificity of the mutant polymerases was already known for a TGA codon in a 5-nucleotide gap (22Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to distinguish between the misinsertion-primer relocation model (Fig. 1 B) and the dNTP misalignment model (Fig. 1 C) by measuring deletion rates using a template that also contained a TGA sequence, 5′-cagTGA-3′. Deletion of a single T, G, or A will yield blue plaques, whereas deletion of any of the first three nucleotides (i.e. cag) generates nonsense codons in the correct reading frame and therefore does not yield a blue plaque. DNA synthesis by the wild-type enzyme generated products with a revertant frequency of 2.2 × 10−4 (Table II), and 11 of 12 revertants subjected to sequence analysis had lost one nucleotide (Fig. 3). This yields an error rate of 11 × 10−5, a value 13-fold lower than for deletions by wild-type pol β in the TTTT run (Table II). This difference between a TTTT run and a non-iterated sequence is consistent with the strand slippage model (Fig.1 A) and the relationship between run length and error rate shown above (Table II). We then determined the single-base deletion error rates for synthesis by the R283K and R283A mutants. These mutant polymerases generated DNA products with revertant frequencies that were elevated by 100- and 190-fold, respectively, compared with the revertant frequency observed with wild-type pol β (Table II). When 46 LacZ revertants were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis, all were found to contain single-base deletions (Fig. 3), including seven that also contained a single-base substitution. Thus, the R283K and R283A mutants are strong mutator polymerases for loss of single, non-iterated nucleotides. This further supports the general hypothesis that interactions of the Arg283 side chain with the minor groove edge of the template strand modulate the rate of single-base deletions generated by pol β. This study of the single base deletion fidelity of human pol β suggests three major conclusions. First, replacement of the Arg283 side chain with either lysine or alanine strongly increases error rates (Table II), suggesting that the DNA minor groove interactions in the polymerase active site provided by Arg283 are important for proper substrate alignment that prevents formation of deletion intermediates. Second, the correlation between increasing deletion error rate and increasing length of a homonucleotide run (Tables I and II), and the fact that the single-base deletion error rates can greatly exceed misincorporation rates (TableII), strongly support the strand slippage hypothesis for deletions in homonucleotide runs generated by wild-type pol β (Fig.1 A). Third, wild-type pol β also deletes non-iterated nucleotides, and the error rate is increased by 100-fold or more upon replacement of the Arg283 side chain (Table II). This implies that some deletions likely result from a non-slippage mechanism that is modulated by DNA minor groove interactions at the active site. We consider two possible models, misinsertion-primer relocation (Fig.1 B) and dNTP misalignment (Fig. 1 C). In an attempt to distinguish between these two models, we used the following logic. If single-base deletions are initiated by misinsertion, then the deletion rate should not exceed the known rate for misincorporations that could realign to form a deletion intermediate (Fig. 1 B). For example, the rate of loss of the T in the 5′-cagTGA-3′ sequence should not exceed the rate at which dCMP is misinserted opposite the T. This is because this misinsertion is needed to pair with the adjacent template G in order to generate the deletion intermediate (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, if deletions are initiated by dCTP pairing with the adjacent template guanine (Fig. 1 C), then misincorporation of dCMP opposite T is not necessary. In this case, the deletion error rate could, but need not necessarily, exceed the base substitution error rate. With this logic in mind, we used the data in Table II and Fig. 3 to calculate the rates at which wild-type pol β and the R283K and R283A mutants deleted a T, G, or A nucleotide from the non-iterated sequence. We then compared these rates to the known base substitution error rates of these same polymerases at the TGA codon in a five-nucleotide gap (22Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The results (Table III) reveal that base substitution error rates exceed deletion rates for all three nucleotides with wild-type pol β, for one of three nucleotides (loss of A) with R283K pol β and for two of three nucleotides (loss of G or A) with R283A pol β. In other words, in these situations misinsertion rates are more than sufficient to explain the deletions by the model in Fig. 1 B. However, the rate at which the R283K mutant deletes T or G and the rate at which the R283A mutant deletes T are similar to the base substitution error rates. Some of these deletions may be initiated via pairing of the incoming dNTP with the next base, as illustrated in Fig. 1 C and suggested by structural considerations (see below).Table IIIBase substitution and deletion error ratesEnzymeErrordCTP·TdATP·GdCTP·AWild typeSubstitution0.20.20.3Deletion0.120.060.03R283KSubstitution241.338Deletion35≤1.63.2R283ASubstitution301560Deletion37≤3.131The base substitution error rates are for synthesis to fill a 5-nucleotide gap (22Osheroff W.P.

Superimposing the structures of the open conformation of pol β bound to non-gapped template-primer (18Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H.

Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) indicates that the template nucleotides (n and n+1) of the open conformation are not in register relative to those in the closed form (Fig. 2,panels A and B). Similarly, superimposing this open conformation with the closed ternary complex of pol β bound to non-gapped DNA (15Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) results in the same observation (not shown). The “vicinity” of the n+1 templating nucleotide in the open conformation with the templating nucleotide (i.e. n) in the closed form suggests that there are opportunities for the incoming nucleoside triphosphate to base pair with the n+1 template base (dNTP misalignment, Fig. 1 C). Additionally, if an incorrect nucleotide is inserted opposite the templating nucleotide (i.e. n) and the misinserted nucleotide is complementary to the n+1 templating nucleotide, then the vicinity of the n+1 template base to the dNTP-binding site could facilitate primer relocation following misinsertion (Fig. 1 B). As illustrated by comparing the last intermediates shown in Panels B and C of Fig. 1, an important distinction between the misinsertion-primer relocation model and the dNTP misalignment model for single-base deletions is whether the misalignment occurs before or after phosphodiester bond formation. Making this distinction will require approaches beyond measuring deletion errors among the completed products of DNA synthesis, including examination of intermediate steps in the process. Relevant to this point are studies of the rate at which pol β inserts nucleotides when copying DNA templates containing abasic sites (29Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or propanodeoxyguanosine adducts (30Hashim M.F. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20205-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In these circumstances, catalytic efficiencies were greatest for insertion of nucleotides that were complementary to the n+1 template base. On that basis, it was suggested that pol β generates base substitutions at sites of DNA damage by dNTP misalignment. In like manner, dNTP misalignment could theoretically explain some of the base substitutions generated by pol β (25Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) all generate single-nucleotide deletions, but at quite different rates. Some of these are deletions of non-iterated nucleotides that occur at rates consistent with the misinsertion-primer relocation model (Fig. 1 B). However, structural considerations of frameshift fidelity differ among the polymerases. For example, in contrast to the situation with pol β (Fig. 2 B), the templating nucleotide in the open complex of HIV-1 RT bound to DNA (38Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) is located in a position similar to that seen in the closed ternary complex poised for catalysis (39Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). In other words, the templating base in the open complex of HIV-1 RT is in register. This is illustrated by comparing the position of the templating base n in Fig. 2, panels B andC. This difference between pol β and HIV-1 RT may relate to differences in the nature of the subdomain movements that occur following dNTP binding. For example, the template strand in the pol β complex may be minimally constrained until the dNTP binds and helix N rotates to a closed conformation. This motion allows the Arg283 side chain to contact the minor groove edge of the template strand (Fig. 2 A), thus aligning it for correct pairing. However, the opposite symmetry holds for HIV-1 RT,i.e. the axis for rotation to a closed conformation is on the other side of the binding pocket for the nascent base pair (Fig.2 C). This may allow stabilizing contacts between the enzyme and the templating strand even in the open conformation, with closure of the β3-β4 loop of RT eventually correctly positioning the incoming dNTP. The axis of rotation to a closed conformation is similarly located on the templating-nucleotide side of the binding pocket in pol I family DNA polymerases (reviewed in Ref. 3Kunkel, T. A., and Bebenek, K. (2000) Annu. Rev. Biochem.69, in pressGoogle Scholar). Also, in the ternary closed complex of T7 DNA polymerase (40Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), HIV-1 RT (39Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), and pol β bound to a one-nucleotide DNA gap (16Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), the n+1 nucleotide is flipped out of the DNA helix and stacks with an aromatic amino acid side chain. Thus, depending on yet to be determined conformational dynamics as these polymerases move from open to closed conformations following dNTP binding, the incoming dNTP may not have the opportunity to pair with the n+1 nucleotide. Differences in the symmetry of subdomain closure, in template nucleotide register and in template nucleotide flipping, may explain why the insertion specificity of Klenow fragment polymerase (a homolog of T7 pol) and HIV-1 RT do not suggest that the incoming dNTP has paired with the n+1 nucleotide when these enzymes copy damaged templates (30Hashim M.F. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20205-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Cai H. Bloom L.B. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23567-23572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flipping of the n+1 nucleotide may or may not modulate the single-nucleotide deletion error rate of pol β. The n+1 nucleotide is displaced and stacked with His34 in a closed ternary complex of pol β bound to DNA containing a single-nucleotide gap (16Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, no such nucleotide displacement was observed when the downstream DNA was single-stranded (15Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 18Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J.

In this case, the amino-terminal 8-kDa domain (i.e.His34) is not observed to be interacting with the DNA. The strong frameshift mutator phenotypes of the R283K and R283A mutants (Table II) imply that prevention of single-base deletions by wild-type pol β is modulated by side chain interactions with the DNA minor groove at the active site. This may explain the elevated rates of single-nucleotide deletions observed with two other pol β mutants, Y265C (27Opresko P.L. Sweasy J.B. Eckert K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and F272L (28Li S.X. Vaccaro J.A. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both Tyr265 and Phe272 occupy positions in the α-helix M that rotates as helix N opens and closes. Since α-helix N contains Arg283, substitutions of other side chains for Tyr265 and Phe272 could indirectly alter the ability of the Arg283 side chain to correctly align the template strand.

https://openalex.org/W1969580799,"A region on chromosome 14q32.1 is often involved in chromosomal translocations and inversions with one of the T-cell receptor loci in T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases. The breakpoints of the different rearrangements segregate into two clusters; a cluster due to inversion on the centromeric side and a cluster due to simple balanced translocations on the telomeric side. If the target gene activated by these different types of chromosomal rearrangements is the same, the gene must be localized between the two clusters of breakpoints in a region of around 160 kb. Within this breakpoint cluster region, we isolated two genes; namely, TCL1 and TML1/TCL1b genes. In the course of characterizing the TML1 gene, we further identified a third novel gene, which we named TCL6 (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6), from a region 7 kb upstream of the TML1 locus. The TCL6 gene expressed at least 11 isoforms through very complex alternative-splicing, including splicing with the TML1 gene. Those isoforms encode at least five open reading frames (ORFs) with no homology to known sequences. The localization of the proteins corresponding to these ORF was determined by fusing green fluorescence protein at the carboxyl terminal of each ORF. ORF141 and ORF72 were observed in the cytoplasmic region, while ORF105, ORF119, and ORF163 were predominantly localized in the nuclear region. Since the TCL6 gene was expressed in T-cell leukemia carrying a t(14;14)(q11;q32.1) chromosome translocation and was not expressed in normal T-cells (just like the TML1 and TCL1 genes), it is also a candidate gene potentially involved in leukemogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2016881508,"The Escherichia coli RuvABC proteins process recombination intermediates during genetic recombination and recombinational repair. Although early biochemical studies indicated distinct RuvAB-mediated branch migration and RuvC-mediated Holliday junction resolution reactions, more recent studies have shown that the three proteins act together as a “resolvasome” complex. In this work we have used recombination intermediates made by RecA to determine whether the RuvAB proteins affect the sequence specificity of the RuvC resolvase. We find that RuvAB proteins do not alter significantly the site specificity of RuvC-dependent cleavage, although under certain conditions, they do affect the efficiency of cleavage at particular sites. The presence of RecA also influences cleavage at some sites. We also show that the RuvAB proteins act upon transient strand exchange intermediates made using substrates that have the opposite polarity of those preferred by RecA. Together, our results allow us to develop further a model for the recombinational repair of DNA lesions that lead to the formation of post-replication gaps during DNA replication. The novel features of this model are as follows: (i) the RuvABC resolvasome recognizes joints made by RecA; (ii) resolution by RuvABC occurs at specific sites containing the RuvC consensus cleavage sequence 5′-(A/T)TT↓(G/C)-3′; and (iii) Holliday junction resolution often occurs close to the initiating gap without significant heteroduplex DNA formation.

Genetic exchange begins with the pairing and alignment of two homologous DNA molecules. After alignment, a single-stranded end from one molecule invades the second duplex; this is followed by further strand transfer between the molecules to produce a four-stranded exchange or Holliday junction. The protein that promotes these pairing and strand exchange activities is highly conserved throughout evolution. Prokaryotes possess one such protein, typified by Escherichia coli RecA, but in eukaryotic organisms two homologues, Rad51 and Dmc1, have been identified (1Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T.

To maintain cell viability, Holliday junctions formed during recombination or recombinational repair must be resolved to liberate the individual DNA molecules. In E. coli, Holliday junction processing is mediated by the RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC proteins (reviewed in Ref. 9West S.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 213-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). RuvA is a junction-specific DNA-binding protein (10Parsons C.A. Tsaneva I. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5452-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The structure of RuvA has been solved both in solution and as a cocrystal with synthetic junction DNA. It binds as a tetramer to either one or both faces of the junction, thereby positioning the arms of the junction in an unfolded, almost square-planar configuration (11Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E.

The failure of a class of RuvC mutant proteins that display reduced specificity of cleavage in vitro to complement ruvC mutations emphasizes the biological importance of this sequence specificity (30Hagan N.F.P.

Like RuvA, RuvC interacts with RuvB (31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C.

Biol. 1998; 278: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) studies support the proposal that RuvABC proteins form a Holliday junction-processing complex that mediates concerted branch migration and resolution. Since theruvA and ruvB genes form an operon that is regulated by the SOS system and their expression is induced as a result of DNA damage (40Benson F.E. Illing G.T. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Shinagawa H. Makino K. Amemura M. Kimura S. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that two types of complex might form in vivo as follows: (i) a RuvABC complex capable of promoting branch migration and resolution, and (ii) a subcomplex consisting of RuvAB alone, which would mediate only branch migration (31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42West S.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 699-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An excess of RuvAB proteins during times of cellular stress would ensure that all RuvC molecules, present in limiting amounts under normal growth conditions, are incorporated into a productive resolution complex. Such a complex is likely to be particularly useful in the recombinational repair of post-replication gaps opposite UV-induced lesions. Recent studies also suggest that the RuvAB complex may function independently of RuvC in the repair of arrested replication forks (43Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); in fact, the cleavage of a Holliday junction generated under these conditions has been proposed to cause a potentially lethal double-strand break. Previously, we examined the overall characteristics of an in vitro system in which RuvABC proteins were added to an on-going RecA-mediated strand exchange reaction (31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that both branch migration and resolution occurred in the presence of RecA protein but did not determine whether the cleavage activity of RuvC or the preferred sites of resolution were affected at the molecular level by the presence of either RuvAB or RecA. In the studies presented below, we have examined in detail whether the association of RuvC with RuvAB affects its cleavage properties. RecA, RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC proteins were purified as described (31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and concentrations are expressed in terms of monomer. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; all other restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. The construction of phagemids pDEA-7Z, pAKE-7Z, and pPB4.3 has been described (27Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C.

Duplex DNA was prepared using a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). Circular (+) ssDNA1 and gapped circular DNA were prepared as described (27Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were determined using ε280 = 8784 and 6500m−1 cm−1for ss- and double-stranded DNA, respectively, and are expressed in terms of molar nucleotide (nt) or molecule. DNAs linearized withPstI or XmnI and the 50-bp ladder size marker (Sigma) were 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]ddATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. DNA linearized withBamHI was 3′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and exo− Klenow. DNA linearized withBsaI was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase and was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. In each case, unincorporated nucleotide was separated from the labeled DNA using a Microspin S-400 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Linearized DNAs were digested with a second restriction enzyme as noted, and the fragment containing the label at the end that was used to initiate strand exchange was excised from an agarose gel and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Labeled linear phagemid DNAs were stored in TE containing 30% ethanol at −20 °C, whereas labeled marker DNA was precipitated, resuspended in formamide/urea loading buffer (1 ml of formamide, 750 mg of urea, 80 μl of 50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 80 μl of 0.5% bromphenol blue, 80 μl of 0.5% xylene cyanol), and stored at 4 °C. In the standard four-stranded reaction utilizingPstI/BsaI pDEA-7Z gDNA andPstI/ScaI pDEA-7Z linear DNA, gDNA (10 μm nt; 1.72 nm molecule) was preincubated with RecA protein (4 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 15 mmMg(OAc)2, 20 mm KOAc, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 2 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following this preincubation, uniquely 3′-32P-end-labeled linear duplex DNA (1.6 μm; 0.29 nm molecule) was added to initiate strand exchange. Ten minutes after addition of the linear DNA, Ruv protein(s), premixed in enzyme dilution buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol), were added as indicated; typically, the reaction was incubated for a further 20 min. When reactions were to be subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, the products were deproteinized by adding 5× stop buffer (2.5% SDS, 10 mg/ml proteinase K) to a final concentration of 1× and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min; 6× gel loading buffer was then added to a final concentration of 1×. When reactions were to be analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they were stopped by adding EDTA to 50 mm, extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), back-extracted with TE, and precipitated at −20 °C with sodium acetate and ethanol in siliconized tubes. The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, dried under vacuum for 10 min, and resuspended in 6 μl of formamide/urea loading buffer. Before loading onto the gel, the samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and then stored on ice. Three-stranded reactions were performed essentially as described above with the following modifications. Gapped DNA was replaced by 5 μm nt (1.72 nm molecule) ssDNA. The concentration of labeled linear DNA was increased to 5 μm(0.89 nm molecule). When included, SSB protein (0.45 μm) was added after 5 min of preincubation, and the reaction was incubated for another 5 min before addition of the linear DNA. Deproteinized four-stranded and three-stranded recombination intermediates were prepared as described previously (31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using the reaction conditions outlined above. Reactions for agarose gel analysis were conducted in a 65-μl volume at 37 °C in the buffer described above, with 10 μm nt (1.72 nmmolecule) PstI/BsaI pDEA-7Z gDNA and 4 μm RecA. SSB protein (2 μm) was added after 5 min, and 5 min later, 5′-32P-end-labeled, BsaI pDEA-7Z linear duplex DNA (1.6 μm nt; 0.27 nmmolecule) was added. Ruv protein(s) were added to a final concentration of 200 nm RuvA, 200 nm RuvB, and 100 nm RuvC. Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at the indicated times and deproteinized as described above, except that the 5× stop buffer also contained 2.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Reactions were incubated with the linear DNA for 20 min before addition of the Ruv proteins. Reaction products were separated on 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.4), 1 mm EDTA) at 4.6 V/cm for 4 h at room temperature with buffer recirculation. Both the gels and the running buffer contained 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. For examination of the sites of cleavage, reaction products were separated on either 5 or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (89 mmTris borate (pH 8.2), 2 mm EDTA) at 60 watts for 4–6 h. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat or BioMax MR film. Effect of RuvAB on the Cleavage Specificity of RuvC—In vitro recombination intermediates containing a Holliday junction (α-structures) are formed by RecA-mediated strand exchange between gapped circular and homologous linear duplex DNAs (Fig. 1). Addition of the RuvABC Holliday junction processing proteins to an ongoing strand exchange reaction results in the earlier formation of branch migration products and also the creation of resolution products (31Eggleston A.K. Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous studies identified the degenerate sequence 5′-(A/T)TT↓(G/C)-3′ as the site selected for resolution by RuvC protein (27Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, we analyzed whether the presence of RecA and/or the RuvAB proteins affect the cleavage specificity or efficiency of RuvC. To permit this analysis, three pairs of gapped circular and linear duplex DNA molecules were used. Each substrate is designated by the enzymes employed in their construction (Fig. 2). For gDNAs (e.g. PstI/BsaI pDEA-7Z), the enzymes indicate the double digest performed to generate the linear fragment that was annealed to circular homologous ssDNA during the preparation of gapped circular DNA. For linear DNAs (e.g. PstI/ScaI pDEA-7Z), the first enzyme indicates the uniquely 3′-end-labeled terminus that initiates strand exchange, whereas the second identifies the digest used to remove label from the distal end. Removal of the distal label permitted unambiguous identification of the sites of cleavage without having to perform primer extension analysis. Because the distal label was removed, each linear DNA is shorter than the gDNA molecule with which it reacts. Therefore, the product of complete strand exchange is a ς-structure (Fig. 1). When gapped circular PstI/BsaI pDEA-7Z DNA was reacted with homologous 32P-labeledPstI/ScaI linear duplex DNA (Fig. 2) in the presence of RecA, we observed the presence of α-structures after 10 min (Fig. 3, lane b), followed by ς-structures (lane c) as the strand exchange reaction went to completion. Addition of RuvAB to this ongoing reaction att = 10 min resulted in enhanced branch migration and the more complete conversion of α-structures to ς-shaped products at 30 min (lane d). Due to the bi-directional nature of the RuvAB reaction, however, approximately half the α-structures were converted back into the starting substrates (compare the amounts of linear duplex DNA in lanes c and d). Addition of RuvC to either the RecA (lane e) or the RecA/RuvAB (lane f) reaction resulted in the production of both32P-labeled linear dimer and nicked circular resolution products. To determine the effect of RuvAB on the specificity or efficiency of cleavage at each RuvC cleavage consensus site, the resolution products of reactions similar to those shown in Fig. 3 (lanes e andf) were analyzed as a function of time by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 A). Since the label was at the 3′-end that initiates strand exchange, the shortest fragments arise from cleavage near the gap, which spans 175 nt in this substrate. With RuvC alone, a series of discrete bands were observed, most of which correspond to predicted consensus cleavage products (Fig. 4 A, lanes b–g, consensus sites are indicated by filled arrowheads). The intensity of these bands increased over time in a coordinated fashion (i.e. all sites appeared to be cleaved with similar kinetics), although the intensities of all cleavage products were not equal (compare, for example, the strong 270- and weak 421-nt cleavage products). When RuvAB proteins were present (lanes i–n), a similar cleavage pattern was observed, and the intensities of the products were comparable to those seen in their absence. Under both conditions, some non-consensus sites were cleaved (see band at 725 nt, indicated byopen arrowhead). We had anticipated that the presence of RuvAB might affect the intensities of the cleavage products, given their ability to promote branch migration. The observation that the relative intensities of the cleavage products were not altered when RuvAB were present suggested that the positional distribution of Holliday junctions was not changed by RuvAB-mediated branch migration when the three Ruv proteins were added simultaneously to reactions containing RecA protein. To test this proposal, RuvC was added to reactions at various times after RuvAB. If our interpretation was correct, increasing the amount of time between the two additions would allow RuvAB to branch migrate the junctions in the absence of the resolvase, and a difference in the intensity of the cleavage products would be detected. In Fig. 4 B (lanes c–j), it is shown that the intensity of each cleavage product decreases as the time of incubation between the addition of RuvAB and that of RuvC increases. Since the efficiency of cleavage in each reaction was similar (data not shown), these results demonstrate that RuvAB-mediated branch migration is occurring and results in the movement of Holliday junctions beyond our region of analysis. The data presented in Fig. 4 indicate that RuvAB proteins do not affect the cleavage specificity of RuvC. To analyze whether RuvAB proteins play a role in targeting RuvC to the Holliday junction, we varied the concentration of resolvase to determine whether, at subsaturating RuvC concentrations, RuvAB could stimulate resolution. In the absence of RuvAB (Fig.5, lanes d–i), cleavage at each consensus site was modestly enhanced with increasing RuvC, although at the highest concentration of protein (640 nm), a reduction in cleavage was observed, presumably due to the aggregation of RuvC (45Dunderdale H.J. Benson F.E. Parsons C.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Nature. 1991; 354: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the presence of RuvAB (lanes k–p), however, we found that the intensity of cleavage products was slightly, although reproducibly, greater at lower concentrations (20–80 nm RuvC) than was seen in their absence, and little variation in activity was observed throughout this concentration range. Enhancement of cleavage at low RuvC concentrations presumably reflects the role that RuvAB plays in (i) targeting RuvC to the junction by assembly of a RuvABC complex, and (ii) promoting branch migration that facilitates the movement of DNA through the RuvABC complex, resulting in the passage of a consensus sequence into the active site of RuvC. In the reactions described above, the Ruv proteins were added 10 min after joint molecule formation was initiated by RecA. At this time, the amount of recombination intermediates (α-structures) is maximal, and strand transfer products (ς-structures) are hardly detectable. Despite the low amount of ς-structures at 10 min (Fig. 3,lane b), however, the location of the Holliday junction in these intermediates is expected to be a significant distance from the initiating gap since strand transfer by RecA is unidirectional and occurs at a rate of approximately 3 bp/s (46West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the experiments shown in Figs. 4, A and B, and 5, one particular site, just 270 nt from the initiating end of the linear duplex (i.e. 95 nt from the 5′-side of the gap), appeared to be cleaved very efficiently, particularly when compared with the next closest consensus sites located 421, 470, and 478 nt from the 3′-end of the linear DNA. Given the assumption noted above, this observation was unexpected since the region of DNA close to the gap would be expected to have only a low concentration of Holliday junctions. To investigate the nature of this strong cleavage product, we first determined whether it was derived from cleavage at a consensus site, since it was possible that this site might define a novel sequence with enhanced specificity for RuvC. Comparison with a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladder, however, confirmed that cleavage occurred at a known consensus sequence, 5′-TTT↓C-3′ (data not shown). Since this site was the first correctly oriented consensus sequence beyond the gap, we next determined whether the location of this site near the gap might be responsible for its enhanced reactivity. This was addressed by constructing a gDNA molecule (XmnI/ScaI pDEA-7Z; Fig. 2), derived from the same phagemid, in which the distance between the gap and the consensus site was increased, and in which there would be seven intervening consensus sites of the correct polarity. Reactions were performed as described above using this gDNA and uniquely 3′-end-labeled XmnI/SphI linear duplex pDEA-7Z DNA (Fig. 2), and the products were analyzed on both 5 and 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 6). We anticipated that if this site, or its sequence context, was responsible for its apparently heightened reactivity, the intensity of this cleavage product (now having a length of 624 nt) would remain greater than that of nearby consensus sites. However, we now found that the intensity of this band (Fig. 6, circled) was no greater than that of other nearby cleavage products (Fig. 6, lanes eand f). Instead, we observed that bands of 134 and 167 nt (15 and 48 nt, respectively, from the end of the gap) were now enhanced. These results show that proximity to th"
https://openalex.org/W2313875470,"A growing body of literature suggests that the ubiquitously expressed Src family kinases (Src, Fyn and Yes) are required for agents such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to stimulate DNA synthesis. Yet Klinghoffer and colleagues recently presented evidence that fibroblasts derived from mice null for Src, Fyn and Yes responded normally to PDGF (Klinghoffer et al., 1999, EMBO J., 18: 2459 - 2471). What is the reason for this discrepancy? We noted that Klinghoffer et al. (1999) used SV40 large T antigen (largeT) to facilitate derivation of cell lines from the embryos. We therefore tested the effect of largeT on PDGF receptor signaling. We found that expression of largeT overcame the inhibitory effects of interfering forms of both Ras (N17Ras) and Src (SrcK-). Furthermore, injection of SrcK- or the cst.1 antibody (which inhibits Src, Fyn and Yes) failed to inhibit PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in NIH3T3 cells expressing dominant negative p53, and fibroblasts derived from p53 null embryos. These data suggest firstly that caution should be used in interpretation of experiments conducted in cell lines expressing largeT, and secondly that the role of Src family kinases in growth factor signaling may be to oppose the effects of negative growth regulators such as p53.

https://openalex.org/W1971402558,"We report here the identification of human homologues to the essential Escherichia coli Orn protein and the related yeast mitochondrial DNA-escape pathway regulatory factor Ynt20. The human proteins appear to arise from alternatively spliced transcripts, and are thus identical, except the human Ynt20 equivalent contains an NH2-terminal extension that possesses a predicted mitochondrial protease cleavage signal. In vitro analysis revealed that the smaller human protein exhibits a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity for small (primarily ≤5 nucleotides in length) single-stranded RNA and DNA oligomers. We have named this human protein Sfn for smallfragment nuclease to reflect its broad substrate range, and have termed the longer protein hSfnα. Sfn prefers Mn2+ as a metal cofactor and displays a temperature-resistant (to 50 °C) nuclease activity. Kinetic analysis indicates that Sfn exhibits a similar affinity for small RNAs and DNAs (K m of ∼1.5 μm), but degrades small RNAs ∼4-fold more efficiently than DNA. Mutation of a conserved aspartate (Asp136) to alanine abolishes both nuclease activities of Sfn. Northern blot analysis revealed that a 1-kilobase transcript corresponding to SFN and/or SFNα (these mRNAs differ by only two nucleotides) is expressed at varying levels in all fetal and adult human tissues examined. Expressed tag sequence clone analysis found that the two splice variants,SFN to SFNα, are present at a ratio of roughly 4 to 1, respectively. The results presented within suggest a role for human Sfn in cellular nucleotide recycling.

The results presented within suggest a role for human Sfn in cellular nucleotide recycling. nucleotide(s) expressed sequence tag polymerase chain reaction Nucleases are critical components of DNA and RNA metabolism, carrying out functions in DNA repair, replication and recombination, and RNA processing and degradation. Several candidate nucleases were recently classified as members of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily (1Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This superfamily includes RNases (such as RNase T and D), the proofreading domains of pol I family DNA polymerases, and DNases that exist as independent proteins (such as Escherichia coliExo1) or as domains within larger polypeptides (such as a region within the Werner's syndrome helicase) (1Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 2Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3Koonin E.V. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2521-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Homology within the superfamily is centered around three conserved exonuclease motifs (Exo I, II, and III) (2Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I and complementing site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the Exo I, II, and III motifs are clustered around the active site and contain four conserved negatively charged residues that are critical for coordinating the two metal ions involved in phosphodiester bond cleavage (reviewed in Ref. 4Joyce C. Steitz T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Based on conservation of the Exo motifs, the protein encoded by theE. coli open reading frame YjeR was placed into the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily (5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein was subsequently shown in vitro to be an exonuclease specific for RNA molecules shorter than about 5 nucleotides (nt)1 in length (6Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this ribonuclease activity, YjeR was renamed Ornfor oligoribonuclease (6Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data base mining revealed a human EST homolog to YjeR, indicating an evolutionary conserved role for the encoded protein (5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Orn is one of eight distinct 3′ to 5′ exoribonucleases present inE. coli (7Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a processive enzyme that initiates attack at a free 3′ hydroxyl group on single-stranded RNA, releasing 5′-mononucleotides in a sequential manner (6Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, unlike previously characterized E. coli ribonucleases,ORN is an essential gene. Experiments using a temperature-sensitive ORN construct and pulse-chase experiments with radiolabeled RNA revealed an accumulation of small RNA oligonucleotides at the non-permissive temperature (8Ghosh S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These observations suggested a role for Orn in the final steps of mRNA degradation, since mRNA-degrading enzymes such as RNase II and polynucleotide phosphorylase generate small oligonucleotide fragments that require further processing to mononucleotides (8Ghosh S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). An ORN homologue is also present in yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This YNT20 gene encodes a larger protein that has been shown to localize to the mitochondria (9Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). YNT20 plays a role in a S. cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA escape pathway, a process that involves the transfer of genetic material from the mitochondria to the nucleus (9Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was suggested, based on sequence comparisons, that the S. cerevisiae Ynt20 protein is potentially capable of hydrolyzing both DNA and RNA (9Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that the E. coli Orn protein exhibits no detectable DNase activity on double stranded T7 chromosomal DNA (10Niyogi S.K. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7307-7312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its ability to degrade short deoxyribonucleotides apparently has not been examined. We set out to examine the substrate specificity of the human Orn equivalent, with a particular interest in its activity for DNA molecules, and demonstrate here that this protein cleaves not only short RNAs but also short DNAs in a 3′ to 5′ direction. Thus, we suggest that the human enzyme be named Sfn for small fragmentnuclease. We discuss our results as they may relate to the cellular role of this protein in nucleic acid metabolism. The EST data base was searched using the TBLASTN program to identify human cDNA clones that encode a protein homologous to the E. coli Orn protein (GenBank accession number P39287). IMAGE clone 663460 was chosen, sequenced (11Wilson III, D.M. Carney J.P. Coleman M.A. Adamson A.W. Christensen M. Lamerdin J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and found to contain an open reading frame encoding a 205-amino acid protein. This protein is identical to CGI-114 protein (accession number is AF151872). The SFNα cDNA was found in the GenBank data base (accession number AL110239). The sequence at the 5′ end (accession number AA224296) or the 3′ end (accession number AA224194) of the SFN gene, when compared with the “Sequenced Tagged Site” data base at National Cancer Biology Institute, identified STS-H98169 as the genetic locus ofSFN. This sequence-tagged site is positioned at chromosome 11 in a region between markers D11S1347 and D11S939 (110.3–117.9 centimorgan), which corresponds to the region 11q23.1–11q23.2. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Spectrophotometric grade glycerol was obtained from Fisher. Olio(dT)4–22 Ladder was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and consists of single-stranded DNA oligos from 4 to 22 nt in length, increasing by 1-nucleotide increments. DNA oligos were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies (Alameda, CA). Synthetic RNA was obtained from Dharmacon Research (Boulder, CO). L buffer (Lysis buffer) contains 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. W5 buffer is 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. W40 is 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 40 mmimidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. E250 buffer is 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All pH values were determined at 21 °C. TheSFN coding region was PCR amplified using primers NCO5′HYJER (5′-GCATGCCTGGCGGCAGGGGAGAGCAT) and HIND3′YJER (3′-GCAGTAAGCTTACTCACGGTCTTCTCAT), and subcloned after digestion into the NcoI and HindIII sites of pET28d (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate phyjeR-His. This construct allows for expression of six histidine residues on the carboxyl terminus under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. phyjeR-His plasmid was sequenced and no PCR errors were found. The phyjeR-His plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS E. coli strain (Novagen). An overnight culture of 100 ml was grown at 37 °C in LB (1% bactotryptone, 0.5% bactoyeast extract, and 1% NaCl) with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of the same medium. This culture was grown at 37 °C with vigorous aeration until theA 550 nm was 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 1 mm) was then added to induce Sfn-His protein expression. At 4 h after induction, cells were harvested. The cell paste was resuspended in 30 ml of L buffer. The cell suspension was sonicated using a Misonix XL sonicator by three 1-min bursts with a microtip at the maximum setting. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, polyethyleneimine was added slowly with constant stirring to a final concentration of 0.25% to remove nucleic acids (12Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was loaded at 1.5 ml/min onto a 2-ml S2 cation exchange column equilibrated with L buffer using the BioLogic Workstation FPLC system (Bio-Rad). Fractionation over the cation exchange column removed the contaminating proteins found to bind nonspecifically to the subsequent Ni affinity column. The S2 flow-through was collected, and NaCl and imidazole were added to final concentrations of 500 and 5 mm, respectively. The S2 flow-through was then incubated with 2 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. This suspension was centrifuged, and the resin was washed 2 times each with 20 ml of W5 buffer, followed by 4 washes each with 10 ml of W40 buffer. Sfn-His proteins were then eluted from the Ni-NTA resin 4 times, each with 2 ml of E250 buffer, dialyzed overnight against L buffer containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and stored at −70 °C. Concentrations of protein solutions were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient E 280 nm of 25,940m−1 cm−1 calculated for Sfn-His (13Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). Sfn-His protein was separated on a 7.8 × 300-mm BioSil SEC 125–5 gel filtration column from Bio-Rad. The running buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min. Size markers used for calibration were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa). Proteins were detected by ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm. Mutagenesis was performed using the overlapped PCR method as described (14Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The site-specific mutant oligo used was D136A, 5′-TATAGAATAATTGCTGTGAGCACTGTTAAG-3′, with the mutated codon underlined. We chose to mutate Asp136 because a structurally equivalent mutation in E. coli DNA pol I (D501A) caused a 13,000-fold decrease in 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (15Derbyshire V. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The final SFN mutant PCR product was digested withNcoI and HindIII and subcloned into the same restriction sites of pET28d. This construct was sequenced as described (11Wilson III, D.M. Carney J.P. Coleman M.A. Adamson A.W. Christensen M. Lamerdin J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3762-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Various DNA and RNA substrates were labeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA5 is 5′-GAUCG-3′. DNA5 is 5′-GATCG-3′. DNA8 is 5′-CACGAGCC-3′. 100 fmol of nucleic acid substrate was incubated with 100–2000 fmol of Sfn-His protein at 37 °C in 10 μl of 50 mm HEPES-KDH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MnCl2 (unless otherwise noted), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. The reactions were stopped with 10 μl of 80% formamide dye solution, heated at 80 °C for 3 min, and then fractionated on a 20 or a 22.5% 8 m urea polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to x-ray film. Visualization of the labeled substrate on the gels was also achieved using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) STORM 860 Phosphorimager and quantitative analysis was performed using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant v1.11 software. Nuclease assays were performed under standard buffer conditions as described above at 37 °C, with Sfn at a final concentration of 10 nm. The reaction was incubated for 5 min with RNA5 or 40 min with DNA5, and was within the linear range of enzymatic activity (i.e. ≤15% of the substrate was converted to product). The substrate concentration range was 0.1–3.2 μm. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) and maximal velocity (V max) were obtained from a double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot. A linear plot of 1/[S] versus1/V (where [S] is the substrate concentration in μm and V is the velocity in μmmin−1 units) produces a slope ofK m /V max and a yintercept of 1/V max. k catwas calculated from the equation (k cat)(E t ) =V max, where E t is the total concentration of enzyme in the assay. Linear regression analysis was performed using CricketGraph software (Cricket Software, Philadelphia, PA). Northern blots were prehybridized for 3 h at 65 °C in ExpressHyb Solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA probe (SFN PCR product described above) was labeled using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized in ExpressHyb Solution at 65 °C for 2–3 h. Blots were washed once at room temperature for 30 min and twice at 50 °C for 30 min with 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. Images were exposed on Kodak Bio-Max MS film for 16 h and developed. Blots were normalized with β-actin transcripts. A cDNA containing the SFN coding region was obtained from the EST data base (see “Experimental Procedures”). By blasting the sequence of the 5′ end (accession number AA224296) or the 3′ end (accession number AA224194) of theSFN cDNA against the NCBI UniGene data base, we found that the human SFN gene mapped to chromosome 11 at position 11q23.1–11q23.2. Four additional genes also map within this vicinity: apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), human serotonin receptor 3 (HTR3), human nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), and zinc finger protein ZNF259 (PLZF). The SFN cDNA codes for a 205-amino acid protein of 23,754 daltons, with a theoretical pI of 5.6. SFN belongs to the YjeR/ORN family, which is a distinct subgroup of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily (1Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the Sfn-like proteins from bacteria, yeast, plant, worm, mouse, and human. The human Sfn protein is ∼50% identical to itsE. coli counterpart, the Orn protein (5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sfn and E. coli Orn possess the three characteristic sequence motifs, termed Exo I, II, and III (2Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily (1Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Four conserved negatively charged residues within these three Exo motifs (shown in Fig. 1 A) are involved in positioning of the two divalent cations required for catalysis and phosphodiester bond cleavage (reviewed in Ref. 4Joyce C. Steitz T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Upon further examination of the GenBank data base, an identical protein to hSfn, but with an extended NH2-terminal domain, was identified (Fig. 1 A). This protein, which we propose to call Sfnα, appears to be the human equivalent to the yeast Ynt20 protein and to have arisen from an alternative RNA splicing event where two additional nucleotides were introduced (Fig. 1 B). Using the PSORT II computer search program, a putative consensus cleavage site motif for mitochondrial processing proteases (ARGVR) (17Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) was identified within the unique NH2-terminal portion of Sfnα. Both Sfn and Sfnα contain a consensus nuclear localization signal (KKRK) (18Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). It seems logical that Sfn would be targeted to the nucleus and that Sfnα would translocate predominantly to the mitochondria. Northern blotting revealed that the SFN cDNA probe detects a single transcript of ∼1 kilobase in all fetal and adult tissues examined (Fig. 2). Comparatively, relatively low mRNA levels are observed in adult lymph nodes, brain, lung, liver, spleen, and thymus, with highest levels observed in heart. Since the human SFN and SFNα cDNAs appear to differ by only two nucleotides, it was not possible to distinguish the two transcripts here. Of the 10 human ESTs found in the data base, 8 contained a sequence identical to the SFNcDNA and two maintained a sequence identical to SFNα. We have characterized here Sfn, and expect that Sfnα will exhibit similar substrate specificity as it maintains the same core nuclease domain (Fig. 1 A). The SFN gene was subcloned into the pET28d plasmid to produce a COOH-terminal-tagged Sfn-His fusion protein, and the recombinant protein was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From 1 liter of induced bacterial culture (about 5 g of wet cell pellet), we obtained ∼4 mg of Sfn-His fusion protein of >95% purity (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, the Sfn-His fusion protein migrates as a single symmetrical peak on an analytical gel filtration column that corresponds to a globular protein with a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa. Since the calculated molecular weight of Sfn is 24,000, Sfn-His fusion protein appears to migrate as a tetramer. However, since the elution position on a gel filtration column is dependent on size and shape of the protein, it is possible that the Sfn-His fusion protein exists in solution as a rod-shaped protein of lower oligomeric state, since rod-shaped proteins are known to migrate slower than expected for their molecular weight. 2Dr. R.

Unlike the human Sfn-His protein, the E. coli Orn protein was reported to be a dimer based on its gel filtration chromatographic profile, although it should be noted that the experimental conditions differed slightly from those used here (6Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Short fragments of ≤5 ribonucleotides were shown to be the optimal substrate for E. coli Orn protein (6Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Niyogi S.K. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7307-7312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a 5-nucleotide RNA (RNA5), labeled at the 5′ end, as the substrate, we determined the divalent metal cation preference of the human Sfn. At metal concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mm, only Mg2+ and Mn2+ had any stimulatory effect on Sfn-His exonuclease activity, with Mg2+ being ∼10-fold less effective than Mn2+ at 10 mm (Fig.4 A and data not shown). Both human Sfn-His and E. coli Orn enzymatic activities have a strong dependence on (and a preference for) Mn2+ (Fig.4 A; Ref. 10Niyogi S.K. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7307-7312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNase activity of Sfn-His also has a temperature optimum around 50 °C (Fig. 4 B), similar to that of E. coli Orn protein (10Niyogi S.K. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7307-7312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus both proteins are quite thermostable. The RNA-specific degradation activity of Sfn at 37 °C is ∼2-fold less than that at 50 °C (Fig. 4 B). Since we observed degraded 4-mer products prior to detecting mononucleotide products (Fig. 4 C), Sfn-His appears, as expected, to be a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease. To determine whether short single-stranded DNA can serve as substrate for Sfn-His, we used a single-stranded oligo(dT) ladder from 4 to 22 bases in length, and single-stranded DNA oligos of 5 and 8 nt. As shown in Fig. 5, Sfn-His is capable of degrading short single-stranded DNA, although with less efficiency than 5-mer RNAs. Furthermore, its DNase activity is inversely related to the length of the DNA oligo, as seen for the RNase activity of E. coli Orn (19Datta A.K. Niyogi S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7313-7319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data above is also consistent with the lack of DNase activity reported for Orn on double stranded T7 chromosomal (large) DNA (10Niyogi S.K. Datta A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7307-7312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed DNase and RNase activities are intrinsic to the Sfn-His protein, a catalytically inactive Sfn-His mutant was constructed. Amino acid residue Asp136 (Fig. 1, in Exo III motif) was selected because an aspartate to alanine mutation at the structurally equivalent residue (5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in E. coli DNA pol I causes a 13,000-fold decrease in 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity (14Erzberger J.P. Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The D136A Sfn-His mutant was purified using the same procedure as described for wild type Sfn-His protein (Fig.6 A). When compared with wild type Sfn-His, D136A Sfn-His mutant displayed a ≥50-fold reduced exonuclease activity for both RNA5 and DNA5 substrates (Fig.6 B). These data are consistent with both nuclease activities being intrinsic to the Sfn-His protein, and not being the result of protein contaminants. The results also demonstrate the importance of this acidic residue in the enzymatic function of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease family members (1Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We subsequently examined Sfn nuclease activity on DNA structures known to be products/substrates of DNA repair processes. As might be expected from the results above, in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+, we did not detect any protein-dependent degradation of 42-base pair double-stranded DNAs of different configurations, including gapped, nicked, 4-nucleotide recessed or overhanged 3′ ends, or flap structures (data not shown; substrates described in Ref. 20Lee B.I. Wilson III, D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37763-37769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To determine the reason(s) for the different nuclease efficiencies of Sfn-His, we determined the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ), maximal velocity (V max), and the apparent rate of catalysis (k cat) for comparable RNA and DNA substrates (Fig. 7). The K m of RNA5 (K m = 1.56 μm) is essentially identical to that of DNA5 (K m = 1.51 μm). In contrast, the V max andk cat values were ∼4-fold higher for RNA5 (V max = 0.015 μmmin−1, k cat = 1.5 min−1) than for DNA5 (V max = 0.004 μm min−1, k cat = 0.39 min−1). Our K m value for RNA5 is consistent with the micromolar range reported for E. coliOrn on p(A)5 single-stranded RNA substrates (19Datta A.K. Niyogi S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7313-7319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human SFN gene belongs to theYjeR/ORN subfamily of the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily previously described (1Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the members of this superfamily, most notably the Werner syndrome gene product and the polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome 100-kDa autoantigen (PM-Scl 100), are associated with human disease (21Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 22Bluthner M. Bautz F.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While a connection ofSFN to a specific human disease is not obvious, the ubiquitous expression of its transcript may suggest a general and essential role for the encoded protein in mammalian cells. Notably, the human SFN gene maps to chromosome position 11q23.1–11q23.2, a region that undergoes translocation events in several leukemias (23Ziemin, L., van der Poel, S., McCabe, N. R., Gill, H. J., Espinosa, R., III, Patel, Y., Harden, A., Rubinelli, P., Smith, S. D., Le Beau, M. M., Rowley, J. D., and Diaz, M. O.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.88,10735–10739Google Scholar,24Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.-Y. Waxman S. Zelent A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), although none of these translocation breakpoints have been finely mapped to SFN. The unique NH2 terminus of hSfnα contains a consensus cleavage site pattern for mitochondrial processing proteases (17Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas both Sfnα and Sfn possess a nuclear targeting signal in their COOH-terminal domains. This observation suggests that an alternative splicing event has evolved to give rise to a mitochondrial (Sfnα) and a nuclear (Sfn) version of the Ynt20/Orn equivalents in human. However, at present, the genomic DNA sequence of the entire hSFN gene is not available, and thus the alternatively spliced products cannot be confirmed. Notably, in the mouse EST data base, there are also multiple transcripts, suggesting that alternatively spliced murineSFN transcripts exist as well. Future studies will need to address whether there is tissue-specific expression of the mRNA splice variants found in mammals. Interestingly, while S. cerevisiae maintains a homologue to hSFNα (calledYNT20 or REX2), we were unable to find a homologue to SFN in the NCBI data base using the Blastp search program. A knockout of the E. coli SFN homologue, theORN gene, results in cellular lethality (7Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An E. coli temperature-sensitive mutant is not only lethal at the nonpermissive temperature (i.e. where Orn is inactive), but accumulates small oligoribonucleotides, indicating that Orn maintains an essential activity to degrade RNA (8Ghosh S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Three possibilities were provided as to why ORN deletion mutants are inviable (8Ghosh S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar): 1) accumulation of oligoribonucleotides results in a depletion of cellular mononucleotides; 2) accumulated oligoribonucleotides inhibit certain enzymes and interfere with essential metabolic processes; or 3) Orn has an additional unknown function that is responsible for the growth cessation. Since Sfn is capable of degrading both RNA and DNA, we propose that the human protein operates to remove not only short RNAs (likely resulting from RNA degradation processes) (25Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 78-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), but also short single-stranded DNAs that might arise as products of DNA repair and recombination. Thus, by extension (8Ghosh S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4372-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Sfn would function globally to recycle nucleotides or to remove nucleic acids that may interfere with essential cellular processes. How the nuclease activities of the Orn/Ynt20 proteins would function in mitochondrial DNA escape, a process that involves translocation of mitochondrial DNA to the nucleus (9Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is possibly linked to cellular aging or senescence (27Shafer K.S. Hanckamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is presently unclear. Furthermore, although unlikely, whether the NH2-terminal differences between these proteins affect substrate specificity will need to be determined. Not surprisingly, Sfn-His, which shares ∼50% identity in amino acid sequence to its bacterial counterpart, has very similar biochemical properties to Orn (5Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R604-R606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, both proteins degrade short RNAs in a 3′ to 5′ direction, prefer Mn2+ as its metal cofactor, and have an enzymatic activity temperature optimum of ∼50 °C. However, gel filtration chromatography suggests that the human Sfn-His fusion protein is a tetramer, in contrast to E. coli Orn, which exists as a homodimer (6Zhang X. Zhu L. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins may maintain differing activities as well. The nuclease activities of both Sfn and Orn (19Datta A.K. Niyogi S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7313-7319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are inversely proportional to the length of the single-stranded substrate. Furthermore, previous kinetic data of E. coli Orn has shown that the K m values for short and long single-stranded RNAs are similar (19Datta A.K. Niyogi S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7313-7319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that Sfn has a similar K m for short single-stranded RNAs and DNAs, but that such short RNAs are degraded ∼4-fold more efficiently than DNAs. Such experimental observations raise questions of how the substrate length or the nucleic acid chemistry influences Sfn/Orn enzymatic activity. To answer these questions will require determining which step(s) is influenced by nucleotide length or nucleic acid composition. High resolution structural data of Sfn, alone and in complex with RNA and DNA, would also shed light on the recognition and catalytic mechanisms of these proteins. Lastly, our studies emphasize that future experiments should pay particular attention to the potential range of substrate diversity recognized by the other 3′ to 5′ exonuclease superfamily members."
https://openalex.org/W2154975675,"Intersectin is a member of a growing family of adaptor proteins that possess conserved Eps15 homology (EH) domains as well as additional protein recognition motifs. In general, EH domain-containing proteins play an integral role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Indeed, intersectin functions in the intermediate stages of clathrin-coated vesicle assembly. However, recent evidence suggests that components of the endocytic machinery also regulate mitogenic signaling pathways. In this report, we provide several lines of evidence that intersectin has the capacity to activate mitogenic signaling pathways. First, intersectin overexpression activated the Elk-1 transcription factor in an MAPK-independent manner. This ability resides within the EH domains, as expression of the tandem EH domains was sufficient to activate Elk-1. Second, intersectin cooperated with epidermal growth factor to potentiate Elk-1 activation; however, a similar level of Elk-1 activation was obtained by expression of the tandem EH domains suggesting that the coiled-coil region and SH3 domains act to regulate the EH domains. Third, intersectin expression was sufficient to induce oncogenic transformation of rodent fibroblasts. And finally, intersectin cooperated with progesterone to accelerate maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. Together, these data suggest that intersectin links endocytosis with regulation of pathways important for cell growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2088380653,"The c-myb proto-oncogene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in normal hematopoiesis. It is a short-lived transcription factor rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome. Although it has been shown that instability determinants reside in its carboxyl terminus, the molecular mechanism of c-Myb degradation is unknown. Here, we report the first evidence that phosphorylation plays a role in targeting the protein to the proteasome. Inhibition of cellular serine/threonine protein phosphatase activity by okadaic acid resulted in hyperphosphorylation of c-Myb and extremely rapid turnover. The hyperphosphorylation resulted in a protein with altered properties that was indicative of conformational changes. Its mobility on gel electrophoresis was altered as well as its recognition by specific monoclonal antibody. The altered hyperphosphorylated protein still bound to DNA with an affinity similar to that of the hypophosphorylated form. Phosphorylation of three previously identified sites, serines 11, 12, and 528, does not appear to be involved in the proposed changes in conformation or stability. However, phosphoamino acid analyses of the hyperphosphorylated form of c-Myb revealed increased c-Myb phosphorylation mainly on threonine residues that correlated with other okadaic acid-induced alterations of c-Myb. These findings indicate that Ser/Thr phosphatases prevent conformational changes that may play an important role in controlled degradation of c-Myb."
https://openalex.org/W2321348439,"The effects of the 5'-truncated Rgr oncogene, a previously shown specific guanine exchange factor for Ral in vitro, in stimulating proliferation, cell transformation and gene expression were investigated. We have established TetRgr cell lines in which expression of Rgr can be inhibited by the presence of tetracycline in the medium. Using this system, we show that Rgr overexpressing cells are morphologically transformed and grow in a disorganized manner. At the transcriptional level, Rgr enhances the activity of the serum response element and c-Jun. Rgr induces phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 and JNK kinases, and increases the levels of the GTP-bound forms of Ral and Ras. Ras activation could account for the broad spectra of effects displayed by Rgr. The important role of these pathways is confirmed by experiments in which the transcriptional activation events can be blocked by dominant negative versions of Ras, Ral and Rho. Among all the Rgr-induced pathways, the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is essential for the transforming properties of Rgr. Additional analysis has shown that the activation of this pathway by Rgr is not due to a feed back mechanism mediated by the Grb2 adaptor protein. Oncogene (2000)."

This study examines replicase components for their ability to be switched between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. These two cell types diverged over 1 billion years ago, and their sequences have diverged widely. Yet the Escherichia coli β clamp binds directly to Staphylococcus aureus PolC and makes it highly processive, confirming and extending earlier results (Low, R. L., Rashbaum, S. A., and Cozzarelli, N.

At the heart of this process lies the replicative DNA polymerase machinery. The chromosomal replicase ofEscherichia coli is a large particle, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, which consists of 10 different proteins in stoichiometries that range from one to four (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 165-181Google Scholar, 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The five subunits that comprise γ complex (γδδ′χψ) act as a clamp loader to open and close the β ring around DNA in an ATP-driven reaction (11O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

The main bacterial system for study of cellular DNA replication is the Gram-negative E. coli. However, there is a great deal of diversity in the eubacterial kingdom. Perusal of bacterial genome data bases reveals homologs to the E. coli β clamp, α subunit of core polymerase, and at least two (γ and δ′) of the five subunits of γ complex, suggesting that the overall strategy of using a clamp and clamp loader generalizes among this diverse group of organisms (eukaryotes also use a clamp loader replication factor C) and clamp (proliferating cell nuclear antigen)) (13Tsurimoto T.

The evolutionary split between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria occurred over 1 billion years ago, and the sequences of the replicative polymerase and β clamp have diverged considerably. Purification of the replicative DNA polymerase, encoded by polC, from a variety of Gram-positive cells yields only a single polypeptide, in contrast to the multiprotein holoenzyme particle purified from E. coli (15Gass K.B.

The PolC polymerase, unlike E. coli α, contains an intrinsic 3′- 5′-exonuclease activity and is approximately the size of E. coli α and ε combined. Even though PolC does not purify with other associated subunits, it has been shown to be the chromosomal replicase by genetics and by studies using the antibiotic compound, hydroxyphenylaza-uracil (HPUra).1 HPUra inhibits PolCin vitro by competing with dGTP. Bacterial strains that are resistant to HPUra encode a mutant PolC that is resistant to HPUrain vitro (19Gass K.B. Low R.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Mackenzie J.M. Neville M.M. Wright G.E. Brown N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S.

The Gram-positive PolC presumably functions with the β clamp and clamp loader, but the interactions among these proteins must be weaker than in the E. coli holoenzyme because a PolC holoenzyme has not been purified. Evidence that Bacillus subtilis PolC functions with other proteins was provided by a much earlier study that demonstrated PolC stimulation by partially purified preparations ofE. coli DNA polymerase III subunits (21Low R.L. Rashbaum S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2973-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These preparations, called elongation factors I and II, likely correspond to the β clamp and γ complex clamp loader (11O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, E. coli γ complex assembled E. coli β onto DNA, whereby it bound to B. subtilis PolC and increased its processivity. Specific utilization of these replication components from such diverse bacteria is quite astounding given the low level of sequence homology between them. This report examines the cross-utilization of replicase components between E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The PolC of S. aureus (1431 amino acids) shows approximately 16% identity to the E. coli α and ε subunits (1160 and 242 amino acids, respectively). The β clamps of these two systems show approximately 27% identity. The results show that S. aureus PolC indeed binds E. coli β directly and converts S. aureus PolC into a highly processive polymerase. The report also examines the S. aureus β clamp and studies its effect on S. aureus PolC and E. coli core polymerase. As expected, S. aureus PolC is stimulated by its cognate β clamp. Although E. coli core displays a weak interaction with S. aureus β, it does not function with the S. aureus β clamp in replication assays.

M13mp18 ssDNA was purified from phage that was prepared by two consecutive bandings in cesium chloride as described (30Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assays using circular M13mp18 ssDNA were uniquely primed with a synthetic DNA 30-mer as described (23Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the linear ssDNA substrate, M13mp18 ssDNA was primed with a DNA 45-mer (5′-AGC TTG CAT GCC TGC AGG TCG ACT CTA GAG GAT CCC CGG GTA CCG-3′) followed by digestion with 2 units of XbaI/μg of DNA (XbaI site is underlined). This produces a linear ssDNA with a 22-base pair duplex at the 5′ end. Complete digestion was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis performed in the absence of ethidium bromide, which separated the linear and circular ssDNA. Linear ssDNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer). Its concentration was estimated upon comparison to known amounts of circular ssDNA in an ethidium bromide-stained native agarose gel. Genomic DNA was obtained from S. aureus strain 4220 (a gift of Dr. Pat Schlievert, University of Minnesota), which lacks a gene needed for producing toxic shock (31Kreiswirth B.N. Löfdahl S.

S. aureus cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing 0.5% glucose and collected by centrifugation (24 g, wet weight). Cells were resuspended in 80 ml of 50 mm glucose, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). SDS and NaOH then were added to 1% and 0.2 n, respectively, followed by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min to lyse the cells. 68.5 ml of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was added, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with 50 ml of 6 m urea in TE buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 ml of TE, and CsCl2 (43.46 g) was added. The preparation was poured into two 35-ml ultracentrifuge tubes, and 0.5 ml of a 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide solution was added to each tube. Tubes were spun at 55,000 × g for 18 h at 18 °C in a Sorvall TV860 rotor, and genomic DNA was extracted using a syringe and needle. Ethidium bromide was removed using two butanol extractions and then dialyzed against 4 liters of TE at pH 8.0 overnight. The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in TE buffer (1.7 mg total), and stored at −20 °C. The S. aureus polC gene (33Pacitti D.F. Barnes M.H. Li D.H. Brown N.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 165: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was amplified from genomic DNA, digested with NsiI, gel-purified, and ligated into pET11 (Novagen) that had been digested with NsiI and gel-purified. The resulting pET11polC plasmid was transformed into E. colistrain BL21(DE3). 24 liters of E. coli BL21(DE3)pET11polC were grown in LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7, and then the temperature was lowered to 15 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the culture was incubated another 18 h at 15 °C. Expression of S. aureus PolC was sufficiently high to be easily visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of whole cells. The expressed protein migrated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a position expected for a 165-kDa polypeptide. In this procedure, it is important that cells are induced at 15 °C, as induction at 37 °C produces a 130-kDa truncated version of PolC. PolC was purified essentially as described (33Pacitti D.F. Barnes M.H. Li D.H. Brown N.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 165: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (12 g, wet weight) were lysed in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, and 30 mm spermidine using a French press. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) was added, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was dialyzed for 1 h against Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmdithiothreitol) containing 50 mm NaCl to a conductivity equivalent to 190 mm NaCl. The dialysate (208 mg in 24 ml) was diluted to 50 ml using Buffer A to bring the conductivity equal to 96 mm NaCl and then was loaded onto an 8-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a 160-ml linear gradient of Buffer A from 50 mm NaCl to 500 mmNaCl; 75 fractions (1.3 ml each) were collected. The presence of PolC was followed in the column fractions using the calf thymus DNA synthesis assay, and 20 μl of each fraction was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Based on the DNA synthetic capability and the correct size band in the gel, fractions 56–65 containing PolC were pooled (31 mg in 22 ml). The pooled fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mmphosphate (pH 7.6), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol (P-cell buffer). The dialyzed pool was loaded onto a 4.5-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated in P-cell buffer and then eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient of P-cell buffer from 0 to 0.5m NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Fractions 20–36 contained the majority of the PolC at a purity of greater than 90% (5 mg). The PolC was aliquoted and stored frozen at −80 °C. The S. aureus dnaN gene (42Alonso J.C. Fisher L.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) encoding β was amplified from genomic DNA, digested with NdeI/BamHI, and ligated into theNdeI/BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagen), which places a leader onto the N terminus that includes six histidine residues (to form pETbeta). The expression clone encoding βpk was generated similarly, except that the downstream primer encoded a six-residue extension (RRASVP) that serves as a kinase recognition sequence (to form pETbetaPK). Expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli-competent SURE II cells (Stratagene). The following procedure describes how S. aureus β was purified. 24 liters of BL21(DE3)pETbeta cells were grown in LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7, and then the temperature was lowered to 15 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 2 mm, and cells were incubated another 18 h at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (44 g, wet weight) and stored at −70 °C. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells (44 g, wet weight) were thawed and resuspended in 45 ml of 1× binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (final pH 7.5)) using a Dounce homogenizer. Cells were lysed in a French press at 20,000 p.s.i., and then 4.5 ml of 10% polyamine P (Sigma) was added. Cell debris and DNA were removed by centrifugation; over 50% of the β was in the soluble fraction. The supernatant (890 mg of protein) was applied to a 10-ml HiTrap chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer and then eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 60 mm to 1 m imidazole in binding buffer. Fractions of 1.35 ml were collected and analyzed for the presence of β in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Fractions 28–52, containing most of the β subunit, were pooled (82 mg in 35 ml). The S. aureus β becomes insoluble as the ionic strength is lowered. Therefore, the pool of β was dialyzed overnight against Buffer A containing 400 mm NaCl. The dialyzed pool became slightly turbid, indicating that β was at its solubility limit at these concentrations of protein and NaCl. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and then diluted 2-fold with Buffer A to bring the conductivity equal to 256 mm NaCl. The protein (64 mg) was applied to an 8-ml Mono Q column equilibrated in Buffer A plus 250 mm NaCl and then eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of Buffer A from 0.25 to 0.75m NaCl. Fractions of 1.25 ml were collected. The β eluted in fractions 1–18 (24 mg) and then was aliquoted and stored frozen at −80 °C. Assays contained 2.5 μg of activated calf thymus DNA in a final volume of 25 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml BSA, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm ATP, 3 mm each dCTP, dGTP, dATP, and 20 μm [α-32P]dTTP. An aliquot of the fraction to be assayed was added to the assay mixture on ice followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. DNA synthesis was quantitated using DE81 paper as described (34Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase protection assays were performed in 30-μl reactions containing 45 pmol of βPKdimer (S. aureus βPK or E. coliβPK) in the presence of either 225 pmol of S. aureus PolC, 180 pmol of E. coli core, and 9.5 μg of BSA or 37 μg of BSA in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2. Reactions were preincubated at 15 °C for 15 min. 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP then was added, and reactions were shifted to 37 °C for 1 min. Phosphorylation was initiated upon addition of 0.0015 unit of recombinant catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (gift of Dr. Susan Taylor, University of California, San Diego). Aliquots (5 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times (10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 s) and quenched with 20 μl of 5 mm ATP and 50 mm EDTA. Phosphorylation of βPK was analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and results were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). DNA synthesis byS. aureus PolC or E. coli core on a primed linear M13mp18 ssDNA substrate was performed in the presence of varying amounts of β and was assayed as follows. Replication reactions (25 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mmMgCl2, 40 μg/ml BSA, 60 μm each dCTP, dGTP, and dATP, 20 μm TTP, 1.25 μCi of [α-32P]TTP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 28.5 fmol of linear M13mp18 ssDNA, 0.8 μg of SSB, and the following proteins: 15 ng (93 fmol) of S. aureus PolC (or 45 ng (271 fmol) of E. coli core) and increasing amounts of eitherS. aureus or E. coli β (0 ng, 10 ng, 30 ng, 100 ng, 300 ng, 1 μg, 3 μg, and 10 μg). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and quenched upon addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS and 40 mm EDTA. For the time course analysis, reaction conditions were as described above with the following exceptions:S. aureus PolC was varied from 1.5 to 150 ng (see Fig. 6), and the amount of S. aureus β was 6 μg/25-μl reaction. The reactions were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence of 60 μm each of dCTP and dGTP (and the absence of dATP and TTP). DNA synthesis was initiated upon addition of 60 μm dATP, 20 μm TTP and 1.25 μCi of [α-32P]TTP. At the indicated times (8, 11, 15, 30, and 60 s) reactions were quenched upon addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS and 40 mm EDTA. Samples (20 μl) were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 0.8% neutral agarose gel. Gels were dried, and radioactive products were visualized following exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. Reactions were performed in 25 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml BSA, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, and 60 μm each dCTP and dGTP containing 28.5 fmol of circular M13mp18 ssDNA, 0.8 μg of SSB, 0.5 mm ATP, S. aureus PolC (15 ng (93 fmol), 45 ng (278 fmol), 300 ng (1.8 pmol), 1 μg (6.2 pmol), 3 μg (18.5 pmol), or 10 μg (62 pmol)). When present, E. coli β (246 fmol as dimer) and γ complex (84 fmol) were added. Reactions were preincubated for 3 min, and synthesis was initiated upon addition of dATP (60 μm) and [α-32P]TTP (20 μm). At the times indicated in the figures (see Figs. 4and 5), reactions were quenched upon addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS, 40 mm EDTA. DNA products were analyzed in a native agarose gel, followed by analysis using a PhosphorImager.Figure 5S. aureus PolC is highly processive with E. coli β. The experiment examines the effect of S. aureus PolC concentration on the time required to form a full-length circular duplex in the presence of E. coli β·γ complex.

Reactions were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and DNA synthesis was initiated upon addition of 60 μmdATP, 20 μm TTP, and 1.25 μCi of [α-32P]TTP. After an additional incubation for 3 min at 37 °C, reactions were quenched and analyzed in a native agarose gel, followed by analysis using a PhosphorImager. The crystal structure of the E. coli β dimer shows that it is a ring-shaped structure with two distinct faces (10Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Both C termini of β extrude from one face as illustrated in the diagram in Fig.1. Earlier studies showed that both the α subunit and γ complex interact with the C-terminal face of β (35Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One assay demonstrating this interaction was a kinase protection assay in which a six-residue kinase recognition sequence was engineered onto the C terminus of β (to produce βpk) (28Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 29Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates the C termini of the recombinant βpk. However, in the presence of either core polymerase or clamp loader, phosphorylation of βpk is inhibited (35Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The result indicates that binding of the polymerase or clamp loader to β prevents efficient access of kinase to its recognition site on β. This kinase protection assay is used in Fig. 1 A to determine whether the S. aureus PolC can interact directly with E. coliβpk. The rate of phosphorylation of E. coli βpk was examined either alone or in the presence of an excess of E. coli core polymerase or S. aureus PolC. The result, in Fig. 1 A, shows that E. coli core and S. aureus PolC are approximately equal in their abilities to inhibit phosphorylation of E. coli βpk. Hence, PolC is able to bind to the E. coli β clamp. Does S. aureus β interact with E. coli core polymerase? To test this, the dnaN gene-encoding S. aureus β was engineered to encode a protein containing the six-residue kinase recognition sequence at the C terminus. The S. aureus βpk was then purified and treated with kinase in the presence or absence of either S. aureus PolC orE. coli core. The result, in Fig. 1 B, indicates that S. aureus βpk interacts with S. aureus PolC as expected for the actions of this chromosomal replicase. However, the E. coli core polymerase only slightly protects S. aureus βpk from phosphorylation (approximately 25% protection). This slight protection is reproducible (not shown), indicating that E. coli core may weakly interact with S. aureus β. However, the kinase protection assay requires relatively high concentrations of protein (i.e. μm). Hence, it is possible that this putative interaction may be too weak to stimulate E. colicore in DNA replication assays in which proteins are present in nm concentration. Next, we studied these protein-protein interactions for function in DNA replication assays. First, we examined S. aureus PolC for functional interaction with the S. aureus β clamp during DNA synthesis. The typical primed template used in the study of E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is a circular phage ssDNA genome, 5–9 kb in length, which is coated with SSB and primed with a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide. Use of a primed circular template requires a clamp loader to open and close the β ring around the primed site. However, we did not have the S. aureus clamp loader for these studies. An earlier study in the yeast replication system showed that the circular sliding clamp (yeast proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was capable of slipping over the end of a linear DNA substrate and then functionally coupling with the DNA polymerase δ in the complete absence of the clamp loader (37Burgers P.M.J. Yoder B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19923-19926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig.2 we employed a similar strategy, using a linear DNA substrate to test whether S. aureus PolC functionally couples with the S. aureus β clamp. Circular M13mp18 ssDNA was linearized using an oligonucleotide that anneals over a restriction site, leaving 22 bp of duplex DNA at one end for polymerase extension (see the diagram in Fig. 2). S. aureus β was then titrated into reactions containing the primed linear template, PolC, and [32P]dNTPs. Reactions were quenched after 5 min, and DNA products were analyzed on native agarose gels, followed by autoradiography. The results, in the firsteight lanes shown in Fig. 2, demonstrate that full-length 7.2-kb M13mp18 duplex DNA is formed at the three highest amounts of the β added to the assay, indicating that β had self-thre"
https://openalex.org/W2323629357,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an important multifunctional cytokine whose gene expression is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. Previous studies using transgenic mice as well as in vitro analyses showed that a potential regulatory element(s) exists between -260 to -230 bp in the upstream region of the HGF gene promoter. In the present study, we have discovered that this region is a composite site through which members of the nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and upstream stimulatory factor (USF) families bind to and regulate HGF gene transcription. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays revealed that USF and NF1 have high binding affinity for this region and that the binding sites of the two different transcription factor families overlap. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppresses HGF gene promoter activity and that USF has an activating function. We found that the NF1/X and NF1/Red1 isoforms strongly suppressed HGF promoter activity while the NF1/L variant had no obvious effects. USF1, but not USF2, of the USF family stimulated HGF gene promoter activity. More interestingly, during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, a process which activates the HGF gene, we noted that the binding activity of USF to the HGF promoter element increased while that of NF1 decreased. These data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern HGF gene transcription. Oncogene (2000)."
https://openalex.org/W2060112916,"Overexpression of HER-2/neu (also known as c-erbB-2) proto-oncogene frequently occurs in many different types of human cancers, including ovarian carcinoma, and is known to enhance tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. Previous studies showed that inhibition of HER-2/neu expression by various agents, such as adenovirus E1A and simian virus 40 large T, can lead to suppression of tumorigenicity of HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells. Here we report that T/t-common, which contains the N-terminal common domain of simian virus 40 large T and small t antigens, could specifically repress the HER-2/neu promoter. When the coding sequence of T/t-common was stably transfected into the HER-2/neu-overexpressing human ovarian carcinoma SK-OV-3 cells, the expression of HER-2/neu was dramatically reduced by the expression of T/t-common. Accordingly the tumorigenic potential of these T/t-common-expressing clones, including the ability to grow anchorage-independently and the ability to induce tumor in nu/nu mice, was also drastically suppressed. Furthermore, when T/t-common was transiently cotransfected with the activated genomic neu into NIH3T3 cells, the transforming activity of the latter was suppressed by T/t-common in soft-agarose microcolony formation assays. Taken together, these data suggest that T/t-common may act as a transformation suppressor of the HER-2/neu oncogene. Oncogene (2000)."
