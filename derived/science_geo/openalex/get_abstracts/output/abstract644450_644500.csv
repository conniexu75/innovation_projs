https://openalex.org/W2995389725,"Prediction of HLA epitopes is important for the development of cancer immunotherapies and vaccines. However, current prediction algorithms have limited predictive power, in part because they were not trained on high-quality epitope datasets covering a broad range of HLA alleles. To enable prediction of endogenous HLA class I-associated peptides across a large fraction of the human population, we used mass spectrometry to profile >185,000 peptides eluted from 95 HLA-A, -B, -C and -G mono-allelic cell lines. We identified canonical peptide motifs per HLA allele, unique and shared binding submotifs across alleles and distinct motifs associated with different peptide lengths. By integrating these data with transcript abundance and peptide processing, we developed HLAthena, providing allele-and-length-specific and pan-allele-pan-length prediction models for endogenous peptide presentation. These models predicted endogenous HLA class I-associated ligands with 1.5-fold improvement in positive predictive value compared with existing tools and correctly identified >75% of HLA-bound peptides that were observed experimentally in 11 patient-derived tumor cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2995711654,"Plant gene editing is typically performed by delivering reagents such as Cas9 and single guide RNAs to explants in culture. Edited cells are then induced to differentiate into whole plants by exposure to various hormones. The creation of edited plants through tissue culture is often inefficient, time-consuming, works for only limited species and genotypes, and causes unintended changes to the genome and epigenome. Here we report two methods to generate gene-edited dicotyledonous plants through de novo meristem induction. Developmental regulators and gene-editing reagents are delivered to somatic cells of whole plants. This induces meristems that produce shoots with targeted DNA modifications, and gene edits are transmitted to the next generation. The de novo induction of gene-edited meristems sidesteps the need for tissue culture and promises to overcome a bottleneck in plant gene editing."
https://openalex.org/W2995162887,"Efforts to sequence single protein molecules in nanopores1-5 have been hampered by the lack of techniques with sufficient sensitivity to discern the subtle molecular differences among all twenty amino acids. Here we report ionic current detection of all twenty proteinogenic amino acids in an aerolysin nanopore with the help of a short polycationic carrier. Application of molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the aerolysin nanopore has a built-in single-molecule trap that fully confines a polycationic carrier-bound amino acid inside the sensing region of the aerolysin. This structural feature means that each amino acid spends sufficient time in the pore for sensitive measurement of the excluded volume of the amino acid. We show that distinct current blockades in wild-type aerolysin can be used to identify 13 of the 20 natural amino acids. Furthermore, we show that chemical modifications, instrumentation advances and nanopore engineering offer a route toward identification of the remaining seven amino acids. These findings may pave the way to nanopore protein sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2994722820,"The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is widely used in the manufacture of industrial enzymes and pharmaceuticals. Like most biotechnological production hosts, P. pastoris is heterotrophic and grows on organic feedstocks that have competing uses in the production of food and animal feed. In a step toward more sustainable industrial processes, we describe the conversion of P. pastoris into an autotroph that grows on CO2. By addition of eight heterologous genes and deletion of three native genes, we engineer the peroxisomal methanol-assimilation pathway of P. pastoris into a CO2-fixation pathway resembling the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle, the predominant natural CO2-fixation pathway. The resulting strain can grow continuously with CO2 as a sole carbon source at a µmax of 0.008 h−1. The specific growth rate was further improved to 0.018 h−1 by adaptive laboratory evolution. This engineered P. pastoris strain may promote sustainability by sequestering the greenhouse gas CO2, and by avoiding consumption of an organic feedstock with alternative uses in food production. A yeast species used to produce proteins and chemicals is engineered to grow solely on the greenhouse gas CO2."
https://openalex.org/W2996509273,"Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a common source of research participants within the academic community. Despite MTurk's utility and benefits over traditional subject pools some researchers have questioned whether it is sustainable. Specifically, some have asked whether MTurk workers are too familiar with manipulations and measures common in the social sciences, the result of many researchers relying on the same small participant pool. Here, we show that concerns about non-naivete on MTurk are due less to the MTurk platform itself and more to the way researchers use the platform. Specifically, we find that there are at least 250,000 MTurk workers worldwide and that a large majority of US workers are new to the platform each year and therefore relatively inexperienced as research participants. We describe how inexperienced workers are excluded from studies, in part, because of the worker reputation qualifications researchers commonly use. Then, we propose and evaluate an alternative approach to sampling on MTurk that allows researchers to access inexperienced participants without sacrificing data quality. We recommend that in some cases researchers should limit the number of highly experienced workers allowed in their study by excluding these workers or by stratifying sample recruitment based on worker experience levels. We discuss the trade-offs of different sampling practices on MTurk and describe how the above sampling strategies can help researchers harness the vast and largely untapped potential of the Mechanical Turk participant pool."
https://openalex.org/W2994724409,"Here we describe TRACE (T7 polymerase-driven continuous editing), a method that enables continuous, targeted mutagenesis in human cells using a cytidine deaminase fused to T7 RNA polymerase. TRACE induces high rates of mutagenesis over multiple cell generations in genes under the control of a T7 promoter integrated in the genome. We used TRACE in a MEK1 inhibitor-resistance screen, and identified functionally correlated mutations. Efficient diversification of DNA sequences is enabled by a T7 RNA polymerase fused to a cytidine deaminase."
https://openalex.org/W2995342721,"Chloramphenicol (CHL) and linezolid (LZD) are antibiotics that inhibit translation. Both were thought to block peptide-bond formation between all combinations of amino acids. Yet recently, a strong nascent peptide context-dependency of CHL- and LZD-induced translation arrest was discovered. Here we probed the mechanism of action of CHL and LZD by using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy to monitor translation arrest induced by antibiotics. The presence of CHL or LZD does not substantially alter dynamics of protein synthesis until the arrest-motif of the nascent peptide is generated. Inhibition of peptide-bond formation compels the fully accommodated A-site transfer RNA to undergo repeated rounds of dissociation and nonproductive rebinding. The glycyl amino-acid moiety on the A-site Gly-tRNA manages to overcome the arrest by CHL. Our results illuminate the mechanism of CHL and LZD action through their interactions with the ribosome, the nascent peptide and the incoming amino acid, perturbing elongation dynamics. Single-molecule FRET technologies reveal the mechanism of sequence-specific translational inhibition induced by two antibiotics, chloramphenicol and linezolid, where aminoacyl-tRNA was repeatedly rejected from the A-site and failed to form a peptide bond."
https://openalex.org/W2996108815,"Rapid urbanization has led to a growing sanitation crisis in urban areas of Bangladesh and potential exposure to fecal contamination in the urban environment due to inadequate sanitation and poor fecal sludge management. Limited data are available on environmental fecal contamination associated with different exposure pathways in urban Dhaka. We conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the magnitude of fecal contamination in the environment in low-income, high-income, and transient/floating neighborhoods in urban Dhaka. Ten samples were collected from each of 10 environmental compartments in 10 different neighborhoods (4 low-income, 4 high-income and 2 transient/floating neighborhoods). These 1,000 samples were analyzed with the IDEXX-Quanti-Tray technique to determine most-probable-number (MPN) of E. coli. Samples of open drains (6.91 log10 MPN/100 mL), surface water (5.28 log10 MPN/100 mL), floodwater (4.60 log10 MPN/100 mL), produce (3.19 log10 MPN/serving), soil (2.29 log10 MPN/gram), and street food (1.79 log10 MPN/gram) had the highest mean log10 E. coli contamination compared to other samples. The contamination concentrations did not differ between low-income and high-income neighborhoods for shared latrine swabs, open drains, municipal water, produce, and street foodsamples. E. coli contamination levels were significantly higher (p <0.05) in low-income neighborhoods compared to high-income for soil (0.91 log10 MPN/gram, 95% CI, 0.39, 1.43), bathing water (0.98 log10 MPN/100 mL, 95% CI, 0.41, 1.54), non-municipal water (0.64 log10 MPN/100 mL, 95% CI, 0.24, 1.04), surface water (1.92 log10 MPN/100 mL, 95% CI, 1.44, 2.40), and floodwater (0.48 log10 MPN/100 mL, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.92) samples. E. coli contamination were significantly higher (p<0.05) in low-income neighborhoods compared to transient/floating neighborhoods for drain water, bathing water, non-municipal water and surface water. Future studies should examine behavior that brings people into contact with the environment and assess the extent of exposure to fecal contamination in the environment through multiple pathways and associated risks."
https://openalex.org/W2996654260,"High-grade gliomas (HGG) afflict both children and adults and respond poorly to current therapies. Epigenetic regulators have a role in gliomagenesis, but a broad, functional investigation of the impact and role of specific epigenetic targets has not been undertaken. Using a two-step, in vitro/in vivo epigenomic shRNA inhibition screen, we determine the chromatin remodeler BPTF to be a key regulator of adult HGG growth. We then demonstrate that BPTF knockdown decreases HGG growth in multiple pediatric HGG models as well. BPTF appears to regulate tumor growth through cell self-renewal maintenance, and BPTF knockdown leads these glial tumors toward more neuronal characteristics. BPTF's impact on growth is mediated through positive effects on expression of MYC and MYC pathway targets. HDAC inhibitors synergize with BPTF knockdown against HGG growth. BPTF inhibition is a promising strategy to combat HGG through epigenetic regulation of the MYC oncogenic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2995850528,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of the Cosmed K5 portable metabolic system dynamic mixing chamber (MC) and breath-by-breath (BxB) modes against the criterion Douglas bag (DB) method. Methods Fifteen participants (mean age±SD, 30.6±7.4 yrs) had their metabolic variables measured at rest and during cycling at 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250W. During each stage, participants were connected to the first respiratory gas collection method (randomized) for the first four minutes to reach steady state, followed by 3-min (or 5-min for DB) collection periods for the resting condition, and 2-min collection periods for all cycling intensities. Collection periods for the second and third methods were preceded by a washout of 1–3 min. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare metabolic variables measured by each method, for seated rest and each cycling work rate. Results For ventilation (VE) and oxygen uptake (VO2), the K5 MC and BxB modes were within 2.1 l/min (VE) and 0.08 l/min (VO2) of the DB (p≥0.05). Compared to DB values, carbon dioxide production (VCO2) was significantly underestimated by the K5 BxB mode at work rates ≥150W by 0.12–0.31 l/min (p<0.05). K5 MC and BxB respiratory exchange ratio values were significantly lower than DB at cycling work rates ≥100W by 0.03–0.08 (p<0.05). Conclusion Compared to the DB method, the K5 MC and BxB modes are acceptable for measuring VE and VO2 across a wide range of cycling intensities. Both K5 modes provided comparable values to each other."
https://openalex.org/W2994934187,"Systemic toxicity and tumor cell resistance still limit the efficacy of chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. Therefore, alternative treatments are desperately needed. The thiazolide Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of parasite-mediated infectious diarrhea with a favorable safety profile. Interestingly, NTZ and the thiazolide RM4819—its bromo-derivative lacking antibiotic activity—are also promising candidates for cancer treatment. Yet the exact anticancer mechanism(s) of these compounds still remains unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated RM4819 and NTZ in 2D and 3D colorectal cancer culture systems. Both compounds strongly inhibited proliferation of colon carcinoma cell lines by promoting G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Thiazolide-induced cell cycle arrest was independent of the p53/p21 axis, but was mediated by inhibition of protein translation via the mTOR/c-Myc/p27 pathway, likely caused by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. While both thiazolides demonstrated mitochondrial uncoupling activity, only RM4819 inhibited the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. Interestingly, thiazolides also potently inhibited the growth of murine colonic tumoroids in a comparable manner with cisplatin, while in contrast to cisplatin thiazolides did not affect the growth of primary intestinal organoids. Thus, thiazolides appear to have a tumor-selective antiproliferative activity, which offers new perspectives in the treatment of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2994825712,"Augmenting live cells with new signal transduction capabilities is a key objective in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. We showed earlier that two-component signaling pathways could function in mammalian cells, albeit while losing their ligand sensitivity. Here, we show how to transduce small-molecule ligands in a dose-dependent fashion into gene expression in mammalian cells using two-component signaling machinery. First, we engineer mutually complementing truncated mutants of a histidine kinase unable to dimerize and phosphorylate the response regulator. Next, we fuse these mutants to protein domains capable of ligand-induced dimerization, which restores the phosphoryl transfer in a ligand-dependent manner. Cytoplasmic ligands are transduced by facilitating mutant dimerization in the cytoplasm, while extracellular ligands trigger dimerization at the inner side of a plasma membrane. These findings point to the potential of two-component regulatory systems as enabling tools for orthogonal signaling pathways in mammalian cells. Bacterial two-component signaling machinery has been reprogrammed for orthogonal signaling in mammalian cells that is triggered by small-molecule-mediated dimerization or ligand-induced GPCR/β-arrestin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2995680778,"Dieback disease caused by Erwinia mallotivora is a major threat to papaya plantation in Malaysia. The current study was conducted to evaluate the potential of endophytic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from papaya seeds for disease suppression of papaya dieback. Two hundred and thirty isolates were screened against E. mallotivora BT-MARDI, and the inhibitory activity of the isolates against the pathogen was ranging from 11.7–23.7 mm inhibition zones. The synergistic experiments revealed that combination of W. cibaria PPKSD19 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis PPSSD39 increased antibacterial activity against the pathogen. The antibacterial activity was partially due to the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). The nursery experiment confirmed that the application of bacterial consortium W. cibaria PPKSD19 and L. lactis subsp. lactis PPSSD39 significantly reduced disease severity to 19% and increased biocontrol efficacy to 69% of infected papaya plants after 18 days of treatment. This study showed that W. cibaria PPKSD19 and L. lactis subsp. lactis PPSSD39 are potential candidate as biocontrol agents against papaya dieback disease."
https://openalex.org/W2995889497,"A critical role of influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is to antagonize the host cellular antiviral response. NS1 accomplishes this role through numerous interactions with host proteins, including the cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptor, retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I). Although the consequences of this interaction have been studied, the complete mechanism by which NS1 antagonizes RIG-I signaling remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that the NS1 RNA-binding domain (NS1 RBD ) interacts directly with the second caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I. We also identified that a single strain-specific polymorphism in the NS1 RBD (R21Q) completely abrogates this interaction. Here we investigate the functional consequences of an R21Q mutation on NS1's ability to antagonize RIG-I signaling. We observed that an influenza virus harboring the R21Q mutation in NS1 results in significant up-regulation of RIG-I signaling. In support of this, we determined that an R21Q mutation in NS1 results in a marked deficit in NS1's ability to antagonize TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs, a critical step in RIG-I activation. We also observed that WT NS1 is capable of binding directly to the tandem RIG-I CARDs, whereas the R21Q mutation in NS1 significantly inhibits this interaction. Furthermore, we determined that the R21Q mutation does not impede the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 or NS1 RBD 's ability to bind RNA. The data presented here offer significant insights into NS1 antagonism of RIG-I and illustrate the importance of understanding the role of strain-specific polymorphisms in the context of this specific NS1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2995329400,"Aim/Background The prevalence of elderly pregnancy and maternal obesity is increasing worldwide. In old and obese women, metabolic derangement affecting fetal growth might be present earlier than the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or even before pregnancy. We thus investigated whether GDM diagnosed at 24–28 weeks of gestation had already affected fetal abdominal growth and, if so, whether elderly pregnancy and/or maternal obesity aggravate fetal abdominal obesity. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 7820 singleton pregnant women who had been universally screened using a 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24–28 weeks of gestation, and underwent a 3-h 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if GCT were ≥140mg/dl. GDM and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were diagnosed using the Carpenter-Coustan criteria. Fetal abdominal obesity was investigated by assessing the fetal abdominal overgrowth ratios (FAORs) of the ultrasonographically estimated gestational age (GA) of abdominal circumference per actual GA by the last menstruation period, biparietal diameter or femur length, respectively. Fetal abdominal overgrowth was defined as FAOR ≥ 90th percentile. The subjects were divided into four study groups: group 1 (age < 35 years and pre-pregnancy body mass index [BMI] < 25 kg/m2), group 2 (age < 35 years and ≥ 25), group 3 (age ≥ 35 years and BMI < 25), and group 4 (age ≥ 35 years and ≥ 25). Results The overall prevalence of GDM was 5.1%, with old and obese group 4 exhibiting the highest prevalence (22.4%). FAORs were significantly higher in the fetus of those with GDM than in the NGT subjects. But, in the subgroup analysis, only old and nonobese group 3 and old and obese group 4 with GDM exhibited significantly higher FAORs than the NGT subjects. Also, risk of fetal abdominal overgrowth was increased in group 3 and 4 subjects with GDM but not in young and nonobese group 1 GDM. The risk of fetal abdominal overgrowth significantly increased with maternal age >35 years, pre-pregnancy BMI >20kg/m2, and HbA1c >37.7 mmol/mol (5.6%). In multivariate analyses, maternal age and HbA1c were significantly associated with FAORs. Conclusion GDM diagnosed at 24–28 weeks of gestation already affected fetal abdominal obesity in older and/or obese women, but not in younger and nonobese women. Our data suggest that selective screening and appropriate intervention of GDM earlier than 24–28 weeks of gestation might be necessary for high-risk old and/or obese women."
https://openalex.org/W2995397576,"Seed arrival is a limiting factor for the regeneration of diverse tropical forests and may be an important mechanism that drives patterns of tree species’ distribution. Here we quantify spatial and seasonal variation in seed rain of secondary forests in southern Bahia, Brazil. We also examine whether secondary forest age enhances seed dispersal and whether seed rain density and diversity in secondary forests decay with distance from mature forest. Across a chronosequence of 15 pairs of mature and secondary forests, 105 seed traps were installed and monitored for one year. We tested the effects of secondary forest age, distance from mature forest, and seasonality on monthly seed rain density, diversity, seed dispersal mode, and diaspore size. We found that secondary forest age had strong, positive effects on the diversity of seed rain, which was generally higher during the wet season. Moreover, contrasting patterns among diversity indices revealed that seeds of rare species occurred more often in 40 yr old secondary forests and mature forests. While the proportion of biotically and abiotically dispersed seeds did not change significantly with distance from mature forest across all forest age classes, we found that biotically dispersed seeds contributed disproportionately more to seed rain diversity. Our results emphasize the importance of biotic dispersal to enhance diversity during secondary succession and suggest that changes in secondary forest structure have the potential to enhance the diversity of tropical secondary forests, principally by increasing dispersal of rare species."
https://openalex.org/W2996392464,"Benthic cyanobacterial proliferations in rivers are have been reported with increasing frequency worldwide. In the Eel and Russian rivers of California, more than a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin toxicosis since 2000. Periphyton proliferations in these rivers comprise multiple cyanobacterial taxa capable of cyanotoxin production, hence there is uncertainty regarding which taxa are producing toxins. In this study, periphyton samples dominated by the cyanobacterial genera Anabaena spp. and Microcoleus spp. and the green alga Cladophora glomerata were collected from four sites in the Eel River catchment and one site in the Russian River. Samples were analysed for potential cyanotoxin producers using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in concert with Sanger sequencing. Cyanotoxin concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, and anatoxin quota (the amount of cyanobacterial anatoxins per toxigenic cell) determined using droplet digital PCR. Sequencing indicated Microcoleus sp. and Nodularia sp. were the putative producers of cyanobacterial anatoxins and nodularins, respectively, regardless of the dominant taxa in the mat. Anatoxin concentrations in the mat samples varied from 0.1 to 18.6 μg g-1 and were significantly different among sites (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon test); however, anatoxin quotas were less variable (< 5-fold). Dihydroanatoxin-a was generally the most abundant variant in samples comprising 38% to 71% of the total anatoxins measured. Mats dominated by the green alga C. glomerata contained both anatoxins and nodularin-R at concentrations similar to those of cyanobacteria-dominated mats. This highlights that even when cyanobacteria are not the dominant taxa in periphyton, these mats may still pose a serious health risk and indicates that more widespread monitoring of all mats in a river are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2994859745,"Prior studies have suggest that religiosity mitigates symptoms of depression. However, population-based data in South America are limited. This study determines the prevalence of religiosity and explores its association with depression in four cities of the Southern cone of Latin-America. In the CESCAS I study 7524 participants aged between 35 and 74 years old were recruited between 2011 and 2012 from randomly selected samples in 4 cities (Bariloche and Marcos Paz, Argentina; Temuco, Chile; and Pando-Barros Blancos, Uruguay). Religiosity was assessed with a questionnaire from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Two dimensions were used: 1) recognition as belonging to a religion; and 2) frequency of participation in religious activities. Depression was measured using the PHQ-9. Prevalence of religiosity was described by sociodemographic characteristics. Association between religiosity and depression was examined through logistic regression models controlling for sex, age and other potential confounders. Weekly religious activities were reported by 32.3% (95% CI: 30.1, 33.6) of participants. Prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) was 14.6% (95% CI: 13.6, 15.6). After controlling for confounders, older women (≥65 years) who reported religious affiliation had 70% lower likelihood of having MDE (OR: 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1, 0.8). Moreover, in this group, women participating in religious activities more than once per week compared with ""never"" had 50% lower likelihood of having a MDE (OR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9). No association between religious activities and depression was found in men. Religiosity is highly prevalent among adults in four cities of South America. Our study found an inverse association between religiosity and depression only in women, stronger in olders. Although longitudinal studies are necessary to determine the true nature of these relationships, religiosity may be a relevant factor that health care providers could take into account when exploring depression in their patients."
https://openalex.org/W2996645583,"Bacteria and other types of microbes interact with their hosts in several ways, including metabolic pathways, development, and complex behavioral processes such as mate recognition. During the mating season, adult males of the lesser long-nosed agave pollinator bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) develop a structure called the dorsal patch, which is located in the interscapular region and may play a role in kin recognition and mate selection. Using high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, we identified a total of 2,847 microbial phylotypes in the dorsal patches of eleven specimens. Twenty-six phylotypes were shared among all the patches, accounting for 30 to 75% of their relative abundance. These shared bacteria are distributed among 13 families, 10 orders, 6 classes and 3 phyla. Two of these common bacterial components of the dorsal patch are Lactococcus and Streptococcus. Some of them—Helcococcus, Aggregatibacter, Enterococcus, and Corynebacteriaceae—include bacteria with pathogenic potential. Half of the shared phylotypes belong to Gallicola, Anaerococcus, Peptoniphilus, Proteus, Staphylococcus, Clostridium, and Peptostreptococcus and specialize in fatty acid production through fermentative processes.

https://openalex.org/W2994973294,"The sequence of the DNA template has long been thought to influence the rate of transcription by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, but the influence of DNA sequence on transcription elongation properties of eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has not been defined. In this study, we observe changes in dinucleotide production, transcription elongation complex stability, and Pol I pausing in vitro in response to downstream DNA. In vitro studies demonstrate that AT-rich downstream DNA enhances pausing by Pol I and inhibits Pol I nucleolytic cleavage activity. Analysis of Pol I native elongating transcript sequencing data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that these downstream sequence elements influence Pol I in vivo . Native elongating transcript sequencing studies reveal that Pol I occupancy increases as downstream AT content increases and decreases as downstream GC content increases. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the downstream DNA sequence directly impacts the kinetics of transcription elongation prior to the sequence entering the active site of Pol I both in vivo and in vitro ."
https://openalex.org/W2995460127,"Introduction In the WHO European Region, endemic transmission of measles and rubella had been interrupted by 37 and 42 of the 53 member states (MSs), respectively, by 2018. Sixteen MSs are still endemic for measles, 11 for rubella and nine for both diseases, the latter including Italy. Elimination is documented by each country’s National Verification Committee (NVC) through an annual status update (ASU). Objective By analysing data used to produce the ASUs, we aimed to describe the advances made by Italy towards elimination of measles and rubella. Moreover, we propose a set of major interventions that could facilitate the elimination process. Methods A total of 28 indicators were identified within the six core sections of the ASU form and these were evaluated for the period 2013–2018. These indicators relate to the incidence of measles/rubella; epidemiological investigation of cases; investigation of outbreaks; performance of the surveillance system; population immunity levels; and implementation of supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). Results From 2013 to 2018, epidemiological and laboratory analyses of measles cases in Italy improved substantially, allowing timely investigation in 2017 and 2018 of most outbreak and sporadic cases and identification of the majority of genotypic variants. Moreover, since 2017, vaccination coverage has increased significantly. Despite these improvements, several areas of concern emerged, prompting the following recommendations: i) improve outbreak monitoring; ii) strengthen the MoRoNet network; iii) increase the number of SIAs; iv) reinforce vaccination services; v) maintain regional monitoring; vi) design effective communication strategies; vii) foster the role of general practitioners and family paediatricians. Conclusions The review of national ASUs is a crucial step to provide the NVC with useful insights into the elimination process and to guide the development of targeted interventions. Against this background, the seven recommendations proposed by the NVC have been shared with the Italian Ministry of Health and the Technical Advisory Group on measles and rubella elimination and have been incorporated into the new Italian Elimination Plan 2019–2023 as a technical aid to facilitate the achievement of disease elimination goals."
https://openalex.org/W2995270189,"We performed two experiments to investigate how monocular vision and a monocular generalized reduction in vision (MRV) impact driving performance during racing. A total of 75 visually normal students or professional racing drivers, were recruited for the two experiments. Driving performance was evaluated under three visual conditions: normal vision, simulated monocularity and simulated monocular reduction in vision. During the driving scenario, the drivers had to detect and react to the sudden intrusion of an opponent’s racing car into their trajectory when entering a turn. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and ANOVA were then used to explore how monocular vision and monocular reduction in vision affect drivers’ performance (crash and reaction time) while confronting them with critical situations. The results show that drivers under monocular condition are from 2.1 (95% CI 1.11–4.11, p = .024) to 6.5 (95% CI 3.91–11.13; p = .0001) times more likely to collide with target vehicles compared with their baseline (binocular) condition, depending on the driving situation. Furthermore, there was an average increase in reaction time from 64 ms (p = .029) to 126 ms (p = .015) under monocular condition, depending on the critical driving situation configuration. This study objectively demonstrates that monocularity has a significant impact on driving performance and safety during car racing, whereas performance under monocular reduction in vision conditions is less affected."
https://openalex.org/W2996437340,"Poor water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in health care facilities increases hospital-associated infections, and the resulting greater use of second-line antibiotics drives antimicrobial resistance. Recognising the existing gaps, the World Health Organisations' Water and Sanitation for Health Facility Improvement Tool (WASH-FIT) was designed for self-assessment. The tool was designed for small primary care facilities mainly providing outpatient and limited inpatient care and was not designed to compare hospital performance. Together with technical experts, we worked to adapt the tool for use in larger facilities with multiple inpatient units (wards), allowing for comparison between facilities and prompt action at different levels of the health system.We adapted the existing facility improvement tool (WASH-FIT) to create a simple numeric scoring approach. This is to illustrate the variation across hospitals and to facilitate monitoring of progress over time and to group indicators that can be used to identify this variation. Working with stakeholders, we identified those responsible for action to improve WASH at different levels of the health system and used piloting, analysis of interview data to establish the feasibility and potential value of the WASH Facility Survey Tool (WASH-FAST) to demonstrate such variability.We present an aggregate percentage score based on 65 indicators at the facility level to summarise hospitals' overall WASH status and how this varies. Thirty-four of the 65 indicators spanning four WASH domains can be assessed at ward level enabling within hospital variations to be highlighted. Three levels of responsibility for WASH service monitoring and improvement were identified with stakeholders: the county/regional level, senior hospital management and hospital infection prevention and control committees.We propose WASH-FAST can be used as a survey tool to assess, measure and monitor the progress of WASH in hospitals in resource-limited settings, providing useful data for decision making and tracking improvements over time."

While many such tools exist for different families of neural models, there is a lack of tools allowing for both a generic model definition and efficiently parallelized simulations. In this work, we present PyRates, a Python framework that provides the means to build a large variety of rate-based neural models. PyRates provides intuitive access to and modification of all mathematical operators in a graph, thus allowing for a highly generic model definition. For computational efficiency and parallelization, the model is translated into a compute graph. Using the example of two different neural models belonging to the family of rate-based population models, we explain the mathematical formalism, software structure and user interfaces of PyRates. We show via numerical simulations that the behavior of the PyRates model implementations is consistent with the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the computational capacities and scalability of PyRates via a number of benchmark simulations of neural networks differing in size and connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2995436878,"The mismatch repair (MMR) complex is composed of MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) and MutLα (MLH1-PMS2) and specifically recognizes mismatched bases during DNA replication. O 6 -Methylguanine is produced by treatment with alkylating agents, such as N -methyl- N -nitrosourea (MNU), and during DNA replication forms a DNA mismatch ( i.e. an O 6 -methylguanine/thymine pair) and induces a G/C to A/T transition mutation. To prevent this outcome, cells carrying this DNA mismatch are eliminated by MMR-dependent apoptosis, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study, we provide evidence that the chromatin-regulatory and ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling protein SMARCAD1 is involved in the induction of MMR-dependent apoptosis in human cells. Unlike control cells, SMARCAD1 -knockout cells (ΔSMARCAD1) were MNU-resistant, and the appearance of a sub-G 1 population and caspase-9 activation were significantly suppressed in the ΔSMARCAD1 cells. Furthermore, the MNU-induced mutation frequencies were increased in these cells. Immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the recruitment of MutLα to chromatin-bound MutSα, observed in SMARCAD1-proficient cells, is suppressed in ΔSMARCAD1 cells. Of note, the effect of SMARCAD1 on the recruitment of MutLα exclusively depended on the ATPase activity of the protein. On the basis of these findings, we propose that SMARCAD1 induces apoptosis via its chromatin-remodeling activity, which helps recruit MutLα to MutSα on damaged chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2995508087,"Intranuclear inclusions (NI) in normal and neoplastic tissues have been known for years, representing one of the diagnostic criteria for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). BRAF activation is involved among others in autophagy. NI in hepatocellular carcinoma contain autophagy-associated proteins. Our aim was to clarify if NI in thyroid carcinoma (TC) have a biological function.NI in 107 paraffin-embedded specimens of TC including all major subtypes were analyzed. We considered an inclusion as positive if it was delimited by a lamin AC (nuclear membrane marker) stained intact membrane and completely closed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF) and 3D reconstruction were performed to investigate content and shape of NI; BRAFV600E mutation was analyzed by next generation sequencing.In 29% of the TCs at least one lamin AC positive intranuclear inclusion was detected; most frequently (76%) in PTCs. TEM analyses revealed degenerated organelles and heterolysosomes within such NI; 3D reconstruction of IF stained nuclei confirmed complete closure by the nuclear membrane without any contact to the cytoplasm. NI were positively stained for the autophagy-associated proteins LC3B, ubiquitin, cathepsin D, p62/sequestosome1 and cathepsin B in 14-29% of the cases. Double-IF revealed co-localization of LC3B & ubiquitin, p62 & ubiquitin and LC3B & p62 in the same NI. BRAFV600E mutation, exclusively detected in PTCs, was significantly associated with the number of NI/PTC (p = 0.042) and with immunoreactivity for autophagy-associated proteins in the NI (p≤0.035). BRAF-IHC revealed that some of these BRAF-positive thyrocytes contained mutant BRAF in their NI co-localized with autophagy-associated proteins.NI are completely delimited by nuclear membrane in TC. The presence of autophagy-associated proteins within the NI together with degenerated organelles and lysosomal proteases suggests their involvement in autophagy and proteolysis. Whether and how BRAFV600E protein is degraded in NI needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2995425324,"Brachycephalic syndrome (BS) is a pathophysiological disorder caused by excessive soft tissue within the upper airways of short-nosed dog breeds, causing obstruction of the nasal, pharyngeal and laryngeal lumen, resulting in severe respiratory distress. As the prevalence of BS appears to be high among some of the affected breeds, there is an urgent need for breeding efforts to improve the health status of those dogs. In the present study, we evaluated correlations between morphometric and other phenotypic characteristics and BS in a population of 69 French bulldogs from Denmark to identify parameters that could serve as a basis for breeding against BS. Furthermore, the genetic variation was monitored to determine whether it would be possible to breed based on these characteristics without simultaneously causing a critical reduction in genetic variation. Six phenotypic characteristics were correlated with the Brachycephalic Syndrome Functional (BSF) score. Among the morphometric risk factors, nostril stenosis (NS) and neck girth (NG) had the highest impact on the BSF score, accounting for 32% and 4% of the variation, respectively. The genetic variation in the population was comparable to other pure breeds, i.e. estimated and observed heterozygosity was 0.60 and the average inbreeding coefficient was 0.01. If only dogs with Grades 1 and 2 NS (no or only mild NS) were selected for breeding the mean BSF score would be reduced significantly. However, it would result in the exclusion of 81% of the population for breeding and this is not prudent. Excluding only dogs with severe stenosis (Grade 4) would exclude 50% of the population without any adverse impact on genetic variation within the population. Although exclusion of dogs with Grade 4 would result in an apparent reduction in the mean BSF score, this reduction is not significant. As NS accounts for 32% of the variation in BSF score, a possible long term strategy to reduce the prevalence of the BS in French bulldogs would seem to be a selection scheme that first excluded dogs with the most severe NS from breeding, gradually moving towards selecting dogs with lower NS grades. According to our findings there is no viable short term solution for reducing the prevalence of BS in the French bulldog population."
https://openalex.org/W2994664282,"Recent advances on the environmental determinants of Kawasaki Disease have pointed to the important role of the atmospheric transport of a still unknown agent potentially triggering the disease. The hypothesis arose from an innovative methodology combining expertise in climate dynamics, the analysis of ocean and atmosphere data, the use of dispersion models and the search for biological agents in air samples. The approach offered a new perspective to reveal the identity of the potential trigger, but at the same time, it increased the level of complexity, which could potentially lead to the misinterpretation of the mechanisms. Some years after it was originally formulated, we here provide a brief clarification on the approach and limits of the methodology in order to prevent an eventual misuse of our research ideas and theory, so that further research can better focus on the knowledge gaps that still remain open."
https://openalex.org/W2995281686,"Introduction In southern European countries, multicentric lymphoma and leishmaniosis are the main differential diagnoses in dogs presented with generalized lymphadenomegaly. The cytological examination is in some cases inconclusive and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR) has become a common method to confirm or rule out a lymphoproliferative neoplasia. According to the literature, leishmaniosis may lead to clonal arrangements and therefore to a false diagnosis of lymphoma, but this assumption is made from a single leishmania infected dog. Therefore, the objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate results from PARR in dogs with lymphadenomegaly due to clinical leishmaniosis at the moment of diagnosis. Materials and methods 31 dogs with a diagnosis of leishmaniosis based on the LeishVet guidelines were included in the study. Samples from enlarged lymph nodes were taken for cytological examination, clonality testing and Leishmania infantum PCR. Results All 31 dogs had medium to high positive antibody titers against Leishmania spp. and 30/31 had a positive Leishmania PCR from the lymph node. A polyclonal arrangement for B cells (immunoglobulin heavy chain gene) and T cells (T-cell receptor gamma chain gene) antigen receptors was found in 28/31 dogs. Two out of 31 dogs showed a monoclonal arrangement for Ig with high (1:2) and low (1:7) polyclonal background respectively; and one of the 31 dogs showed a monoclonal arrangement for T cell receptor with low (1:3) polyclonal background. Conclusion Infections with Leishmania infantum resulted in clonal rearrangement, and therefore in a possible false diagnosis of lymphoma, in 3 out of 31 dogs (9.7%). Although, PARR is a useful method to differentiate lymphoma from reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in dogs with leishmaniosis, mono-/biclonal results should be interpreted carefully, especially in the presence of any degree of polyclonal background, and together with other clinicopathological findings."
https://openalex.org/W2996524493,"In neonatal T cells, a low response to infection contributes to a high incidence of morbidity and mortality of neonates. Here we have evaluated the impact of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial levels of Reactive Oxygen Species of adult and neonatal CD8+ T cells on their activation potential. We have also constructed a logical model connecting metabolism and ROS with T cell signaling. Our model indicates the interplay between antigen recognition, ROS and metabolic status in T cell responses. This model displays alternative stable states corresponding to different cell fates, i.e. quiescent, activated and anergic states, depending on ROS levels. Stochastic simulations with this model further indicate that differences in ROS status at the cell population level contribute to the lower activation rate of neonatal, compared to adult, CD8+ T cells upon TCR engagement. These results are relevant for neonatal health care. Our model can serve to analyze the impact of metabolic shift during cancer in which, similar to neonatal cells, a high glycolytic rate and low concentrations of glutamine and arginine promote tumor tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2994968091,"Recent empirical findings have indicated that gaze allocation plays a crucial role in simple decision behaviour. Many of these findings point towards an influence of gaze allocation onto the speed of evidence accumulation in an accumulation-to-bound decision process (resulting in generally higher choice probabilities for items that have been looked at longer). Further, researchers have shown that the strength of the association between gaze and choice behaviour is highly variable between individuals, encouraging future work to study this association on the individual level. However, few decision models exist that enable a straightforward characterization of the gaze-choice association at the individual level, due to the high cost of developing and implementing them. The model space is particularly scarce for choice sets with more than two choice alternatives. Here, we present GLAMbox, a Python-based toolbox that is built upon PyMC3 and allows the easy application of the gaze-weighted linear accumulator model (GLAM) to experimental choice data. The GLAM assumes gaze-dependent evidence accumulation in a linear stochastic race that extends to decision scenarios with many choice alternatives. GLAMbox enables Bayesian parameter estimation of the GLAM for individual, pooled or hierarchical models, provides an easy-to-use interface to predict choice behaviour and visualize choice data, and benefits from all of PyMC3’s Bayesian statistical modeling functionality. Further documentation, resources and the toolbox itself are available at https://glambox.readthedocs.io."
https://openalex.org/W2995885751,"In high-income countries of the Arabian Peninsula, including the Sultanate of Oman, motorization has been extremely rapid. As a result, road traffic crashes are by far the highest cause of premature mortality, and speeding is an acknowledged key risk factor. Theory-based interventions are needed to target prevention of this unsafe practice. This study sheds light on determinants of speeding among new generations of Omani drivers applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). A questionnaire covering all five main constructs of the TPB was first contextualized and administered to two target groups: male drivers of all ages (n = 1107) approached in person when renewing their driving license and university students drivers (men and women) reached through internet contact (n = 655). Multiple, stepwise linear regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with speeding. Results indicate that driving fast and not respecting the posted speed limits was common in both groups of drivers, although rates were higher among students; 41.8% reported driving a bit faster than other drivers and 24.1% faster than the posted speed limit compared with 31.4% and 14.2% in male drivers of all ages. In both groups the TPB model predicted to a limited extent the determinants of speeding behaviour. However, the intention to speed was associated with a negative attitude towards the respect of rules for men of all ages (β = -0.30 (p<0.001)) and for students (β = -0.26 (p<0.001)); a positive view regarding subjective norms (β = 0.25 (p<0.001) and β = 0.28 (p<0.001) respectively), and behavioural control (β = 0.15 (p<0.001) and β = 0.20 (p<0.001) respectively). Intention was the only significant predictor of speeding behaviour (β = 0.48 (p<0.001); and β = 0.64 (p<0.001)). To conclude, speeding is widespread among Omani drivers of all ages and the intention to respect posted speed limits meets a range of barriers that need greater consideration in order to achieve a better safety culture in the country."
https://openalex.org/W2996588927,"In Africa, the target pests of genetically modified Bt maize are lepidopteran stem borers, notably Busseola fusca (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Gene flow between Bt maize hybrids and open pollinated varieties (OPVs) that do not contain the Bt trait is highly likely in areas where both types of maize are cultivated. Consequently, introgression of the cry1Ab transgene into local OPVs will result in unknown patterns of Cry1Ab protein expression in plants during follow-up seasons when recycled seed of OPVs is planted. Too low concentrations of Cry protein in such plants may result in selection for resistant alleles and accelerate resistance evolution. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of introgression of the cry1Ab transgene into an OPV, on Cry protein concentration levels and pest survival. Bt transgene introgression was done by crossing a transgenic donor hybrid containing the cry1Ab gene with a non-Bt OPV as well as with a non-Bt near-isogenic hybrid. F1 and F2 crosses as well as back crosses were done yielding 11 genotypes (treatments). Cry1Ab protein concentrations in leaf tissue of these crosses were determined by means of ELISAs. All crosses that contained the transgene had similar or higher Cry1Ab concentrations when compared to the Bt parental hybrid, except for the Bt x OPV F1-cross that had a significantly lower Cry1Ab concentration. Survival B. fusca larvae were evaluated in assays in which larvae were reared for 14 days on whorl leaf tissue of the different treatments. Larval survival did not differ between any of the maize plant treatments which contained the Bt gene. Results suggest that Bt transgene introgression into OPVs may produce plant progenies that express Cry1Ab protein at sufficient concentrations, at last up to the F2 seed, to control B. fusca larvae. Resistance evolution is however not only influenced by the frequency of pest individuals that survive exposure to the Cry proteins but also by factors such as genetics of the pest and recipient OPV, pest biology and migration behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2995866832,"Researchers are increasingly showing interest in the application of a Butler matrix for fifth-generation (5G) base station antennas. However, the design of the Butler matrix is challenging at millimeter wave because of the very small wavelength. The literature has reported issues of high insertion losses and incorrect output phases at the output ports of the Butler matrix, which affects the radiation characteristics. To overcome these issues, the circuit elements of the Butler matrix such as the crossover, the quadrature hybrid and the phase shifter must be designed using highly accurate dimensions. This paper presents a low-loss and compact single-layer 8 × 8 Butler matrix operating at 28 GHz. The optimum design of each circuit element is also demonstrated in detail. The designed Butler matrix was fabricated to validate the simulated results. The measured results showed return losses of less than −10 dB at 28 GHz. The proposed Butler matrix achieved a low insertion loss and a low phase error of ± 2 dB and ± 10°, respectively. In sum, this work obtained a good agreement between the simulated and measured results."
https://openalex.org/W2996232836,"Energy drink consumption is increasing worldwide, especially among young adults, and has been associated with physical and mental health problems. In two experiments, we tested the prediction that energy drink consumption is in part driven by biased cognitive processing (attentional and approach biases), with a view to modifying these to reduce consumption. Young adults (18–25 years) who regularly consume energy drinks completed the dot probe (Exp.1; N = 116) or approach-avoidance task (Exp.2; N = 110) to measure attentional and approach bias for energy drink cues, respectively. They then underwent a cognitive bias modification protocol where they were trained to direct their attention away from pictures of energy drink cans (Exp.1), or to push a joystick away from themselves in response to these pictures (Exp.2). Following a post-training assessment of attentional (Exp.1) or approach bias (Exp.2), energy drink consumption was measured by an ostensible taste test. Regular energy drink consumers showed both an attentional and an approach bias for energy drink cues. Cognitive bias modification successfully reduced both biases. However, neither attentional nor approach bias modification significantly reduced energy drink intake. The results lend some support to incentive sensitisation theory which emphasises the role of biased decision-making processes related to addictive behaviours."

Plasma hemopexin (Hpx) and alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M) are hemoglobin scavenger proteins that protect against toxic effects of free heme released in the hemoglobin degradation process. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to analyze maternal plasma Hpx and A1M concentrations at 12–14, 18–20 and 26–28 weeks of gestation in three groups: 1) 51 women with a low risk for pre-eclampsia (LRW), 2) 49 women with a high risk for pre-eclampsia (PE) who did not develop PE (HRW) and 3) 42 women with a high risk for PE who developed PE (HRPE). The study had three aims: 1) to investigate whether longitudinal differences exist between study groups, 2) to examine if Hpx and A1M concentrations develop differently in pre-eclamptic women with small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses vs. pre-eclamptic women with appropriate for gestational age fetuses, and 3) to examine if longitudinal Hpx and A1M profiles differ by PE subtype (early-onset vs. late-onset and severe vs. non-severe PE). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in Hpx and A1M concentrations between the groups. We found that the differences in longitudinal plasma Hpx and A1M concentrations in HRW compared to HRPE and to LRW may be associated with reduced risk of PE regardless of clinical risk factors. In women who developed PE, a high A1M concentration from midgestation to late second trimester was associated with SGA. There were no differences in longitudinal Hpx and A1M concentrations from first to late second trimester in high-risk women who developed early-onset or. late-onset PE or in women who developed severe or. non-severe PE."
https://openalex.org/W2996726899,"This study elucidated the characteristics of climatological seasonal changes in the diurnal variations of precipitation at four ground stations in the upper Río Chagres basin in the Panama Canal watershed. The seasonal changes differed among the stations, although they are located within an area of only 414 km2. Precipitation peaks in the early afternoon at 1500 local standard time (LST) were observed at all the stations. At Chamon, monthly-mean hourly precipitation at every hour exceeded 0.3 mm h-1 throughout November and December. The occurrence of morning precipitation in January and March distinguished the seasonal precipitation pattern at Esperanza from the pattern at the other stations. Analyses of the seasonal changes in the diurnal variation with pattern correlations and rotational empirical orthogonal functions grouped the stations into two pairs: no morning peak at Chico and Río Piedras in the downstream basin and morning peak at Chamon and Esperanza in the upstream basin."
https://openalex.org/W2994848848,"Many studies have attempted to shed light on the ability of non-human animals to understand physical causality by investigating their tool-use behavior. This study aimed to develop a tool-manipulation task for rodents in which the subjects could not manipulate the tool in the direction of the reward by simple patterned behavior. Eight rats had to use a rake-shaped tool to obtain a food reward placed beyond their reach. During the training, the rats never moved the rakes laterally to obtain the reward. However, in the positional discrimination test, the rake was placed at the center of the experimental apparatus, and the reward was positioned on either the left or right side of the rake. Interestingly, this test indicated that some rats were able to manipulate the rake toward the reward without relying on a patterned behavior acquired during the training. These results suggested that rats have the primitive ability to understand causal relationships in the physical environment. The findings indicate that rats can potentially serve as an animal model to investigate the mechanisms of evolution and development of the understanding of physical causality in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2995816442,"Ninety-five percent of all transmembrane proteins exist in kinetically trapped aggregation-prone states that have been directly linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, the primary sequence almost invariably avoids off-pathway aggregate formation, by folding reliably into its native, thermodynamically stabilized structure. However, with the rising incidence of protein aggregation diseases, it is now important to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of membrane protein aggregation. Micromolecular physicochemical and biochemical alterations in the primary sequence that trigger the formation of macromolecular cross-β aggregates can be measured only through combinatorial spectroscopic experiments. Here, we developed spectroscopic thermal perturbation with 117 experimental variables to assess how subtle protein sequence variations drive the molecular transition of the folded protein to oligomeric aggregates. Using the Yersinia pestis outer transmembrane β-barrel Ail as a model, we delineated how a single-residue substitution that alters the membrane-anchoring ability of Ail significantly contributes to the kinetic component of Ail stability. We additionally observed a stabilizing role for interface aliphatics, and that interface aromatics physicochemically contribute to Ail self-assembly and aggregation. Moreover, our method identified the formation of structured oligomeric intermediates during Ail aggregation. We show that the self-aggregation tendency of Ail is offset by the evolution of a thermodynamically compromised primary sequence that balances folding, stability, and oligomerization. Our approach provides critical information on how subtle changes in protein primary sequence trigger cross-β fibril formation, with insights that have direct implications for deducing the molecular progression of neurodegeneration and amyloidogenesis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2996309863,"Because of the recent increase in the demand for fresh produce, contamination of raw food products has become an issue. Foodborne diseases are frequently caused by the infection of leguminous plants by human bacterial pathogens. Moreover, contamination by Vibrio cholerae, closely related with Vibrio vulnificus, has been reported in plants and vegetables. Here, we investigated the possibility of Vibrio vulnificus 96-11-17M, an opportunistic human pathogen, to infect and colonize Arabidopsis thaliana plants, resulting in typical disease symptoms at 5 and 7 days post-inoculation in vitro and in planta under artificial and favorable conditions, respectively. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 5,360, 4,204, 4,916 and 3,741 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation, respectively, compared with the 0 h time point. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that these DEGs act in pathways responsive to chemical and hormone stimuli and plant defense. The expression of genes involved in salicylic acid (SA)-, jasmonic acid (JA)- and ethylene (ET)-dependent pathways was altered following V. vulnificus inoculation. Genetic analyses of Arabidopsis mutant lines verified that common pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors perceive the V. vulnificus infection, thus activating JA and ET signaling pathways. Our data indicate that the human bacterial pathogen V. vulnificus 96-11-17M modulates defense-related genes and host defense machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana under favorable conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2996740522,"In this study, the initial soil moisture in an atmospheric model was varied by assimilating AMSR-E (The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) products, and the results were compared with the default model scenario and in-situ data based on long-term CAMP/Tibet (Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) Asia-Australia Monsoon Project (CAMP) Tibet) observations. The differences between the obtained results (i.e., the new simulation, default model configuration and in-situ data) showed an apparent inconsistency in the model-simulated land surface heat fluxes. The results showed that the soil moisture was sensitive to the specific model simulation. To evaluate and verify the model stability, a long-term modeling study with AMSR-E soil moisture data assimilation was performed. Based on test simulations, AMSR-E data were assimilated into an atmospheric model for July and August 2007. The results showed that the land surface fluxes agreed well with both the in-situ data and the results of the default model configuration. Assimilating the AMSR-E SM products was important for determining the land surface heat fluxes in the WRF model. All the assimilation work substantially improved the modeling of land surface heat fluxes. Land surface heat fluxes are related to atmospheric interactions. Therefore, land surface heat fluxes are very important land surface parameters during these processes. Therefore, the simulation can be used to retrieve land surface heat fluxes from an atmospheric model. It is important to study the surface heating sources that are related to both the water and energy cycles over the Tibetan Plateau."

This study has two purposes, namely, (1) to investigate the gender differences in the stressors and utilization frequency of problem-focused coping among adult employees and (2) to explore the gender differences in the interaction effect of cumulative risk and problem-focused coping on depression among adult employees. The cumulative risk of employees was assessed in the following six ways: health pressure, family economic pressure, love and marriage problems, conflicts among family members, work stress and friend support. Problem-focused coping was measured by the three dimensions of active coping, planning, and using instrumental support from the Brief COPE scale, and depression was assessed by the Self-rating Depression Scale. The participants consisted of 406 Chinese employees. The results showed that (1) the cumulative risk of male employees was marginally significantly higher than that of female employees; (2) there was no significant difference in the utilization frequency of problem-focused coping between male and female employees; and (3) problem-focused coping moderated the relationship between cumulative risk and depression for male employees but not for female employees. This study indicates that problem-focused coping has a stronger effect on depression for male employees than for female employees."

Data were obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2006-2015.Administration of an opioid medication either during the ED visit or as a discharge prescription. Survey-adjusted regression analyses were used to determine the probability of a patient receiving an opioid medication.During the study period, there were 19,241 pediatric trauma visits discharged from the ED, of which 14% were associated with an opioid. Opioid administration decreased by nearly 30% during the study period (p<0.001 for trend). In multivariable analysis, patient factors associated with opioid administration were adolescent age, evening visit, region of the country, and severe pain score. The diagnosis associated with the most opioids was ankle sprain and the diagnosis with the highest rate of opioid administration was radius fracture. The most common opioid administered to children under 12 years of age was acetaminophen-codeine.Opioid administration appears to be decreasing among pediatric patients presenting to the ED with trauma, but a high number of children continue to be exposed to opioids every year. Further education on opioid sparing pain management strategies may be warranted to decrease opioid exposure, including the inappropriate use of codeine, in this low risk trauma population."

Continuity of care (COC), a measurement of the extent to which an individual patient receives care from a given provider over a specified period of time, can help cancer survivors process their experiences of dealing with the illness and recuperation; however, limited research has focused on the survival rate of working-age patients with oral cancer.A total of 14,240 working-age patients (20 <age ≤65 years) with oral cavity cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) during 2000-2013 were included in this study from a registry of patients with catastrophic illnesses maintained by the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We evaluated the effects of the Continuity of Care Index (COCI) proposed by Bice and Boxerman, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidities on the survival rate. This study categorized COC into three groups-low (COCI < 0.23), intermediate (COCI = 0.23-0.37), and high (COCI ≥ 0.38)-according to the distribution of scores in our sample. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine the demographic factors and comorbidities associated with the survival rate.Among all the relevant variables, low COCI, male sex, low socioeconomic status, no receipt of prior dental treatment before RT, residence outside northern Taiwan, chemotherapy receipt, and a history of diabetes increased the risk of mortality. Pre-RT dental evaluation and management was significantly associated with reduced post-RT mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.767, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.729-0.806, p < 0.001). Compared with patients with a high COCI, those with a low COCI exhibited an increased risk of mortality (aHR = 1.170, 95% CI = 1.093-1.252, p < 0.001). The mortality risk in the intermediate COC group was significantly higher than that in the high COC group (aHR = 1.194, 95% CI = 1.127-1.266, p < 0.001). To balance the distribution of the potential risk factors, propensity-score matching was used for the high COC (COCI > 0.38) and non-high COC (COCI ≤ 0.38) groups. After propensity-score matching, the mortality risk in the low and intermediate COC groups was also found to be significantly higher than that in the high COC group (aHR = 1.178, 95% CI = 1.074-1.292, p < 0.001 and aHR = 1.189, 95% CI = 1.107-1.277, p = 0.001, respectively).In Taiwan, COC and prior dental treatment before RT significantly affected the survival rate of working-age patients with oral cancer.

Participants were selected through purposive sampling. The sample consisted of 21 women with a confirmed diagnosis of CIN. Semistructured interviews were recorded and transcribed, and a thematic analysis was carried out, including researcher triangulation to verify the results of the analysis.Two main themes emerged from the participants' experiences: CIN medical surveillance encounters and risk management strategies are shaped by the biomedical discourse, and the effects of ""risk treatment"" for patients include (a) profound changes expected of patients, (b) increased patient risk management, and (c) resistance to risk management. While doctors' surveillance aimed to prevent the development of cervical cancer, women felt they were sick because they had to follow strict recommendations over an unspecified period of time and live with the possibility of a life-threatening disease. Clinical risk management resulted in the medicalization of women's personal and social lives and produced great uncertainty.This study is the first to conceptualize CIN medical surveillance as an illness experience for patients. It also problematizes the effects of preventative practices in women's lives. Patients deal with great uncertainty, as CIN medical surveillance performed by gynecologists simultaneously trivializes the changes expected of patients and underestimates the effects of medical recommendations on patients' personal wellbeing and social relations."
https://openalex.org/W2995880564,"The deluge of sequence information in the recent times provide us with an excellent opportunity to compare organisms on a large genomic scale. In this study we have tried to decipher the variation in the gene organization and structuring of a vital bacterial gene called ftsZ which codes for an integral component of the bacterial cell division, the FtsZ protein. FtsZ is homologous to tubulin protein and has been found to be ubiquitous in eubacteria. FtsZ is showing increasing promise as a target for antibacterial drug discovery. Our study of ftsZ protein from 143 different bacterial species spanning a wider range of morphological and physiological type demonstrates that the ftsZ gene of about ninety three percent of the organisms show relatively biased codon usage profile and significant GC deviation from their genomic GC content. Comparative codon usage analysis of ftsZ and a core housekeeping gene rpoB demonstrated that codon usage pattern of ftsZ CDS is shaped by natural selection to a large extent and mimics that of a housekeeping gene. We have also detected a tendency among the different organisms to utilize a core set of codons in structuring the ftsZ coding sequence. We observed that the compositional frequency of the amino acid serine in the FtsZ protein appears to be a indicator of the bacterial lifestyle. Our meticulous analysis of the ftsZ gene linked with the corresponding FtsZ protein show that there is a bias towards the use of specific synonymous codons particularly in the helix and strand regions of the multi-domain FtsZ protein. Overall our findings suggest that in an indispensable and vital protein such as FtsZ, there is an inherent tendency to maintain form for optimized performance in spite of the extrinsic variability in coding features."

We aimed to assess this association in Cameroonian mothers.We used a case-control study. Cases were women diagnosed with any arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease between 2012 and 2017 at two major hospitals of Yaoundé. Controls were mothers of children who sought pediatric care at the Gyneco-obstetric hospital of Yaoundé, with no diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. We abstracted data from patient files to assess cardiovascular disease and used phone-based questionnaires to assess a prior history of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy. We used logistic regression and propensity scores for data analysis.Out of 1228 individuals selected, 173 cases and 339 controls participated in the study. We found no increased risk of cardiovascular diseases for women with a history of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (OR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.34). Women with gestational hypertension had 2.33 (95% CI, 0.99 to 5.50) times the risk of women with no history of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy, an inverse association was observed between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases (OR = 0.28, 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.72).Cameroonian women with a history of gestational hypertension may have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, population-based studies with more accurate data on the exposure are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2996752125,"The Sustainable Development Goals have spurred a growing interest in and focus on equitable development. In theory, donors can play an important role in promoting equity within a country by providing services, influencing government policies and incorporating equity into decision-making. However, we know little about whether this actually happens on the ground. We conduct what we believe is the first study to explore the extent to which equity is prioritised in the allocation and distribution of aid, based on in-depth interviews with government officials, bilateral and international donors, and implementing partners operating in Northern Uganda. We find that a broad category of people are perceived to be marginalised/vulnerable, with a substantial segment largely untargeted by major donor programmes. Various stakeholders employ a wide range of strategies to identify the most vulnerable individuals and groups, including the use of available data and statistics, consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders, and undertaking primary data collection. The strategies used to incorporate equity in aid allocation and distribution include: targeting the regions of Northern Uganda and Karamoja in particular, targeting both refugees and host populations in refugee-hosting districts, prioritising the critically vulnerable in any aid distribution process, and using specific tools and consultants to ensure that major equity issues are addressed in proposals. Challenges undermining the process include poor understanding of the concept of equity among some implementing partners, lack of comprehensively disaggregated data, corruption, and political interference in choice of aid location from government officials and donors."
