https://openalex.org/W2082484676,"Introduction Treatment failure in acute myeloid leukemia is probably caused by the presence of leukemia initiating cells, also referred to as leukemic stem cells, at diagnosis and their persistence after therapy. Specific identification of leukemia stem cells and their discrimination from normal hematopoietic stem cells would greatly contribute to risk stratification and could predict possible relapses. Results For identification of leukemic stem cells, we developed flow cytometric methods using leukemic stem cell associated markers and newly-defined (light scatter) aberrancies. The nature of the putative leukemic stem cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells, present in the same patient's bone marrow, was demonstrated in eight patients by the presence or absence of molecular aberrancies and/or leukemic engraftment in NOD-SCID IL-2Rγ-/- mice. At diagnosis (n = 88), the frequency of the thus defined neoplastic part of CD34+CD38- putative stem cell compartment had a strong prognostic impact, while the neoplastic parts of the CD34+CD38+ and CD34- putative stem cell compartments had no prognostic impact at all. After different courses of therapy, higher percentages of neoplastic CD34+CD38- cells in complete remission strongly correlated with shorter patient survival (n = 91). Moreover, combining neoplastic CD34+CD38- frequencies with frequencies of minimal residual disease cells (n = 91), which reflect the total neoplastic burden, revealed four patient groups with different survival. Conclusion and Perspective Discrimination between putative leukemia stem cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells in this large-scale study allowed to demonstrate the clinical importance of putative CD34+CD38- leukemia stem cells in AML. Moreover, it offers new opportunities for the development of therapies directed against leukemia stem cells, that would spare normal hematopoietic stem cells, and, moreover, enables in vivo and ex vivo screening for potential efficacy and toxicity of new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2000807423,"Indoxyl sulfate is a uremic toxin and a ligand of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcriptional regulator. Elevated serum indoxyl sulfate levels may contribute to progressive kidney disease and associated vascular disease. We asked whether indoxyl sulfate injures podocytes in vivo and in vitro. Mice exposed to indoxyl sulfate for 8 w exhibited prominent tubulointerstitial lesions with vascular damage. Indoxyl sulfate-exposed mice with microalbuminuria showed ischemic changes, while more severely affected mice showed increased mesangial matrix, segmental solidification, and mesangiolysis. In normal mouse kidneys, AhR was predominantly localized to the podocyte nuclei. In mice exposed to indoxyl sulfate for 2 h, isolated glomeruli manifested increased Cyp1a1 expression, indicating AhR activation. After 8 w of indoxyl sulfate, podocytes showed foot process effacement, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and a focal granular and wrinkled pattern of podocin and synaptopodin expression. Furthermore, vimentin and AhR expression in the glomerulus was increased in the indoxyl sulfate-exposed glomeruli compared to controls. Glomerular expression of characteristic podocyte mRNAs was decreased, including Actn4, Cd2ap, Myh9, Nphs1, Nphs2, Podxl, Synpo, and Wt1. In vitro, immortalized-mouse podocytes exhibited AhR nuclear translocation beginning 30 min after 1 mM indoxyl sulfate exposure, and there was increased phospho-Rac1/Cdc42 at 2 h. After exposure to indoxyl sulfate for 24 h, mouse podocytes exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, perturbed actin cytoskeleton, decreased expression of podocyte-specific genes, and decreased cell viability. In immortalized human podocytes, indoxyl sulfate treatment caused cell injury, decreased mRNA expression of podocyte-specific proteins, as well as integrins, collagens, cytoskeletal proteins, and bone morphogenetic proteins, and increased cytokine and chemokine expression. We propose that basal levels of AhR activity regulate podocyte function under normal conditions, and that increased activation of podocyte AhR by indoxyl sulfate contributes to progressive glomerular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2163327003,"The importance of mangrove forests in carbon sequestration and coastal protection has been widely acknowledged. Large-scale damage of these forests, caused by hurricanes or clear felling, can enhance vulnerability to erosion, subsidence and rapid carbon losses. However, it is unclear how small-scale logging might impact on mangrove functions and services. We experimentally investigated the impact of small-scale tree removal on surface elevation and carbon dynamics in a mangrove forest at Gazi bay, Kenya. The trees in five plots of a Rhizophora mucronata (Lam.) forest were first girdled and then cut. Another set of five plots at the same site served as controls. Treatment induced significant, rapid subsidence (−32.1±8.4 mm yr−1 compared with surface elevation changes of +4.2±1.4 mm yr−1 in controls). Subsidence in treated plots was likely due to collapse and decomposition of dying roots and sediment compaction as evidenced from increased sediment bulk density. Sediment effluxes of CO2 and CH4 increased significantly, especially their heterotrophic component, suggesting enhanced organic matter decomposition. Estimates of total excess fluxes from treated compared with control plots were 25.3±7.4 tCO2 ha−1 yr−1 (using surface carbon efflux) and 35.6±76.9 tCO2 ha−1 yr−1 (using surface elevation losses and sediment properties). Whilst such losses might not be permanent (provided cut areas recover), observed rapid subsidence and enhanced decomposition of soil sediment organic matter caused by small-scale harvesting offers important lessons for mangrove management. In particular mangrove managers need to carefully consider the trade-offs between extracting mangrove wood and losing other mangrove services, particularly shoreline stabilization, coastal protection and carbon storage."
https://openalex.org/W2000259494,"A recently proposed methodology called the Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) [Luque et al., Phys. Rev. E., 80, 046103 (2009)] that constitutes a geometrical simplification of the well known Visibility Graph algorithm [Lacasa et al., Proc. Natl. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 4972 (2008)], has been used to study the distinction between deterministic and stochastic components in time series [L. Lacasa and R. Toral, Phys. Rev. E., 82, 036120 (2010)]. Specifically, the authors propose that the node degree distribution of these processes follows an exponential functional of the form , in which is the node degree and is a positive parameter able to distinguish between deterministic (chaotic) and stochastic (uncorrelated and correlated) dynamics. In this work, we investigate the characteristics of the node degree distributions constructed by using HVG, for time series corresponding to chaotic maps, 2 chaotic flows and different stochastic processes. We thoroughly study the methodology proposed by Lacasa and Toral finding several cases for which their hypothesis is not valid. We propose a methodology that uses the HVG together with Information Theory quantifiers. An extensive and careful analysis of the node degree distributions obtained by applying HVG allow us to conclude that the Fisher-Shannon information plane is a remarkable tool able to graphically represent the different nature, deterministic or stochastic, of the systems under study."
https://openalex.org/W2090903341,"Defining the specific role of the factors that affect metaphor processing is a fundamental step for fully understanding figurative language comprehension, either in discourse and conversation or in reading poems and novels. This study extends the currently available materials on everyday metaphorical expressions by providing the first dataset of metaphors extracted from literary texts and scored for the major psycholinguistic variables, considering also the effect of context. A set of 115 Italian literary metaphors presented in isolation (Experiment 1) and a subset of 65 literary metaphors embedded in their original texts (Experiment 2) were rated on several dimensions (word and phrase frequency, readability, cloze probability, familiarity, concreteness, difficulty and meaningfulness). Overall, literary metaphors scored around medium-low values on all dimensions in both experiments. Collected data were subjected to correlation analysis, which showed the presence of a strong cluster of variables-mainly familiarity, difficulty, and meaningfulness-when literary metaphor were presented in isolation. A weaker cluster was observed when literary metaphors were presented in the original contexts, with familiarity no longer correlating with meaningfulness. Context manipulation influenced familiarity, concreteness and difficulty ratings, which were lower in context than out of context, while meaningfulness increased. Throughout the different dimensions, the literary context seems to promote a global interpretative activity that enhances the open-endedness of the metaphor as a semantic structure constantly open to all possible interpretations intended by the author and driven by the text. This dataset will be useful for the design of future experimental studies both on literary metaphor and on the role of context in figurative meaning, combining ecological validity and aesthetic aspects of language."
https://openalex.org/W1980190728,"Small non-coding RNAs act as critical regulators of gene expression and are essential for male germ cell development and spermatogenesis. Previously, we showed that germ cell-specific inactivation of Dicer1, an endonuclease essential for the biogenesis of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), led to complete male infertility due to alterations in meiotic progression, increased spermatocyte apoptosis and defects in the maturation of spermatozoa. To dissect the distinct physiological roles of miRNAs and endo-siRNAs in spermatogenesis, we compared the testicular phenotype of mice with Dicer1 or Dgcr8 depletion in male germ cells. Dgcr8 mutant mice, which have a defective miRNA pathway while retaining an intact endo-siRNA pathway, were also infertile and displayed similar defects, although less severe, to Dicer1 mutant mice. These included cumulative defects in meiotic and haploid phases of spermatogenesis, resulting in oligo-, terato-, and azoospermia. In addition, we found by RNA sequencing of purified spermatocytes that inactivation of Dicer1 and the resulting absence of miRNAs affected the fine tuning of protein-coding gene expression by increasing low level gene expression. Overall, these results emphasize the essential role of miRNAs in the progression of spermatogenesis, but also indicate a role for endo-siRNAs in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2043462612,"Newly synthesized membrane and secreted proteins undergo a series of posttranslational modifications in the Golgi apparatus, including attachment of carbohydrate moieties. The final structure of so-formed glycans is determined by the order of execution of the different glycosylation steps, which seems intimately related to the spatial distribution of glycosyltransferases and glycosyl hydrolases within the Golgi apparatus. How cells achieve an accurate localization of these enzymes is not completely understood but might involve dynamic processes such as coatomer-coated (COPI) vesicle-mediated trafficking. In yeast, this transport is likely to be regulated by vacuolar protein sorting 74 (Vps74p), a peripheral Golgi protein able to interact with COPI coat as well as with a binding motif present in the cytosolic tails of some mannosyltransferases. Recently, Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3), the mammalian homolog of Vps74, has been shown to control the Golgi localization of core 2 N-acetylglucosamine-transferase 1. Here, we highlight a role of GOLPH3 in the spatial localization of α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1. We show, for the first time, that GOLPH3 supports incorporation of both core 2 N-acetylglucosamine-transferase 1 and α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 into COPI vesicles. Depletion of GOLPH3 altered the subcellular localization of these enzymes. In contrast, galactosyltransferase, an enzyme that does not interact with GOLPH3, was neither incorporated into COPI vesicles nor was dependent on GOLPH3 for proper localization."
https://openalex.org/W2089226777,"Lectin-like low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) is a receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in endothelial cells. The activation of LOX-1 by oxLDL stimulates the apoptosis and dysfunction of endothelial cells, and contributes to atherogenesis. However, the regulatory factors for LOX-1 are still unclear. MicroRNAs are small, endogenous, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expressions at a post-transcriptional level. The let-7 family is the second microRNA been discovered, which plays important roles in cardiovascular diseases. Let-7a and let-7b were predicted to target LOX-1 3′-UTR and be highly expressed in endothelial cells. The present study demonstrated that LOX-1 was a target of let-7a and let-7b. They inhibited the expression of LOX-1 by targeting the positions of 310-316 in LOX-1 3′-UTR. Over-expression of let-7a and let-7b inhibited the oxLDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, NO deficiency, ROS over-production, LOX-1 upregulation and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) downregulation. Moreover, we found that oxLDL treatment induced p38MAPK phosphorylation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, IκB degradation and PKB dephosphorylation. Let-7a or let-7b over-expression attenuated these alterations significantly. The present study may provide a new insight into the protective properties of let-7a and let-7b in preventing the endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2051262717,"Purpose The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the independent prognostic factors and optimize the treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Methods A total of 234 patients referred between January 2001 and December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 234 patients, 94 patients received chemotherapy alone (CT), and 140 patients received chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Clinical features, laboratory parameters and treatment modality were examined with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results The median overall survival (OS) time was 22 months (range, 2-125 months), and the 1-year, 2-year, 3-year overall survival rates were 82.2%, 51.3% and 34.1%. The overall response and disease control rates of metastatic lesions after chemotherapy were 56.0% and 89.8%. The factors associated with poor response were karnofsky performance score (KPS) <80, liver metastasis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)>245 IU/L, and number of chemotherapy cycles <4. The 3-year OS of patients receiving CRT was higher than those receiving CT alone (48.2% vs. 12.4%, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that significantly improved survival was also achieved by radiotherapy of the primary tumor in patients who achieved complete remission (CR)/partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) of metastatic lesions after chemotherapy. Significant independent prognostic factors of OS were KPS, liver metastasis, levels of LDH, and multiple metastases. Treatment modality, response to chemotherapy and chemotherapy cycles were also associated with OS. Conclusion A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy seems to have survival benefits for selected patients with distant metastases at initial diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory characteristics can help to guide treatment selection. Prospective randomized studies are needed to confirm the result."
https://openalex.org/W1989772117,"Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a complex surface structure that is linked to many pathogenic properties of Acinetobacter baumannii. In A. baumannii, the genes responsible for the synthesis of the outer core (OC) component of the LOS are located between ilvE and aspS. The content of the OC locus is usually variable within a species, and examination of 6 complete and 227 draft A. baumannii genome sequences available in GenBank non-redundant and Whole Genome Shotgun databases revealed nine distinct new types, OCL4-OCL12, in addition to the three known ones. The twelve gene clusters fell into two distinct groups, designated Group A and Group B, based on similarities in the genes present. OCL6 (Group B) was unique in that it included genes for the synthesis of L-Rhamnosep. Genetic exchange of the different configurations between strains has occurred as some OC forms were found in several different sequence types (STs). OCL1 (Group A) was the most widely distributed being present in 18 STs, and OCL6 was found in 16 STs. Variation within clones was also observed, with more than one OC locus type found in the two globally disseminated clones, GC1 and GC2, that include the majority of multiply antibiotic resistant isolates. OCL1 was the most abundant gene cluster in both GC1 and GC2 genomes but GC1 isolates also carried OCL2, OCL3 or OCL5, and OCL3 was also present in GC2. As replacement of the OC locus in the major global clones indicates the presence of sub-lineages, a PCR typing scheme was developed to rapidly distinguish Group A and Group B types, and to distinguish the specific forms found in GC1 and GC2 isolates."
https://openalex.org/W1968913844,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4) and interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) are critical regulators of keratinocyte differentiation, and their mutation causes the related developmental epidermal disorders Bartsocas-Papas syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome, respectively. However, the signaling pathways in which RIPK4 and IRF6 operate to regulate keratinocyte differentiation are poorly defined. Here we identify and mechanistically define a direct functional relationship between RIPK4 and IRF6. Gene promoter reporter and in vitro kinase assays, coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and confocal microscopy demonstrated that RIPK4 directly regulates IRF6 trans-activator activity and nuclear translocation. Gene knockdown and overexpression studies indicated that the RIPK4-IRF6 signaling axis controls the expression of key transcriptional regulators of keratinocyte differentiation, including Grainyhead-like 3 and OVO-like 1. Additionally, we demonstrate that the p.Ile121Asn missense mutation in RIPK4, which has been identified recently in Bartsocas-Papas syndrome, inhibits its kinase activity, thereby preventing RIPK4-mediated IRF6 activation and nuclear translocation. We show, through mutagenesis-based experiments, that Ser-413 and Ser-424 in IRF6 are important for its activation by RIPK4. RIPK4 is also important for the regulation of IRF6 expression by the protein kinase C pathway. Therefore, our findings not only provide important mechanistic insights into the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation by RIPK4 and IRF6, but they also suggest one mechanism by which mutations in RIPK4 may cause epidermal disorders (e.g. Bartsocas-Papas syndrome), namely by the impaired activation of IRF6 by RIPK4.

The epithelial cells that cover the external surfaces of the body (e.g. epidermal and oral keratinocytes) serve a number of important functions. One such function is to provide a barrier defense against mechanical trauma, chemicals, and infection (1.Madison K.C. Barrier function of the skin: “la raison d'etre” of the epidermis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The formation of this barrier during embryonic development relies upon a tightly regulated balance between keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Proliferation is restricted to the basal layer, where epidermal stem cells periodically lose the capacity to proliferate and initiate a program of terminal keratinocyte differentiation and migrate toward the surface (2.Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal homeostasis: a balancing act of stem cells in the skin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The development of various ectodermal structures (e.g. lips and mouth, digits, and external genitalia) also relies upon these processes being tightly regulated (2.Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Epidermal homeostasis: a balancing act of stem cells in the skin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation must also be tightly regulated post-development to maintain barrier integrity and to prevent pathological conditions (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma) (3.Ratushny V. Gober M.D. Hick R. Ridky T.W. Seykora J.T. From keratinocyte to cancer: the pathogenesis and modeling of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) is a critical transcriptional regulator of keratinocyte differentiation (4.Ingraham C.R.

Dunnwald M. Interferon regulatory factor 6 is necessary, but not sufficient, for keratinocyte differentiation.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2012; 132: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Irf6-deficient mice exhibit a range of epidermal defects. For instance, their epidermis is characterized by a greatly expanded spinous layer and absence of the granular and cornified layers, resulting in defective epidermal barrier function (4.Ingraham C.R. Kinoshita A. Kondo S. Yang B. Sajan S. Trout K.J. Malik M.I. Dunnwald M. Goudy S.L. Lovett M. Murray J.C. Schutte B.C.

Irf6-deficient mice also have epidermal adhesions at several sites, including in the oral cavity. Although the signaling pathways in which IRF6 operates are unclear, its transcriptional activation of the transcription factors Grainyhead-like 3 (GRHL3) and OVO-like 1 (OVOL1) is important for keratinocyte differentiation (7.de la Garza G.

How RIPK4 and IRF6 regulate keratinocyte differentiation is not well understood. However, given the phenotypic similarities between Ripk4- and Irf6-deficient mice, along with the similarities in the developmental defects in individuals with mutations in RIPK4 and IRF6, we sought to establish whether a direct functional relationship exists between these two proteins. We demonstrate here that not only do RIPK4 and IRF6 function in the same PKC-regulated signaling pathway to promote keratinocyte differentiation, but RIPK4 also directly activates IRF6. We also provide insights into how a specific missense mutation in RIPK4 may cause BPS.

The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pGEX2TH, and then the sequence was verified. Transformed BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli were grown at 37 °C in 2YT broth (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.0) with constant shaking. When the culture A600 reached ∼0.6, protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm), and the culture was incubated at 25 °C for 2–3 h with constant shaking. The bacteria were lysed by sonication in ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, DNase I (30 µg/ml) and protease inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (27,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C), and the GST proteins (GST-IRF6 CTD and GST) were purified on an FPLC system using GSTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare) and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filters (Millipore). The human oral keratinocyte cell line OKF6/TERT-2 (25.Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C. Ino Y. Ronfard V. Wu J.Y. Weinberg R.A. Louis D.N. Li F.P. Rheinwald J.G.

Primary human epidermal keratinocytes (Lonza) were cultured in KGM-GoldTM medium according to the protocol of the supplier. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm GlutaMax-1. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and cOmplete protease inhibitors) on ice for 60 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and protein concentrations were measured using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% NuPAGE gels, followed by Western blotting according to standard protocols. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL reagents (Millipore) and a LAS-3000 Imager (Fujifilm) or by exposure to x-ray film (Fujifilm). Films were scanned using a GS-800 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). V5-IRF6 was immunoprecipitated by incubating 1 mg of cell lysate with 1 µg of anti-V5 antibody and 20 µl of protein G-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. FLAG-Ripk4 was immunoprecipitated by incubating 1 mg of cell lysate with 10 µl of anti-FLAG-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. In both cases, the beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer. Anti-FLAG (Ripk4) immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 µm ATP, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing 2 µg of GST-IRF6 CTD or GST. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of the reactions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie G-250 and dried, and 32P incorporation was detected using a Typhoon Trio PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). HEK293T cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and transfected (in duplicate) the next day using FuGENE6 transfection reagent. The total amount of plasmid in each transfection was kept constant using empty vector. The cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection with passive lysis buffer and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. The IFNβ gene promoter reporter plasmid was provided by Dr. Ashley Mansell (Monash Institute of Medical Research). The NF-κB-dependent E-selectin (ELAM-1) gene promoter reporter plasmid was as described previously (26.Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Three NF-κ B binding sites in the human E-selectin gene required for maximal tumor necrosis factor α-induced expression.Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control Renilla reporter plasmid, pRL-TK, was from Promega. OKF6/TERT-2 cells and HEK293T cells (seeded on glass coverslips) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in 5% goat serum. The cells were then incubated overnight (at 4 °C) with a rabbit anti-IRF6 antibody, a mouse anti-FLAG antibody, or a mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody for 16 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody or an Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and finally mounted on glass microscope slides using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent containing DAPI. Mounted coverslips were allowed to cure in the dark for 24 h. Images were acquired on an Olympus FV1000 scanning confocal microscope. No anti-IRF6 or anti-FLAG staining was apparent in HEK293T cells transfected with empty vector only. The effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on IRF6 subcellular localization were analyzed using ImageJ software. Three random fields of cells were analyzed for each treatment condition. Binary images were obtained by thresholding to define the nuclear region of interest, which was subsequently used for measuring IRF6 nuclear fluorescence. Thereafter, IRF6 cytoplasmic fluorescence was determined by subtracting the nuclear fluorescence from the total cell fluorescence. IRF6 nuclear localization was calculated by dividing the nuclear fluorescence by the cytoplasmic fluorescence and is presented as a ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic IRF6. Total RNA was purified using an RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 µg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random primers and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase. Real-time PCR was performed (in triplicate) with an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system and TaqMan assays (Invitrogen) for the following genes: GRHL3 (Hs00297962_m1), IRF6 (Hs00196213_m1), IVL (Hs00902520_m1), KRT13 (Hs00999762_m1), MAD1 (Hs00965581_m1), OVOL1 (Hs00190060_m1), RIPK4 (Hs01062501_m1), and Ripk4 (Mm00458366_m1). Messenger RNA levels relative to those of the endogenous control gene, HPRT, were calculated using the ΔΔCt method (27.Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25424) Google Scholar). A reverse transfection protocol was used for the transfection of OKF6/TERT-2 cells and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. For gene silencing, siRNAs were diluted to 120 nm with 100 µl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and then mixed with 100 µl of Opti-MEM medium containing 1 µl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent, followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. For gene overexpression, the expression plasmid (1 µg of total plasmid) was diluted in 100 µl of Opti-MEM medium and then mixed with 100 µl of Opti-MEM medium containing 1 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. For both gene silencing and overexpression, keratinocytes (2–5 × 105 cells in 1 ml of antibiotic-free growth medium) were seeded into 12-well plates, and the transfection mixture was added. For gene knockdown experiments, the medium was replaced after 16 h, and the cells were treated with PMA 48 or 72 h post-transfection. For gene overexpression experiments, the cells were treated with PMA 24 h post-transfection without medium change. Data combined from three or more independent experiments are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Differences between two groups were evaluated using Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance and Sidak's or Dunnett's test as a post hoc test. p <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To establish whether a functional relationship exists between RIPK4 and IRF6, we first investigated whether the trans-activator activity of IRF6 is regulated by RIPK4. IRF6 trans-activator activity, which was measured using an IFNβ gene promoter reporter plasmid (24.Kwa M.Q. Nguyen T. Huynh J. Ramnath D. De Nardo D. Lam P.Y. Reynolds E.C. Hamilton J.A. Sweet M.J.

Consistent with earlier findings (13.Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Núñez G. Inohara N.

The phosphorylation of regulatory serine residues in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of IRFs represents a critical step in their inducible activation (28.Tamura T. Yanai H. Savitsky D. Taniguchi T. The IRF family transcription factors in immunity and oncogenesis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 535-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). To determine whether RIPK4 can directly phosphorylate the IRF6 CTD, in vitro kinase assays were performed using a GST-IRF6 CTD fusion protein as substrate. RIPK4 phosphorylated the GST-IRF6 CTD protein but not the GST control (Fig. 1E). Because of the instability of the GST-IRF6 CTD fusion protein, a degradation product was also evident in the Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 1E). The ability of RIPK4 to interact with IRF6 was also investigated by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments. IRF6 interacted, either directly or as part of a complex, with wild-type RIPK4. However, no interaction with the RIPK4 K51R mutant was detected (Fig. 1F, top panel). Because of autophosphorylation (12.Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S.

The ability of RIPK4 to regulate IRF6 nuclear translocation was also tested. IRF6 was detected in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. However coexpression of wild-type RIPK4, but not RIPK4 K51R, resulted in the partial nuclear translocation of IRF6 (Fig. 1G). RIPK4 localized exclusively to the cytoplasm, where it exhibited a degree of colocalization with the cy"

During this time, significant opportunities exist for the infant to acquire antibiotic resistant bacteria, which can become established and constitute the infant gut resistome. With increased antibiotic resistance limiting our ability to treat bacterial infections, investigations into resistance reservoirs are highly pertinent. This study aimed to explore the nascent resistome in antibiotically-naïve infant gut microbiomes, using a combination of metagenomic approaches. Faecal samples from 22 six-month-old infants without previous antibiotic exposure were used to construct a pooled metagenomic library, which was functionally screened for ampicillin and gentamicin resistance. Our library of ∼220Mb contained 0.45 ampicillin resistant hits/Mb and 0.059 gentamicin resistant hits/Mb. PCR-based analysis of fosmid clones and uncloned metagenomic DNA, revealed a diverse and abundant aminoglycoside and β-lactam resistance reservoir within the infant gut, with resistance determinants exhibiting homology to those found in common gut inhabitants, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., and Clostridium difficile, as well as to genes from cryptic environmental bacteria. Notably, the genes identified differed from those revealed when a sequence-driven PCR-based screen of metagenomic DNA was employed. Carriage of these antibiotic resistance determinants conferred substantial, but varied (2–512x), increases in antibiotic resistance to their bacterial host. These data provide insights into the infant gut resistome, revealing the presence of a varied aminoglycoside and β-lactam resistance reservoir even in the absence of selective pressure, confirming the infant resistome establishes early in life, perhaps even at birth."
https://openalex.org/W1978419881,"The formation of a stable 43 S preinitiation complex (PIC) must occur to enable successful mRNA recruitment. However, the contributions of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, and the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC) in stabilizing the 43 S PIC are poorly defined. We have reconstituted the human 43 S PIC and used fluorescence anisotropy to systematically measure the affinity of eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3j in the presence of different combinations of 43 S PIC components. Our data reveal a complicated network of interactions that result in high affinity binding of all 43 S PIC components with the 40 S subunit. Human eIF1 and eIF1A bind cooperatively to the 40 S subunit, revealing an evolutionarily conserved interaction. Negative cooperativity is observed between the binding of eIF3j and the binding of eIF1, eIF1A, and TC with the 40 S subunit. To overcome this, eIF3 dramatically increases the affinity of eIF1 and eIF3j for the 40 S subunit. Recruitment of TC also increases the affinity of eIF1 for the 40 S subunit, but this interaction has an important indirect role in increasing the affinity of eIF1A for the 40 S subunit. Together, our data provide a more complete thermodynamic framework of the human 43 S PIC and reveal important interactions between its components to maintain its stability."

In contrast, the β-amino acid recognition mechanism of adenylation enzymes is still unclear despite the importance of β-amino acid activation for the biosynthesis of various natural products.

https://openalex.org/W2027620715,"The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum is a major surface protein, which forms a dense coat on the sporozoite's surface. Preclinical research on CSP and clinical evaluation of a CSP fragment-based RTS, S/AS01 vaccine have demonstrated a modest degree of protection against P. falciparum, mediated in part by humoral immunity and in part by cell-mediated immunity. Given the partial protective efficacy of the RTS, S/AS01 vaccine in a recent Phase 3 trial, further improvement of CSP-based vaccines is crucial. In this report, we describe the preclinical development of a full-length, recombinant CSP (rCSP)-based vaccine candidate against P. falciparum malaria suitable for current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) production. Utilizing a novel high-throughput Pseudomonas fluorescens expression platform, we demonstrated greater efficacy of full-length rCSP as compared to N-terminally truncated versions, rapidly down-selected a promising lead vaccine candidate, and developed a high-yield purification process to express immunologically active, intact antigen for clinical trial material production. The rCSP, when formulated with various adjuvants, induced antigen-specific antibody responses as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), as well as CD4+ T-cell responses as determined by ELISpot. The adjuvanted rCSP vaccine conferred protection in mice when challenged with transgenic P. berghei sporozoites containing the P. falciparum repeat region of CSP. Furthermore, heterologous prime/boost regimens with adjuvanted rCSP and an adenovirus type 35-vectored CSP (Ad35CS) showed modest improvements in eliciting CSP-specific T-cell responses and anti-malarial protection, depending on the order of vaccine delivery. Collectively, these data support the importance of further clinical development of adjuvanted rCSP, either as a stand-alone product or as one of the components in a heterologous prime/boost strategy, ultimately acting as an effective vaccine candidate for the mitigation of P. falciparum-induced malaria."
https://openalex.org/W1985248841,"Dectin-1 recognizes β-glucan and plays important roles for the antifungal immunity through the activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in dendritic cells or macrophages. Recently, expression of Dectin-1 was also identified in human and mouse mast cells, although its physiological roles were largely unknown. In this report, rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 was analyzed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Dectin-1-mediated activation and responses of mast cells. Treatment of cells with Dectin-1-specific agonist curdlan induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and the interaction of Dectin-1 with the Src homology 2 domain of Syk. These responses depended on tyrosine phosphorylation of the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif in the cytoplasmic tail of Dectin-1, whereas they were independent of the γ-subunit of high-affinity IgE receptor. DNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses showed that Dectin-1-mediated signaling stimulated gene expression of transcription factor Nfkbiz and inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The response was abrogated by pretreatment with Syk inhibitor R406. These results suggest that Syk is critical for Dectin-1-mediated activation of mast cells, although the signaling differs from that triggered by FcϵRI activation. In addition, these gene expressions induced by curdlan stimulation were specifically observed in mast cells, suggesting that Dectin-1-mediated signaling of mast cells offers new insight into the antifungal immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2144990806,"Chromatin insulators of higher eukaryotes functionally divide the genome into active and inactive domains. Furthermore, insulators regulate enhancer/promoter communication, which is evident from the Drosophila bithorax locus in which a multitude of regulatory elements control segment specific gene activity. Centrosomal protein 190 (CP190) is targeted to insulators by CTCF or other insulator DNA-binding factors. Chromatin analyses revealed that insulators are characterized by open and nucleosome depleted regions. Here, we wanted to identify chromatin modification and remodelling factors required for an enhancer blocking function. We used the well-studied Fab-8 insulator of the bithorax locus to apply a genome-wide RNAi screen for factors that contribute to the enhancer blocking function of CTCF and CP190. Among 78 genes required for optimal Fab-8 mediated enhancer blocking, all four components of the NURF complex as well as several subunits of the dREAM complex were most evident. Mass spectrometric analyses of CTCF or CP190 bound proteins as well as immune precipitation confirmed NURF and dREAM binding. Both co-localise with most CP190 binding sites in the genome and chromatin immune precipitation showed that CP190 recruits NURF and dREAM. Nucleosome occupancy and histone H3 binding analyses revealed that CP190 mediated NURF binding results in nucleosomal depletion at CP190 binding sites. Thus, we conclude that CP190 binding to CTCF or to other DNA binding insulator factors mediates recruitment of NURF and dREAM. Furthermore, the enhancer blocking function of insulators is associated with nucleosomal depletion and requires NURF and dREAM."
https://openalex.org/W2031229874,"Formins are multidomain proteins that assemble actin in a wide variety of biological processes. They both nucleate and remain processively associated with growing filaments, in some cases accelerating filament growth. The well conserved formin homology 1 and 2 domains were originally thought to be solely responsible for these activities. Recently a role in nucleation was identified for the Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD), which is C-terminal to the formin homology 2 domain. The C-terminal tail of the Drosophila formin Cappuccino (Capu) is conserved among FMN formins but distinct from other formins. It does not have a DAD domain. Nevertheless, we find that Capu-tail plays a role in filament nucleation similar to that described for mDia1 and other formins. Building on this, replacement of Capu-tail with DADs from other formins tunes nucleation activity. Capu-tail has low-affinity interactions with both actin monomers and filaments. Removal of the tail reduces actin filament binding and bundling. Furthermore, when the tail is removed, we find that processivity is compromised. Despite decreased processivity, the elongation rate of filaments is unchanged. Again, replacement of Capu-tail with DADs from other formins tunes the processive association with the barbed end, indicating that this is a general role for formin tails. Our data show a role for the Capu-tail domain in assembling the actin cytoskeleton, largely mediated by electrostatic interactions. Because of its multifunctionality, the formin tail is a candidate for regulation by other proteins during cytoskeletal rearrangements."

We aimed to evaluate the consequences of suboptimal care in the early management of severe bacterial infection in children and study the determinants.A previously reported population-based confidential enquiry included all children (3 months- 16 years) who died of severe bacterial infection in a French area during a 7-year period. Here, we compared the optimality of the management of these cases to that of pediatric patients who survived a severe bacterial infection during the same period for 6 types of care: seeking medical care by parents, evaluation of sepsis signs and detection of severe disease by a physician, timing and dosage of antibiotic therapy, and timing and dosage of saline bolus. Two independent experts blinded to outcome and final diagnosis evaluated the optimality of these care types. The effect of suboptimal care on survival was analyzed by a logistic regression adjusted on confounding factors identified by a causal diagram. Determinants of suboptimal care were analyzed by multivariate multilevel logistic regression.Suboptimal care was significantly more frequent during early management of the 21 children who died as compared with the 93 survivors: 24% vs 13% (p = 0.003). The most frequent suboptimal care types were delay to seek medical care (20%), under-evaluation of severity by the physician (20%) and delayed antibiotic therapy (24%). Young age (under 1 year) was independently associated with higher risk of suboptimal care, whereas being under the care of a paediatric emergency specialist or a mobile medical unit as compared with a general practitioner was associated with reduced risk.Suboptimal care in the early management of severe bacterial infection had a global independent negative effect on survival. Suboptimal care may be avoided by better training of primary care physicians in the specifics of pediatric medicine."

When the fungus Fusarium oxysporum is exposed to Fly-ash, it is capable of selectively leaching out silica nanoparticles of quasi-spherical morphology within 24 h of reaction. These silica nanoparticles have been completely characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, Photoluminescence (PL), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX)."
https://openalex.org/W2142990937,"The Mx protein is one of the best-characterized interferon-stimulated antiviral mediators. Mx homologs have been identified in most vertebrates examined; however, their location within the cell, their level of activity, and the viruses they inhibit vary widely. Recent studies have demonstrated multiple Mx alleles in chickens and some reports have suggested a specific variant (S631N) within exon 14 confers antiviral activity. In the current study, the complete genome of nine elite egg-layer type lines were sequenced and multiple variants of the Mx gene identified. Within the coding region and upstream putative promoter region 36 SNP variants were identified, producing a total of 12 unique haplotypes. Each elite line contained from one to four haplotypes, with many of these haplotypes being found in only one line. Observation of changes in haplotype frequency over generations, as well as recombination, suggested some unknown selection pressure on the Mx gene. Trait association analysis with either individual SNP or haplotypes showed a significant effect of Mx haplotype on several egg production related traits, and on mortality following Marek's disease virus challenge in some lines. Examination of the location of the various SNP within the protein suggests synonymous SNP tend to be found within structural or enzymatic regions of the protein, while non-synonymous SNP are located in less well defined regions. The putative resistance variant N631 was found in five of the 12 haplotypes with an overall frequency of 47% across the nine lines. Two Mx recombinants were identified within the elite populations, indicating that novel variation can arise and be maintained within intensively selected lines. Collectively, these results suggest the conflicting reports in the literature describing the impact of the different SNP on chicken Mx function may be due to the varying context of haplotypes present in the populations studied."
https://openalex.org/W2132349995,"A phenanthrene-degrading endophytic bacterium, Pn2, was isolated from Alopecurus aequalis Sobol grown in soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Based on morphology, physiological characteristics and the 16S rRNA gene sequence, it was identified as Massilia sp. Strain Pn2 could degrade more than 95% of the phenanthrene (150 mg·L−1) in a minimal salts medium (MSM) within 48 hours at an initial pH of 7.0 and a temperature of 30°C. Pn2 could grow well on the MSM plates with a series of other PAHs, including naphthalene, acenaphthene, anthracene and pyrene, and degrade them to different degrees. Pn2 could also colonize the root surface of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam), invade its internal root tissues and translocate into the plant shoot. When treated with the endophyte Pn2 under hydroponic growth conditions with 2 mg·L−1 of phenanthrene in the Hoagland solution, the phenanthrene concentrations in ryegrass roots and shoots were reduced by 54% and 57%, respectively, compared with the endophyte-free treatment. Strain Pn2 could be a novel and useful bacterial resource for eliminating plant PAH contamination in polluted environments by degrading the PAHs inside plants. Furthermore, we provide new perspectives on the control of the plant uptake of PAHs via endophytic bacteria."

Although γ-tubulin complexes have primarily been implicated in the nucleation process, details of the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that a member of the human transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) protein family, TACC3, plays a critical role in microtubule nucleation at the centrosome. In mitotic cells, TACC3 knockdown substantially affected the assembly of microtubules in the astral region and impaired microtubule nucleation at the centrosomes. The TACC3 depletion-induced mitotic phenotype was rescued by expression of the TACC3 C terminus predominantly consisting of the TACC domain, suggesting that the TACC domain plays an important role in microtubule assembly. Consistently, experiments with the recombinant TACC domain of TACC3 demonstrated that this domain possesses intrinsic microtubule nucleating activity. Co-immunoprecipitation and sedimentation experiments revealed that TACC3 mediates interactions with proteins of both the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC). Interestingly, TACC3 depletion resulted in reduced levels of γ-TuRC and increased levels of γ-TuSC, indicating that the assembly of γ-TuRC from γ-TuSC requires TACC3. Detailed analyses suggested that TACC3 facilitates the association of γ-TuSC-specific proteins with the proteins known to be involved in the assembly of γ-TuRC. Consistent with such a role for TACC3, the suppression of TACC3 disrupted localization of γ-TuRC proteins to the centrosome. Our findings reveal that TACC3 is involved in the regulation of microtubule nucleation at the centrosome and functions in the stabilization of the γ-tubulin ring complex assembly.

The centrosome nucleates and organizes microtubules in most animal cells and plays key roles in the spatial and temporal control of microtubule networks (1.Bornens M.

The centriole has a well defined structure that involves microtubule triplets, whereas the organization of the PCM is less precise (3.Nigg E.A. Stearns T.

During the cell cycle, microtubules undergo large scale reorganization from a few long radial arrays in interphase to shorter, but very dense, spindles in mitosis. During this reorganization, the PCM increases in volume, and microtubule nucleation exhibits a severalfold increase (5.Petry S. Groen A.C. Ishihara K. Mitchison T.J. Vale R.D.

Microtubule nucleation is primarily mediated through the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), comprising γ-tubulin and the members of the conserved γ-tubulin complex family proteins (GCP) (6.Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T. Nucleation of microtubule assembly by a γ-tubulin-containing ring complex.Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The core structural unit is a tetrameric complex, the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC), which is composed of 2 units of γ-tubulin and 1 unit each of GCP2 and GCP3. Multiple γ-TuSC units are further assembled into a larger ring-shaped complex, γ-TuRC. In budding yeast, γ-TuRC consists of only γ-TuSC units, whereas in higher organisms, γ-TuRC contains additional GCP proteins, including GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6 (7.Aldaz H. Rice L.M. Stearns T. Agard D.A. Insights into microtubule nucleation from the crystal structure of human γ-tubulin.Nature. 2005; 435: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although γ-TuSCs have been shown to be critically important for microtubule nucleation in vivo, the same cannot be recapitulated in vitro using purified components, suggesting the involvement of yet unknown factors in this process (8.Oegema K.

Consistent with this idea, structural analyses of purified γ-tubulin complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed that both γ-TuSC and γ-TuRC ring-like structures are defective in microtubule nucleation (9.Kollman J.M.

Earlier studies have demonstrated the presence of a stable salt-insoluble protein scaffold/matrix in the PCM, which is likely composed of coiled-coil proteins (23.Moritz M. Zheng Y. Alberts B.M. Oegema K. Recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex to Drosophila salt-stripped centrosome scaffolds.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Subsequently, proteomics analyses of purified centrosomes have demonstrated the abundance of coiled-coil proteins in the centrosome (24.Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A.

However, the functions of coiled-coil proteins in centrosome-mediated processes are poorly understood. Members of the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) protein family are among the highly abundant coiled-coil proteins localized at the centrosomes. These proteins share an evolutionarily conserved long C-terminal coiled-coil region of ∼200 amino acids, referred to as the TACC domain (26.Raff J.W. Centrosomes and cancer: lessons from a TACC.Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 222-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27.Peset I. Vernos I. The TACC proteins: TACC-ling microtubule dynamics and centrosome function.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). TACC3, the highly conserved TACC homolog in humans, is aberrantly expressed in a variety of human cancers and has been shown to promote tumor growth in vivo (28.Yao R. Kondoh Y. Natsume Y. Yamanaka H. Inoue M. Toki H. Takagi R. Shimizu T. Yamori T. Osada H. Noda T. A small compound targeting TACC3 revealed its different spatiotemporal contributions for spindle assembly in cancer cells.Oncogene. 2013; 33: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have indicated that TACC3 is essential in mitosis. In Drosophila, D-TACC is required for normal spindle function and is critical for early embryonic development (29.Gergely F. Kidd D. Jeffers K. Wakefield J.G. Raff J.W. D-TACC: A novel centrosomal protein required for normal spindle function in the early Drosophila embryo.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, TAC-1 depletion leads to defects in spindle elongation in the one-cell-stage embryo (30.Bellanger J.M. Gönczy P. TAC-1 and ZYG-9 form a complex that promotes microtubule assembly in C. elegans embryos.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1488-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, TACC has been shown to interact with microtubule polymerase XMAP215 and to promote microtubule stability (31.Kinoshita K. Noetzel T.L. Pelletier L. Mechtler K. Drechsel D.N. Schwager A. Lee M. Raff J.W. Hyman A.A. Aurora A phosphorylation of TACC3/maskin is required for centrosome-dependent microtubule assembly in mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In human cells, TACC3 has been shown to be associated with the organization of the mitotic spindle poles (32.Gergely F. Draviam V.M. Raff J.W. The ch-TOG/XMAP215 protein is essential for spindle pole organization in human somatic cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that TACC3 depletion induced chromosomal misalignment, reduced spindle stability, and triggered apoptosis in cells (33.Schneider L. Essmann F. Kletke A. Rio P. Hanenberg H. Wetzel W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nürnberg B. Piekorz R.P. The transforming acidic coiled coil 3 protein is essential for spindle-dependent chromosome alignment and mitotic survival.J. Biol.

Vernos I. Aurora A kinase and its substrate TACC3 are required for central spindle assembly.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which TACC3 regulates microtubule functions at the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) has not been described. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of TACC3 in centrosome/spindle pole-mediated microtubule nucleation and to uncover its molecular links with the core microtubule-nucleating machinery, the γ-tubulin ring complex at the centrosome. We provide evidence that in mitotic cells, TACC3 primarily regulates the assembly of astral microtubules and is essential for the nucleation of microtubules at the centrosome and spindle poles. We show that TACC3 interacts with proteins of the γ-tubulin complexes; it functions in stabilizing the assembly of γ-TuRC from γ-TuSC and integrates γ-TuRC proteins to the centrosome. Our results also demonstrate that the TACC domain of TACC3 possesses intrinsic microtubule nucleating activity. These results reveal for the first time the involvement of a TACC3-mediated mechanism in the regulation of microtubule nucleation at the centrosome.

For rescue experiments, we followed two methods. For the first method, we depleted TACC3 using TACC3 siRNA in the siRNA-resistant TACC3-GFP stable HeLa cells.

DNA, esiRNAs, or single siRNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For transfection in MCF-7 cells, Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used. Microtubule regrowth assays were performed as described previously (42.Choi Y.K. Liu P. Sze S.K. Dai C. Qi R.Z. CDK5RAP2 stimulates microtubule nucleation by the γ-tubulin ring complex.J.

Briefly, mitotic cells were incubated in ice-cold DMEM containing 10% FBS for 3 h to depolymerize all cellular microtubules, and the medium was subsequently exchanged with growth medium that had been pre-warmed to 37 °C. The cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.5% Triton X-100 at different time points over 15 min and then immunostained and imaged using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Similar methods were followed for regrowth assay in the interphase cells, except that the cold incubation time was for 2 h. Cells fixed in either methanol at −20 °C or 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.5% Triton X-100 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), mixed with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 45 and 1 min, respectively. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold (Invitrogen), and images (×63) were captured using a Leica SP5 laser confocal microscope. Cells were mitotically synchronized using a double thymidine block (44.Manna T. Thrower D. Miller H.P. Curmi P. Wilson L.

Thymidine was again added to the cells after a 9-h release, followed by a 17-h incubation (second block). The cells were released from G1 arrest after the removal of thymidine and were collected at the mitotic stage. For experiments with synchronized interphase cells, the cells were collected under double thymidine-treated conditions. The synchronized cells were lysed using lysis buffer (4 °C) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, phosphatase inhibitors 2 and 3, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Subsequently, TACC3, GCP3, GCP6, and γ-tubulin were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antibodies, followed by the addition of protein G-agarose beads. The beads were washed with lysis buffer and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Membranes were developed for immunoblot using the Immobilon reagent (Millipore), followed by imaging using ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad). All immunofluorescence images were captured using a ×63 (1.4 N.A.) oil-immersion objective on a Leica SP 5 confocal microscope. The same image acquisition and analysis settings were used for both control and depleted conditions. The maximum intensity images were produced by projecting the images (Z-stacks) captured in three-dimensional optical sections at 0.3-µm intervals. The images were analyzed using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Lite 2.8.0 software. To analyze microtubule intensity (shown in Fig. 1C), a region of interest line of 19.83 µm in length was drawn across the spindle poles in the mitotic cell to measure microtubule intensity across the spindle pole axis (as shown in Fig. 1B). Intensities were analyzed using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Lite software. To quantify the microtubule regrowth in mitotic cells (as shown in Fig. 3), the microtubule intensities of the areas up to which the microtubules had grown around the spindle pole were quantified. The intensity of a microtubule-free background region of similar area was subtracted from the sample data to obtain the net intensity of the microtubules. The numbers of microtubules that had been nucleated from the centrosome in the interphase cells were counted by visual inspection (as shown in Fig. 4). To analyze the intensities of γ-tubulin and GCP6 at the spindle poles (as shown in Fig. 7), the total intensity within an area spanning 1.83 µm2 around the spindle poles was quantified in each case.FIGURE 4.TACC3 depletion inhibits microtubule nucleation in interphase cells.

https://openalex.org/W2081145784,"Broadly applicable polymorphic genetic markers are essential tools for population genetics, and different types of markers have been developed for this purpose. Microsatellites have been employed as particularly polymorphic markers for over 20 years. However, PCR primers for microsatellite loci are often not useful outside the species for which they were designed. This implies that a new set of loci has to be identified and primers developed for every new study species. To overcome this constraint, we identified 45 conserved microsatellite loci based on the eight currently available ant genomes and designed primers for PCR amplification. Among these loci, we chose 24 for in-depth study in six species covering six different ant subfamilies. On average, 11.16 of these 24 loci were polymorphic and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any given species. The average number of alleles for these polymorphic loci within single populations of the different species was 4.59. This set of genetic markers will thus be useful for population genetic and colony pedigree studies across a wide range of ant species, supplementing the markers available for previously studied species and greatly facilitating the study of the many ant species lacking genetic markers. Our study shows that it is possible to develop microsatellite loci that are both conserved over a broad range of taxa, yet polymorphic within species. This should encourage researchers to develop similar tools for other large taxonomic groups."

NIK is brought into close proximity to the c-IAPs through a TRAF2-TRAF3 bridge where TRAF2 recruits c-IAP1/2 and TRAF3 binds to NIK. However, it is not clear how the c-IAPs specifically recognize and ubiquitylate NIK in the complex. We have identified an IAP-binding motif (IBM) at the amino terminus of NIK. IBMs are utilized by a number of proapoptotic proteins to antagonize IAP function. Here, we utilize mutational studies to demonstrate that wild-type NIK is destabilized in the presence of c-IAP1, whereas the NIK IBM mutant is stable. NIK interacts with the second baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR2) domain of c-IAP1 via the IBM, and this interaction, in turn, provides substrate recognition for c-IAP1 mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of NIK. Furthermore, in the presence of the NIK IBM mutant, we observed an elevated processing of p100 to p52 followed by increased expression of NF-κB target genes. Together, these findings reveal the novel identification and function of the NIK IBM, which promotes c-IAP1-dependent ubiquitylation of NIK, resulting in optimal NIK turnover to ensure that noncanonical NF-κB signaling is off in the absence of an activating signal.

Recently, environmental bacteria have become established as important both as sources of antibiotic resistance genes and in disseminating resistance genes. Low levels of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are regularly released into water environments via wastewater, and the concern is that such environmental contamination may serve to create hotspots for antibiotic resistance gene selection and dissemination. In this study, microcosms were created from water and sediments gathered from a lake in Sweden only lightly affected by human activities. The microcosms were exposed to a mixture of antibiotics of varying environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e., concentrations commonly encountered in wastewaters) in order to investigate the effect of low levels of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance gene abundances and dynamics in a previously uncontaminated environment. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Abundances of seven antibiotic resistance genes and the class 1 integron integrase gene, intI1, were quantified using real-time PCR. Resistance genes sulI and ermB were quantified in the microcosm sediments with mean abundances 5 and 15 gene copies/10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies, respectively. Class 1 integrons were determined in the sediments with a mean concentration of 3.8 × 10(4) copies/106 16S rRNA gene copies.

Materials and Methods Original CT scan data (100 mAs, 80 mAs, 60 mAs, 40 mAs, 20 mAs, 10 mAs; 100 kV) of a swine were acquired (approved by the regional governmental commission for animal protection). Simulations of CT acquisition with a lower dose (simulated 10–80 mAs) were calculated using a low-dose simulation algorithm. The simulations were compared to the originals of the same dose level with regard to density values and image noise. Four radiologists assessed the realistic visual appearance of the simulated images. Results Image characteristics of simulated low dose scans were similar to the originals. Mean overall discrepancy of image noise and CT values was −1.2% (range −9% to 3.2%) and −0.2% (range −8.2% to 3.2%), respectively, p>0.05. Confidence intervals of discrepancies ranged between 0.9–10.2 HU (noise) and 1.9–13.4 HU (CT values), without significant differences (p>0.05). Subjective observer evaluation of image appearance showed no visually detectable difference.

The underlying pathogenic molecular changes in this disease are poorly understood. Earlier studies reported oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunctions and accelerated death of stromal keratocytes in keratoconus (KC) patients. Utilizing mass spectrometry we found reduced stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in KC, suggesting ECM-regulatory changes that may be due to altered TGFβ signals. Here we investigated properties of stromal cells from donor (DN) and KC corneas grown as fibroblasts in serum containing DMEM: F12 or in serum-free medium containing insulin, transferrin, selenium (ITS). Phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 of the canonical TGFβ pathway, was high in serum-starved DN and KC fibroblast protein extracts, but pSMAD1/5/8 low at base line, was induced within 30 minutes of TGFβ1 stimulation, more so in KC than DN, suggesting a novel TGFβ1-SMAD1/5/8 axis in the cornea, that may be altered in KC. The serine/threonine kinases AKT, known to regulate proliferation, survival and biosynthetic activities of cells, were poorly activated in KC fibroblasts in high glucose media. Concordantly, alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1), an indicator of increased glucose uptake and metabolism, was reduced in KC compared to DN fibroblasts. By contrast, in low glucose (5.5 mM, normoglycemic) serum-free DMEM and ITS, cell survival and pAKT levels were comparable in KC and DN cells. Therefore, high glucose combined with serum-deprivation presents some cellular stress difficult to overcome by the KC stromal cells. Our study provides molecular insights into AKT and TGFβ signal changes in KC, and a mechanism for functional studies of stromal cells from KC corneas."
https://openalex.org/W2046925079,"In carcinogenesis, inflammasomes may play contradictory roles through facilitating anti-tumor immunity or inducing oncogenic factors. Their function in cancer remains poorly characterized. In this study, we explored the effect of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) on the migration and invasion activity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines and account for related mechanisms. Our results revealed that exogenous IL-17A promoted cell migration and invasion significantly in both NPC-039 and CNE-2Z cell lines. In addition, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)/-9 and Vimentin could be elevated by IL-17A stimulation; meanwhile the expression of E-cadherin was decreased. The results also show that IL-17A could activate the p38 signaling pathway in IL-17A-stimulated NPC-039 and CNE-2Z cell lines. Combining treatment with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) resulted in decreased invasion capabilities of NPC-039 and CNE-2Z cell lines. SB203580 also inhibited the expression of MMP-2/-9 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in IL-17A-stimulated NPC-039 and CNE-2Z cell lines. IL-17A also could activate NF-κB in NPC-039 and CNE-2Z cell lines. In summary, our data show that IL-17A promote the cell migration and invasion of NPC cells. The effect of IL-17A on cell migration and invasion may be mediated via regulation of the expression of MMP-2/-9 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via p38-NF-κB signaling pathway. Thus, IL-17A or its related signaling pathways may be a promising target for preventing and inhibiting NPC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2171129793,"Loss of the chromatin remodeling ATPase CHD5 has been linked to the progression of neuroblastoma tumors, yet the underlying mechanisms behind the tumor suppressor role of CHD5 are unknown. In this study, we purified the human CHD5 complex and found that CHD5 is a component of the full NuRD transcriptional repressor complex, which also contains methyl-CpG binding proteins and histone deacetylases. The CHD5/NuRD complex appears mutually exclusive with the related CHD4/NuRD complex as overexpression of CHD5 results in loss of the CHD4 protein in cells. Following a search for genes that are regulated by CHD5 in neuroblastoma cells, we found that CHD5 binds to and represses the G2/M checkpoint gene WEE1. Reintroduction of CHD5 into neuroblastoma cells represses WEE1 expression, demonstrating that CHD5 can function as a repressor in cells. A catalytically inactive mutant version of CHD5 is able to associate with a NuRD cofactor but fails to repress transcription. Our study shows that CHD5 is a NuRD-associated transcriptional repressor and identifies WEE1 as one of the CHD5-regulated genes that may link CHD5 to tumor suppression."

In both cases it seems illogical for the weaker side to persist in the conflict if it will eventually lose. In the case of animal contests analyses of the links between opponent power and contest duration have provided insights into what sources of information are available to fighting animals. I outline the theory of information use during animal contests and describe a statistical framework that has been used to distinguish between two strategies that individuals use to decide whether to persist or quit. I then apply this framework to the analysis of interstate wars. War duration increases with the power of winners and losers. These patterns provide no support for the idea that wars are settled on the basis of mutual assessment of capabilities but indicate that settlement is based on attrition. In contrast to most animal contests, war duration is as closely linked to the power of the winning side as to that of the losing side. Overall, this analysis highlights a number of similarities between animal contests and interstate war, indicating that both could be investigated using similar conceptual frameworks."

Our 2.05 Å structure of BdcA shows that it is a member of the NAD(P)(H)-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Structural comparisons with other members of the SDR family suggested that BdcA binds NADP(H). This was demonstrated experimentally using thermal denaturation studies, which showed that BcdA binds specifically to NADPH. Subsequent ITC experiments further confirmed this result and reported a Kd of 25.9 µM.

We analyzed the genetic diversity and levels of expression of fHbp among 268 carriage strains and compare them to those of 467 invasive strains. fhbp gene sequencing showed higher proportions of variants 2 and 3 among carriage isolates (p<0.0001). Carriage isolates expressed lower levels of fHbp (p<0.01) but that remain high enough to predict targeting by antibodies against fHbp particularly in group B isolates belonging to the frequent hypervirulent clonal complexes in Europe and North America (cc32, cc41/44, cc269).

In the presence of a bundling component, actin bundles that grow from the surface of WT-VASP-coated beads induced movement of the beads. VASP promotes actin-based movement alone, in the absence of other actin nucleators. We propose that at physiological salt conditions VASP nucleation activity is too weak to promote motility and bundle formation.

Being released from Escherichia coli, it contains mainly heme b, which can be autocatalytically modified and covalently bound to the protein by incubation with hydrogen peroxide. In the present study, we investigated the reactivity of these two forms in their ferric, compound I and compound II state in a multi-mixing stopped-flow study. Upon heme modification, the reactions between the ferric proteins with cyanide or H2O2 were accelerated.

We conducted a field experiment within six replicate natural intermittent pool beds to explore macroinvertebrate community dynamics during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitat and during the terrestrial phase. We monitored and compared macroinvertebrate communities within leaf packs that i) remained wet, ii) underwent drying (i.e., started wet and then dried), and iii) remained dry. Our results show that i) a diverse macroinvertebrate community inhabits all phases of intermittent pool beds, ii) pool drying involves colonization by an assemblage of macroinvertebrates not recorded in permanently terrestrial leaf packs, iii) the community within dried leaf packs remains distinct from that of permanently terrestrial leaf packs for an extended period following drying (possibly until subsequent refilling), and iv) there are likely to be strong spatial and temporal resource linkages between the aquatic and terrestrial communities.

https://openalex.org/W2015353338,"The tumor suppressor, p53, negatively regulates cell migration and invasion in addition to its role in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and senescence. Here, we study the roles of p53 in PDGF-induced circular dorsal ruffle (CDR) formation in rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. In primary and immortalized RASM cells, up-regulation of p53 expression or increase in activity with doxorubicin inhibits CDR formation. In contrast, shRNA-knockdown of p53 or inhibition of its activity with pifithrin α promotes CDR formation. p53 acts by up-regulating PTEN expression, which antagonizes Rac and Cdc42 activation. Both lipid and protein phosphatase activities of PTEN are required for maximal suppression of CDR, but the lipid activity clearly plays the dominant role. N-WASP, the downstream effector of Cdc42, is the major positive contributor to CDR formation in RASM, and is an indirect target of p53. The Rac effector, WAVE2, appears to also play a minor role, while WAVE1 has no significant effect in CDR formation. In sum, we propose that p53 suppresses PDGF-induced CDR formation in RASM cells by upregulating PTEN leading mainly to the inhibition of the Cdc42-N-WASP pathway."

During embryogenesis, a set of cells, the Adult Muscle Precursors (AMPs), are specified. These cells will become proliferating myoblasts during the larval stages which will then give rise to the adult IFMs. Although the cellular aspect of this developmental process is well studied, the molecular biology behind the different stages is still under investigation. In particular, the interactions required during the transition from proliferating myoblasts to differentiated myoblasts ready to fuse to the muscle fiber. It has been previously shown that the Notch pathway is active in proliferating myoblasts, and that this pathway is inhibited in developing muscle fibers. Furthermore, the Myocyte Enhancing Factor 2 (Mef2), Vestigial (Vg) and Scalloped (Sd) transcription factors are necessary for IFM development and that Vg is required for Notch pathway repression in differentiating fibers. Here we examine the interactions between Notch and Mef2 and mechanisms by which the Notch pathway is inhibited during differentiation. We show that Mef2 is capable of inhibiting the Notch pathway in non myogenic cells. A previous screen for Mef2 potential targets identified Delta a component of the Notch pathway. Dl is expressed in Mef2 and Sd-positive developing fibers. Our results show that Mef2 and possibly Sd regulate a Dl enhancer specifically expressed in the developing IFMs and that Mef2 is required for Dl expression in developing IFMs."
https://openalex.org/W1965089376,"Background There was lack of evidence for familial aggregation in onset age of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese population. We conducted a population-based case-control family study to examine familial correlation of age of HCC onset in Taixing, China. Methods A total of 202 cases and 202 matched controls as well as their relatives were included in the study. Lifetime cumulative risks of HCC were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Cross ratios (CRs) were obtained from stratified Cox proportional hazard models, to assess the familial correlation of onset age. Results The mean age of HCC onset was decreased as increasing number of HCC cases in a family. The onset age was the earliest for first-degree relatives, intermediate for second-degree relatives, and latest for non-blood relatives (spouse) (log-rank test, P<0.01). The onset age was significantly correlated between probands and their relatives. In stratified Cox proportional hazard models, the CRs for the probands versus their fathers, mothers, siblings and uncles/aunts were 6.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.84–21.25), 9.81 (95% CI: 1.24–77.56), 6.22 (95% CI: 1.37–28.36) and 3.24 (95% CI: 1.26–8.33), respectively. After adjustment for hepatitis B virus infection, the CRs remained significant. Conclusion This current study suggested a significant correlation of onset age for HCC among blood relatives. Familial HCC cases yielded earlier age of onset and their relatives have higher HCC risk in early age, highlighting intensive surveillance should be start at an earlier age for individuals with family history of HCC."

Here we explore the importance of long helix M2 and its junction with the A domain by disrupting the helix structure and elongating with insertions of five glycine residues. Insertions into the membrane region of M2 and the top junctional segment impair Ca(2+) transport despite reasonable ATPase activity, indicating that they are uncoupled. These mutants fail to occlude Ca(2+). Those at the top segment also exhibited accelerated phosphoenzyme isomerization E1P → E2P. Insertions into the middle of M2 markedly accelerate E2P hydrolysis and cause strong resistance to inhibition by luminal Ca(2+). Insertions along almost the entire M2 region inhibit the dephosphorylated enzyme transition E2 → E1. The results pinpoint which parts of M2 control cytoplasm gating and which are critical for luminal gating at each stage in the transport cycle and suggest that proper gate function requires appropriate interactions, tension, and/or rigidity in the M2 region at appropriate times for coupling with A domain movements and catalysis."

Here we investigated whether pairing desirable food with errors could decrease impulsive choice during hypothetical temporal decisions about food. To this end, healthy women performed a Stop-signal task in which one food cue predicted high-error rate, and another food cue predicted low-error rate. Afterwards, we measured participants' intertemporal preferences during decisions between smaller-immediate and larger-delayed amounts of food. We expected reduced sensitivity to smaller-immediate amounts of food associated with high-error rate. Moreover, taking into account that deprivational states affect sensitivity for food, we controlled for participants' hunger. Results showed that pairing food with high-error likelihood decreased temporal discounting. This effect was modulated by hunger, indicating that, the lower the hunger level, the more participants showed reduced impulsive preference for the food previously associated with a high number of errors as compared with the other food. These findings reveal that errors, which are motivationally salient events that recruit cognitive control and drive avoidance learning against error-prone behavior, are effective in reducing impulsive choice for edible outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1988650746,"The biological interaction between copper and iron is best exemplified by the decreased activity of multicopper ferroxidases under conditions of copper deficiency that limits the availability of iron for erythropoiesis. However, little is known about how copper deficiency affects iron homeostasis through alteration of the activity of other copper-containing proteins, not directly connected with iron metabolism, such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). This antioxidant enzyme scavenges the superoxide anion, a reactive oxygen species contributing to the toxicity of iron via the Fenton reaction. Here, we analyzed changes in the systemic iron metabolism using an animal model of Menkes disease: copper-deficient mosaic mutant mice with dysfunction of the ATP7A copper transporter. We found that the erythrocytes of these mutants are copper-deficient, display decreased SOD1 activity/expression and have cell membrane abnormalities. In consequence, the mosaic mice show evidence of haemolysis accompanied by haptoglobin-dependent elimination of haemoglobin (Hb) from the circulation, as well as the induction of haem oxygenase 1 (HO1) in the liver and kidney. Moreover, the hepcidin-ferroportin regulatory axis is strongly affected in mosaic mice. These findings indicate that haemolysis is an additional pathogenic factor in a mouse model of Menkes diseases and provides evidence of a new indirect connection between copper deficiency and iron metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2047639698,"Spirometry should follow strict quality criteria. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends the use of a noseclip; however there are controversies about its need. ATS also indicates that tests should be done in the sitting position, but there are no recommendations neither about position of the upper limbs and lower limbs nor about who should hold the mouthpiece while performing the maneuvers: evaluated subject or evaluator.To compare noseclip use or not, different upper and lower limbs positions and who holds the mouthpiece, verifying if these technical details affect spirometric results in healthy adults.One hundred and three healthy individuals (41 men; age: 47 [33-58] years; normal lung function: FEV₁/FVC = 83±5, FEV₁ = 94 [88-104]%predicted, FVC = 92 [84-102]%predicted) underwent a protocol consisting of four spirometric comparative analysis in the sitting position: 1) maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) with vs without noseclip; 2) FVC performed with vs without upper limbs support; 3) FVC performed with lower limbs crossed vs lower limbs in neutral position; 4) FVC, slow vital capacity and MVV comparing the evaluated subject holding the mouthpiece vs evaluator holding it.Different spirometric variables presented statistically significant difference (p<0.05) when analysing the four comparisons; however, none of them showed any variation larger than those considered as acceptable according to the ATS reproducibility criteria.There was no relevant variation in spirometric results when analyzing technical details such as noseclip use during MVV, upper and lower limb positions and who holds the mouthpiece when performing the tests in healthy adults."
https://openalex.org/W1980898584,"Current family-based association tests for sequencing data were mainly developed for identifying rare variants associated with a complex disease. As the disease can be influenced by the joint effects of common and rare variants, common variants with modest effects may not be identified by the methods focusing on rare variants. Moreover, variants can have risk, neutral, or protective effects. Association tests that can effectively select groups of common and rare variants that are likely to be causal and consider the directions of effects have become important. We developed the Ordered Subset - Variable Threshold - Pedigree Disequilibrium Test (OVPDT), a combination of three algorithms, for association analysis in family sequencing data. The ordered subset algorithm is used to select a subset of common variants based on their relative risks, calculated using only parental mating types. The variable threshold algorithm is used to search for an optimal allele frequency threshold such that rare variants below the threshold are more likely to be causal. The PDT statistics from both rare and common variants selected by the two algorithms are combined as the OVPDT statistic. A permutation procedure is used in OVPDT to calculate the p-value. We used simulations to demonstrate that OVPDT has the correct type I error rates under different scenarios and compared the power of OVPDT with two other family-based association tests. The results suggested that OVPDT can have more power than the other tests if both common and rare variants have effects on the disease in a region."
https://openalex.org/W2004341613,"Tree-ring datasets are used in a variety of circumstances, including archeology, climatology, forest ecology, and wood technology. These data are based on microdensity profiles and consist of a set of tree-ring descriptors, such as ring width or early/latewood density, measured for a set of individual trees. Because successive rings correspond to successive years, the resulting dataset is a ring variables × trees × time datacube. Multivariate statistical analyses, such as principal component analysis, have been widely used for extracting worthwhile information from ring datasets, but they typically address two-way matrices, such as ring variables × trees or ring variables × time. Here, we explore the potential of the partial triadic analysis (PTA), a multivariate method dedicated to the analysis of three-way datasets, to apprehend the space-time structure of tree-ring datasets. We analyzed a set of 11 tree-ring descriptors measured in 149 georeferenced individuals of European larch (Larix decidua Miller) during the period of 1967-2007. The processing of densitometry profiles led to a set of ring descriptors for each tree and for each year from 1967-2007. The resulting three-way data table was subjected to two distinct analyses in order to explore i) the temporal evolution of spatial structures and ii) the spatial structure of temporal dynamics. We report the presence of a spatial structure common to the different years, highlighting the inter-individual variability of the ring descriptors at the stand scale. We found a temporal trajectory common to the trees that could be separated into a high and low frequency signal, corresponding to inter-annual variations possibly related to defoliation events and a long-term trend possibly related to climate change. We conclude that PTA is a powerful tool to unravel and hierarchize the different sources of variation within tree-ring datasets."
https://openalex.org/W1975112859,"Myostatin functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth by suppressing proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. Dysfunction of the myostatin gene, either due to natural mutation or genetic manipulations such as knockout or knockdown, has been reported to increase muscle mass in mammalian species. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) is a promising method for gene knockdown studies. In the present study, transient and stable silencing of the myostatin gene in caprine fetal fibroblasts (CFF) was evaluated using the two most effective constructs selected from four different miRNA expression constructs screened in 293FT cells. Using these two miRNA constructs, we achieved up to 84% silencing of myostatin mRNA in transiently transfected CFF cells and up to 31% silencing in stably transfected CFF cells. Moreover, off-target effects due to induction of interferon (IFN) response genes, such as interferon beta (IFN-β) and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), were markedly fewer in stably transfected CFF cells than in transiently transfected cells. Stable expression of anti-myostatin miRNA with minimal induction of interferon shows great promise for increasing muscle mass in transgenic goats."
https://openalex.org/W1983477808,"Separase is a protease that promotes chromosome segregation at anaphase by cleaving cohesin. Several non-proteolytic functions of separase have been identified in other organisms. We created a transgenic C. elegans line that expresses protease-dead separase in embryos to further characterize separase function. We find that expression of protease-dead separase is dominant-negative in C. elegans embryos, not previously reported in other systems. The C. elegans embryo is an ideal system to study developmental processes in a genetically tractable system. However, a major limitation is the lack of an inducible gene expression system for the embryo. We have developed two methods that allow for the propagation of lines carrying dominant-negative transgenes and have applied them to characterize expression of protease-dead separase in embryos. Using these methods, we show that protease-dead separase causes embryo lethality, and that protease-dead separase cannot rescue separase mutants. These data suggest that protease-dead separase interferes with endogenous separase function, possibly by binding substrates and protecting them from cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2023174760,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major clinical form of inflammatory bowel disease. UC is characterized by mucosal inflammation limited to the colon, always involving the rectum and a variable extent of the more proximal colon in a continuous manner. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes may influence the extent of repair functions, DNA damage, and thus the manifestations of UC. This study thus evaluated the role of polymorphisms of the genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms. A total of 171 patients and 213 controls were included. Genotyping was carried out by ARMS PCR and PCR-RFLP analyses for RAD51, XRCC3 and hMSH2 gene polymorphisms. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were computed in both control & patient groups and data was analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. The frequency of ‘A’ allele of hMSH2 in the UC group caused statistically significant increased risk for UC compared to controls (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.16–2.31, p = 0.004). Similarly, the CT genotype of XRCC3 gene was predominant in the UC group and increased the risk for UC by 1.75 fold compared to controls (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.15–2.67, p = 0.03), further confirming the risk of ‘T’ allele in UC. The GC genotype frequency of RAD51 gene was significantly increased (p = 0.02) in the UC group (50.3%) compared to controls (38%). The GC genotype significantly increased the risk for UC compared to GG genotype by 1.73 fold (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14–2.62, p = 0.02) confirming the strong association of ‘C’ allele with UC. Among the controls, the SNP loci combination of hMSH2:XRCC3 were in perfect linkage. The GTC and ACC haplotypes were found to be predominant in UC than controls with a 2.28 and 2.93 fold significant increase risk of UC."
https://openalex.org/W2011953071,"Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) cleave phosphodiester bonds in cyclic nucleotides and play diverse roles in cell biology. PDE5A is a cytoplasmic phosphodiesterase which specifically degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a cell signaling molecule that plays important roles in neuronal signaling and vascular smooth muscle contraction. Inhibition of PDE5A induces headache resembling migraine headaches.To test the hypothesis that Ser102 and Ser104 in PDE5A and/or their phosphoserine derivatives 1) regulate the intracellular localization and/or activity of PDE5A, and 2) modulate the interaction between PDE5A and pharmaceutical reagents in clinical or pre-clinical use for migraine headaches and other types of vascular dysfunction.Wild type PDE5A or PDE5A with substitution mutations (Ser102Ala, Ser104Ala or Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala) were overexpressed in SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells as C-terminal fusions with green fluorescent protein. Transfected cells were treated with sildenafil, cilostazol, glyceryl trinitrate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or sumatriptan. PDE5A-GFP fusion proteins were localized in fixed cells by immunofluorescence and PDE activity was quantified in cell extracts by standard in vitro assay using [3H] cGMP.The intracellular distribution of wild-type, single and double mutant PDE5A was similar and was not altered by exposure to sildenafil, cilostazol, glyceryl trinitrate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or sumatriptan. PDE5 activity was similar for wild type, Ser102Ala and Ser104Ala PDE5A, but activity of the Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala mutant was approximately two-fold higher than wild type. Double mutant Ser102Ala/Ser104Ala migrated as a single band on a native acrylamide gel, while wild-type and single mutant PDE5A migrated as a doublet.Ser102 and Ser104 may influence the conformational flexibility of PDE5A, which may in turn influence phosphorylation status, allosteric regulation by cGMP or other as yet unknown regulatory mechanisms for PDE5A. PDE5A activation could be important in reversal of migraine-like headache."
