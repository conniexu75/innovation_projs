Satellite observations of this emission at long radio wavelengths provide a means of investigating properties of the interplanetary medium, including the gross magnetic field configuration over distances of 1 astronomical unit. Results of such observations are illustrated."
https://openalex.org/W1996843906,"The reflection spectrum for the integral disk of the planet Mercury was measured and was found to have a constant positive slope from 0.32 to 1.05 micrometers, except for absorption features in the infrared. The reflectivity curve matches closely the curve for the lunar upland and mare regions. Thus, the surface of Mercury is probably covered with a lunar-like soil rich in dark glasses of high iron and titanium content. Pyroxene is probably the dominant mafic mineral."
https://openalex.org/W2043675338,"Thorium-230 measurements on a core of globigerina ooze from the Caribbean Sea substantiate the prediction of Ericson et al. that the paleontological boundary U-V (Sangamon-Illinoian boundary in their scheme) in the Atlantic sediments has an age of close to 320,000 years. As the ages derived by Ericson et al. were based on extrapolations of mean sedimentation rates established by carbon-14 and protactinium-231 dating of the upper sections of this and other cores, this result confirms the assumption that sedimentation rates in the Caribbean Sea have not changed significantly during the past several hundred thousand years. The uranium content of the ocean as indicated by the deposition rate of thorium-230 was no more than 30 percent higher during glacial than during interglacial periods."
https://openalex.org/W1999109566,"The effects of auxin on the inhibition of lateral buds in decapitated bean plants are enhanced if kinetin is applied together with auxin. The uptake of (14)C-indoleacetic acid by the stumps of decapitated plants is increased in the presence of kinetin and leads to extensive transport of (14)C-indoleacetic acid in the stems. The increased bud inhibition resulting when auxin and kinetin are applied together may be due to greater amounts of auxin reaching the buds, but an alternative explanation is that metabolites are directed from the buds to the point of hormone application."
https://openalex.org/W2032823463,"A specimen of tabashir, a variety of opal found in bamboo, contained more water but smaller amounts of alkalis and alkaline earths than most opals. It consisted of particles of about 100 angstroms in diameter, linked together in clumps, which appeared in fractured surfaces as irregularities. The tabashir was amorphous, but its microstructure differed from that of silicagel and amorphous opal of inorganic origin."

https://openalex.org/W1966104097,"The first time-resolved spectrum of a return stroke between the cloud and ground has been obtained with a slitless spectrograph. The time for luminosity to rise from zero to its peak in a section of the channel is 10 microseconds or less, and the intense emission lines are attributed to singly ionized nitrogen atoms. Several faint lines persisting for approximately 150 microseconds are due to neutral nitrogen and oxygen atoms."
https://openalex.org/W1977431860,"A realistic model involving mutual gravitation and tidal dissipation for the first time provides a detailed explanation for satellite orbit-orbit resonance capture. Although applying directly only to Saturn's satellites Titan and Hyperion, the model reveals general principles of resonance capture, evolution, and stability which seem applicable to other orbit-orbit resonances in the solar system."

There was no significant variation with phase."

I am indebted to KÃ¡roly Balogh for reminding me that Gottwald was Ulbricht's Czech counterpart."
