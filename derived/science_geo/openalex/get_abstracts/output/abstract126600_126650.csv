https://openalex.org/W1980803266,"A new type of inhalation aerosol, characterized by particles of small mass density and large size, permitted the highly efficient delivery of inhaled therapeutics into the systemic circulation. Particles with mass densities less than 0.4 gram per cubic centimeter and mean diameters exceeding 5 micrometers were inspired deep into the lungs and escaped the lungs' natural clearance mechanisms until the inhaled particles delivered their therapeutic payload. Inhalation of large porous insulin particles resulted in elevated systemic levels of insulin and suppressed systemic glucose levels for 96 hours, whereas small nonporous insulin particles had this effect for only 4 hours. High systemic bioavailability of testosterone was also achieved by inhalation delivery of porous particles with a mean diameter (20 micrometers) approximately 10 times that of conventional inhaled therapeutic particles."
https://openalex.org/W2092321617,"The plant hormone auxin regulates plant physiology by modulating the interaction of transcription factors with auxin response elements (AuxREs) of the affected genes. A transcription factor, Auxin Response Factor 1 (ARF1), that binds to the sequence TGTCTC in AuxREs was cloned from Arabidopsis by using a yeast one-hybrid system. ARF1 has an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain related to the carboxyl terminus of the maize transactivator Viviparous-1. Sequence requirements for ARF1 binding in vitro are identical to those that confer auxin responsiveness in vivo. The carboxyl terminus of ARF1 contains two motifs found in the Aux/IAA class of proteins and appears to mediate protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2042478939,"The plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA) is formed by the oxidative cleavage of an epoxy-carotenoid. The synthesis of other apocarotenoids, such as vitamin A in animals, may occur by a similar mechanism. In ABA biosynthesis, oxidative cleavage is the first committed reaction and is believed to be the key regulatory step. A new ABA-deficient mutant of maize has been identified and the corresponding gene, Vp14 , has been cloned. The recombinant VP14 protein catalyzes the cleavage of 9- cis -epoxy-carotenoids to form C 25 apo-aldehydes and xanthoxin, a precursor of ABA in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2004319639,"The source of increasing viremia that characterizes the latter stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has remained a paradox because it occurs at a time when lymphoid tissue is quantitatively and qualitatively impaired, and the patients' CD4 T lymphocytes are steadily declining. Here, macrophages, both infected and uninfected with common opportunistic pathogens of HIV disease such as Mycobacterium avium complex and Pneumocystis carinii, were identified as highly productive sources of HIV in coinfected lymph nodes. These observations indicate that tissue macrophages are not only infected with HIV, but that common pathogens of HIV disease can dramatically increase their production of virus. Thus, prevention or successful treatment of opportunistic coinfections, or both, potentially benefits the patient twofold by limiting the pathology caused by opportunistic infection and by controlling induction of HIV replication."

In addition the virus was detected in the bone marrow dendritic cells from two out of eight patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a precursor to myeloma. Viral interleukin-6, the human homolog of which is a growth factor for myeloma, was found to be transcribed in the myeloma bone marrow dendritic cells. KSHV may be required for transformation from MGUS to myeloma and perpetuate the growth of malignant plasma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067121396,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family has recently been expanded by the isolation of two additional growth factors, VEGF-B and VEGF-C. Here we compare the regulation of steady-state levels of VEGF, VEGF-B and VEGF-C mRNAs in cultured cells by a variety of stimuli implicated in angiogenesis and endothelial cell physiology. Hypoxia, Ras oncoprotein and mutant p53 tumor suppressor, which are potent inducers of VEGF mRNA did not increase VEGF-B or VEGF-C mRNA levels. Serum and its component growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and the tumor promoter phorbol myristate 12,13-acetate (PMA) stimulated VEGF-C, but not VEGF-B mRNA expression. Interestingly, these growth factors and hypoxia simultaneously downregulated the mRNA of another endothelial cell specific ligand, angiopoietin-1. Serum induction of VEGF-C mRNA occurred independently of protein synthesis; with an increase of the mRNA half-life from 3.5 h to 5.5-6 h, whereas VEGF-B mRNA was very stable (T 1/2>8 h). Our results reveal that the three VEGF genes are regulated in a strikingly different manner, suggesting that they serve distinct, although perhaps overlapping functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2056270776,"The avian sarcoma virus 16 (ASV 16) is a retrovirus that induces hemangiosarcomas in chickens. Analysis of the ASV 16 genome revealed that it encodes an oncogene that is derived from the cellular gene for the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). The gene is referred to as v- p3k , and like its cellular counterpart c- p3k , it is a potent transforming gene in cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). The products of the viral and cellular p3k genes have PI 3-kinase activity. CEFs transformed with either gene showed elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and activation of Akt kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2013313335,"Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), a potent antimicrobial protein of 456 residues, binds to and neutralizes lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. At a resolution of 2.4 angstroms, the crystal structure of human BPI shows a boomerang-shaped molecule formed by two similar domains. Two apolar pockets on the concave surface of the boomerang each bind a molecule of phosphatidylcholine, primarily by interacting with their acyl chains; this suggests that the pockets may also bind the acyl chains of lipopolysaccharide. As a model for the related plasma lipid transfer proteins, BPI illuminates a mechanism of lipid transfer for this protein family."

Like CCR5, US28 allowed infection of CD4-positive human cell lines by primary isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2, as well as fusion of these cell lines with cells expressing the viral envelope proteins. In addition, US28 mediated infection by cell line–adapted HIV-1 for which CXCR4 was an entry cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W2072013487,"We report the cloning of a human homolog of the yeast OGG1 gene, which encodes a DNA glycosylase that excises an oxidatively damaged form of guanine, 8-hydroxyguanine (also known as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine). Since the deduced amino acid sequence (68 amino acids) of a human expressed sequence tag, N55394, matched a short stretch of yeast OGG1 protein with greater than 40% amino acid identity, a full length cDNA clone was isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library with the N55394 clone as a probe. The cDNA clone encodes a predicted protein of 345 amino acids which is homologous to yeast OGG1 protein throughout the entire polypeptide sequence and shares 38% amino acid identity with yeast OGG1 protein. Moreover, we found that both a human homolog and yeast OGG1 protein possess two distinct DNA binding motifs, a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif and a C2H2 zinc finger like motif, and a domain homologous to human and E. coli MutY proteins. Expression of a human homolog suppressed spontaneous mutagenesis of an E. coli (mutM mutY) mutant as in the case of yeast OGG1 protein. The gene was ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human organs and mapped to chromosome 3p26.2. These results strongly suggest that the gene isolated here is a human counterpart of the yeast OGGI gene and is involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W2330995965,"Induction of the Myc-oestrogen receptor fusion protein (MycER) by 4-OH-tamoxifen (OHT) leads to the activation of Cyclin E/Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CycE/Cdk2) complexes followed by the induction of DNA synthesis. As CycE/Cdk2 activity is essential for G1/S transition, we have investigated the mechanism by which Myc can activiate CycE/Cdk2. Our results suggest that this activation may involve at least two Myc-dependent steps: the induction of cyclin E gene transcription followed by accumulation of cyclin E mRNA in a protein synthesis-independent manner and the inhibition of p27(Kip1) association with CycE/Cdk2 complexes containing newly synthesised CycE. As a consequence phosphorylation of CycE-bound Cdk2 by cyclin activating kinase (CAK) is accelerated. We propose a model in which the active newly synthesised CycE/Cdk2 complexes trigger a positive feed-back mechanism to activate preexisting complexes through phosphorylation-dependent p27(Kip1) release."
https://openalex.org/W2312862539,"The death of small intestinal epithelial cells has been characterized and quantitated after irradiation of mice rendered homozygously null for the p53 gene. In wild-type animals homozygous for p53 a rapid (4.5 h) elevation of p53 protein was observed in the proliferative compartment of the crypts after 8 Gy of irradiation. Cells underwent cell death by apoptosis in this region. We had reported previously a total repression of apoptosis in small intestinal crypt epithelia 4.5 h after the γ-irradiation (8 Gy) of p53 homozygously null animals. Thus, while 400 apoptotic cells were observed in 200 half crypts taken from wild-type animals at 4.5 h, this fell to background levels (10 – 30) in the p53 null animals (Merritt et al., 1994) and did not increase by 12 h. However, we have now found a delayed initiation of a p53-independent apoptosis after 8 Gy of γ-radiation: at 24 h, approximately 100 apoptotic cells were observed in 200 half crypts. This late wave of apoptosis was not observed after 1 Gy of γ-radiation. The morphological appearance of this p53-independent apoptosis suggested that death may have arisen as the result of aberrant mitosis. Analysis of the regeneration of crypts 3 days after irradiation of mice with between 11 and 17 Gy showed that there was no significant increase (P=0.135) in the potential of clonogenic cells from the p53 null animals to repopulate the crypts. The data support the idea that a p53-independent apoptotic mechanism permits the engagement of apoptosis, probably by a mitotic catastrophe, after 8 Gy of γ-irradiation in vivo and that a loss of p53 does not make these epithelial cells radioresistant in vivo to doses of 8 Gy and above. In contrast, irradiation with 1 Gy failed to induce a p53-independent apoptosis in vivo, suggesting that the p53 `sensor' of damage was more sensitive than that engaging the p53-independent mechanism of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2088713359,"A leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) allows rapid export of proteins from cell nuclei. Microinjection studies revealed a role for the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran in NES-mediated export. Nuclear injection of a Ran mutant (Thr 24 → Asn) blocked protein export but not import, whereas depletion of the Ran nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 blocked protein import but not export. However, injection of Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) into RCC1-depleted cell nuclei inhibited export. Coinjection with Ran mutants insensitive to RanGAP prevented this inhibition. Therefore, NES-mediated protein export appears to require a Ran-GTP complex but does not require Ran-dependent GTP hydrolysis."

The matrix protein (M protein) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was shown to block transport of RNAs and proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm of Xenopus laevis oocytes. The pattern of inhibition indicated that M protein interfered with transport that is dependent on the ra s-like n uclear guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran-TC4 and its associated factors. This inhibition of nuclear transport by M protein explains several observations about the effects of VSV infection on host cell gene expression and suggests that RNA export is closely coupled to protein import."

https://openalex.org/W2318613091,"Activation of helper T cells results in coordinate expression of a number of cytokines involved in differentiation, proliferation and activation of the haematopoietic system. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is one such cytokine, whose increased expression results mostly from increases in transcription. Cis-acting elements with NFkappaB, AP1 and ETS-like binding motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the GM-CSF gene, and are important or essential for transcriptional activity following T cell activation. ETS1 is a transcription factor of the ETS family that is expressed in T cells. We have previously shown that ETS1 can transactivate GM-CSF in Jurkat T cells, but only after the cells have been stimulated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin, agents that mimic T cell activation. Thus we proposed that ETS1, which is expressed constitutively in Jurkat cells, may act in concert with PMA/ionomycin inducible factors. Here we show that ETS1 can transactivate a GM-CSF reporter construct in unstimulated Jurkat cells, providing that either NFkappaB or AP1 transcription factors are supplied by co-transfection. We confirm that binding of endogenous NFkappaB and AP1 is induced following PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells. Transactivation by ETS1, NFkappaB and AP1 is synergistic, and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are interdependent. Our results suggest that constitutive ETS1, and inducible NFkappaB and AP1, cooperate as part of a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells."

Activation of these receptors also induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Formation of IP3 in response to stimulated receptors that couple to Gq/11 was blocked by protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These inhibitors appeared to act before activation of Gq/11. Moreover, stimulation of receptors coupled to Gq/11 induced phosphorylation on a tyrosine residue (Tyr356) of the Galphaq/11 subunit, and this tyrosine phosphorylation event was essential for Gq/11 activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Galphaq/11 induced changes in its interaction with receptors. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Galphaq/11 appears to regulate the activation of Gq/11 protein."

Periodontitis is an infectious disease associated with a loss of connective tissue, resorption of alveolar bone, and formation of periodontal pockets.

However, besides its central role in hemostasis, this proteinase is also a potent stimulator of prostaglandin synthesis in osteoblasts (12Partridge N.C. Hillyard C.J. Nolan R.D. Martin T.J. Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with in vitro bone resorption appearing to be dependent, at least in part, on thrombin-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis (13Hoffmann O.

Rs, from P. gingivalis (22Chen Z. Potempa J. Polanowski A. Wikstrom M. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18896-18901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pike R McGraw W. Potempa J.

Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and degrading fibrinogen in human plasma (25Imamura T. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Moore J.N. Barton M.H. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these events may be potentially associated with crevicular fluid production and bleeding tendency, respectively, at periodontitis sites. The 95-kDa proteinase is composed of both a catalytic and an adhesin domain (26Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the former being 81% identical in primary structure with that of the 50-kDa form. 2J. Potempa, unpublished data. 2J. Potempa, unpublished data. However, little is known with regard to any other specific functional differences between the two enzymes. Since coagulation factors are activated by cleavage of peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal side of specific arginine residues (27Halkier T. Mechanisms in Blood Coagulation, Fibrinolysis, and the Complement System. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar), it is possible that each of the gingipains Rs could activate the coagulation cascade system to produce thrombin, an enzyme known to have multiple functions. Therefore, to study other possible pathogenic roles for the two gingipain Rs, we investigated their effect on activating this system. It was found that each proteinase could induce blood coagulation through factor X activation. However, there were significant differences between 95-kDa gingipain R and the 50-kDa form in performing this function.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have provided experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that gingipain Rs can induce blood coagulation through activation of factor X. Although snake venom enzymes are known to activate factor X (35Kisiel W. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 36Farid T. Nasser H. Zaki K. el-Asmar M.F. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), no bacterial proteinase has been reported so far to perform this same function. Indeed, staphylocoagulase is the only bacterial coagulase which can induce human plasma coagulation, apparently through formation of an active molecular complex with prothrombin (37Hemker H.C. Bass B.M. Muller A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present work, therefore, demonstrates the existence of factor X activators of bacterial origin for the first time. Previously, it has been shown that gingipain Rs can activate prekallikrein and convert it to kallikrein (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), an activator of Hageman factor (38Cochrane C.G. Revak S.D. Wuepper K.D. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 138: 1564-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) which initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway (39Cochrane C.G. Griffin J.H. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 33: 241-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is possible that gingipain Rs trigger blood coagulation through this mechanism. However, this pathway is unlikely to be involved in gingipain R-induced blood coagulation, since the APTT of prekallikrein-deficient plasma, like other deficient plasmas (except factor X-deficient plasma), is also shortened by 50-kDa gingipain R (Table I). Furthermore, this bacterial proteinase also shortened PT of factor VII-deficient plasma but not of factor X-deficient plasma (TableII). Thus, it seems likely that the factor X activation by gingipain Rs is the primary site through which blood coagulation is induced by these proteinases.The K m values of gingipain Rs (Table III) are lower than the factor X concentration in normal plasma (around 10 μg/ml, 170 nm) (27Halkier T. Mechanisms in Blood Coagulation, Fibrinolysis, and the Complement System. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar), which, together with their effects on APTT and PT (Figs. 1 and 2), supports the hypothesis that factor X activation by gingipain Rs can occur in plasma. Since phospholipids and calcium ions are ubiquitous cell membrane components and ions, respectively, their stimulatory effect on 95-kDa gingipain R-induced factor X activation (Fig. 5) can occur in vivo. Together with the fact that thek cat/K m value is close to the value of RVV-XCP (Table III), a strong factor X activator, it is likely that the high molecular weight gingipain R is physiologically a more important factor X activator than the smaller form.We previously reported the binding activity of the adhesin domains in high molecular mass forms of gingipains to various proteins (40Pike R.N. Potempa J. McGraw W. Coetzer T.H.T. Travis J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2876-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the phopholipids augment factor X activation only by 95-kDa gingipain R (Fig. 5), complexed with adhesin domains, suggest the binding of the adhesin domains to phospholipids. Exoenzyme S, recently confirmed as an adhesin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (41Baker N.R. Minor V. Deal C. Sahrabadi M.S. Simpson D.A. Wooda D.E. Infect.

Thus, it may be natural for 95-kDa gingipain R adhesin domains to bind to phospholipids. However, phospholipids augmented neither Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA hydrolysis, prekallikrein activation, nor fibrinogen degradation by the complexed form, 4T. Imamura, unpublished data. hence the phospholipids effect appears to be specific for factor X activation. The augmentation of 95-kDa gingipain R factor X activation by phospholipids, together with the lower K m and much higherk cat values of 95-kDa gingipain R than those of the 50-kDa form (Table III), indicates a further function for the adhesin domains in increasing the affinity to factor X as well as facilitating substrate cleavage.In human plasma, gingipain Rs generate bradykinin (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a potent vascular permeability enhancing peptide. In parallel, and through factor X activation thrombin is also generated (Fig. 1 and 2). Thus, in blood there is likely to be the simultaneous production of each by gingipain Rs, and for this reason it is believed that both may also be involved in the production of gingival crevicular fluid (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and of prostaglandins and interleukin-1 (13Hoffmann O. Klaushofer K. Koller K.

Hence, the elevated levels of prostaglandins and interleukin-1 in gingival crevicular fluid of adult periodontitis patients (3Offenbacher S. Odle B.M. Van Dyke T.E. J. Periodont.

In addition, thrombin and fibrinopeptide B, released from fibrinogen by thrombin are each neutrophil chemotactic factors (44Bizios R. Lai L. Fenton J.W., II Malik J.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 45Senior R.M. Skogen W.F. Griffin G.L. Wilner G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and may contribute to infiltration of these phagocytic cells at periodontitis sites (46Williams D.M. Hughes F.J. Odell E.W. Farthing P.M. Pathology of Periodontal Disease. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kindgom1992: 90Google Scholar). Finally, factor Xa also enhances macrophage interleukin-1 production (15Jones A. Geczy C.L. Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar) and is mitogenic for endothelial cells (47Gajdusek C. Carbon S. Ross R. Nawroth P. Stern D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (48Gasic G.P. Arenas C.P. Gasic T.B. Gasic G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2317-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and lymphocytes (49Altieri D.C. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 372-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data described here would imply that gingipain R-induced activation of blood coagulation through conversion of factor X to Xa can easily be involved in the development of periodontitis.In septic patients, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurs frequently. Recent studies indicate that the initial activation of coagulation in sepsis is primarily dependent on activation of the extrinsic pathway, initiated by tissue factor expressed on monocytes (50Levi M. ten Cate H. van der Poll T. van Deventer S.J.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 270: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Since endotoxin, itself, or endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-α can stimulate monocytes to express tissue factor (51Rivers R.P. Hathaway W.E. Weston W.L. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 30: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 52Conkling P.R. Greenberg C.S. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1988; 72: 128-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the tendency has been to recognize such factors as the primary bacterial agents involved in the induction of DIC coagulation in sepsis. However, our finding that gingipain Rs can also readily induce blood coagulation suggest the possibility of bacterial proteinase-induced DIC coagulation in sepsis. It has been reported that a patient with an acute dentoalveolar abscess developed septicemia ofBacteroides melaninogenicus, a bacterium similar toP. gingivalis, and died with DIC (53Currie W.J.R. Ho V. Br. J. Oral Maxillofac. Surg. 1993; 31: 296-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fact that no plasma proteinase inhibitor effectively inactivates gingipain Rs (data not shown) supports this possibility. If so, inhibitors of such enzymes could be a therapy for DIC. Periodontitis is an infectious disease associated with a loss of connective tissue, resorption of alveolar bone, and formation of periodontal pockets. It is the most common cause of tooth loss in adults, primarily because of the declining incidence of dental caries in the general population (1Shaw J.H. N. Eng. J. Med. 1987; 317: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Williams R.C. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Although the pathogenesis of periodontitis is not completely understood, prostaglandins (3Offenbacher S. Odle B.M. Van Dyke T.E. J. Periodont. Res. 1986; 21: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 4Tubb M. Williams F.E. Fraizier L.W. Arch. Oral.

Res. 1990; 25: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which increase in gingival crevicular fluid in periodontal pockets, are considered to be predominant factors in the tissue destruction process associated with this disease. However, the mechanism of the production of these inflammatory mediators is still unclear. Thrombin, which is primarily associated with the cleavage of fibrinogen to generate fibrin clots (7Fenton J.W., II Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Blood. 1988; 71: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a key proteinase in the blood coagulation system. However, besides its central role in hemostasis, this proteinase is also a potent stimulator of prostaglandin synthesis in osteoblasts (12Partridge N.C. Hillyard C.J. Nolan R.D. Martin T.J. Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with in vitro bone resorption appearing to be dependent, at least in part, on thrombin-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis (13Hoffmann O. Klaushofer K. Koller K. Peterlik M. Mavreas T. Stern P. Prostaglandins. 1986; 31: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Lerner U.H. Gustafson G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, thrombin also potentiates lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin-1 production by macrophages (15Jones A. Geczy C.L. Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar). These facts suggest that thrombin may play a major role in the development of periodontitis by indirectly causing tissue breakdown including alveolar bone resorption. However, whether thrombin is produced at periodontitis sites is still unknown. A close relationship between Porphyromonas gingivalis(formally Bacteroides gingivalis) and adult periodontitis has been reported (16Slots J. Genco R.J. Mergenhagen S.E.

We have previously purified two arginine-specific cysteine proteinases, referred to as 50-kDa and 95-kDa gingipain 1The abbreviations used are: gingipain R, arginine-specific gingipain; PT, prothrombin time; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; TLCK, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; factor Xa, activated coagulation factor X; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation. 1The abbreviations used are: gingipain R, arginine-specific gingipain; PT, prothrombin time; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; TLCK, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; factor Xa, activated coagulation factor X; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation. Rs, from P. gingivalis (22Chen Z. Potempa J. Polanowski A. Wikstrom M. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18896-18901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pike R McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and found each to be capable of generating bradykinin through prekallikrein activation (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and degrading fibrinogen in human plasma (25Imamura T. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Moore J.N. Barton M.H. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these events may be potentially associated with crevicular fluid production and bleeding tendency, respectively, at periodontitis sites. The 95-kDa proteinase is composed of both a catalytic and an adhesin domain (26Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the former being 81% identical in primary structure with that of the 50-kDa form. 2J. Potempa, unpublished data. 2J. Potempa, unpublished data. However, little is known with regard to any other specific functional differences between the two enzymes. Since coagulation factors are activated by cleavage of peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal side of specific arginine residues (27Halkier T. Mechanisms in Blood Coagulation, Fibrinolysis, and the Complement System. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar), it is possible that each of the gingipains Rs could activate the coagulation cascade system to produce thrombin, an enzyme known to have multiple functions. Therefore, to study other possible pathogenic roles for the two gingipain Rs, we investigated their effect on activating this system. It was found that each proteinase could induce blood coagulation through factor X activation. However, there were significant differences between 95-kDa gingipain R and the 50-kDa form in performing this function. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have provided experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that gingipain Rs can induce blood coagulation through activation of factor X. Although snake venom enzymes are known to activate factor X (35Kisiel W. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 36Farid T. Nasser H. Zaki K. el-Asmar M.F. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), no bacterial proteinase has been reported so far to perform this same function. Indeed, staphylocoagulase is the only bacterial coagulase which can induce human plasma coagulation, apparently through formation of an active molecular complex with prothrombin (37Hemker H.C. Bass B.M. Muller A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present work, therefore, demonstrates the existence of factor X activators of bacterial origin for the first time. Previously, it has been shown that gingipain Rs can activate prekallikrein and convert it to kallikrein (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), an activator of Hageman factor (38Cochrane C.G. Revak S.D. Wuepper K.D. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 138: 1564-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) which initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway (39Cochrane C.G. Griffin J.H. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 33: 241-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is possible that gingipain Rs trigger blood coagulation through this mechanism. However, this pathway is unlikely to be involved in gingipain R-induced blood coagulation, since the APTT of prekallikrein-deficient plasma, like other deficient plasmas (except factor X-deficient plasma), is also shortened by 50-kDa gingipain R (Table I). Furthermore, this bacterial proteinase also shortened PT of factor VII-deficient plasma but not of factor X-deficient plasma (TableII). Thus, it seems likely that the factor X activation by gingipain Rs is the primary site through which blood coagulation is induced by these proteinases.The K m values of gingipain Rs (Table III) are lower than the factor X concentration in normal plasma (around 10 μg/ml, 170 nm) (27Halkier T. Mechanisms in Blood Coagulation, Fibrinolysis, and the Complement System. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar), which, together with their effects on APTT and PT (Figs. 1 and 2), supports the hypothesis that factor X activation by gingipain Rs can occur in plasma. Since phospholipids and calcium ions are ubiquitous cell membrane components and ions, respectively, their stimulatory effect on 95-kDa gingipain R-induced factor X activation (Fig. 5) can occur in vivo. Together with the fact that thek cat/K m value is close to the value of RVV-XCP (Table III), a strong factor X activator, it is likely that the high molecular weight gingipain R is physiologically a more important factor X activator than the smaller form.We previously reported the binding activity of the adhesin domains in high molecular mass forms of gingipains to various proteins (40Pike R.N. Potempa J. McGraw W. Coetzer T.H.T. Travis J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2876-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the phopholipids augment factor X activation only by 95-kDa gingipain R (Fig. 5), complexed with adhesin domains, suggest the binding of the adhesin domains to phospholipids. Exoenzyme S, recently confirmed as an adhesin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (41Baker N.R. Minor V. Deal C. Sahrabadi M.S. Simpson D.A. Wooda D.E. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2859-2863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds to phosphatidylethanolamine specifically in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 (42Lingwood C.A. Huesca M. Kuksis A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lipid receptors have been shown to be involved in the binding of Helicobacter pyloriand Burkholderia (Basonym Pseudomonas)cepacis to epithelial cells (42Lingwood C.A.

Immun. 1992; 60: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lipid receptors have been shown to be involved in the binding of Helicobacter pyloriand Burkholderia (Basonym Pseudomonas)cepacis to epithelial cells (42Lingwood C.A.

Thus, it may be natural for 95-kDa gingipain R adhesin domains to bind to phospholipids. However, phospholipids augmented neither Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA hydrolysis, prekallikrein activation, nor fibrinogen degradation by the complexed form, 4T. Imamura, unpublished data. hence the phospholipids effect appears to be specific for factor X activation. The augmentation of 95-kDa gingipain R factor X activation by phospholipids, together with the lower K m and much higherk cat values of 95-kDa gingipain R than those of the 50-kDa form (Table III), indicates a further function for the adhesin domains in increasing the affinity to factor X as well as facilitating substrate cleavage. In human plasma, gingipain Rs generate bradykinin (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a potent vascular permeability enhancing peptide. In parallel, and through factor X activation thrombin is also generated (Fig. 1 and 2). Thus, in blood there is likely to be the simultaneous production of each by gingipain Rs, and for this reason it is believed that both may also be involved in the production of gingival crevicular fluid (24Imamura T. Pike R.N. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and of prostaglandins and interleukin-1 (13Hoffmann O. Klaushofer K. Koller K.

Hence, the elevated levels of prostaglandins and interleukin-1 in gingival crevicular fluid of adult periodontitis patients (3Offenbacher S. Odle B.M. Van Dyke T.E. J. Periodont. Res. 1986; 21: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 4Tubb M. Williams F.E. Fraizier L.W. Arch. Oral. Biol. 1990; 35: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Masada M.P.

In addition, thrombin and fibrinopeptide B, released from fibrinogen by thrombin are each neutrophil chemotactic factors (44Bizios R. Lai L. Fenton J.W., II Malik J.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 45Senior R.M. Skogen W.F. Griffin G.L. Wilner G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and may contribute to infiltration of these phagocytic cells at periodontitis sites (46Williams D.M. Hughes F.J. Odell E.W. Farthing P.M. Pathology of Periodontal Disease. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kindgom1992: 90Google Scholar). Finally, factor Xa also enhances macrophage interleukin-1 production (15Jones A. Geczy C.L. Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar) and is mitogenic for endothelial cells (47Gajdusek C. Carbon S. Ross R. Nawroth P. Stern D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (48Gasic G.P. Arenas C.P. Gasic T.B. Gasic G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2317-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and lymphocytes (49Altieri D.C. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 372-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data described here would imply that gingipain R-induced activation of blood coagulation through conversion of factor X to Xa can easily be involved in the development of periodontitis. In septic patients, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurs frequently. Recent studies indicate that the initial activation of coagulation in sepsis is primarily dependent on activation of the extrinsic pathway, initiated by tissue factor expressed on monocytes (50Levi M. ten Cate H. van der Poll T. van Deventer S.J.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 270: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Since endotoxin, itself, or endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-α can stimulate monocytes to express tissue factor (51Rivers R.P. Hathaway W.E. Weston W.L. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 30: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 52Conkling P.R. Greenberg C.S. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1988; 72: 128-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the tendency has been to recognize such factors as the primary bacterial agents involved in the induction of DIC coagulation in sepsis. However, our finding that gingipain Rs can also readily induce blood coagulation suggest the possibility of bacterial proteinase-induced DIC coagulation in sepsis. It has been reported that a patient with an acute dentoalveolar abscess developed septicemia ofBacteroides melaninogenicus, a bacterium similar toP. gingivalis, and died with DIC (53Currie W.J.R. Ho V. Br. J. Oral Maxillofac. Surg. 1993; 31: 296-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fact that no plasma proteinase inhibitor effectively inactivates gingipain Rs (data not shown) supports this possibility. If so, inhibitors of such enzymes could be a therapy for DIC."
https://openalex.org/W2318138831,"The activation of multiple interleukin-1beta converting enzyme-related proteases (caspases) in apoptotic mammalian cells raises questions as to whether the multiple active caspases have distinct roles in apoptotic execution as well as how these proteases are organized in apoptotic signaling pathways. Here we used an affinity-labeling agent, YV(bio)KD-aomk, to investigate the caspases activated during apoptotic cell death. YV(bio)KD-aomk identified six distinct polypeptides corresponding to active caspases in Fas-stimulated Jurkat T cells. On staurosporine treatment, four polypeptides were detected. Competition experiments showed that the labeled caspases have distinct substrate preferences. Stepwise appearance of the labeled caspases in each cell death event was consistent with the view that the activated caspases are organized into protease cascades. Moreover, we found that stepwise activation of caspases similar to that induced by Fas ligation is triggered by exposing non-apoptotic Jurkat cell extracts to caspase-8 (MACH/FLICE/Mch5). Conversely, CrmA protein, a viral suppressor of Fas-induced apoptosis, inhibited the protease activity of caspase-8. Overall, these findings provide evidence that caspase-8, a CrmA-sensitive protease, is responsible for initiating the stepwise activation of multiple caspases in Fas-stimulated cells."

We now show that costimulation of 2B4 cells, in the absence or presence of transgenic Bcl-2, with anti-CD3ε and forskolin, an activator of cAMP signaling, resulted in antagonism of Fas-dependent activation-induced cell death that was always accompanied by selective down-regulation of the nuclear levels of NF-κB p65-p50 (RelA-p50) transcription factor. Forskolin not only inhibited activation-induced cell death and NF-κB activation, but also suppressed expression of Fas and Fas ligand (Fas-L). Furthermore, NF-κB p65 antisense oligonucleotide down-regulated nuclear levels of NF-κB, inhibited cell surface expression of Fas-L and apoptosis of 2B4. Collectively, these finding demonstrate a potential role of NF-κB in the regulation of activation-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2329891521,"Transcription of the B-Myb gene is cell cycle regulated by an E2F-dependent mechanism and its product, B-Myb, is itself a transcription factor required for S-phase entry. Previously, we have shown that B-Myb is specifically phosphorylated during S-phase and that similar modification to a less electrophoretically mobile form could be induced by baculovirus-expressed cyclin A/Cdk2 kinase. We report here that cyclin A-mediated phosphorylation of B-Myb is associated with a marked increase in transactivation function in U-2 OS cells. In contrast to previous studies, transactivation of the luciferase reporter was dependent upon Myb binding sites located upstream of the promoter. Enhancement of B-Myb activation function was also obtained by truncation of the C-terminus just downstream of a domain conserved in evolution. Potentiation of B-Myb activity by phosphorylation was not simply a consequence of overcoming the negative effect of the C-terminus, however, as the truncated protein was to a lesser extent also activated by cyclin A/Cdk2. Whereas wild-type B-Myb transactivation activity could not be potentiated by cyclin A/Cdk2 in NIH3T3 cells, the truncated protein was hyperactive. Finally, we showed that B-Myb synergises with cyclin A to promote U-2 OS cells into S-phase."
https://openalex.org/W2333247929,"The Tax protein of the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV) activates the expression of viral mRNA through a three 21 bp repeat enhancer located within the HTLV-1 LTR. Since Tax does not bind to the 21 bp DNA repeats directly, it has been speculated that Tax interacts with cellular protein(s) which mediate binding to the enhancer. We employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify host proteins that are potentially relevant to Tax transactivation. We identified a Tax binding protein encoded from a cDNA expression library derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The corresponding cDNA has sequence identity with a known transcription factor, activating factor-4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 also binds to GST-Tax fusion protein in vitro. Tax mutants that did not transactivate the HTLV-1 LTR also failed to bind ATF-4. The critical domain for Tax binding resides in a 85 amino acid stretch in the C-terminus of ATF-4, which contains the basic domain and leucine zipper. We further demonstrated that both full length and N-terminal truncated ATF-4 were able to enhance Tax transactivation. Thus, ATF-4 may act as an adapter between Tax and the TRE (Tax responsive element), and play an important role in Tax-mediated transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2015853580,"To test proposals for the origin of oxygen absorption bands in the visible reflectance spectrum of Ganymede, the reflectance of condensed films of pure oxygen (O 2 ) and O 2 -water mixtures and the evolution of O 2 from the films as a function of temperature were determined. Absorption band shapes and positions for oxygen at 26 kelvin were similar to those reported for Ganymede, whereas those for the mixtures were slightly shifted. The band intensity dropped by more than two orders of magnitude when the ice mixture was warmed to 100 kelvin, although about 20 percent of the O 2 remained trapped in the ice, which suggested that at these temperatures O 2 molecules dissolve in the ice rather than aggregate in clusters or bubbles. The experiments suggest that the absorption bands in Ganymede's spectrum were not produced in the relatively warm surface of the satellite but in a much colder source. Solid O 2 may exist in a cold subsurface layer or in an atmospheric haze."
https://openalex.org/W2059029007,"P130 shares structural and functional homology with pRb and p107. One property common to p107 and p130, but not to pRb, is the ability to stably interact with cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin E/cdk2 complexes in vitro and in vivo. Using GST-p130 fusion proteins representing various regions of p130, baculovirus-produced cyclin A/cdk2 and cyclin E/cdk2 complexes were found to interact with residues within a part of p130 known as the spacer region. Cyclin E was able to bind the p130 spacer region in the presence or absence of cdk2 whereas cyclin A binding was dependent upon the presence of cdk2. The smallest p130 fusion protein sufficient to interact with cyclin A/cdk2 or cyclin E/cdk2 complexes contained p130 amino acids 652 – 698 and deletion of p130 amino acids 680 – 682 abolished binding to both of the cyclin/cdk2 complexes. When overexpressed in C33A cells, a p130 mutant containing a deletion of amino acids 620 – 697 was unable to form complexes with either cyclin A or cyclin E. This p130 mutant was at least as active as wild type p130 in suppressing the growth of G418 resistant colonies when overexpressed in C33A or SAOS-2 cells"
https://openalex.org/W2326990516,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed with v-src were previously reported to revert to normal phenotype after the introduction of dominant-negative mutants of Fos or Jun, indicating that endogenous AP-1 activity is essential for the cellular transformation. The major changes in the expression levels of fos and jun family genes induced by v-src were the elevation of fra-2 and c-jun transcripts. We show here that extensive phosphorylation of the AP-1 component Fra-2 is a major qualitative change in v-src transformed CEF and that several Ser and Thr residues in a C-terminal region of Fra-2 (amino acids 266-323) are phosphorylated specifically. The induced kinase activity was detected at the position of 42 kDa by in gel kinase assay using the Fra-2 C-terminal region as a substrate, and it was identified as chicken ERK2. JNK1 and JNK2, other members of the MAP kinase family, were not significantly activated in v-src transformed CEF and Fra-2 was not a good substrate for JNKs. fra-2 promoter analysis indicated that this promoter activity is elevated in v-src transformed CEF via two AP-1 binding sites and CRE-like sequence. We propose that phosphorylation of Fra-2 by ERK2 converts it from an inefficient transcriptional activator to an active one and further that fra-2 expression is autoregulated in response to the phosphorylation status of its gene product."

https://openalex.org/W2050164732,"BCL-6 gene alterations have been observed in 27 – 45% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBs) with chromosomal translocations at 3q27. The deregulated expression of normal BCL-6 protein caused by this chromosomal translocation is believed to be responsible for lymphomagenesis. Recently, we demonstrated that BCL-6 is expressed at high levels in germinal center B-cells as a 92-98 kDa nuclear protein in a constitutively phosphorylated form. In this study, we show that BCL-6 is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in vitro at the sites phosphorylated in vivo. These numerous phosphorylation sites were found to be located in its serine- and proline-clustered (SPC) region (amino acids-250-483). BCL-6 phosphorylation significantly increased in Ramos cells following stimulation with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or BCL-6- and erk1-transfected COS-7 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the increase of phosphorylation was inhibited by MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059. Furthermore, we observed that BCL-6 was associated with MAPK in vivo and its SPC region was important for this association. These results suggest that the functions of BCL-6 are regulated by phosphorylation mediated by the MAPK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2316816410,"We have previously reported on the M-phase specific dephosphorylation of pRb and identified a type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1) as the enzyme mediating pRb dephosphorylation. In this report, we have characterized the pRb-directed phosphatase activity found in mitotic cells with respect to dose dependence and demonstrate that the pRb isoform conversion detected in vitro mirrors the pRb isoform conversion which occurs during mitosis of intact cells. Cell fractionation and PP1 catalytic subunit isolation studies support the notion that the pRb-directed phosphatase activity involves subpopulations of PP1 catalytic subunits. Coprecipitation studies revealed that PP1 can form a complex with hypophosphorylated pRb which was converted from the hyperphosphorylated form in mitotic cell extracts. Taken together with data from previous reports in the literature, a model for the regulation of PP1 activity towards pRb during mitotic exit is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2327948153,"Oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 contains the N-terminal transactivation domains of E2a and the majority of the homeodomain protein, Pbx1. Using recombinant proteins, both Pbx1 and E2a-Pbx1 heterodimerize with Hox proteins on bipartite elements, Pbx1 binding a 5′ TGAT core and Class I Hox proteins binding adjacent 3′ TAAT, TTAT, or TGAT cores. In contrast to these in vitro results, nuclear extracts from E2a-Pbx1-transformed cells assemble an abundant Pbx-containing complex on TGATTGAT that excludes E2a-Pbx1, suggesting that an uncharacterized in vivo partner discriminates between E2a-Pbx1 and Pbx proteins, distinguishing it from Hox proteins. Here, we describe the DNA-binding properties of this complex, and identify TGATTGAC (PCE; Pbx Consensus Element) as its optimal recognition motif. In vitro, the PCE fails to bind heterodimers of Class I Hox proteins plus either Pbx1 or E2a-Pbx1. Likewise, in vivo, the PCE fails to mediate cooperative transactivation by E2a-Pbx1 plus Class I Hox proteins. Thus, the PCE binds a Pbx dimer partner that behaves unlike Class I Hox proteins. Competition analysis indicates that the Pbx-containing complex that binds the PCE also binds the TGATTGAT Pbx-Hox element and binds promoter elements required for tissue-specific expression of a number of cellular genes. Thus, different Pbx partners dictate targetting of Pbx heterodimers to related DNA motifs that differ in the sequence of their 3′ half-sites, and E2a-Pbx1 heterodimerizes with only a subset of Pbx partners, restricting its potential DNA targets."

Although the existence of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein on pancreatic zymogen granules was previously suggested (22Schnefel S. Zimmermann P. Profrock A. Jahn R. Aktories K. Zeuzem S. Haase W. Schulz I. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 2: 77-89Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) its identity is still uncertain. In the current work, we have identified a heterotrimeric G-protein(s), which localizes to zymogen granules and appears to participate in regulated exocytosis. We found that both αq/11 and G-protein β-subunit exist on zymogen granules. We also examined the effect of substance-P-related peptides on calcium-induced amylase release from streptolysin-O permeabilized acini. Substance-P-related peptide GPAnt-2a and GPAnt-1 were reported to antagonize Gq/11 and Go/i, respectively (23Mukai H. Munekata E. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16237-16243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus these peptides are widely used for analyzing the function of heterotrimeric G-proteins on both plasma membranes and secretory vesicles (17Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vitale N. Deloulme J.C. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol.

We found that GPAnt-2a, but not GPAnt-1, enhanced calcium-stimulated amylase secretion from streptolysin-O permeabilized pancreatic acini and that GPAnt-2a, but not GPAnt-1, inhibited GTPase activity on zymogen granules. These results suggest that Gq/11 on zymogen granules plays a tonic inhibitory role in calcium-regulated amylase release from pancreatic acini. Streptolysin-O was purchased from Welcome Diagnostic (Greenville, NC), chromatographically purified collagenase from Worthington Biochemicals, bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) from ICN Immunobiologicals (Lisle, IL), and protein A-agarose from Pierce. The following compounds were purchased from Sigma: Mg-ATP, creatine kinase, creatine phosphate, GTP, and activated charcoal. [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol) and125I-Bolton-Hunter CCK-8 (2200 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN (Boston, MA). GPAnt-1 and GPAnt-2A peptides were purchased from Sigma and Bio-Mol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), respectively. Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-αq/11 antibody (C-19L), anti-αo antibody (K-20), anti-αi (C-10L), anti-G-protein-β-subunit antibody (T-20), and anti-phospholipase Cβ1 antibody (G-12) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-αs antiserum (RM-1) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Monoclonal antibody against rat pancreatic GP-2 was a gift from Dr. Anson Lowe (Stanford University). Polyclonal antibody (31B) to the α subunit of the sodium pump has been described previously (25Hiebor V.G. Siegel J. Desmond T. Liu J.L-H. Ernst S.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies included peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunogloblin G (IgG, Amersham) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Purified zymogen granules were prepared by Percoll gradient separation by previously published procedures (13Ohnishi H. Ernst A.S. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar, 26Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Goke B. Williams J.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9099-9104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their purity has been determined both by analysis of several subcellular enzymatic organelle markers and by electron microscopic analysis and shown to be enriched 100–400-fold compared with other organelles (26Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Granule membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation after lysis with nigericin as described previously (28Wagner A.C. Wishart M.J. Mulders S.M. Blevins P.M. Andrews P.C. Lowe A.W. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9099-9104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membrane-rich fractions were prepared by sucrose gradient centrifugation by previously published procedures (29Blevins Jr., G.T. van de Westerlo E.M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G866-G874PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-CCK binding to plasma membrane and zymogen granule membrane was carried out as described previously (29Blevins Jr., G.T. van de Westerlo E.M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G866-G874PubMed Google Scholar) except that membranes were collected on Whatman GFF filters and washed three times with ice-cold buffer to terminate binding. Protein content of membranes was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Electrophoresis was performed as described (28Wagner A.C. Wishart M.J. Mulders S.M. Blevins P.M. Andrews P.C. Lowe A.W. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9099-9104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variable amounts of protein from each sample were loaded per lane onto 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and run at 200 V. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 30 volts overnight. Western blotting was carried out as described previously, using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent to visualize the secondary antibody. Freshly prepared pancreatic lobules were fixed for 2 h at 4 °C with a mixture of 2% formaldehyde (prepared from paraformaldehyde) and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed tissue was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, cryoprotected with sucrose, and frozen as described previously (13Ohnishi H. Ernst A.S. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar, 30Barthel L.K. Raymond P.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 383-1388Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence localization of αq/11 in 5-μm thick cryostat sections followed the procedures described previously in detail (13Ohnishi H. Ernst A.S. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ernst S.A. Post K.M.C. Cohn M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 267: C990-C1001Crossref Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-αq/11 was used at 10 μg/ml. Specificity of staining was assessed by preincubation of primary antibody with 10-fold excess by weight of peptide used to generate the antibody. For comparative purpose, some cryostat sections were exposed to monoclonal antibody to the zymogen granule membrane marker, GP-2. Sections were examined by epifluorescence microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC-600). Digitized images were processed using Photoshop 3.0 software. Acini were prepared by collagenase digestion as described previously (32Burnham D.B. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10523-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, acini were suspended in permeabilization buffer consisting of 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 140 mm potassium glutamate, 0.91 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm ATP (Mg salt), and 0.5 IU/ml streptolysin-O. For permeabilizing acini and introducing G-protein antagonist peptides into acini, aliquots of the acinar suspension were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 min in the presence of various amounts of the indicated peptide, then placed in ice-cold water bath for 5 min and aliquoted into 200-μl samples. Amylase release was initiated by adding 200 μl of permeabilization buffer supplemented with CaCl2 to give a final concentration of 1 mm free Mg2+ and the specified concentrations of free Ca2+ which were calculated using a computer program as described previously (32Burnham D.B. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10523-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, samples were centrifuged for 10 s in an microcentrifuge. Amylase released into the supernatant during the incubation was quantified using the Phadebas Amylase Test (Pharmacia, Columbus, OH) and expressed as a percent of total amylase in the acini at the beginning of the incubation. For immunoprecipitation of αq/11, purified zymogen granules were sonicated for 15 s in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Gq/11antibody at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. The Gq/11-bound beads were washed with the same buffer and used for Western blotting or assay of GTPase activity. Purified zymogen granules (200 μg of protein) or immunoprecipitated αq/11 protein from purified zymogen granules (2 mg) were suspended in 60 μl of HEPES-buffered solution (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was initiated by adding 40 μl containing of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml creatine kinase, 5.5 mm creatine phosphate, 2.5 mm ATP, 2.5 μm GTP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP followed by incubation for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 900 μl of cold phosphoric acid (pH 2.3) supplemented with 25% activated charcoal by weight. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C and the [32P]Pi in the supernatant (300 μl) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was subtracted from all data. To determine the heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunit(s) localized to zymogen granules, we performed Western blotting of purified zymogen granule membranes and a plasma membrane-rich fraction using antibodies specific to αq/11, αs, αo, and αi. Fig. 1 shows that αq/11, αs, and αo were all present in a plasma membrane-rich fraction; αi was only faintly visualized in plasma membranes and was therefore not studied further. Of the four G proteins, only αq/11 was detected on zymogen granule membranes in Western blotting. In addition, the Na+ pump α subunit was found on the plasma membrane but not granule membrane (Fig. 1). To quantitate the relative abundance of αq/11on plasma membrane and zymogen granule membrane we carried out a dilution series of plasma membrane from 30 to 0.1 μg and compared the immunoblot signal to 30 μg of granule membranes. In two separate preparations 30 μg of granule membranes were comparable to 1 μg of plasma membranes. Based on the method of preparation and relative purity of granules (26Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) this is not likely due to contamination. To confirm this quantitatively, we evaluated CCK receptor binding as a well established pancreatic plasma membrane marker. Specific binding was observed on plasma membranes (total binding 20,173 ± 211 cpm, nonspecific 318 ± 29, mean ± S.E., n = 4). By contrast, no specific binding was present on zymogen granule membranes (total binding 306 ± 24 cpm, nonspecific 340 ± 42). Recently, multiple heterotrimeric G-protein α-subunits were shown to be localized to the Golgi apparatus of pancreatic acinar cells using immunohistochemistry, but no β-subunits were detected in the Golgi apparatus (33Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These investigators suggested that G-protein α-subunits are localized to the Golgi apparatus independent of β-subunits. To determine whether αq/11 exists alone or as part of a complete G-protein complex, zymogen granule membranes were probed with a β-subunit antibody directed against a common region in the COOH-terminal of all β-subunits. A 37-kDa band was found to be present in both zymogen granule membranes and plasma membrane-rich fraction (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that αq/11 protein on zymogen granules maintains an interaction with β-subunit as an intact heterotrimeric G-protein as is the case for the plasma membrane. We also carried out Western blotting using antiphospholipase Cβ1 antibody; phospholipase Cβ1 was detected in the plasma membrane-rich fraction, but not in purified zymogen granule membranes (Fig. 2 B). These observations in total, confirm the purity of our zymogen granule and indicate that αq/11 in granule membrane preparations is not due to contamination with plasma membranes. To further address the localization of αq/11, we analyzed the distribution of αq/11 protein in cryostat sections of pancreatic lobules by immunofluorescence and confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 A, αq/11 staining was pronounced along the basolateral membranes of acinar cells, and more weakly localized to the granule region in the apical cytoplasm. Although not quantitative, the weaker immunofluorescence signal over the granule area compared with the plasma membrane is consistent with the similar pattern resolved in Western blots (Fig. 1). When anti-αq/11 antiserum was preincubated with the peptide used to generate the antibody, the specific staining associated with both the basolateral membrane and the granules was abolished (Fig. 3 B). Immunofluorescence staining of the apical cytoplasm with anti-αq/11 appeared at higher magnification to be punctate and to be associated specifically with the zymogen granules (Fig. 3 C). As shown in this figure, no staining was apparent at the apical membrane of the acinar cells. To study the function of Gq/11 on zymogen granule membranes, we utilized the SP-related peptides GPAnt-1 and GPAnt-2a which are known to be antagonists of Gi/o and Gq/11, respectively (23Mukai H. Munekata E. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16237-16243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When these peptides are introduced into permeabilized acini and amylase secretion is stimulated by 10 μm free calcium, an effect on heterotrimeric G-proteins at the plasma membrane to mobilize intracellular calcium can be excluded and the function of the G-proteins at steps distal to intracellular calcium mobilization can be evaluated. GPAnt-2a peptide potentiated amylase secretion induced by 10 μm free calcium from streptolysin-O permeabilized acini in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). In contrast, GPAnt-1 did not alter calcium-stimulated amylase secretion. We also evaluated the peptide from the carboxyl-terminal of αq/11 used to generate the antibody and it had no effect on secretion (not shown). None of the peptides affected basal amylase secretion even at 100 μm. These data demonstrated that GPAnt-2a peptide specifically potentiated calcium-stimulated amylase release at a late step of exocytosis. To confirm that GPAnt-2a peptide augments calcium-stimulated amylase secretion from permeabilized acini by antagonizing G-proteins on zymogen granules, we evaluated the GTPase activity of zymogen granules. As shown in Fig.5 A, 100 μm GPAnt-2a peptide inhibited GTPase activity on zymogen granules approximately 25%. GPAnt-1 peptide, however, had no effect on the GTPase activity on zymogen granules. Since multiple small G-proteins are also known to be localized on zymogen granules (27Goke B. Williams J.A. Wishart M.J. De Lisle R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C493-C500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Padfield P.J. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), total GTPase activity of zymogen granules most likely represents the activity of multiple G-proteins. Therefore, the fact that GPAnt2a inhibited only 25% of the GTPase activity on zymogen granules is not surprising. To further determine that GPAnt-2a peptide specifically inhibits Gq/11 protein function on zymogen granules, we examined the inhibitory effect of G-protein antagonist peptides on GTPase activity of Gq/11 immunoprecipitated from purified zymogen granules. Fig. 5 B shows immunoprecipitated Gq/11 protein from zymogen granules visualized by Western blotting. Using this immunoprecipitant, the effect of G-protein antagonist peptides on Gq/11 GTPase activity was assayed. As shown in Fig.5 C, GPAnt-2a peptide markedly inhibited immunoprecipitated Gq/11 GTPase activity by about 60%. GPAnt-1 peptide, however, had no effect on GTPase activity of Gq/11. Taken together, these data suggest that the inhibition of GTPase activity of zymogen granules by GPAnt-2A peptide results in the potentiation of calcium-stimulated amylase secretion from permeabilized acini. Transduction and amplification of receptor-mediated signals to phospholipase C at the level of the plasma membrane is the only currently established function of Gq/11 (35Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 36Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although some studies have predicted the participation of Gq/11 in intracellular vesicle trafficking (20Wilson B.S. Komuro M. Farquhar M.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 13: 233-244Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Ibarrondo J. Joubert D. Dufour M.N. Cohen-Solal A. Homburger V. Jard S. Guillon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8413-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), such a role has not been conclusively demonstrated. In the present study, we have described a role for Gq/11 on secretory vesicles in exocytosis. We showed the localization of Gq/11 on zymogen granules by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry. We next demonstrated that Gq/11 antagonist peptide GPAnt-2a augmented calcium-stimulated amylase release from permeabilized acini. Furthermore, we observed that GPAnt-2a inhibited GTPase activity of both zymogen granules and immunopurified Gq/11 from zymogen granules. Accordingly, it is suggested that GPAnt-2a enhanced calcium-induced amylase secretion from permeabilized acini by inhibiting GTPase activity of Gq/11 on zymogen granules. Of central importance to our evaluation of the role of αq/11 on zymogen granule membranes is the purity of the granules and the certainty that the observed signal is not due to contamination with Gq/11-rich plasma membrane. The preparation of granules makes use of the high density of intact granules which band in Percoll gradients separate from other organelles and are enriched 250–500-fold relative to DNA (nuclei), glutamate dehydrogenase (mitochondria), and NADH dehydrogenase (endoplasmic reticulum) (26Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a recent study the purified granule preparation was used to show the absence of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release in purified granules (38Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikeiwicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) although both are present in contaminating membranes present in crude granules prepared by simple differential centrifugation. Finally, in the present work αo, αs, α subunits of the sodium pump, phospholipase Cβ1, and CCKA receptors were all identified in the plasma membrane but not zymogen granule membranes; if the granule membranes were contaminated with as little as 1% of plasma membranes we would have detected saturable CCK binding in the granule membranes. The results with CCK binding are especially useful since there is a large and quantifiable signal in plasma membranes. Finally, the immunohistochemistry reveals specific labeling of the zymogen granules that could be completed by preincubating antisera with the immunizing peptide. Thus, the data as a whole makes a convincing case that αq/11 is present on the zymogen granules. G-proteins have been suggested to be involved in a late step of exocytosis as a result of observations obtained using permeabilized cell systems. When a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS was introduced into neutrophils (1Barrowman M.M. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), mast cells (2Howell T.W. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), insulin secreting RIN cells (3Vallar L. Biden T.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5049-5056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chromaffin cells (39Bader M.F. Sontag J.M. Thierse D. Aunis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16426-16434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence of free calcium, exocytosis was markedly enhanced. These findings strongly supported the involvement of G-proteins in the late steps of exocytosis. However, since GTPγS can activate both heterotrimeric G-proteins and small G-proteins, other reagents specific to trimeric G-proteins are required to analyze their function in exocytosis. AlF4−and mastoparan, both of which are known to be specific activators of heterotrimeric G-proteins, have been intensively used in permeabilized cell systems. When AlF4− was introduced into permeabilized secretory cells, their calcium-stimulated exocytosis was enhanced (40Sorimachi M. Nishimura S. Yamagami K. Yada T. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1988; 38: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 41Sorimachi M. Nisimura S. Sadano H. Biomed. Res. 1987; 8: 205-209Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or attenuated (17Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings strengthen the idea that heterotrimeric G-proteins are involved in the late steps of exocytosis. Although AlF4− is a powerful tool for studying heterotrimeric G-proteins, it activates all isoforms. By contrast, mastoparan, an amphiphilic tetradecapeptide purified from wasp venom, is more specific to inhibitory heterotrimeric G-proteins Gi and Go (42Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sukumar M. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Application of mastoparan to permeabilized cell systems suggest the direct linkage of Gi or Go to the exocytotic machinery (44Ozaki Y. Matsumoto Y. Yatomi Y. Higashihara M. Kariya T. Kume S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 45Wheeler-Jones C.P. Saermark T. Kakkar V.V. Authi K.S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23297-23306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to mastoparan, pertussis toxin is also a specific tool to analyze Gi and Go. It catalyzes their ADP-ribosylation, and results in their non-responsiveness to activating signals. Thus pertussis toxin pretreatment affected the exocytosis induced by exogenously introduced free calcium into permeabilized chromaffin cells (47Sontag J.M. Thierse D. Rouot B. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 48Ohara-Imaizumi M. Kameyama K. Kawae N. Takeda K. Muramatsu S. Kumakura K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2275-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the participation of mastoparan and pertussis toxin sensitive G-proteins, Gi and Go, in the late steps of exocytosis have been intensively studied in these cells. Gi and Go were recently found on small synaptic vesicles of neuronal cells by immunocytochemistry, and Go has also been found on large dense core vesicles of adrenal chromaffin cells (49Ahnert-Hilger G. Schafer T. Spicher K. Grund C. Schultz G. Wiedenmann B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 26-38PubMed Google Scholar). In exocrine tissues, both Gi and Go have been reported on parotid secretory granule membranes by Western blotting (50Watson E.L. DiJulio D. Kauffman D. Iversen J. Robinovitch M.R. Izutsu K.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since various proteins on secretory vesicles play important roles at the step of vesicle docking and fusion with plasma membrane (51Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 52Wagner A.C. Williams J.A. Digestion. 1994; 55: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), heterotrimeric G-proteins on secretory vesicles are now assumed to be one of the G-proteins involved in the late steps of exocytosis. Recently, Vitale et al. (17Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vitale N. Deloulme J.C. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30293-30298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Go on secretory granules has an inhibitory effect on the final stages of exocytosis in chromaffin cells. In insulin-secreting β-cells, Konrad et al. (19Konrad R.J. Young R.A. Record R.D. Smith R.M. Butkerait P. Manning D. Jarett L. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12869-12876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have described that Gi on insulin containing vesicles plays a stimulatory role in the mastoparan-induced insulin secretion. These data suggest that different heterotrimeric G-proteins on secretory granules play distinct roles in regulated exocytosis. Concerning other heterotrimeric G-proteins, Gs is shown to be localized to secretory granule membranes of neuroendocrine tissues and parotid glands (20Wilson B.S. Komuro M. Farquhar M.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 13: 233-244Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar,48Ohara-Imaizumi M. Kameyama K. Kawae N. Takeda K. Muramatsu S. Kumakura K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2275-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, little is known about its function. Gq/11 has not previously been reported on secretory granules although it was shown to exist in the Golgi apparatus in some neuroendocrine cells (20Wilson B.S. Komuro M. Farquhar M.G. Endocrinology. 1994; 13: 233-244Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and pancreatic acini (33Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Its function in the Golgi is still unclear. In the current study, we have shown that Gq/11 is present on pancreatic zymogen granules and acts to inhibit calcium-triggered exocytosis. These findings are consistent with the previous evidence that G-proteins interact with intracellular calcium to bring about exocytosis (2Howell T.W. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 53Gomperts B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 591-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our findings that Gq/11 antagonist GPAnt2a potently augmented calcium-induced amylase secretion, but not basal secretion, reinforces the synergistic role of Gq/11 with intracellular free calcium in regulated exocytosis. Currently, the process of exocytosis is thought to occur in two phases. The first step of docking and fusion of primed secretory vesicles to plasma membranes is completed in the first 5 min. The second step is the sequential release of vesicles from a reserve pool (54Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). According to this theory, our findings that GPAnt-2a potently enhanced the initial amylase release over a 5-min incubation suggests that the target protein of GPAnt-2a, Gq/11, acts on the docking and fusion steps of exocytosis in acinar cells. Taken together, it is reasonable to speculate that the Gq/11 target of GPAnt-2a is on the zymogen granules. To confirm our hypothesis, we examined the GPAnt-2a effect on both zymogen granules and Gq/11 isolated from zymogen granules. GPAnt-2a inhibited both GTPase activities. Thus we have concluded that Gq/11 on zymogen granules tonically inhibits calcium-induced amylase release from pancreatic acini. Heterotrimeric G-proteins exist on plasma membranes as a complex of α, β, and γ subunits at resting state, and separates into free α subunit and a βγ complex when activated; β,γ subunits are assumed always to exist as a complex (55Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 56Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We have shown that β-subunit as well as αq/11 is localized to zymogen granule membranes. Although we did not evaluate the presence of γ subunits, it is reasonable to conclude that Gq/11 exists as a complete complex of all three subunits on zymogen granules. In the classical signal transduction pathway involving Gq/11 on the plasma membrane, phospholipase C is the sole effector protein known thus far. In our Western blotting studies, we could detect phospholipase Cβ1 in the plasma membrane-rich fraction but not in zymogen granule membranes (Fig. 2 B). Although this observation reinforces the purity of the zymogen granule membrane preparation, it concomitantly implies that the effector of the Gq/11 on zymogen granules still remains uncertain. F-actin has been assumed to play inhibitory roles in exocytosis by blocking secretory vesicle movement toward the plasma membrane (57Vitale M.L. Rodriguez Del Castillo A. Tchakarov L. Trifaro J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Vitaleet al. speculated that the G-protein which is involved in the negative control of exocytosis may be coupled with some component controlling the subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton and the movement of secretory granules to the exocytotic sites (17Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thierse D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their speculation is based on results concerning Go of chromaffin secretory granules. However, the interaction between Go and F-actin is not yet elucidated. On the other hand, Ibarrondo et al.(37Ibarrondo J. Joubert D. Dufour M.N. Cohen-Solal A. Homburger V. Jard S. Guillon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8413-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have recently reported the close association of Gq/11with F-actin filaments in mammary tumor cell line. Moreover, it was shown that assembly and disassembly of F-actin are essential to the final steps of exocrine pancreatic exocytosis (54Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is more likely for Gq/11 that some protein(s) which regulates the actin network organization might be the effector of the G-proteins on secretory granules. Alternatively, the possibility still remains that undefined isoforms of phospholipase C might exist on zymogen granules as an effector of Gq/11. In any case, further studies are needed to elucidate the effector of Gq/11 on zymogen granules. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a tonic inhibitory action of Gq/11 which localizes to zymogen granules in pancreatic acinar exocytosis. These observations provide new insights for understanding the synergistic regulation of exocytosis by intracellular calcium and G-proteins. We thank R. W. Holz, R. R. Neubig, and S. M. Wade for their valuable suggestions and technical advice. The excellent technical assistance of Noel Wys is gratfully acknowledged."

https://openalex.org/W2333562168,"Compelling evidence indicates that p53 acts as a transcription factor and that this activity is regulated by several factors including subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of the protein. To learn more about how these two processes determine whether p53 becomes activated, we studied the temperature sensitive murine p53, p53val135. At nonpermissive temperatures, p53val135 remains sequestered in the cytoplasm of cells which express it. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that, under these conditions, the protein lacked DNA binding activity. However, by shifting to the permissive temperature, p53val135 became concentrated in the nucleus, hyperphosphorylated, and had acquired the ability to bind DNA in a sequence specific manner. This was accompanied by the induction of two p53 regulated genes, mdm2 and p21waf1, which indicated that p53val135 had become an active transcription factor. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis and tryptic peptide mapping showed that entry into the nucleus resulted in the appearance of new phosphorylated isoforms and that the protein had become extensively phosphorylation at the N-terminus. Notably, phosphorylation at the N-terminus occurred only in the nucleus, whereas phosphorylation at the C-terminus could occur in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Based on these observations, we suggest that phosphorylation of p53's N-terminus is compartmentally restricted."
https://openalex.org/W2322004903,"The Pebpb2/Cbfb gene encodes the non-DNA binding subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor, PEBP2/CBF. To examine the expression of the PEBP2β/CBFβ protein in vivo, we carried out immunohistochemistry using the tissues from adult mice as well as embryos. Although PEBP2β/CBFβ was detected in various tissues to various degrees, interesting features of expression were observed in the skeletal myogenic cells. Here PEBP2β/CBFβ was found mainly to occur as cytoplasmic staining and the intensity of this staining increased depending on the differentiation stage of the cells. In the undifferentiated myoblasts PEBP2β/CBFβ was undetectable, whereas moderate levels of PEBP2β/CBFβ were detected in the elongated and aligned myocytes. PEBP2β/CBFβ appeared to accumulate further when the cells fused to each other to become multinucleated myotubes. Once the muscle fibers were established, PEBP2β/CBFβ was relocated onto or around the Z-lines. PEBP2β/CBFβ was also detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac myocytes and in the smooth muscle cells of the digestive tract. In all the above, the skeletal myotubes were the only case that showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of PEBP2β/CBFβ. Thus, we could show differentiation dependent pattern of PEBP2β/CBFβ expression in muscle development and establish PEBP2β/CBFβ to be a cytoplasmic as well as nuclear protein in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2020772198,"The human small nuclear (sn) RNA promoters contain a proximal sequence element (PSE), which recruits the basal transcription factor SNAPc, and a distal sequence element characterized by an octamer sequence, which recruits the POU domain transcription factor Oct-1. The Oct-1 POU domain and SNAPc bind cooperatively to probes containing a PSE and an octamer sequence, and this effect contributes to efficient transcription in vitro. In vivo, however, Oct-1 regions outside of the POU domain can activate snRNA gene transcription. Here, we have examined whether the role of these regions is to contribute to cooperative binding with SNAPc. We find that they indeed improve cooperative binding, but most of the effect is nevertheless mediated by just the POU domain. This suggests that Oct-1 activates transcription of snRNA genes in at least two steps, recruitment of SNAPc mediated primarily by the POU domain, and a later step mediated by regions outside of the POU domain. We also show that a PSE-binding complex observed in nuclear extracts consists of Oct-1 and SNAPc. Although Oct-1 cannot bind effectively to the PSE probe on its own, in the complex it contacts DNA. Thus, in a nuclear extract, SNAPc can recruit Oct-1 to a probe to which Oct-1 cannot bind on its own.

Transcriptional activators are key regulators of RNA polymerase II transcription, but their mode of action is still poorly understood. Activators often consist of a DNA-binding domain, whose role is to target the activator to the correct promoter, and of activation domains, whose role is to enhance transcription (1Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The activation domains may help recruit members of the basal transcription machinery to the promoter, enhance transcription elongation, or perhaps trigger modifications of the basal machinery that result in enhanced transcription initiation (2Lieberman P.M.

The octamer constitutes a binding site for both the Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domain transcription factors, but the distal sequence element is thought to recruit Oct-1. Indeed, like snRNA genes, Oct-1 is broadly expressed, whereas Oct-2 is a B cell-specific factor (see Ref. 12Cleary M.A. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, for a review). Moreover, in vivo, the Oct-1 and Oct-2 activation domains display promoter specific activities; the Oct-1 activation domains preferentially activate snRNA promoters, whereas the Oct-2 activation domains preferentially activate transcription from mRNA promoters (13Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This differential activation results from differences in the mRNA and snRNA basal promoter elements, suggesting that the Oct-1 and Oct-2 activation domains interact differentially with promoter-specific basal transcription factors (13Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Both the Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domains bind cooperatively with SNAPc/PTF to a probe containing a PSE and an octamer sequence, and at least in the case of the Oct-1 POU domain, this cooperative binding promotes increased levels of transcription in vitro (9Murphy S. Yoon J.-B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The observation that in vivo, Oct-1 regions outside of the POU domain activate snRNA gene transcription, and do so much more efficiently than Oct-2 regions outside of the POU domain, suggests that the POU domain is not sufficient for transcription activation in vivo (16Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). How do Oct-1 regions outside of the POU domain contribute, then, to transcription activation?Here we have tested whether Oct-1 regions outside of the POU DNA-binding domain play any role in cooperative binding with SNAPc to probes containing a PSE and an octamer sequence. We find that they do contribute to cooperative binding but most of the effect is mediated by the POU domain, suggesting that the Oct-1 activation domains play their primary role at a later step in the activation process. We also show that in crude nuclear extracts, a complex consisting of Oct-1 and SNAPc forms on a probe containing a PSE-binding site but lacking an octamer site. Formation of the complex is dependent on the ability of Oct-1 to bind DNA, and indeed Oct-1 contacts DNA in the complex. Thus, in the very complex mixture of proteins that constitutes a nuclear extract, SNAPc can recruit Oct-1 to a probe to which Oct-1 cannot bind on its own.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructsConstructs for PCR ProbesThe plasmids containing the H2B octamer site and human U6 PSE were previously described (15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the H2B octamer site was described previously (17Cleary M.A. Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The plasmids AD (also referred to in the text as mouse U6 PSE probe) and the mouse U6 PSE probe with the ABC mutation were generated by annealing two oligos, filling in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, cutting with BamHI and HindIII, and inserting into pUC118. This resulted in plasmids containing inserts with the sequences GGATCCGAAACTCACCCTAACTGTAAAGTAATTGTGTTTCTTGGCTTCTCGAGCCTTGTGGAAGCTTAAG and GGATCCGAAACTCCCACTACCGGTCCAGTAATTGTGTTTCTTGGCTTCTCGAGCCTT-GTGGAAGCTTAAG for the AD plasmid and the plasmid containing the mouse U6 PSE with the ABC mutation, respectively. The N7 plasmid has been previously described (18Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Probes were generated by PCR amplification of these constructs using the universal sequencing primer end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and the reverse sequencing primer. The probes AD-mutHD and AD-short were generated by PCR with the plasmid AD as a template and primers with the sequences TCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGACCACGAATTCG and AGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCC, respectively, substituted for the reverse sequencing primer. All the probes were generated with the same radiolabeled primer and had, therefore, the same specific activity.Expression ConstructsThe pET11c.G.POU-1 and pET11c.G.Pit-1 POU constructs, which contain the Oct-1 POU and Pit-1 POU domains fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene, were previously described (19Lai J.-S. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Aurora R. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The constructs pET11c.H.Oct-1 and pET11c.H.1.P.1 were generated by PCR amplification of a plasmid containing the Oct-1 coding sequence and pBSoct-1(H)P(Pf)1 (20Aurora R. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), respectively, using oligonucleotides with the sequences GGGAATTCCATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACAACAATCCGTCAGAAACCAG and ACGCGGATCCTCACTGTGCCTTGGAGGC. The PCR products were cleaved withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET11c cleaved with NdeI and BamHI.Sources of ProteinsSNAPcThe SNAPc used in these experiments was derived from a Mono Q peak fraction, which corresponds to the fourth step in the purification of SNAPc and is purified approximately 2,500-fold (10Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The total protein concentration in the fraction is approximately 0.3 mg/ml.Expression and Purification of Oct Proteins in Escherichia coliAll proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells using the T7 expression system (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Aurora R. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Oct-1 POU, Oct-1 POU R49A, and Pit-1 POU domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins and were purified with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). In some cases the GST moiety was removed by cleavage with thrombin and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. In all cases the proteins appeared to be greater than 90% pure. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad).Histidine-tagged proteins were produced by growing 1-liter cultures ofE. coli BL21 (DE3) cells expressing histidine-tagged Oct-1 (H.Oct-1) or histidine tagged Oct-1.P.1 (H.Oct-1.P.1) as described above. The cells were lysed by sonication in OctQ buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was collected and passed over a Mono Q 10/10 column (Pharmacia). The flow-through fractions were kept and dialyzed against OctQ buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Protein was applied to a 1.5-ml Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 40 mm imidazole. Fractions containing octamer binding activity were then dialyzed against OctQ buffer containing 100 mmNaCl and applied to a Mono S 5/5 column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a salt gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing octamer binding activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D. Protein purity and concentration were assessed by the same method as with the POU domains above except that the protein gels were stained with silver. For both Oct-1 and Oct-1.P.1, a number of truncated proteins were visible below the full-length products. Oct-2 and the Oct-2 POU domain were a generous gift of Dr. Masafumi Tanaka (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory).Nuclear ExtractsHeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar).EMSAThe binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing final concentrations of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μg of fetal calf serum as a protein carrier, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg each of poly(dI-dC) and pUC118. The amounts of SNAPc and Oct proteins added are indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before addition of 25,000 cpm (50–100 pg) of radiolabeled DNA probe followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. The reactions were electrophoresed through 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio, 39:1) in 1 × TGE running buffer (50 mm Tris base, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA) at 150 V for 4.5 h at room temperature. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. The intensities of the signals were measured with a Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImager.OP-Cu FootprintingEMSA reactions containing 16 μl of SNAPc, O.4 μg of His-Oct-1, and 100,000 cpm of DNA probe in a total volume of 80 μl were performed as described above. In-gel footprinting reactions were performed essentially as described (23Sigman D.S. Kuwabara M.D. Chen C.-H.B. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 414-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) except that the reactions were performed at 4 °C. The gel was washed with 600 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The wash solution was removed and the gel was immersed in 400 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 ml of solution A (2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 0.45 mmCuSO4), and 40 ml of solution B (58 mm3-mercaptopropionic acid). The cleavage reaction was allowed to proceed for 13 min and stopped by the addition of 40 ml of 28 mm2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline. The gel was incubated for an additional 15 min at 4 °C and 10 min at room temperature. The gel was subject to autoradiography and the bands corresponding to specific protein-DNA complexes, as well as free probe, were excised. Gel slices were eluted overnight in 0.4 ml of 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Eluted DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform (1:1), precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide (19:1), 8 m urea, 0.5 × TBE sequencing gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed.DISCUSSIONThe snRNA promoters contain an enhancer, the distal sequence element, which is nearly always characterized by the presence of an octamer sequence as well as, in some cases, an Sp1-binding site (28Hernandez N. Cold Spring Harbor Monogr. Ser. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-313Google Scholar). This contrasts with the enhancers of mRNA promoters, which differ from one promoter to the next and can consist of a wide variety of protein-binding sites. Consistent with the uniformity of the distal sequence element, basal transcription from snRNA promoters is activated by Oct-1 activation domains and a glutamine-rich activation domain derived from Sp1 (13Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but not, in general, by activation domains derived from other activators. For example, the VP16 or Oct-2 activation domains do not activate snRNA gene transcription (13Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,16Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka M. Grossniklaus U. Herr W. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1764-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This selectivity suggests that the Oct-1 activation domains exert their action on a snRNA promoter-specific transcription factor, such as SNAPc.The Oct-1 DNA-binding domain (POU domain) has been shown before to bind cooperatively with SNAPc to a probe containing a PSE and an octamer motif (9Murphy S. Yoon J.-B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, a possibility is that the role of the Oct-1 activation domains is to reinforce this effect. Indeed, we find that the Oct-1 regions outside of the POU domain contribute to cooperative binding with SNAPc, and the effect is significantly larger than that observed with Oct-2 regions outside of the POU domain. There is, therefore, a correlation between the ability of the Oct-1 and Oct-2 regions outside of the POU domain to recruit SNAPc to the PSE and to enhance snRNA gene transcriptionin vivo (14Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, most of the SNAPcrecruitment effect is contributed by the POU domain, suggesting that the main function of the Oct-1 activation domains is different. They may be involved either in recruiting other members of the basal machinery, perhaps other snRNA-promoter specific factors, or, for example, in inducing conformational changes in the basal machinery that result in more efficient transcription.While characterizing a PSE-binding complex observed in crude nuclear extracts, we found that it consists of SNAPc and Oct-1. This was unexpected, because Oct-1 on its own did not bind effectively to the probe, and our previous results had indicated that cooperative binding of Oct-1 and SNAPc to DNA requires the presence of both a PSE and an octamer motif (15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, we find that within the complex, Oct-1 contacts DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and that this contact is required for formation of the complex. Thus, as we had observed previously, cooperative binding of SNAPc and Oct-1 to DNA requires Oct-1-DNA contacts. Interestingly, the location of these contacts relative to the location of the PSE is flexible and changes on different probes. This is consistent with the observation that neither the distance between the octamer sequence and the PSE (9Murphy S. Yoon J.-B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) nor the orientation of the octamer (15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), are critical for cooperative binding.The POU domain consists of two helix-turn-helix-containing DNA-binding structures, the POU homeodomain (POUH) and the POU-specific domain (POUS), joined together by a flexible linker (30Herr W.

Cooperative binding of the Oct-1 POU domain and SNAPc can be disrupted by a single amino acid change within the POUS domain, which maps to the surface of helix 1 away from the DNA and has no effect on DNA binding (15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that the POUS domain is involved in direct protein-protein interactions with SNAPc, and that its position may, therefore, be fixed relative to SNAPc and the PSE. We show here that cooperative binding can also be disrupted by a single amino acid mutation within the POUS domain that maps to the surface of helix 3 pointing toward the DNA and that affects DNA binding (12Cleary M.A. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that the POUS domain also contacts the DNA in the complex. How, then, can there be so much flexibility in the spacing between the PSE and the sequences contacted by Oct-1 POU? Perhaps the POUS domain-DNA contact is transient, occurring only during formation of the trimeric complex, whereas the POUH domain remains bound to DNA in the formed complex. Or perhaps the location of the POUS domain-DNA contact is dictated more by protein-protein interactions with SNAPcthan by specific DNA sequence. In contrast, the position of the POUH may be much more dependent on local DNA sequences than on the position of SNAPc and the PSE. Indeed, the sequence ATT (or AAT on the other strand) constitutes part of the AAAT sequence recognized by the POUH domain on a histone H2B-octamer site (33Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Thus, perhaps on different probes, the relative locations of the Oct-1 POUS and POUH domains changes, the first being dictated mainly by the location of SNAPc, and the second by the local DNA sequence. Alternatively, SNAPc may itself be flexible, allowing different positionings of Oct-1 on the DNA while maintaining protein-protein contacts. Transcriptional activators are key regulators of RNA polymerase II transcription, but their mode of action is still poorly understood. Activators often consist of a DNA-binding domain, whose role is to target the activator to the correct promoter, and of activation domains, whose role is to enhance transcription (1Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The activation domains may help recruit members of the basal transcription machinery to the promoter, enhance transcription elongation, or perhaps trigger modifications of the basal machinery that result in enhanced transcription initiation (2Lieberman P.M.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and a distal sequence element, which serves as a transcriptional enhancer and is characterized by the presence of an octamer sequence. The octamer constitutes a binding site for both the Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domain transcription factors, but the distal sequence element is thought to recruit Oct-1. Indeed, like snRNA genes, Oct-1 is broadly expressed, whereas Oct-2 is a B cell-specific factor (see Ref. 12Cleary M.A. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, for a review). Moreover, in vivo, the Oct-1 and Oct-2 activation domains display promoter specific activities; the Oct-1 activation domains preferentially activate snRNA promoters, whereas the Oct-2 activation domains preferentially activate transcription from mRNA promoters (13Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This differential activation results from differences in the mRNA and snRNA basal promoter elements, suggesting that the Oct-1 and Oct-2 activation domains interact differentially with promoter-specific basal transcription factors (13Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both the Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domains bind cooperatively with SNAPc/PTF to a probe containing a PSE and an octamer sequence, and at least in the case of the Oct-1 POU domain, this cooperative binding promotes increased levels of transcription in vitro (9Murphy S. Yoon J.-B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Mittal V. Cleary M.A. Herr W. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The observation that in vivo, Oct-1 regions outside of the POU domain activate snRNA gene transcription, and do so much more efficiently than Oct-2 regions outside of the POU domain, suggests that the POU domain is not sufficient for transcription activation in vivo (16Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). How do Oct-1 regions outside of the POU domain contribute, then, to transcription activation? Here we have tested whether Oct-1 regions outside of the POU DNA-binding domain play any role in cooperative binding with SNAPc to probes containing a PSE and an octamer sequence. We find that they do contribute to cooperative binding but most of the effect is mediated by the POU domain, suggesting that the Oct-1 activation domains play their primary role at a later step in the activation process. We also show that in crude nuclear extracts, a complex consisting of Oct-1 and SNAPc forms on a probe containing a PSE-binding site but lacking an octamer site. Formation of the complex is dependent on the ability of Oct-1 to bind DNA, and indeed Oct-1 contacts DNA in the complex. Thus, in the very complex mixture of proteins that constitutes a nuclear extract, SNAPc can recruit Oct-1 to a probe to which Oct-1 cannot bind on its own.

https://openalex.org/W2332790051,"The p53 protein is known to play a central role in mediating G1 arrest or apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation in some cell types. It has been proposed that the link between p53 and induction of apoptosis is provided in part by p53-mediated upregulation of BAX. In this study, we used the human SW626 ovarian cancer cell line, which lacks functional p53, to further investigate the relationship between wildtype p53, BAX, and apoptosis. SW626 cells expressing a temperature sensitive (ts) p53 mutant did not undergo G1 arrest or apoptosis and did not exhibit enhanced sensitivity to radiation at the permissive temperature of 32 degrees C. The tsp53 protein was functional in these cells as evidenced by rapid induction of p21 at 32 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, restoration of wildtype p53 function at 32 degrees C was not associated with BAX upregulation. In addition, stable overexpression of BAX in SW626 cells was not capable of enhancing apoptotic cell death in response to radiation. Thus, failure of p53 to upregulate BAX is not the sole reason for its inability to promote radiation-induced apoptosis in SW626 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that neither p53 nor BAX upregulation is sufficient for the induction of apoptosis in response to genotoxic damage in some cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2409472563,"Overexpression of the bcl-2 oncogene in the lymphoid compartment of transgenic mice prolongs the lifespan of lymphocytes and leads to a low incidence of lymphomas at later age. Transgenic mice carrying a mutated T-cell receptor lacking the variable domain (ΔV-TCRβ) suffer from lymphocyte depletion and are highly predisposed to lymphoma development. We intercrossed Bcl-2-Ig and ΔV-TCRβ transgenic mice to assess whether Bcl-2 could synergize with ΔV-TCRβ in tumorigenesis as reported previously for other oncogenes. Surprisingly, bitransgenic ΔV-TCRβ; bcl-2-Ig mice showed a reduction in the incidence of lymphomas. Analyses of prelymphomatous mice showed that Bcl-2 restored some of the phenotypic aberrations caused by the ΔV-TCRβ transgene in the lymphoid compartment. The inhibitory activity of Bcl-2 on ΔVTCRβ-induced lymphomagenesis was not observed when both transgenes were crossed into the RAG-1−/− background suggesting an important role for more mature lymphocytes in this phenomenon. These results show that, depending on the specific conditions, overexpression of Bcl-2 can both promote as well as impair lymphoma development."
