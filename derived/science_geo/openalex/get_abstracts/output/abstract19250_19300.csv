https://openalex.org/W1968814677,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are multifunctional cytokines with many similar activities. LIF is structurally and functionally related to another cytokine, Oncostatin M (OSM), that binds to the high-affinity LIF receptor but not to the low-affinity LIF receptor. A complementary DNA was isolated that encodes the high-affinity converting subunit of the LIF receptor. The converter conferred high-affinity binding of both LIF and OSM when expressed with the low-affinity LIF receptor and is identical to the signal transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor, gp130. The gp130 subunit alone confers low-affinity binding of OSM when expressed in COS-7 cells. This receptor system resembles the high-affinity receptors for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, and IL-5, which share a common subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2049773295,"Presentation of cytoplasmic antigens to class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells implied the existence of a specialized peptide transporter. For most class I heavy chains, association with peptides of the appropriate length is required for stable assembly with beta 2-microglobulin. Mutant cells RMA-S and .174/T2 neither assemble stable class I molecules nor present intracellular antigens, and we have suggested that they have lost a function required for the transport of short peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum. The genetic defect in .174 has been localized to a large deletion in the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex, within which two genes (RING4 and RING11) have been identified that code for 'ABC' (ATP-binding cassette) transporters. We report here that the protein products of these two genes assemble to form a complex. Defects in either protein result in the formation of unstable class I molecules and loss of presentation of intracellular antigens. The molecular defect in a new mutant, BM36.1, is shown to be in the ATP-binding domain of the RING11/PSF2 protein. This is in contrast to the mutant .134, which lacks the RING4/PSF1 protein."

https://openalex.org/W2070054628,"Oncostatin M, a cytokine produced by activated lymphoid cells, regulates the growth and differentiation of a number of tumor and normal cells. In contrast to its effects on normal endothelial and aortic smooth muscle cell cultures, Oncostatin M was a potent mitogen for cells derived from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS). After exposure to Oncostatin M, AIDS-KS cells assumed a spindle morphology, had an increased ability to proliferate in soft agar, and secreted increased amounts of interleukin-6. Oncostatin M RNA and immunoreactive Oncostatin M protein were found in AIDS-KS-derived cell isolates. These results suggest that Oncostatin M may play a role in the pathogenesis of AIDS-KS."

https://openalex.org/W2080990838,"During development of the mammalian visual system, axon terminals of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, initially intermixed within layer 4 of the visual cortex, gradually segregate according to eye preference to form ocular dominance columns. In addition to LGN axons and layer 4 neurons, subplate neurons may also participate in interactions leading to column formation. Deletion of subplate neurons before the formation of ocular dominance columns prevents the segregation of LGN axons within layer 4. Thus, interactions between LGN axons and layer 4 neurons are not sufficient; subplate neurons are also required for formation of ocular dominance columns in the visual cortex."

A protein of 30 kilodaltons was purified from conditioned medium that supports the growth of AIDS-KS cells. The amino-terminal sequence of this protein was identical to the amino-terminal sequence of Oncostatin M, a glycoprotein that inhibits the growth of a variety of cancer cells. Oncostatin M from conditioned medium stimulated a twofold increase in the growth of AIDS-KS cells at a concentration of less than 1 nanogram of the protein per milliliter of medium."
https://openalex.org/W2093586327,"CELL polarization requires that a cellular axis or cell-surface site be chosen and that the cytoskeleton be organized with respect to it. Details of the link between the cytoskeleton and the chosen axis or site are not clear1. Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit cell polarization in two phases of their life cycle, during vegetative growth and during mating, which reflects responses to intracellular and extracellular signals, respectively. Here we describe the isolation of two mutants defective specifically in cell polarization in response to peptide mating pheromones. The mutants carry special alleles (denoted bem1-s) of the BEM1 gene required for cell polarization during vegetative growth2,3. Unlike other beml mutants, the bem1-s mutants are normal for vegetative growth. Complete deletion of BEM1 leads to the defect in polarization of vegetative cells seen in beml mutants23. The predicted sequence of the BEM1 protein (Bem1p) reveals two copies of a domain (denoted SH3) that is found in many proteins associated with the cortical cytoskeleton and which may mediate binding to actin or some other component of the cell cortex4,5. The sequence of Bemlp and the properties of mutants defective in this protein indicate that it may link the cytoskeleton to morphogenetic determinants on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1560334098,"The transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family members are ubiquitously expressed and control a variety of cellular processes by interacting with at least two types of high affinity cell surface receptors. However, the primary signal transduction mechanism of the receptors is unknown. The ras-encoded 21-kDa GTP binding proteins have recently been shown to mediate the effects of other polypeptide growth factors. Here we show that both TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 (5 ng/ml) result in a rapid (within 6 or 12 min, respectively) stimulation of GTP bound to p21ras in TGF beta-sensitive intestinal epithelial cells. Further, the CCL64 epithelial cell line, extremely sensitive to growth inhibition by TGF beta, displayed a concentration-dependent increase in GTP bound to p21ras by TGF beta 1 and a rapid activation of p21ras by TGF beta 2. The results provide the first direct evidence for rapid activation of a receptor coupling component for TGF beta in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1523758704,"The alpha-amylase excreted by the antarctic bacterium Alteromonas haloplanctis was purified and the corresponding amy gene was cloned and sequenced. N- and C-terminal amino acid sequencing were used to establish the primary structure of the mature A. haloplanctis alpha-amylase which is composed of 453 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 49,340 and a pI of 5.5. Three Ca2+ ions are bound per molecule and its activity is modulated by chloride ions. Within the four consensus sequences, Asp-174, Glu-200, and Asp-264 are the proposed catalytic residues. The psychrotrophic A. haloplanctis alpha-amylase is characterized by a high amylolytic activity at low temperatures, a reduced apparent optimal temperature, and typical thermodynamic activation parameters A. haloplanctis alpha-amylase has also a low thermal stability as demonstrated by the temperature effect on both activity and secondary structure. It is suggested that structure flexibility and lower sensitivity of secondary structure to temperature variations in the low temperature range are the main structural adaptations of the psychrotrophic enzyme. The unusual stacking of small amino acids around the catalytic residues is proposed as a factor inducing active site flexibility and concomitant high activity of the enzyme at low temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2068495101,"A surface force apparatus was used to measure a long-range attractive protein-ligand force at separations D < 85 angstroms. This force may effectively ""steer"" ligand trajectories, resulting in a greater than 27-fold enhancement of the association rate. A much stronger specific attraction is measured at contact (D < 4 angstroms). A sevenfold increase in intermembrane adhesion resulted from increased lateral mobility of the receptors and molecular rearrangements in membranes above the solid-fluid transition temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1580716972,"Uracil analogues with appropriate substituents at the 5-position inactivated dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPDHase). The efficiency of these inactivators was highly dependent on the size of the 5-substituent. For example, 5-ethynyluracil inactivated DHPDHase with an efficiency (kinact/Ki) that was 500-fold greater than that for 5-propynyluracil. 5-Ethynyluracil inactivated DHPDHase by initially forming a reversible complex with a Ki of 1.6 +/- 0.2 microM. This initial complex yielded inactivated enzyme with a rate constant of 20 +/- 2 min-1 (kinact). Thymine competitively decreased the apparent rate constant for inactivation of DHPDHase by 5-ethynyluracil. The absorbance spectrum of 5-ethylnyluracil-inactivated DHPDHase was different from that of reduced enzyme. These optical changes were correlated with the loss of enzymatic activity. 5-Ethynyluracil inactivated DHPDHase with a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol of inactivator per mol of active site. Enzyme inactivated with [2-14C]5-ethynyluracil retained all of the radiolabel after denaturation in 8 M urea, but lost radiolabel under acidic conditions. These results suggested that inactivation was due to covalent modification of an amino acid residue and not due to modification of a noncovalently bound prosthetic group. A radiolabeled peptide was isolated from a tryptic digest of the enzyme inactivated with [2-14C]5-ethynyluracil. The sequence of this peptide was Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Ser-Gly-Ala-Y-Ala-Leu-Glu-Leu-Asn-Leu-Ser-X-Pro-His-Gly- Met-Gly-Glu-Arg, where X and Y were unidentified amino acids. Since the radiolabel was lost from the peptide during the first cycle on the amino acid sequenator, the position of the radiolabeled amino acid was not determined. The amino acid residue designated by X was identified as a cysteine from previous work with DHPDHase inactivated with 5-iodouracil. In contrast to 5-ethynyluracil, 5-cyanouracil was a reversible inactivator of the enzyme. 5-Cyanouracil-inactivated enzyme slowly regained activity (t1/2 = 1.8 min) after dilution into the standard assay. DHPDHases isolated from rat, mouse, and human liver had similar sensitivities to inactivation by 5-alkynyluracils."

https://openalex.org/W1507048810,"Abstract Activation of platelets by thrombin and other physiological agonists leads to a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins (Ferrell, J. E., and Martin, G. S. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 3606-3610; Golden, A., and Brugge, J. S. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 901-905; Nakamura, S., and Yamamura, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7089-7091). To date, none of the tyrosine kinases that are involved in platelet activation, nor the substrates that are phosphorylated in response to agonists, have been identified. A kinase strategy, designed to take advantage of the stability of known tyrosine kinase-substrate interactions, was employed to address both issues. p21rasGAP antibodies were used to examine the phosphorylated state of GAP in agonist-treated platelets and to isolate potential GAP-kinase complexes. We show that GAP and two proteins of 59 and 68 kDa are phosphorylated on tyrosine after thrombin stimulation and that three Src-related protein tyrosine kinases, Fyn, Lyn and Yes, are associated with GAP in complexes, detectable only after agonist stimulation. The thrombin-dependent detection of these kinases in GAP immunoprecipitates suggests that thrombin may either induce the formation of these complexes or activate kinases that are associated with GAP prior to, or following, agonist stimulation. This approach of trapping kinases bound to their substrates will be useful in identifying non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in signaling pathways. Furthermore, although GAP phosphorylation has been previously implicated in growth factor signaling pathways, this is the first example of its involvement downstream from a G-protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1671698008,"A high number of 125I-activin-A binding sites (an apparent Kd of 260 pM and 5,600 sites/cell) were observed on MC3T3-E1 cells, a well characterized osteoblastic cell line. Activin-A has a mitogenic effect on these cells, with the greatest influence being observed on cells in an undifferentiated state, as well as a suppressive effect on the alkaline phosphatase activity. Northern and ligand blotting analyses revealed that these osteoblastic cells produce follistatin, which was down-regulated by retinoic acid treatment. Because follistatin is an activin-A-binding protein, we suggest that activin-A modulates the function of osteoblastic cells by being regulated by follistatin during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1972931607,"Introns have generally been assumed to be passive in the transfer RNA splicing reaction. Experiments have now been done showing that the endonuclease is able to cut a precursor provided that a base in the single-stranded loop of the intron can pair with the base of the 5' exon situated at the position that immediately follows the anticodon stem (position 33 in the yeast tRNA isoacceptor pre-tRNA(Leu)3, position 32 in yeast pre-tRNA(Phe)). The elucidation of the role of the intron reveals that in addition to the conserved bases, there are positions in the mature domain which, although not necessarily occupied by the same base in all pre-tRNA's, nevertheless have a fundamental role in the splicing reaction. These positions are termed cardinal positions."
https://openalex.org/W2062279246,"Gene amplification, one example of genetic instability, is of prognostic and clinical importance in neoplasia. In tumorigenic cells, gene amplification occurs at a very high frequency, whereas in normal diploid fibroblasts the event is undetectable by the clonogenic assay. To investigate genetic control of gene amplification, amplification frequency was measured in hybrids of tumorigenic cells and normal diploid cells. The ability to amplify an endogenous gene behaved as a recessive genetic trait, and control of gene amplification potential segregated independently of tumorigenicity and immortality."
https://openalex.org/W1510111120,"Previous studies in our laboratories have revealed that juvenile visceral steatosis mice show suppressed transcription of urea cycle enzyme genes during development and are systemically deficient in carnitine. It has not yet been explained, however, how this carnitine deficiency relates to the abnormal gene expression. We investigated the effect of carnitine on abnormal gene expression, growth retardation, and fatty liver. Carnitine administration relieved the suppression of the developmental induction of two urea cycle enzymes examined, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase and argininosuccinate synthase, and kept the activities of enzymes normal. However, carnitine did not reduce accumulated lipid in the liver to the normal level. These results suggest that carnitine deficiency plays an important role in the abnormal expression of urea cycle enzyme genes and that the abnormal expression of the genes is not directly caused by lipid accumulation in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1545784480,"A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was developed that allowed us to monitor transcript levels corresponding to individual members of the cytotoxic cell proteinase (CCP) gene family during T cell activation. Selective expression was observed and shown to depend upon the mode of T cell antigen receptor stimulation. Mitogen or allogeneic stimulation of cells resulted in the appearance of transcripts corresponding to all the genes measured, whereas alpha CD3 antibody produced a response restricted to just two family members. This differential gene activation represents a heterogeneity in cytotoxic T lymphocytes that has not been recognized previously. It may indicate that the T cell branch of the immune system can distinguish between different forms of stimulation and respond by synthesizing a specific set of effector and ancillary molecules that is most appropriate for lysis of cells bearing that type of antigen. Only CCP1 transcripts correlated with cytotoxicity for all modes of stimulation. The patterns for the others are suggestive of distinct and ancillary, rather than direct effector, roles in the lytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1533974129,"Brefeldin A leads to an increase of sphingomyelin in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The antibiotic is known to cause a dramatic morphological change of the endomembrane system in various mammalian cells resulting in a redistribution of Golgi resident proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (Lippincott-Schwartz, J., Donaldson, J. G., Schweizer, A., Berger, E. G., Hauri, H. P., Yuan, L. C., and Klausner, R. D. (1990) Cell 60, 821-836). A strict correlation was found between the brefeldin A-induced increase of sphingomyelin and the biochemical criteria that apply for this morphological change. From our data we conclude that the increase in sphingomyelin caused by brefeldin A reflects translocation of the enzyme sphingomyelin synthase from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum. Using a radioactively labeled truncated ceramide this increase in sphingomyelin synthesis is easily detectable, and thus this method can serve as a convenient biochemical assay for the action of brefeldin A in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W193602970,"Previously, we isolated and characterized unique liposomal-like, cholesterol-rich lipid particles that accumulate in human atherosclerotic lesions. Human plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) has a molar ratio of total cholesterol to phospholipid (3:1) similar to that of this lesion cholesterol-rich lipid particle. However, LDL is enriched in cholesteryl ester while the lesion lipid particle is enriched in unesterified cholesterol. To examine a possible precursor-product relationship between LDL and the lesion lipid particle, we hydrolyzed the cholesteryl ester core of LDL with cholesterol esterase. Cholesteryl ester hydrolysis occurred only after LDL was treated with trypsin. Trypsin pretreatment was not required for cholesteryl ester hydrolysis of LDL oxidized with copper, a treatment that also degrades apolipoprotein B, the major protein moiety in LDL. In contrast to greater than 90% hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester in trypsin-cholesterol esterase-treated or copper-oxidized LDL, there was only 18% hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester in similarly treated high density lipoprotein. With a limited 10-min hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl ester, LDL-sized particles and newly formed larger flattened films or discs were present. With complete hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl ester, LDL particles converted to complex multilamellar, liposomal-like, structures with sizes approximately five times larger than native LDL. These liposomal-like particles derived from LDL were chemically and structurally similar to unesterified cholesterol-rich lipid particles that accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2019010747,"Hypoxia has been shown to elicit behavioral hypothermia in a number of different metazoan species, all with nervous systems. The protozoan, Paramecium caudatum, has no nervous system and was not expected to display behavioral hypothermia. However, this species was also found to select a lower temperature in a thermal gradient under hypoxic conditions. This response proved to be beneficial as survival of hypoxic paramecia was greatly increased at lower temperatures. This unicellular species may provide a useful model to investigate the cellular and molecular basis of adaptive thermoregulatory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1559820839,"A full-length rat androgen receptor cDNA was used to produce a recombinant baculovirus (AcrAR) by homologous recombination. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells infected with this virus expressed a 110-kDa polypeptide that amounted up to about one-third of total cell protein. Studies with AR antibodies confirmed that this protein was indeed rAR. Only a minor portion of the recombinant AR was soluble in buffers without ionic detergents, but its complete solubilization was achieved in 6 M guanidine HCl (GdnHCl). Electron microscopy of cell pellets revealed that AR was localized to electron-dense cytoplasmic aggregates. The soluble cytosolic receptor was biologically active, in that it bound [3H]mibolerone with high affinity and specificity and interacted with an androgen-responsive element. The functions of the GdnHCl-solubilized AR were partially restored by a 20-50-fold dilution. The solubilized receptor was purified to an apparent homogeneity in a single step by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-400 column in the presence of 6 M GdnHCl. The homogeneous AR protein could be renatured to bind [3H]mibolerone, interact specifically with a DNA element, and be recognized by receptor antibodies. Receptor-DNA interaction was stabilized by an antibody directed against the N-terminal part and abolished by an antibody against the hinge region of the receptor Zn2+ ions were essential for the purified receptor to refold into a specific DNA-binding form during the renaturation, with the optimal ZnCl2 concentration being 50-100 microM depending on the buffer conditions. Cd2+ ions were also capable of restoring the receptor's DNA-binding activity and did so at concentrations 10-fold lower than those of the Zn2+ ions."
https://openalex.org/W2137420060,"Vascular factors play an important role in the pathogenesis and prevention of acute gastric mucosal lesions, Endothelin-3 (ET-3), a potent vasoactive peptide, was infused intra-arterially to induce gastric microvascular and hemorrhagic mucosal lesions, and to enhance the damaging effects of dilute HCl and ethanol. ET-3 antibody was injected intravenously to decrease hemorrhagic mucosal lesions induced by ethanol. Locally infused ET (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 nmol·100 g–1·min–1 for up to 15 min) was followed in some cases by intragastric dilute ethanol or HCl, which alone caused no or only mild vascular and mucosal lesions. Monastral blue was used to visualize and quantify vascular injury. ET-3 produced dose-dependent vascular lesions that affected the walls of mucosal capillaries and venules and induced mucosal congestion and focal endothelial labeling in vessels of the gastric muscular layers. The highest dose of ET induced hemorrhagic gastric mucosal lesions, mortality, and periods of hyper- and hypotension in the rat. Medium and low doses of ET-3 caused vascular injury, and dose-dependently potentiated the vascular and hemorrhagic mucosal lesions caused by dilute HCl and ethanol. Indomethacin slightly enhanced damage induced by ET and 50% ethanol, suggesting a limited mediatory role of prostaglandins in the ET-induced mucosal lesions. Anti-ET-3 serum dose-dependently decreased but did not abolish the hemorrhagic gastric mucosal lesions induced by 75% ethanol. Thus, ET-3 causes endothelial damage in capillaries and venules of rat stomach and predisposes to mucosal damage even after exposure to dilute ethanol or HCl. ET is more potent than leukotrienes and histamine and thus may play an important role in the mechanisms of acute gastric mucosal injury and protection where the vascular network appears to be a major target.—Morales, R. E.; Johnson, B. R.; Szabo, S. Endothelin induces vascular and mucosal lesions, enhances the injury by HCl/ethanol, and the antibody exerts gastroprotection. FASEB J. 6: 2354-2360; 1992."
https://openalex.org/W1496001421,"Human and chicken progesterone receptors (A form) were overproduced in a baculovirus expression system. These recombinant progesterone receptors were full-length bound progesterone specifically and were recognized by monoclonal antibodies, AB52 and PR22, specific for human and chicken progesterone receptor, respectively. In gel retardation studies, binding of recombinant human and chicken progesterone receptors to their progesterone response element (PRE) was specific and was enhanced in the presence of progesterone. Binding of human progesterone receptor to the PRE was also enhanced in the presence of the antiprogestin, RU486, but very little effect was observed in the presence of estradiol, dexamethasone, testosterone, and vitamin D. In our cell-free transcription system, human progesterone receptor induced transcription in a receptor-dependent and hormone-activable manner. Receptor-stimulated transcription required the presence of the PRE in the test template and could be specifically inhibited by excess PRE oligonucleotides. Furthermore, chicken progesterone receptor also induced in vitro transcription in a hormone-activable manner. These results demonstrate that steroid receptors overexpressed in a baculovirus expression system are functional and exhibit steroid-responsive binding and transcription. These observations support our present understanding of the mechanism of steroid receptor-regulated gene expression and provide a technological format for studies of the role of hormone and antihormone in altering gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1552198848,"Previous observations with type I collagen from a proband with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta demonstrated that type I collagen containing a substitution of cysteine for glycine alpha 1-748 copolymerized with normal type I collagen (Kadler, K. E., Torre-Blanco, A., Adachi, E., Vogel, B. E., Hojima, Y., and Prockop, D. J. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 5081-5088). Here, three preparations containing normal type I procollagen and type I procollagen with a substitution of cysteine for glycine alpha 1-175, glycine alpha 1-691, or glycine alpha 1-988 were purified from cultured skin fibroblasts from probands with osteogenesis imperfecta. The procollagens were then used as substrates in a system for assaying the self-assembly of type I collagen into fibrils. The cysteine-substituted collagens in all three preparations were incorporated into fibrils. The cysteine alpha 1-175 and cysteine alpha 1-691 collagens were shown to increase the lag time and decrease the propagation rate constant for fibril assembly. All three preparations containing cysteine-substituted collagens formed fibrils with diameters that were two to four times the diameter of fibrils formed under the same conditions by normal type I collagen. Also, the three preparations containing cysteine substituted collagens had higher solubilities than normal type I collagen. The results, therefore, demonstrated that the three cysteine-substituted collagens copolymerized with normal type I collagen. The effects of the mutated collagens on fibril assembly can be understood in terms of a recently proposed model of fibril growth from symmetrical tips by assuming that the mutated monomers partially inhibit tip growth but not lateral growth of the fibrils. Of special interest was the observation that the Cys alpha 1-175 collagen from a proband with a non-lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta had quantitatively less effect on several parameters of fibril assembly at 37 degrees C than cysteine-substituted collagens from three probands with lethal variants of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1548095972,"To understand how the alpha and beta 2 subunits of tryptophan synthase from Escherichia coli interact to form an alpha 2 beta 2 complex and undergo mutual activation, we have investigated alpha subunits with single amino acid replacements at conserved proline residues. Although the activities of alpha 2 beta 2 complexes that contain wild type alpha subunit or alpha subunits substituted at positions 28, 62, 96, and 207 are similar, the activities of alpha 2 beta 2 complexes that contain alpha subunits substituted at positions 57 and 132 are remarkably altered. Whereas the latter enzymes have greatly reduced activities in the individual half-reactions, they have considerably higher activities in the overall reaction. These remarkable activity results are explained by a decrease in the affinity of these mutant alpha subunits for the beta 2 subunit and by an increase in the affinity in the combined presence of ligands of both the alpha subunit and the beta 2 subunit. Isothermal calorimetric titrations of wild type beta 2 subunit with wild type alpha subunit and a mutant alpha subunit containing a substitution of glycine for proline at position 132 show that both the affinity and the exothermic association enthalpy are greatly reduced in the mutant alpha subunit although the stoichiometry of association is unchanged. The affinity of the mutant alpha subunit for the beta 2 subunits is greatly increased in the presence of an alpha subunit ligand, alpha-glycerol phosphate. We conclude that proline 132 plays a critical role in subunit interaction and in mutual subunit activation."
https://openalex.org/W1587892235,"3-Deazaadenosine analogs can function as inhibitors and also as alternative substrates of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase. In cells treated with the analogs, AdoHcy invariably accumulates, leading to inhibition of cellular methylation. F9 teratocarcinoma cells, stably transfected with two collagen (IV) promoter-enhancer-CAT constructs and treated with 10 microM 3-deazaadenosine, 3-deaza-(+-)-aristeromycin or 3-deazaneplanocin, showed a strong induction of CAT activities without affecting differentiation. In comparison, the same 3-deaza analogs did not affect the CAT activity in F9 cells transfected with the beta-actin promoter-CAT construct. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis of endogenous mRNA from wild-type F9 cells treated with the 3-deaza nucleosides all showed an induction of the collagen alpha 1(IV) chain mRNA. Thus, the 3-deaza analogs most likely affect DNA methylation because their results are consistent with the previous observation that the integrated collagen alpha 1(IV) promoter-enhancer constructs were activated with 5-azacytidine."

https://openalex.org/W1519229896,"In order to determine the role of apoprotein (apo) B conformation in the activation of the lysolecithin acyl-transferase reaction, we studied the activation of purified enzyme by various subfractions of low density lipoprotein (LDL), isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The activation of LAT correlated positively with the density of LDL and negatively with cholesterol/protein and triglyceride (TG)/protein ratios. The enzyme activation was also positively correlated with the number of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-reactive lysine amino groups, which increased with increasing density of LDL. The immunoaffinity of the LDL subfractions for B1B6, a monoclonal antibody directed to the receptor-binding region of apoB, increased with increasing density, while the affinity toward C1.4, a monoclonal antibody directed to the amino-terminal region of apoB, was not altered. Enrichment of normal whole LDL with TG resulted in a 45% reduction in enzyme activation, a 27% decrease in the number of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-reactive lysine groups, and a marked reduction in the immunoaffinity for B1B6. All these parameters reversed to normal when the TG-enriched LDL was treated with milk lipoprotein lipase, which specifically reduced the TG content of LDL. The LDL subfractions also supported cholesterol esterification by the purified enzyme, in parallel with lysolecithin esterification, indicating that apoB can also serve as an activator of the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase reaction. These results strongly suggest that the localized conformational change of apoB which occurs during the TG depletion of the precursor particle is critical for its activation of acyltransferase reactions, in a manner analogous to its interaction with the cellular receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1497113035,"The preponderance of nonpolar contacts between CoA and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in the high resolution structure of the binary complex prompted a study of selected hydrophobic residues by site-directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetic analysis. Substitutions of three aromatic residues were used to evaluate binding contacts with the adenine moiety of CoA (Tyr-178), the pantetheine arm of the coenzyme (Tyr-56), and the S-acyl substituent (Phe-33). For those substitutions at residues 56 and 178 that cannot promote alternative polar interactions there is a correlation between residue hydrophobicity and the free energy of formation of the binary and ternary complexes of acetyl-CoA and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and of the transition-state complex. Substitutions at Tyr-178 destabilize all such complexes to approximately the same extent (uniform binding changes), whereas those at Tyr-56 and Phe-33 cause differential binding changes, having a greater effect on the transition state than on either of the other complexes with acetyl-CoA."

The gene product was pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine as a protein of an apparent Mr of 34,000 on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Cell membranes overproducing the LIV-II carrier were solubilized with n-dodecyl beta-D-maltopyranoside. The carrier protein was purified from the detergent extract by two purification steps: (i) immunoaffinity column chromatography using purified polyclonal antibody directed against synthetic 13-mer peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus region of the carrier and (ii) subsequent DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The detergent was replaced by n-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside prior to the first elution and phospholipid was present during purification. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified LIV-II carrier exhibited Na+ or Li+ concentration gradient-driven transport of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These results show that the LIV-II carrier was purified to be in a functional form."

Deaminase activity could be effectively inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate. This treatment protected folate from deamination and thus allowed investigation of folate binding to deaminase fractions. Two types of folate binding sites, differing in affinity and specificity, were detected on the folate deaminase glycoprotein. One type displays high affinity and binds folate stronger than N10-methylfolate. This binding site appears to be identical with the catalytic site of folate deaminase. The other type of binding site shows lower affinity but prefers N10-methylfolate relative to folate. A similar preference for N10-methylfolate was observed in chemotaxis tests pointing to the possibility that the second type of binding site is involved in chemotactic perception of folate compounds. Folate perception and deamination could thus be performed by activities residing on the same polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1548215594,"Intact ejaculated bovine sperm incorporate 32Pi into ADP to a specific activity two to three times higher than into ATP. This contrasts with other cell types where ATP specific activity is higher than that of ADP. Predominant labeling of ADP may be partially due to compartmentation of ATP, but removal of cytosolic ATP does not change the relative labeling of ADP and ATP. Dilution of extracellular 32Pi following labeling resulted in loss of 70% of label from ADP but only 50% loss from gamma-ATP at 26 min. ADP was labeled in the absence of detectable ATP in the presence of rotenone plus antimycin. Fractionation of ejaculated sperm yielded midpieces that are depleted of adenylate kinase and have coupled respiration. ATP was labeled with 32Pi, but ADP was not in midpieces. Evidence for mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation-supported incorporation of 32Pi into nucleotides was observed for intact sperm incubated with pyruvate and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, but this activity did not occur in midpieces and does not appear to explain disproportionate labeling of ADP. We conclude that labeling of ADP in intact and permeabilized cells occurs by two pathways; one involves adenylate kinase, and the other is an unknown pathway which may be independent of ATP."
