A single nucleotide exchange in this region (AAAATTCAAT → AAGATCAAT) uncouples the expression of an AtpCpromoter::uidA gene fusion from the regulation by light, cytokinin, and functional plastids and results in a high constitutive expression of the reporter gene. By screening anArabidopsis thaliana expression library with a double-stranded wild-type oligonucleotide from this promoter region, we have isolated cDNAs from Arabidopsis libraries that code for plant homologs of the CAAT-box binding factor (CBF)-C. Binding occurs only in the presence of nuclear extracts, consistent with reports from metazoa CBFs that the subunits A and B in addition to C are required for the formation of the CBF-DNA complex. At least eight genes with homologies to CBF-C are present in theArabidopsis genome; one of them exhibits striking similarities to the gene for the human global transcriptional repressor Drap1. In gel mobility shift assays, low binding activity of CBF to the wild-type AtpC promoter sequence was observed with nuclear extracts from tissue with low AtpC expression levels,i.e. extracts from etiolated and photobleached seedlings, whereas high binding activity was detectable with extracts from tissues with high AtpC expression levels, i.e. extracts from light-grown seedlings and etiolated seedlings treated with cytokinin. Binding to the mutant sequence, which directs constitutive high level uidA expression in vivo, is significantly stronger than to the wild-type sequence. The data are consistent with the idea that the assembly of CBF at theAtpC promoter is regulated in response to light and cytokinin and that the low level of expression in etiolated and photobleached material is caused by an inhibitory effect. The structure/function relationships of the Arabidopsis CBFs are discussed in relation to their regulatory function inAtpC gene expression.

CAAT-box binding factor The plastid ATP synthase consists of nine different subunits; three of them are encoded by the nuclear genes AtpC,AtpD, and AtpG (gene products: the subunits γ and δ of the CF1 moiety and CFoII (1Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Bichler J. Schneiderbauer A. Steppuhn J. Wedel N. Tyagi A.K. Westhoff P. Herrmann R.G. Larkins B.A. Plant Molecular Biology. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 411-427Google Scholar)). Expression of these genes is strongly regulated in response to cell-internal and -external factors such as light, phytohormones, diurnal light changes, functional plastids, or factors determining organ and tissue specificity (cf.

Expression analysis of promoter::reporter gene fusions in transgenic tobacco seedlings suggested that these regulators influence transcription and defined cis-acting elements, which are involved in these processes (3Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to many photosynthesis genes, essential cis-elements determining the regulated expression of AtpC are positioned in close vicinity of the respective transcription start sites (3Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and crucial nucleotides for the light-regulated, plastid-dependent, and organ-specific expression appear to be located within a segment, which might also be involved in the assembly of the CAAT-box binding complex. Here we describe the isolation of cDNAs encoding the subunit C of the CAAT-box binding factor CBF1(7Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), a plant homolog of the previously characterized CBF from metazoa (8McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 9: 47-58Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that CBF-C is part of a complex that binds to the CAAT-box of AtpC, and we provide evidence that the binding activity is regulated in response to the above-mentioned regulators. In addition, binding of CBF-C to various mutant sequencesin vitro corresponds to the promoter activitiesin vivo. This suggests that expression of AtpC is regulated by the assembly of CBF and that low levels of expression result from the repression of CBF assembly. At least eight homologs of CBF-C are present in the Arabidopsis genome, and one of them exhibits striking similarities to the human DRAP1, a general inhibitor of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Tobacco seeds were surface-sterilized, planted on one-half strength Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2% sucrose in the presence or absence of Norflurazon (10−6m) and kept in the cold room in darkness for 2 days to synchronize germination. Seedlings were either kept in darkness for 10 days at 22 °C, or they were transferred to white light 20 h before harvest in the absence (L) or presence (L/NF) of Norflurazon. To test the effect of cytokinin onAtp gene expression, etiolated seedlings were transferred to cytokinin-containing plates (N 6 -benzylaminopurine, 10−5m) in darkness 20 h before harvest. 36 h before phytohormone application, the seedlings were illuminated with red light (7 Watt·meter−2) for 12 h. In herbicide-treated seedlings, the red light treatment severely affected plastid development; the untreated material served as a control. The transgenic lines with AtpC and AtpDpromoter::uidA gene fusions have been described (3Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A spontaneous mutation of the AtpC region −73/+173 was obtained in which a single A nucleotide was exchanged to G (AAAATTCAAT → AAGATCAAT). The mutant promoter segment was excised from pBSC+ as an 5′-SalI-BamHI-3′ fragment and cloned into pBI 101.1. The plasmid was transferred into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum Samsun var.) by leaf disc transformation. 15 plants were regenerated, and their seeds were harvested individually. The β-glucuronidase assay has been described (3Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cotyledons and the upper part of the hypocotyls were harvested for the enzyme assay. For Northern analysis RNA was isolated from approximately 150 seedlings with the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). An equal amount of RNA (3 μg) was loaded per lane, and the filter was hybridized to AtpC, AtpD, and AtpGgenes from Arabidopsis. Oligonucleotides for wild-type and mutant sequences were annealed (10Lübberstedt T. Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cloned into theSmaI site of pBSC+ (Stratagene, San Diego) before sequencing. Plasmids were chosen in which the 5′-end of the promoter fragment was orientated toward the BamHI site of pBSC+. Thus all promoter fragments had the following 5′- and 3′-extensions: 5′­GATCCCCC[Insert]GGGCTGCA­3′3′­GGGG[Insert]CCCG­5′SEQUENCE 1 After digestion of the plasmids with PstI andBamHI, the BamHI site was filled-in with all four radiolabeled nucleotides and the Klenow enzyme, and the fragments were gel-purified on agarose gels. For the analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA fragments on polyacrylamide gels (15%, see Fig. 6), the insertions were excised with BamHI andPstI and run either at 22 °C or 60 °C in a temperature-controlled growth chamber. For Southwestern analysis, nuclear protein extracts were isolated from 6-week-old spinach or tobacco plants grown in the greenhouse. The cauliflower was obtained from the local market. For physiological studies, nuclear extracts were prepared from the cotyledons of 2-week-old spinach seedlings, which were either kept in light or darkness, or etiolated seedlings were treated with cytokinin 48 h before harvest. The nuclear protein fraction was prepared as described (11Oelmüller R. Bolle C. Tyagi A.K. Niekrawietz N. Breit S. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Approximately 150,000 phages of an Arabidopsis thalianacDNA library were screened with the radiolabeled AtpCpromoter region (−68/−39) in the presence of nuclear extracts (1 mg/ml buffer). 4 positive phages were plaque-purified, and pBSC+ was excised according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene) before sequencing and in vitrotranscription and translation. Southwest hybridization was performed at 4 °C. The filters were first blocked with blocking buffer by gentle shaking for 3 h (SW buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% v/v glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1.5 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). After 3 washing steps (10 min each) with HS buffer (SW buffer, 1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA), the filters were incubated overnight with SW buffer in the presence of the radioactive DNA fragments. When indicated, 1 mg of nuclear extract from tobacco, spinach, or cauliflower/ml of hybridization medium was added. After washing with SW buffer, the filters were exposed to an x-ray film. In Vitro Transcription and Translation of CBF-C in the Presence of Radiolabeled Methionine, Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Radiolabeled CBF-C was obtained by transcription and translation. After insertion of an in-frame ATG codon at the 5′-end of the gene, the initially isolated, not full-length plasmid was linearized behind the 3′-end of the gene and transcribed, and the mRNA was translated with wheat germ extracts in the presence of radiolabeled methionine (12Clausmeyer S. Klösgen R.B. Herrmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (10Lübberstedt T. Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled CBF-C was incubated with nuclear extracts (1 μg/μl) in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the DNA was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before gel electrophoresis. Fig. 1 demonstrates that two factors, light and cytokinin, stimulate the expression of AtpC,AtpD, and AtpG in 10-day-old tobacco seedlings. The stimulatory effect of both inducers is substantially reduced if plastid development is impaired by treatments with the bleaching herbicide Norflurazon. Regulation of Atp gene expression appears to reflect differences in transcription rates, since four promoter::uidA gene fusions with 5′-flanking sequences of the spinach AtpC and AtpD genes exhibit similar regulatory features in transgenic tobacco (Table I). Thus, light and cytokinin stimulateAtp gene expression, and this regulation requires functional plastids.Table Iβ-Glucuronidase activity in 10-day-old tobacco seedlings with 5′-flanking sequences of the spinach AtpC and AtpDgenes, or as well as with the 5′-flanking sequences of the 35 S RNA (CaMV) transcription unit (−1583/+3) fused to theuidA reporter gene.β-Glucuronidase activityDLL/NFnmol min −1 mg −1AtpD(−1137/+62)17.5 ± 2.761.3 ± 11.718.4 ± 3.3AtpD(−185/+62)1.3 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.91.1 ± 0.2AtpC (−1874/+173)7.5 ± 1.113.3 ± 2.26.8 ± 1.2AtpC (−73/+173)1.3 ± 0.28.8 ± 1.31.0 ± 0.1AtpC(M)6.1 ± 0.76.9 ± 1.16.0 ± 1.035 S RNA CaMV124 ± 19112 ± 22141 ± 16D*D/CytD*/Cyt/NFAtpD(−1137/+62)22.9 ± 4.445.3 ± 6.525.1 ± 3.3AtpD (−185/+62)2.0 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.71.8 ± 0.4AtpC (−1874/+173)10.9 ± 0.915.5 ± 2.19.1 ± 0.8AtpC(−73/+173)1.8 ± 0.36.1 ± 0.71.4 ± 0.1AtpC (M)6.0 ± 0.46.4 ± 0.55.6 ± 0.335 S RNA CaMV119 ± 23134 ± 12144 ± 29 Open table in a new tab The shortest AtpC promoter::uidA gene construct (−73/+173) still exhibits proper regulation in response to light, cytokinin, and the stage of the plastids (Table I). A single A → G nucleotide exchange immediately upstream of the putative CAAT-box (AAAATTCAAT → AAGATCAAT; construct: AtpC-M) results in a significant increase in uidA gene expression in etiolated material and in material with photobleached plastids. As a consequence, the β-glucuronidase levels directed by the mutant sequence in etiolated and photobleached seedlings do not differ significantly from those observed in light and after cytokinin treatment (Table I). This indicates that the low expression in etiolated and photobleached wild-type material is caused by an inhibitory effect that is not operative under inductive conditions (light, cytokinin) and in seedlings harboring the mutant promoter sequence (cf. see “Discussion”). A double-stranded oligonucleotide from the −69/−39 AtpCRegion (5′-TTTACCTCCAAAATTCAATGGCCAAAATCT-3′) harboring the AAAAT (bold) and CAAT (italics) motifs was used to screen an expression library from Arabidopsis. Positive signals were only obtained when the screen was performed in the presence of 1 mg/ml nuclear extract from spinach or tobacco, and four positive phages with identical inserts were isolated (Fig. 2). Positive signals were also obtained with cauliflower nuclear extracts, suggesting that the missing factor(s) is neither organism-specific nor related to photosynthesis. Signals with whole cell extracts from Arabidopsis were significantly weaker, presumably because of the dilution of the nuclear protein fraction (data not shown). Binding in the presence of spinach extract could also be detected to the mutant oligonucleotide with the A → G nucleotide exchange (AAAAT mutant), but not to an oligonucleotide, in which the CAAT-containing region CAATGG was replaced by GTTATT (Ref. 3Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; cf. see below). DNA sequence analysis revealed that the insertions encode a protein with high homology to the human, yeast, and Aspergillus nidulans CBF-C (Fig. 3; Refs. 8McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 9: 47-58Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar and9Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A data bank search revealed that at least eight genes with striking homologies are present in the Arabidopsis genome; the two with the highest similarities are included in Fig. 3 (Ara IA, Ara VA). The middle part of the proteins, which displays similarities to histone-fold motifs of the histones H2B and H2A and represents the DNA binding region (cf. see “Discussion”), is highly conserved not only among the three Arabidopsis proteins, but also among human, yeast, and A. nidulans, whereas both the N- and C-terminal regions differ substantially with respect to their lengths and amino acid sequences. The histone-fold motif, which consists of the short α-helix I followed by a loop and a β-stranded segment LI, a longer α-helix II, a second short loop and a β-stranded segment LII, and a short α-helix III (Fig. 3), is also present in the subunit A of the Arabidopsis CBF (data bank accession number Y13723) and appears to be crucial for dimer formation (cf. see “Discussion”).FIG. 3Comparison of the CBF-C sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of two genomic Arabidopsissequences from the chromosomes I and V, respectively (Ara IA, Ara VA), are compared with that of the isolated cDNA (Ara cDNA, identical to the GenBank™ accession numberY13725.1) as well as with the amino acid sequences of CBF-C from human, yeast, and Aspergillus (ASPERG).Asterisks, identical amino acids; dots, homologous amino acids; dashes, gaps to optimize the alignment.

The initiator methionines are in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 4 compares the middle parts of theArabidopsis CBF-C homologs. Two of them are encoded on chromosome I (IA and IB), the residual six genes on chromosome V (VA-VF). Interestingly, three of the genes on chromosome V, VB-VD, are organized in a cluster. Besides the high degree of similarities among the Arabidopsis proteins, they also exhibit homologies to the human DRAP1 and its yeast homolog NCB-1. This is particularly striking for VF (Fig. 4). In human, DRAP1 forms a heterodimer with Dr1 and functions as a global repressor for transcription (Refs. 13Mermelstein F. Yeung K. Chao J. Inostroza J.A. Erdjumentbromage H. Eagelson K. Landmann D.

In metazoa, the CBF complex is characterized by its requirement for a high degree of conservation both within the CAAT-box sequence and flanking sequences (cf. see Ref. 7Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast to the typical metazoa CCAAT-boxes, the spinachAtpC CAAT motif lacks one C, and the nucleotides surrounding this motif appear to differ from the consensus sequence determined by Bi et al. (16Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) for metazoa. To test the sequence requirement for the formation of the CBF-DNA complex at the AtpCpromoter, a series of mutant sequences were tested for their ability to bind CBF-C in the presence of nuclear extracts from spinach. Fig. 5 demonstrates that mutation of the CAAT motif completely abolishes the binding activity (lane 6) and that the binding activity to the oligonucleotide with the A → G exchange increases relative to the wild-type sequence (comparelanes 2 and 3). Introduction of a second C at the 5′-end of the CAAT motif did not affect the binding activity significantly (compare lanes 2, 4, and5). This confirms that CBF-C is a CAAT-box binding factor and that the binding activity of CBF at the AtpC promoter is influenced by nucleotides located 5′ to the CAAT motif. The wild-type sequence (AAAATTCAAT) as well as the CAAT-box mutant (AAAATTGTTA) migrated faster on polyacrylamide gels at 22 °C when compared with the A → G mutant (AAGATTCAAT). An intermediate migration was observed for the fragment with the CAAT motif (AAAATCCAAT, Fig. 6, 22 °C). However, at 60 °C (Fig. 6, 60 °C), most of the DNA molecules exhibit a slow electrophoretic mobility similar to that observed for the A → G mutant. This indicates that the wild-type sequence has the potential to form a secondary structure at room temperature and that both the central A (replaced by G) and the 3′-flanking T (replaced by C) contribute to this behavior (cf. see “Discussion”). A correlation of the promoter activity in vivo (Table I) and its capability to bind CBF-C in the presence of nuclear extract from spinach is presented in Fig. 7. Four representative nuclear extracts from dark-adapted seedlings (Fig. 7 A, D extract, 1–4) showed little binding activity to the radiolabeled CBF-C if the wild-type oligonucleotide was used for the gel shift assays. Consistent with the higher gene expression level, directed by the mutant sequence, a stronger retardation signal can be detected in gel mobility shift assays. Two representative nuclear extracts from light-grown seedlings (Fig. 7 A, WL extract, 1–2) showed substantially stronger retardation signals irrespective of whether the wild-type or the mutant sequence was analyzed. The same appears to be true for cytokinin treatments (Fig. 7 B), whereas herbicide treatments significantly reduced the binding activity with both extracts from light-grown seedlings and etiolated seedlings treated with cytokinin. This suggests that the assembly of CBF at theAtpC promoter is crucial for the regulated expression ofAtpC. In many eukaryotic class II promoters, CCAAT motifs are often found between 50 and 100 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site (17Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 18Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A.

Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and these motifs are recognized by different classes of CCAAT-binding proteins, one of which is CBF. CBF consists of three different subunits, A, B, and C, and all of them are essential for DNA binding. CBF-A and CBF-C interact with each other to form a stable heterodimer, and CBF-B can only interact with the dimer to form a heterotrimeric complex which then binds DNA (cf. see Ref. 7Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In metazoa, the CBF-DNA complex is characterized by its requirement for a high degree of conservation within the binding motif CCAAT (7Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 21Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B.

Science. 1989; 244: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and sequences surrounding the pentameric motif contribute to the binding specificity (Ref. 16Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and references therein). The complex that assembles at the spinach AtpC promoter differs from those described for metazoa in two respects: first, the putative CAAT-box in the AtpC promoter lacks one of the two C residues, and introduction of an additional C does not affect significantly the binding activity (Fig. 5). Second, the surrounding nucleotides do not match to the consensus sequence determined by Biet al. (16Bi W. Wu L. Coustry F. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26562-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast to many animal CCAAT motifs, the majority of the plant sequences contain only one C or lack a CAAT-box completely. On the other hand, the AtpC promoter is relatively weak, which could be caused by an imperfect CBF binding site. The CAAT-box sequences, which are believed to influence the frequency of transcriptional initiation, can also be the target site for regulation. Maity and de Crombrugghe (7Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) define three classes of CBF binding promoters in mammals: (i) those in which a mutation in the CAAT motif decreases transcription in the absence of stimulatory influences (21Maity S.N.

Thus, for at least 10 mammalian genes analyzed in details, assembly of CBF at the CAAT motif occurs in response to cell internal or external signals. Although the mechanisms by which these processes are coupled to signal pathways are unknown, several models have been proposed. For instance, dimer formation between the subunits A and C requires histone-fold motifs in both subunits, and dimerization could be prevented if one of the subunits interacts with a repressing polypeptide, which also contains a histone-fold motif. In mammals, besides histones, several polypeptides with histone-fold motifs have been described; for instance, the human Dr1 and DRAP1, which form a heterodimer and function as a strong global transcriptional repressor at the TATA box (13Mermelstein F. Yeung K. Chao J. Inostroza J.A. Erdjumentbromage H. Eagelson K. Landmann D. Levitt P. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At least one member of the Arabidopsis CBF-C gene family exhibits significant sequence similarities to the human DRAP-1 (Fig. 4). A simple model can describe AtpC gene regulation. The AAAAT sequence, in particular the underlined A, is a repressor binding site that prevents the assembly of CBF in darkness and in tissue with impaired plastids and, thus, diminishesAtpC transcription. Light and cytokinin treatments prevent repressor binding and, thus, allow the assembly of CBF, a situation that can be mimicked by the described mutation. Our data further indicate that a recombinant subunit C apparently finds its partners in nuclear extracts before binding to DNA. This indicates that unassembled subunits must be present in our extracts and is consistent with reports from rat liver nuclear extracts in which unassembled subunits can be separated on cation exchange resins (38Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 217-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that the cDNA initially isolated in our screen lacks most of the 5′-end and starts immediately upstream of the region that encodes the histone-fold motif. This suggests that formation of the heterodimer between A and C, association of B with the dimer, and ultimately DNA binding do not require the N-terminal part of CBF-C. There is increasing evidence that etiolation is caused by repressors active in darkness rather than stimulatory processes functional in light (cf. see Ref. 39Fankhauser C Chory J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that transcription of a light-regulated gene is repressed in darkness and under photodamaging conditions. The nature of the postulated binding factor is unknown at present; however, because of the AT-rich sequence, one might speculate that it is involved in DNA bending or recognition of bent DNA regions (cf. see Ref. 40Gustafson T.A. Taylor A. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2162-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that light and cytokinin do not only controlAtpC gene expression via the same cis-element in the promoter but operate also in a comparable fashion, most likely by regulating the same trans-acting factors (Table I)."

A particularly good example of bacterial pathogens that employ a multi-stage infection strategy involving a type III secretion system is provided by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli(EPEC)1 and enterohemorrhagicE. coli (EHEC) (reviewed in Ref. 3Frankel G.

Subversion of epithelial cell function by EPEC and EHEC leads to the formation of distinctive “attaching and effacing” (A/E) lesions, characterized by localized destruction (effacement) of brush border microvilli, intimate attachment of the bacillus to the host cell membrane, and the formation of an actin-rich underlying pedestal-like structure in the host cell (reviewed in Ref. 3Frankel G.

Additionally, many of these components demonstrate similarity to proteins involved in bacterial flagellar biosynthesis (2Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

EspA is secreted via the type III secretion apparatus and is required for the translocation of EspB and Tir into the host cell cytosol (9Kenny B. DeVinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It has recently been identified as a major component of large extracellular filamentous structures, which appear on the surface of EPEC at an early stage of infection prior to intimate attachment (14Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I. Neves B.C. Bain C. Wolff C. Dougan G. Frankel G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The assembly of a number of eukaryotic proteins into filamentous structures is based upon interactions between dimeric coiled-coil domains (15Parry D.A. Steinert P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and similarly predicted coiled-coil segments lie within regions of functional significance in a number of bacterial proteins. Coiled-coil segments have been predicted to occur in many proteins associated with type III secretion systems (16Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), where they have a potential role in mediating the formation of large multi-protein complexes or more discrete interactions that may facilitate protein translocation. Notably, bacterial flagellins contain coiled-coil domains at the amino and carboxyl termini of the protein corresponding to regions deemed important in the polymerization of flagellin into the flagellar filament (17Hyman H.C. Trachtenberg S. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 79-88Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Kuwajima G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3305-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). EspA demonstrates discrete sequence similarity to flagellins in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein which is predicted with high probability to adopt a coiled-coil conformation (16Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Frankel G. Wren B. Dougan G. Delahay R.M. Batchelor M. Hale C. Hartland E.L. Pallen M.J. Rosenshine I. Knutton S. England R. Hobbs G. Bainton N. Roberts D.M. Microbial Signaling and Communication: Society for General Microbiology Symposium. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1999: 197-213Google Scholar). The similarity between type III secretion components and proteins of the flagellar export machinery, particularly in regions predicted to form coiled-coils prompted us to investigate the importance of the predicted coiled-coil domain of EspA for the assembly and function of the EspA filaments. In this study we provide evidence, based on a rational site-directed mutagenesis approach, that mutation of specific residues predicted to be critical in coiled-coil conformation have dramatic consequences for the assembly of the EspA filament and subversion of host cell signal transduction pathways leading to A/E lesion formation. Considering the similarities between different type III secretion systems, coiled-coil interactions may represent a common feature of their function. The bacterial strains used in this study were generated by vector complementation of theespA gene in the espA mutant strain UMD872 (20Kenny B. Lai L.C. Finlay B.B. Donnenberg M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Complementation was achieved by transformation of plasmid pMSD2 containing the functional EPEC espA gene (20Kenny B. Lai L.C. Finlay B.B. Donnenberg M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, strains UMD864 (espB− ), UMD870 (espD− ), and the prototype (parent) EPEC E2348/69 were used. Mutant strains were generated by site directed mutagenesis of pMSD2. Bacteria were grown to stationary phase at 37 °C in l-broth, or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), with the addition of chloramphenicol to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml as appropriate. Coiled-coil predictions were carried out using a revised version of the computer program described by Lupaset al. (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar) available via the World Wide Web. Predictions were based on a window size of 28 residues and weighting the algorithm in favor of hydrophobic residues at positions a andd of the heptad repeat. For analysis of EspA monomeric interactions using GST-EspA fusion protein, a BamHI-flanked espA polymerase chain reaction fragment (primer pair; 5′- CGGGATCCATGGATACATCAACTAC-3′ and 5′- CGGGATCCTTATTTACCAAGGGATATTCC-3′, temperature cycling as follows; 1 cycle of 95 °C, 5 min, then 25 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s, 58 °C 45 s, 72 °C 45 s, with a final extension step of 72 °C, 5 min) was cloned into the BamHI site of the GST gene fusion vector pGEX-2T, creating a translational fusion with glutathione S-transferase (generating plasmid pICC34). The GST-EspA fusion was produced in XL1-Blue by induction of a 2-h log phase culture with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubating for another 4 h at 37 °C. GST or GST-EspA was purified from 10 ml of clarified sonicate by the addition of 100 μl (50% slurry) of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following 30 min of incubation, the beads were washed three times in PBS, and the fusion eluted by the addition of a total of 500 μl of 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris -HCl, pH 8.0. EspA interactions were subsequently assayed by ELISA as follows; ELISA plates were coated with 25 μg/ml purified His-EspA (12Rosqvist R. Hakansson S. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked, then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with three-fold serial dilutions of GST-EspA, GST, or GST-EspA with the addition of 5 μg of His-EspA in PBS-Tween (0.05%). Plates were washed, then probed with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1/500 dilution, 1 h) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat antiserum (Sigma, 1/1000, 1 h). The reaction was visualized by addition ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, and the final optical density measured at 405 nm. The mean optical density from five separate experiments was used for graphical representation. Site-directed mutagenesis of theespA gene was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following manufacturer's instructions, using double-stranded pMSD2 or subsequently mutated vector as template. Complimentary mutagenesis oligonucleotide pairs incorporating single amino acid substitutions are as follows. Sense oligonucleotides were 5′-GAAATACAGCAAAGGTCAAATACGTTAAACC-3′ (pICC25, pICC27), 5′-AAAGCGAATAACGGACAACGACGGTC-3′ (pICC26, pICC27), and 5′-ACGGTCAATAATAGGCAGCTTGAAATA-3′ (pICC28, pICC29). Plasmids pICC30, -31, and -32 used a similar oligonucleotide to pICC26 with the following modifications at bases 13–15: pICC30, ATG; pICC31, TTT; pICC32, GTG. Antisense oligonucleotides were 5′-GGTTTAACGTATTTGACCTTTGCTGTATTTC-3′ (pICC25, pICC27), 5′-GACCGTCGTTGTCCGATTATTCGCTTT-3′ (pICC26, pICC27), and 5′-TATTTCAAGCTGCCTATTATTGACCGT-3′ (pICC28, pICC29). As above, plasmids pICC30, -31, and -32 used a similar oligonucleotide to pICC26 with the following modifications at bases 13–15: pICC30, CCG; pICC31, AAA; pICC32, CAC. Mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks was generated by extension of primers annealed to opposite strands of the denatured plasmid by temperature cycling (1 cycle of 95 °C, 30 s, then 16 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s, 55 °C, 1 min, 68 °C, 18 min) in the presence of the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase. Synthesized DNA containing the desired mutation was selected from the original DNA template by incubation with DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. Nicks in the plasmid were repaired following transformation of 1 μl of the synthesized products into competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Chloramphenicol-resistant transformants were randomly selected and inoculated to overnight l-broth cultures for preparation of plasmid Mini-preps (Qiagen). Correct incorporation of each mutation was monitored by DNA sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 377). Mutated plasmid was transformed to competent UMD872 cells (espA −) for analysis of phenotypic effects. Proteins secreted in DMEM supernatants (EspA, EspB) or contained in whole cell lysates (intimin) from induced cultures were separated on 12% reducing or non-reducing polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were subsequently blocked for 1 h by the addition of 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%) as described (22Adu-Bobie J. Frankel G. Bain C. Goncaleves A.G. Trabulsi L.R. Douce G. Knutton S. Dougan G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 662-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were variously probed for 2 h with anti-EspA (14Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I. Neves B.C. Bain C. Wolff C. Dougan G. Frankel G.

Following a standard wash step, blots were incubated for 2 h with anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 in PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%). The immunoblots were subsequently developed by the addition of one buffered substrate tablet (Sigma) containing 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 0.30 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water. The ability of EspA derivative strains to induce A/E lesion formation was assessed using the FAS test (23Knutton S. Baldwin T. Williams P.H. McNeish A.S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and detection of EPEC-associated EspA filaments with anti-EspA polyclonal antiserum was performed according to Knutton et al. (14Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I. Neves B.C. Bain C. Wolff C. Dougan G. Frankel G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that EspA polymerization is the structural basis for the formation of EspA filaments, which, similar to flagella, are hollow cylindrical structures assembled in a manner dependent on a type III secretion system (3Frankel G. Phillips A.D. Rosenshine I. Dougan G. Kaper J.B. Knutton S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 19Frankel G. Wren B. Dougan G. Delahay R.M. Batchelor M. Hale C. Hartland E.L. Pallen M.J. Rosenshine I. Knutton S. England R. Hobbs G. Bainton N. Roberts D.M. Microbial Signaling and Communication: Society for General Microbiology Symposium. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1999: 197-213Google Scholar). In this study we sought to investigate the basis for EspA filament assembly. We analyzed Western blots of secreted EPEC proteins, separated under non-denaturing conditions. This provided direct evidence for polymerized forms of EspA in culture supernatants of the prototype EPEC strain E2348/69 (Fig. 1, lane 4). No EspA was detected in culture supernatants of UMD872 harboring a deletion mutation in the espA gene (Fig. 1,lane 3), but multimerization was restored in UMD872 complemented with pMSD2 containing a cloned espA gene (results not shown). These results demonstrate that EspA is a major component of the EspA filament assembly, and as such, monomers would be expected to possess structural regions that would mediate hetero- and/or homo-oligomeric interactions. Importantly, multimerization of EspA was not affected in the background of espD andespB mutant strains and appeared identical to the wild type strain E2348/69 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and2, respectively). As a preliminary demonstration of EspA:EspA interactions, we assessed the ability of purified EspA fusions to associate in an ELISA based assay. Purified His-tagged EspA was used to coat wells of a 96-well plate, then serial dilutions of purified GST-EspA were added. GST-EspA immobilized in wells by association with His-EspA was detected by anti-GST antibody followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat antiserum. GST-EspA demonstrated a dose dependent association with His-EspA (Fig. 2). Additionally, GST-EspA:His-EspA interaction could be competitively inhibited by the addition of 5 μg of soluble His-EspA in tandem with the GST-EspA fusion protein. Binding of GST alone by His-EspA was not evident. These results provide a direct demonstration of EspA interactions by a solid phase assay. We have previously shown that coiled-coil motifs are a common feature of many proteins secreted by type III secretion systems (16Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In EspA, six heptad repeats comprising the motif aXXdXXX (where a andd represent hydrophobic residue and X any residue) can be identified in the carboxyl terminus of the EspA protein indicating a propensity of this region to adopt a coiled-coil conformation (Fig. 3 A). When analyzed by the COILS algorithm (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar), these repeats are predicted to form a coiled-coil with a probability of 98% (Table I). Amino acids in the heptad repeat of coiled-coils are assigned positions a-b-c-d-e-f-g, where thea and d residues are largely hydrophobic and form the hydrophobic core in an association between one or more helices (24Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 25Forest K.T. Tainer J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We aimed to introduce non-conservative substitutions at positiona which are deemed important for the coiled-coil conformation. Non-conservative substitution of single, double, and triple position a residues in selected repeats (Fig. 3 B) reduced the probability of coiled-coil formation by the values listed in Table I.Table IAnalysis of heptad repeats spanning residues 138–181 of the EspA sequencePosition of Arginine substitutionPeak scoreEspA0.979EspA-Met1630.609EspA-Leu1490.478EspA-Leu149/Met1630.029EspA-Leu149/Ser1560.610EspA-Ser156/Met1630.227Alternative substitutionsPeak scoreEspA-Met1490.807EspA-Phe1490.478EspA-Val1490.577EspA-Met149/Arg1630.153 Open table in a new tab The EspA derivatives were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid pMSD2. Mutant derivatives were introduced into UMD872, and biological functions of the mutated EspA were characterized in terms of Esp protein secretion, EspA multimerization, EspA filament assembly, and the ability to support A/E lesion formation. Western blots of bacterial supernatants and whole cell extracts were used to confirm that the mutations introduced into the coiled-coil domain of EspA did not affect LEE-encoded protein expression or secretion. All of the single and double espA mutants secreted EspA at overall levels comparable to wild type in both l-broth and DMEM cultures (Fig. 4 A), although some culture to culture variation between experiments was observed (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the triple espA mutant UMD872(pICC24) produced an insoluble EspA that was only detected in the bacterial pellets and migrated with a higher molecular weight compared with the native EspA (data not shown). Consequently, the triple EspA mutant was not investigated further. Mutagenesis of espA had no significant effect on secretion of EspB and although, similarly to EspA, some variations between experiments was observed, similar levels of secreted EspB were detected in culture supernatants of all strains (Fig. 4 B); expression of intimin, an outer membrane EPEC adhesion molecule, by all mutant strains was similarly unaffected (data not shown). These results show that the mutations in the coiled-coil domain of EspA do not have pleotropic effects on expression or secretion of LEE-encoded virulence genes, including EspA itself. An indication of the impact of position asubstitutions on the ability of EspA to polymerize into higher structures was obtained by analysis of Western blots of DMEM-secreted proteins separated under non-denaturing conditions. Mobility shifts were demonstrated in all mutant EspAs as a consequence of slight charge differences between arginine and the residues substituted and likely conformational changes induced by the a position substitutions. Additionally, single and double mutations, with the exception of Arg163 (pICC25), appeared to affect the multimerization potential of the protein, as evidenced by depletion of some oligomeric forms (Fig. 5). The results of the immunostaining of the EspA filaments is summarized in Table II and illustrated in Fig. 6. This revealed greatly shortened surface protrusions, which appeared as “bobbles” or stumps around the cell in UMD872(pICC25) and UMD872(pICC26) compared with UMD872(pMSD2). In contrast, and as suggested by the altered mobility pattern on native gels, the double position a amino acid mutants lacked any EspA filament structure. The observation that all double substitutions at different positions along the length of the predicted coiled-coil domain in EspA resulted in the same mutant phenotype (Table II) provides a strong indication that the underlying basis for the inability of the EspA mutant to assemble into a filament involves disruption of a structural domain rather than resulting from more serious perturbations in the predicted α-helical secondary structure of the protein. The fact that the double mutant EspAs are soluble and secreted further support this suggestion (data not shown).Table IISummary of attaching and effacing activity of strains bearing radical and conservative amino acid substitutions in the predicted coiled-coil domain of EspAespA complement in UMD872Attaching-effacing activityEspA stainUMD872 (espA − )−No filamentspMSD2 (EPEC espA)+Long filamentspICC25 (Arg163)+Vestigial filamentspICC26 (Arg149)+Vestigial filamentspICC27 (Arg149/Arg163)−No filamentspICC28 (Arg149/Arg156)−No filamentspICC29 (Arg156/Arg163)−No filamentspICC30 (Met149)+Vestigial filamentspICC31 (Phe149)+Long filamentspICC32 (Val149)+Long filamentspICC33 (Met149/Arg163)+Vestigial filaments Open table in a new tab In order to identify possible functional effects of the coiled-coil mutagenesis, we investigated the ability of the different strains to induce A/E lesions on cultured HEp-2 cells using the FAS test as a marker for lesion formation (23Knutton S. Baldwin T. Williams P.H. McNeish A.S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitution by arginine at position Leu149 or Met163 was insufficient to inhibit formation of A/E lesions by UMD872(pICC26) or UMD872(pICC25), respectively, whereas double mutants, even after extended incubations (5 h), were unable to initiate host cytoskeletal rearrangements and A/E lesion formation (Table II; Fig. 6). To demonstrate that the mutant phenotypes were solely a consequence of the specific substitutions introduced at the carboxyl terminus, we targeted the non-permissive Arg149 residue in pICC26 for substitution with more conservative amino acids methionine, phenylalanine, and valine producing plasmids pICC30, pICC31, and pICC32, respectively. A similar methionine substitution was also introduced into the double mutant pICC27 at the same position generating plasmid pICC33. The FAS phenotype and EspA filament assembly were restored in UMD872(pICC31) and UMD872(pICC32) (Table II; Fig. 6), while UMD872(pICC30) remained deficient of wild type filament structure (Table II). All the revertant strains showed a positive FAS. Restoration of EspA multimerization in these revertant strains was similarly reflected by the characteristic wild type “laddering” profile of EspA protein in native gels (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). The ability to promote A/E lesions was similarly restored in UMD872(pICC33) but filament structure in this strain was indistinguishable from the vestigial structures encoded by pICC25 and pICC26 complements. Taken together these results provide a strong indication of functional restoration of a structural domain in the EspA protein that is proposed to be important for interactions leading to filament assembly. Coiled-coils form important structural domains in diverse proteins mediating oligomerization of monomers via association of two or more α-helices. Sequences that are capable of forming coiled-coils are characterized by heptad repeats comprising seven amino acids designateda–g, where the first (a) and fourth (d) positions are occupied by hydrophobic amino acids, and the remaining positions (b, c, e,f, and g) by polar amino acids. The aand d position residues form a hydrophobic interface between helices which are buried in the core of the assembled coiled-coil complex. The hydrophobic interactions form the basis for the stability of the complex. The prevalence of predicted coiled-coils among proteins of type III secretion systems (16Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) hints at a potential mechanism by which proteins may interact in the formation of multimeric complexes or processes involved in the translocation of effector proteins. The prediction of a coiled-coil segment in a region of EspA that demonstrates significant similarity to a well characterized coiled-coil region in flagellins from a number of bacterial species introduces the possibility that coiled-coil interactions may contribute to EspA filament assembly. In addition to flagellins, the assembly of a number of eukaryotic proteins into filamentous structures is based upon interactions between dimeric coiled-coil domains (15Parry D.A. Steinert P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, only one coiled-coil domain is predicted in the carboxyl terminus of EspA, which presents the possibility that this region mediates homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric interactions between different polypeptides (16Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that EspA:EspA interaction is impaired by mutation at an essential carboxyl-terminal domain, although some oligomeric forms of EspA are still evident in the more extreme double mutants (Fig. 5). This is perhaps not unexpected since other molecular interactions in addition to the potential contribution of coiled-coils are likely to be involved in EspA association. Using GST-EspA and His-EspA, we demonstrated EspA-EspA interaction on solid phase. Unfortunately, due to low expression level of the double mutant GST-EspA fusion, we were unable to determine the effect of the mutations on EspA-EspA interaction using this binding assay. Carboxyl-terminal mutants are, however, unable to produce surface EspA filaments. This is a direct effect of mutation within the predicted coiled-coil domain and may be a consequence of the destabilizing effect incurred by coiled-coil disruption on homo-oligomeric interactions, or alternatively, abrogation of EspA interactions with additional protein(s) more integral to filament assembly or structure. Mutations affecting flagellar presentation and shape are similarly located in a coiled-coil region of the flagellin (17Hyman H.C. Trachtenberg S. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 79-88Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Kanto S. Okino H. Aizawa S. Yamaguchi S. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Unlike double substitution mutants where EspA:EspA interaction and EspA filament assembly was totally abrogated, single substitution mutants produced a vestigial EspA filament. In this situation, alterations within an essential domain may not be sufficient to prevent EspA:EspA interaction but appear to be sufficient to prevent polymerization into long filaments. Interestingly, the vestigial filaments produced by the single substitution mutants are reminiscent of the filament stumps produced by an espD − strain UMD870 (14Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I. Neves B.C. Bain C. Wolff C. Dougan G. Frankel G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence that neither EspD nor EspB is required for EspA multimerization, although it is clear that EspD is integral to assembly and or elaboration of the filament on the bacterial cell surface (14Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I. Neves B.C. Bain C. Wolff C. Dougan G. Frankel G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It has recently been determined that EspD is transported to the host cell membrane where it remains exposed and solvent accessible (27Wachter C. Beinke C. Mattes M. Schmidt M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1695-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). EspD has two predicted coiled regions, spanning residues 147–174, and 336–368 (16Pallen M.J. Dougan G. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which could potentially mediate structural interactions with EspA and/or other proteins, presenting a potential mechanism by which the EspA filament could be anchored at the host cell surface. In the light of this recent information, EspA filament assembly may require the contribution of EPEC proteins, which perhaps reflect further the function of flagellar biogenesis components, such as the flagellar capping protein FliD, which is essential for polymerization of flagellin monomers at the tip of the growing flagellum (28Ikeda T. Asakura S. Kamiya R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similarly, a second gene in the fliD operon ofSalmonella typhimurium, fliS, encodes a protein that appears to facilitate the export of flagellin through the growing filament channel (29Yokoseki T. Kutsukake K. Ohnishi K. Iino T. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutation at fliS affects the filament elongation step, resulting in short flagella with a concomitant decrease in the amount of excreted flagellin. Both these effects are mirrored, with respect to EspA, by mutation of the EPEC espDgene (14Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Pallen M.J. Nisan I. Neves B.C. Bain C. Wolff C. Dougan G. Frankel G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Alternatively, aberrant surface presentation of the filament may be due to a failure of a more mechanical nature involving proteins that anchor the filament at the bacterial cell surface. Demonstration of the structural integrity of the mutant EspA proteins is an important consideration if inferences are to be made concerning the effect of mutations in an uncharacterized domain. The ability to restore wild type EspA function by reversion of a functionally non-permissive mutation to a more conservative residue (Arg149 to Val), but one that is still different from wild type (Leu149), provides an indication that the altered phenotypic effects were the consequence of aberrant structural interactions, since low tolerance for substitution at apositions comprising the hydrophobic core in coiled-coils is well documented (30Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The smaller Val and Phe residues are less likely to grossly deform a coiled-coil in the way that the larger Met residue at the same position might. It is also possible that Met interacts differently with residues from neighboring peptides. The results presented herein provide the first analysis of EspA filament assembly assessed in the context of culture supernatants, which in the prototypic strain E2348/69 are known to contain several proteins secreted by the type III secretion system (31Jarvis K.G. Giron J.A. Jerse A.E. McDaniel T.K. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7996-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Future studies using purified wild type and mutant EspA proteins selected on the basis of these results will facilitate the further characterization of EspA homo- and hetero-oligomeric interactions and enable structural integrity of mutants to be rigorously assessed by the application of procedures such as circular dichroism spectrophotometry. We thank Kate Brown for helpful discussion and critical reading of the manuscript, and Jim Kaper and Michael Donnenberg from the University of Maryland for providing the E2348/69 derivatives and pMDS2.

This result suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of the intact enzyme sterically hinders its dimerization. When EGF is removed from the dimer of the fragment, the rate constant for its dissociation is greater than 0.2 min−1, more than 40-fold that of the native enzyme.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in the signal transduction initiated by this enzyme. The receptor for epidermal growth factor is composed of three domains (6Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J.

It is of interest to determine the role of each of these domains in the dimerization of the intact protein. In the experiments reported here, a recombinant form of the extracellular domain of human EGF receptor also containing the membrane-spanning segment (9Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B.

Comparisons of the behavior of this extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment with that of the native, intact EGF receptor and with that of soluble, recombinant forms of the extracellular domain provide insight into the participation of the three domains in the process of dimerization. Cells of the murine B82 line expressing a recombinant form of EGF receptor that is missing its cytoplasmic domain and contains only the extracellular domain and the membrane-spanning segment (9Chen W.S.

These cells were grown to confluence, the plates were scraped to release the cells, and the resulting suspension was spun at 3,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were lysed (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) by the addition of 4-fold of the pelleted cell volume of 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmbenzamidinium chloride, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. An equal volume of 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and 30 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, was added to the cell lysates, and the mixture was homogenized with 15–20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer at 0 °C and then clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA-100.2 rotor in a Beckman T1-100 table top ultracentrifuge. The resulting extracts are referred to as detergent extracts of B82 cells. They were either used immediately or stored for future use at −70 °C. All dilutions of the detergent extract were made in 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The states of dimerization of the two truncated forms of EGF receptor were determined by subjecting solutions containing these proteins to quantitative cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Solutions of the purified soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of human EGF receptor (10Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in 0.1 mNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were graciously provided by Dr. Deborah Cadena, Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego. These solutions were diluted to the desired concentration of protein with 30 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. Samples (0.3 ml) of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain or of detergent extracts of B82 cells were mixed at room temperature with 0.15 ml of EGF in 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 (phosphate-buffered saline) or with phosphate-buffered saline alone to produce the noted final concentrations. The samples then stood at room temperature. Portions were removed at the noted times and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (final concentration of 80 mm) for 1 min prior to quenching the cross-linking reaction with glycine (final concentration of 0.2 m). The proteins in the samples were unfolded in a solution of recrystallized SDS at 5 g SDS (g protein)−1 for 1 min at 100 °C prior to submitting them to electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels cast in a solution of 0.1% SDS (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The cross-linked polypeptides were then electrotransferred (12Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) to membranes of polyvinylidene difluoride and immunostained (13Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). For immunostaining of blots of detergent extracts of B82 cells, a mouse monoclonal immunoglobulin (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) raised against the synthetic peptide IQCAHYIDGPHC, corresponding to a region near the juxtamembrane section of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor, was used as the primary immunoglobulin. The intensity of the staining on immunoblots was quantified by scanning them with a reflectance densitometer (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The assays for the concentration of binding sites for EGF were performed as described by Sherrill & Kyte at a concentration of EGF of 3.3 μm (14Sherrill J.M. Kyte J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5705-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several different concentrations of protein were assayed as well as a control with no protein. The counts per minute of specifically bound EGF were usually 10-fold greater in the samples with the highest concentration of protein than those for nonspecifically bound EGF in the control samples. When125I-EGF was used as the radioactive tracer, the supernatant fluids were removed, and both the pellets and the supernatants were submitted to γ-counting. In some samples, unlabeled EGF was added at a higher concentration than that of the125I-EGF to demonstrate that the bound radioactivity could be chased by unmodified ligand. A recombinant extracellular domain of human EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment has been expressed in murine B82 cells (9Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M. Channing J. Der H. Wiley S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This truncated version of EGF receptor contains the amino-terminal portion of the protein through arginine 647. It includes the entire membrane-spanning segment of the protein but does not include more than about six residues of the cytoplasmic domain. It was dissolved in a solution of Triton X-100 and tested to see if it could undergo dimerization in a manner dependent on the concentration of EGF as does the intact enzyme (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples of a detergent extract of B82 cells stood at room temperature with the indicated concentrations of EGF for 20 min prior to subjecting each sample to quantitative cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The polypeptides in the samples were then separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to a membrane of polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunostained. The recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment was observed to dimerize readily in response to EGF (Fig. 1). In lanes 5, 6,7, and 8 of Fig. 1, the fractions of the protein that had dimerized were 0.09, 0.33, 0.44, and 0.55, respectively. The fraction of the protein that had dimerized was plotted as a function of the concentration of EGF for all of the data from experiments of this type, and the combined data were fit with a rectangular hyperbola. The apparent dissociation constant for EGF, as judged by the concentration of EGF producing half maximum dimerization, was found to be 500 ± 150 nm. In all of the experiments examining the dimerization of the recombinant extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment, the maximum extent of dimerization observed at saturation with EGF was about 0.45 to 0.50. This result indicates that in the B82 cells, the expressed protein is present in at least two forms, one competent to dimerize, the other incompetent. Experiments were performed to monitor the dimerization of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment as a function of time. Samples of detergent extracts of B82 cells were mixed at room temperature with either phosphate-buffered saline or a saturating concentration of EGF in phosphate-buffered saline. At the noted times, samples were assayed for dimerization. The extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment in undiluted detergent extracts of B82 cells dimerized to the maximum extent within the 1 min resolution of the cross-linking reaction (Fig. 2). The fractions of the protein that had dimerized in the experiment presented in Fig. 2 were 0.47, 0.45, 0.46, and 0.45 at 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min, respectively. Detergent extracts of B82 cells were diluted in an attempt to slow the presumably second-order dimerization of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment. Several dilutions (3-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, and 20-fold) of the detergent extract of B82 cells were attempted. In each case, the dimerization of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment still proceeded too rapidly. At a dilution of 20-fold, the fractions of the protein that had dimerized were 0.44, 0.51, 0.50, and 0.49 at 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 3). The molar concentration of extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment in the undiluted detergent extract of B82 cells used in this last experiment was estimated to be 150 nm on the basis of an assay for the binding of EGF (14Sherrill J.M. Kyte J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5705-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If it is assumed that the dimerization is greater than 50% complete in less than 1 min (Fig. 3) at a concentration of protein competent to dimerize of 2.5 nm, then the second-order rate constant for the dimerization of the protein must be greater than 0.3 nm−1 min−1. Under identical conditions of pH, temperature, and concentrations of glycerol and Triton X-100, the rate constant for the dimerization of intact native EGF receptor is 0.03 nm−1 min−1(1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Sherrill J.M. Kyte J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5705-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment dimerizes at a rate more than 10-fold faster than that for the dimerization of native, intact EGF receptor. In an attempt to slow the dimerization of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment even further, EGF was added to samples of a detergent extract of B82 cells at 0 °C. Even at the lower temperature, undiluted samples of the extract still dimerized completely within 1 min of the cross-linking reaction. Epidermal growth factor was then added to a sample of a detergent extract of B82 cells that had been diluted 10-fold and brought to 0 °C. The rate of dimerization of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment in these samples standing on ice was decreased sufficiently to observe the dimerization proceed over the course of 20 min (Fig. 4). In a previous study (15Tanner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14889-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it was found that when intact, native EGF receptor was activated with saturating EGF to produce a fully dimerized and enzymatically active state and then passed over a column containing an immunoadsorbent made from anti-EGF immunoglobulins that could remove both the EGF in solution and any bound EGF, the unoccupied EGF receptor nevertheless remained dimerized and enzymatically active over extended periods of time. The rate of dissociation the dimerized recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment was assessed in undiluted detergent extracts of B82 cells that had been exposed to EGF for 5 min at room temperature prior to removing the EGF by passing the sample over the immunoadsorbent for EGF. Samples of a pool of the fractions of the eluate from the immunoadsorbent containing the protein were subjected to quantitative cross-linking with glutaraldehyde at various times over a period of 80 min (Fig. 5). The dimerized extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment had reverted completely to its monomeric form within 5 min following the removal of the EGF (lane 1). The readdition of EGF after its removal, however, was able to return the protein to its dimeric form (Lanes 5–8). This control shows that the immunoadsorbent had not affected the ability of the protein to dimerize but had merely removed the EGF. From these results, it can be estimated that the rate constant for the monomerization of the dimeric extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment, following removal of the EGF, is greater than 0.2 min−1. This value is more than 50-fold greater than that of the rate constant (0.26 h−1) for the monomerization of dimeric native EGF receptor following the removal of EGF by the same immunoadsorbent under the same conditions (15Tanner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14889-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In previous reports (5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that soluble, recombinant forms of the extracellular domains of EGF receptor must be at high concentrations (40 μm or greater) to display dimerization. It was possible, however, that the conditions we were using to examine the dimerization of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment, which occurred readily even at very low concentrations (2.5 nm), somehow dramatically enhanced the dimerization of the extracellular domain. Therefore, experiments were performed to assess the ability of a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor to dimerize in response to treatment with EGF under the same conditions of pH, detergent concentration, and temperature as the experiments just described. The soluble, recombinant extracellular domain used in these experiments was the one expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells by Cadena & Gill (10Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which included the amino-terminal domain of human EGF receptor through threonine 624. This protein was a gift of Dr. Deborah Cadena, who had purified it by chromatography on Sepharose to which wheat germ agglutinin had been attached. Each preparation had been routinely assayed by Dr. Cadena for the binding of EGF which displayed an apparent dissociation constant of 500 ± 200 nm (10Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor used in these assessments of its ability to dimerize spanned a range of 1,000-fold (5 nm to 5 μm). In some experiments the concentration of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor was high enough (5 μm) to visualize it on polyacrylamide gels by staining them with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Epidermal growth factor was incubated with the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor at final concentrations as high as 30 μm, which is 60-fold higher than its apparent dissociation constant. Both quantitative cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (7Lax I. Mitra A.K. Ravera C. Hurwitz D.R. Rubinstein M. Ullrich A. Stroud R.M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13828-13833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed. Most of these experiments were carried out in the absence of detergent, but in two experiments, one at 5 μm in soluble, recombinant extracellular domain, Triton X-100 and glycerol were added to 1 and 10%, respectively, to mimic more closely the conditions under which the detergent extracts of B82 cells expressing the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment were examined. Experiments were also performed in which the cross-linking reaction with glutaraldehyde was extended from 1 to 10 min. No dimerization of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor induced by the addition of EGF was detected under any of these conditions. The concentration of EGF that was incubated with the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor in these studies was always well above the reported dissociation constant of 500 nm. Using the same preparation of soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor, Cadena & Gill (10Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) also could not detect any EGF-induced dimerization, as determined by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, at 1.5 μm protein and 1.7 μm EGF. Neither our results nor those of Cadena & Gill (10Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are surprising, however, because concentrations of 45 μm or greater of a similar recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor were needed to observe dimerization in the experiments of Lemmon et al. (5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To define more precisely the regions of EGF receptor that may form contacts that are important in its dimerization, a recombinant form of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment of the protein (9Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M. Channing J. Der H. Wiley S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) dissolved in a solution of Triton X-100 was examined to see if it would dimerize in response to addition of EGF. Not only did this fragment of the protein dimerize in response to treatment with EGF, but it did so at a rate more than 10-fold greater than that for the dimerization of intact native EGF receptor when the two proteins are assayed at the same concentration of EGF. This result suggests that regions of the cytoplasmic domain of native, intact EGF receptor interfere with its dimerization. It has been difficult to detect dimerization of soluble, recombinant forms of the extracellular domain of EGF receptor lacking the membrane-spanning domain. Several other investigators have had experiences similar to ours in being unable to detect dimerization of soluble, recombinant extracellular domains of human EGF receptor (20Günther N. Betzel C. Weber W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22082-22085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Greenfield C. Hils I. Waterfield M.D. Federwisch M.L. Wollmer A. Blundell T.L. McDonald N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In other studies, however, it has been concluded that EGF is able to promote dimerization of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor when that domain is present at high concentrations. Hurwitz et al. (22Hurwitz D.R. Emanuel S.L. Nathan M.H. Sarver N. Ullrich A. Felder S. Lax I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22035-22043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were able to detect small amounts of dimerization of a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor produced in baculovirus by cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate. Under these conditions an almost equivalent amount of trimer and detectable amounts of tetramer were also observed (7Lax I. Mitra A.K. Ravera C. Hurwitz D.R. Rubinstein M. Ullrich A. Stroud R.M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13828-13833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hurwitz D.R. Emanuel S.L. Nathan M.H. Sarver N. Ullrich A. Felder S. Lax I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22035-22043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The long cross-linking reaction with disuccinimidyl suberate at the high concentrations of EGF (0.1 mg ml−1) may have resulted in the cross-linking of the EGF itself, forming dimers, trimers, and tetramers, and these multivalent forms of the hormone may have led to the higher oligomers of the extracellular domain that were observed. In a separate study, Brown et al. (23Brown P.M. Debanne M.T. Grothe S. Bergsma D. Caron M. Kay C. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) presented data interpreted as demonstrating that the binding of EGF could induce dimerization of a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor, but the concentration of protein used (170 μm) was so high that significant amounts of dimer were detected even in the absence of EGF, whereas incubation with high concentrations of EGF (340 μm) were required to produce increases in the yield of dimer and even then the monomer still predominated. The most striking experimental observation in all of these studies was that the concentrations of EGF required to observe significant amounts of the dimeric recombinant extracellular domain were anywhere from 100-fold to more than a 1,000-fold higher than the reported dissociation constants (22Hurwitz D.R. Emanuel S.L. Nathan M.H. Sarver N. Ullrich A. Felder S. Lax I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22035-22043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brown P.M. Debanne M.T. Grothe S. Bergsma D. Caron M. Kay C. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One reason that such high amounts of EGF had to be used in some of these experiments was that the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain had to be at high concentrations to observe the dimerization. Nevertheless, one is left with the impression that the oligomerization that is occurring during the long times involved in the cross-linking of EGF receptor performed in many of these experiments is only indirectly related to the binding of EGF. The recent report by Lemmon et al. (5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), however, is significantly more convincing. They report that EGF induces the quantitative formation of dimers of a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor, as assayed by small angle x-ray scattering, but only at high concentrations of the protein. This has been the only report that has demonstrated a quantitative dimerization of a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor. Dimerization of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment proceeded to completion at concentrations of competent protein as low as 2.5 nm (Fig. 3). Under identical conditions of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentrations of glycerol and Triton X-100, intact, native EGF receptor at concentrations as low as 2 nm also dimerizes completely upon addition of EGF (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Sherrill J.M. Kyte J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5705-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, to observe quantitative yields of dimerization of a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain lacking the membrane-spanning segment, Lemmonet al. (5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) used concentrations of the domain of 45 μm or greater. Consistent with their results, we and Cadena & Gill (10Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were unable to observe any dimerization of a similar soluble, recombinant extracellular domain at concentrations as high as 5 μm. The fact that the apparent dissociation constant for EGF of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment, as judged by its effect on the yield of dimer (Fig. 1), and the apparent dissociation constant for the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain lacking the membrane-spanning segment, as judged by cross-linking [125I]iodinated EGF to its binding site, were both 500 nm suggests that comparisons of these two proteins should be meaningful. It is also reassuring that these values for the apparent dissociation constants compare favorably with values of 350 nm (21Greenfield C. Hils I. Waterfield M.D. Federwisch M.L. Wollmer A. Blundell T.L. McDonald N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), 250 nm (7Lax I. Mitra A.K. Ravera C. Hurwitz D.R. Rubinstein M. Ullrich A. Stroud R.M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13828-13833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 150 nm(22Hurwitz D.R. Emanuel S.L. Nathan M.H. Sarver N. Ullrich A. Felder S. Lax I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22035-22043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for other preparations of soluble, recombinant EGF receptor. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that the conditions under which the dimerization of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain and the dimerization of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment were assessed in the present experiments were not identical because these two proteins were prepared by different protocols. The soluble, recombinant extracellular domain was provided to us as a protein that had been purified from the culture medium surrounding the Chinese hamster ovary cells that had excreted it, and the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment was expressed in murine B82 cells and tested for dimerization in the context of a crude lysate of these cells. We did examine these two proteins under identical conditions of temperature, pH, and detergent concentration. In fact, even at a 20-fold dilution, the condition most important for its comparison with the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain, the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment showed no decrease in the amount of dimerization (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, the remaining cytoplasm of the lysed cells had been diluted more than 200-fold over its concentration in the cell, and the solution should be even more similar to that in which the purified soluble, recombinant extracellular domain was dissolved. For all of these reasons, we believe that valid comparisons can be made between the behavior of these two proteins. Therefore, dimers of both intact, native EGF receptor and of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment have dissociation constants at least 10,000-fold smaller than that of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain. It follows that addition of the segment of the 23 amino acids GMVGALLLLLVVALGIGLFMRRR, which contains the sequence spanning the membrane with an additional three to six amino acids that extend into the cytoplasm, converts a protein that dimerizes reluctantly into a protein that dimerizes avidly in response to the addition of EGF. This observation suggests that rather than playing a passive role in the dimerization of EGF receptor produced by EGF, the two membrane-spanning domains from the two monomers of EGF receptor that dimerize upon the binding of EGF provide molecular surfaces that associate to yield a significant portion of the standard free energy of dimerization. This possibility has always been an implication of the fact that the mutation of valine 664 to a glutamate (17Bargmann C.I. Hung M. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) in the membrane-spanning segment of the rat Neu protein turns an inactive, monomeric protein tyrosine kinase into a constitutively active (18Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5394-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), constitutively dimeric (19Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) protein tyrosine kinase. It has been argued that the high concentrations of soluble, recombinant extracellular domain that are necessary to observe dimerization result from the fact that the protein is in free solution rather than in the membrane (5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). While it is true that intact EGF receptor in a cell membrane is restricted to diffusion in two, rather than three, dimensions, native intact EGF receptor or its extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment when they are dissolved in solutions of Triton X-100 have the same degrees of diffusional freedom as a soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor, yet high concentrations of these proteins are not required to observe the dimerization produced by EGF. Because a 1% solution of Triton X-100 is 0.1 mm in micelles (24Yedgar S. Barenholz Y. Cooper V.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 363: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Kushner L.M. Hubbard W.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 1163-1167Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a concentration over 1,000-fold greater than the concentration of native EGF receptor in even undiluted detergent extracts of A431 cells, it can be concluded that the small minority of the micelles that are occupied by molecules of native EGF receptor or the extracytoplasmic domain containing the membrane-spanning segment will contain only one molecule of the respective monomeric protein. In fact, if a significant fraction of the molecules of unactivated monomeric intact EGF receptor or monomeric unactivated extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment shared the same micelle with any protein, let alone one of its twins, then cross-linking of it with these other molecules of protein would be unavoidable because of their close proximity, and clear bands of immunostained monomeric protein would not be observed on the respective Western blots, but they are (1Canals F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4493-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). If each molecule of monomeric native EGF receptor in these solutions is alone in its micelle, there is no fundamental difference between its diffusion through the solution and the diffusion of the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain through the solution, and direct comparisons between the two in terms of dissociation constants are valid. Nor is it proper to consider the micelles of Triton X-100 as a separate phase (5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) when evaluating the dissociation constants of the intact native EGF receptor or its extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment. The proteins are equal to or greater in mass (molar masses of 71,300 g mol−1 and 132,000 g mol−1) than a micelle (24Yedgar S. Barenholz Y. Cooper V.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 363: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Kushner L.M. Hubbard W.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 1163-1167Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) of Triton X-100 alone (molar mass of 90,000 g mol−1). Furthermore, the size of a micelle of Triton X-100 does not dramatically increase as phospholipid dissolves in it (24Yedgar S. Barenholz Y. Cooper V.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 363: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 489-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); in the relevant range of mole fraction, as molecules of phospholipid are incorporated into a micelle, the number of molecules of Triton X-100 present increases at most by 50% (24Yedgar S. Barenholz Y. Cooper V.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 363: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mixed micelles of Triton X-100 and endogenous phospholipid surrounding the dissolved transmembrane segments of the proteins in the detergent extracts used in these experiments are simply accretions upon the proteins themselves (27Kyte J. Structure in Protein Chemistry. Garland, NY1995: 521-523Google Scholar). Consequently, the molar concentrations relevant to quantification of the equilibria are those of the complexes between the proteins and the detergent expressed in moles of complex for each liter of aqueous solution, not in moles for each liter of Triton X-100. Finally, it is unlikely that the simple fusion of the two micelles, one from each monomer of the native enzyme or of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment, contributes any favorable free energy of association to the formation of a dimer. This conclusion follows from the fact that above the critical micelle concentration, increasing the concentration of Triton X-100 has little effect on the mass of either micelles of pure Triton X-100 or mixed micelles of phospholipid and Triton X-100 (24Yedgar S. Barenholz Y. Cooper V.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 363: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Kushner L.M. Hubbard W.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 1163-1167Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that a micelle represents the most stable oligomer of the detergent at the given pH, ionic strength, and temperature (16Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, NY1980: 42-89Google Scholar), and doubling its size by fusion should, if anything, be unfavorable. When both free EGF and EGF bound to the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment were removed from the solution by passage over an immunoadsorbent for EGF (15Tanner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14889-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the dimeric protein reverted to monomer within 5 min of the removal of the EGF (Fig. 5). This behavior is distinct from the behavior of dimeric, enzymatically active intact EGF receptor from which the EGF has been removed by passage over the same immunoadsorbent. Unliganded dimer of intact EGF receptor remains dimerized over several hours (15Tanner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14889-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). If it is assumed that the half time for dissociation of the dimer of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment is less that 4 min, then the rate constant for its dissociation must be greater than 0.2 min−1. The rate of dissociation of the unliganded native enzyme has been estimated to be 0.26 h−1. Therefore, the dissociation of a dimer of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment is at least 40-fold faster than the dissociation of a dimer of the native enzyme. This result suggests that regions of the cytoplasmic domain of EGF receptor must form strong associations in the native dimer of the intact enzyme. The facts that the soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of EGF receptor does not avidly form dimers in response to addition of EGF, that adding EGF to the extracellular domain of EGF receptor containing the membrane-spanning segment results in its rapid dimerization in even the most dilute solutions of the protein, that this dimer rapidly dissociates upon removal of the EGF, and that intact EGF receptor remains dimerized even in the absence of EGF lead to a new proposal that is an alternative to that presented by Lemmon et al.(5Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) for the mechanism of dimerization of EGF receptor. The unoccupied extracellular, ligand-binding domain of intact, native EGF receptor, rather than being the source of its dimerization, sterically inhibits its dimerization. The binding of EGF produces a conformational change in the extracellular domain relieving the steric inhibition. It is this relief of the steric effect that permits the protein to undergo rapid homodimerization. Some of the contacts that are necessary to realize this dimerization in the presence of EGF, must be in the segment of amino acids that spans the membrane because only feeble dimerization is observed with the extracellular domain alone. These contacts between membrane-spanning segments are sufficient to stabilize the dimer but only in the presence of EGF because, when EGF is removed from the dimer of the extracellular domain containing the membrane-spanning segment, it rapidly reverts to monomer. This suggests that the conformational change relieving the steric inhibition is rapidly reversible upon dissociation of EGF. When the cytoplasmic domain of EGF receptor is present, however, additional surfaces from these domains in the dimer of EGF receptor must interact favorably to provide a significant portion of the stabilization of the homodimer because dimerization of the intact native EGF receptor persists for hours following the removal of EGF by passage over the immunoadsorbent. We thank Dr. Gordon Gill, Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego for providing us with the B-82 cells used in these experiments and for his consistent interest and encouragement. Samples of the purified soluble, recombinant extracellular domain of human EGF receptor were kindly provided by Dr. Deborah Cadena, Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego."

https://openalex.org/W2022143748,"In vitro mRNA synthesis of Sendai virus is almost entirely dependent on the addition of cellular proteins (host factors). Previous studies indicated that the host factor activity from bovine brain was resolved into at least two complementary fractions, one of which may be tubulin. In this study, the host factor activity that stimulates the transcription in the presence of tubulin was further purified from bovine brain. This fraction was found to contain at least two complementary factors, and one of them was purified to a single polypeptide chain with an apparentM r of 46,000 (p46). From the amino acid sequence, biochemical, and immunological analyses, p46 was identified as a glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Purified native PGK from rabbit and yeast, and a recombinant human PGK substituted for p46. Although, as previously suggested, tubulin was involved in the transcription initiation complex formation by being integrated into the complex, p46 and its complementary factor had little effect on the complex formation. On the other hand, when p46 and the complementary factor were added to the RNA chain elongation reaction from the isolated initiation complex formed with tubulin, mRNA synthesis was dramatically stimulated. The enzymatic activity per se of PGK did not seem to be required for its activity. West-Western blot analysis showed that PGK could directly interact with tubulin. These data suggest that PGK stimulates Sendai virus mRNA synthesis at the elongation step, probably through its interaction with tubulin in the initiation complex.

These data suggest that PGK stimulates Sendai virus mRNA synthesis at the elongation step, probably through its interaction with tubulin in the initiation complex. Sendai virus phosphoglycerate kinase ribonucleoprotein vesicular stomatitis virus human parainfluenza virus dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin polyvinylidene difluoride horseradish peroxidase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone Sendai virus (SeV),1 a member of the Paramyxovirus family in the order Mononegavirales, contains a monopartite negative strand RNA genome, which consists of six genes encoding the viral proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), hemagglutin-neuraminidase glycoprotein (HN), and large protein (L) (reviewed in Refs. 1Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1177-1204Google Scholar, 2Collins P.L. Chanock R.M. McIntosh K. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M.

The viral envelope encloses a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), which mainly contains the RNA genome of 15.3 kilobases and three viral proteins: NP, P, and L. The RNA genome encapsidated with the NP proteins serves as the template to synthesize a positive strand leader RNA and mRNAs as well as a full-length positive strand anti-genomic RNA, which serves as the template for the negative strand RNA genome (1Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1177-1204Google Scholar). The genetic information of the RNA genome is expressed through at least six monocistronic mRNA species. The P gene mRNA products which encode the C and V protein families, in addition to the P protein, use multiple translation initiation sites as well as an open reading frame newly generated by RNA editing (1Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1177-1204Google Scholar). According to a current model (1Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1177-1204Google Scholar), the viral RNA synthesis starts with a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase entering at the 3′ end of the genome RNA, where the viral RNA polymerase initiates the sequential synthesis of a leader RNA and mRNAs or synthesizes a full-length anti-genome RNA. However, little is known about the mechanism of mode switching of the RNA polymerase from transcription to replication, although it has been shown that three viral proteins, the NP, P, and L proteins are required for transcription and replication of the genome RNA (4Horikami S.M. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1992; 189: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Curran J. Pelet T. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1994; 202: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and that the L protein interacts with the P protein to form the polymerase complex for replication and transcription (4Horikami S.M. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Smallwood S. Ryan K.W. Moyer S.A. Virology. 1994; 202: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that, during replication, P protein acts as a chaperon for the NP to encapsidate newly synthesized genome or anti-genome RNAs (8Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies using in vitro transcription systems of paramyxoviruses, e.g. human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) (9De B.P. Galinski M.S.

Virus Res. 1996; 41: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and canine distemper virus (15Oglesbee M.J. Liu Z. Kenney H. Brooks C.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2125-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggest the involvement of cellular proteins in the viral RNA synthesis in addition to viral proteins (reviewed in Refs. 16Moyer S.A. Horikami S.M. Kingsbury D.W. The Paramyxoviruses. Plenum Press, New York1991: 249-274Crossref Google Scholar and 17De B.P. Banerjee A.K. Adv. Virus Res. 1997; 48: 169-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have established an accurate and efficient in vitromRNA synthesizing system using purified SeV particles or viral RNP complexes, in which viral mRNA synthesis is almost completely dependent on the presence of host cell proteins (host factors) (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that cellular tubulin, which is essential forin vitro transcription of SeV, is integrated into the transcription initiation complex and activates viral mRNA synthesis (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Takagi T. Muroya K. Iwama M. Shioda T. Tsukamoto T. Mizumoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The involvement of tubulin in SeV RNA synthesis was also supported by the inhibition of in vitro transcription of SeV by a monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (20Moyer S.A. Baker S.C. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5405-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Deet al. (21De B.P. Lesoon A. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3268-3275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22De B.P. Burdsall A.L. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5703-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the polymeric form of actin binds viral RNP of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) and activates in vitro transcription. They also found that the HPIV3 RNPs are specifically localized on the actin microfilaments in the virus-infected cells (23Gupta S. De B.P. Drazba J.A. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2655-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The participation of tubulin or actin in transcription has also been observed in measles virus (12Moyer S.A. Baker S.C. Horikami S.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and respiratory syncytial virus (24Huang Y.T. Romito R.R. De B.P. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1993; 193: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Burke E. Dupuy L. Wall C. Barik S. Virology. 1998; 252: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), respectively. Furthermore, cellular protein kinases such as casein kinase II and protein kinase C isoform ζ have been shown to phosphorylate the P protein (26Villanueva N. Navarro J. Mendez E. Garcia-Albert I. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Das T. Shuster A. Schneider-Schaulies S. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 1995; 211: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28De B.P. Gupta S. Gupta S. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5204-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Huntley C.C. De B.P. Banerjee A.K. J. Biol.

Virology. 1997; 26: 198-206Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the precise mode of action of these host factors in activating and regulating the RNA polymerase of paramyxoviruses remains to be studied. In addition, there seem to be other factors required for the transcription as well as replication of paramyxovirus genome that have not been identified yet (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Takagi T. Muroya K. Iwama M. Shioda T. Tsukamoto T. Mizumoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, the purification and the functional analysis of each host factor may, of course, provide an important step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of transcription and replication of the paramyxovirus genome. In this study, we purified the host factor activity complementary to tubulin, and showed it has at least two components, and we identified one of them as phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), a glycolytic enzyme. This is the first example showing the involvement of a glycolytic enzyme in the transcription of paramyxoviruses. We have shown that PGK stimulates viral mRNA synthesis at the elongation step, probably through its interaction with tubulin integrated into the initiation complex. Tubulin stimulated both mRNA synthesis and leader RNA synthesis of SeV, while PGK failed to stimulate leader RNA synthesis, suggesting that mRNA and leader RNA synthesis may be regulated by different sets of host proteins.

Microtubular proteins were prepared form bovine brain through three assembly-disassembly cycles as described by Shelanski et al. (32Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Purified tubulin free from microtubule-associated protein was obtained as a heterodimer by phosphocellulose column chromatography of microtubular proteins as reported by Weingartenet al. (33Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). In vitro mRNA synthesis of Sendai virus or vesicular stomatitis virus was carried out under standard conditions as described by Mizumoto et al. (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with 50 μm[α-32P]UTP (3,000–5,000 cpm/pmol) and 6 μg of purified Sendai virus particles, or with 50 μm[α-32P]UTP (500–1,000 cpm/pmol) and 1 μg of purified vesicular stomatitis virus particles. After incubation for 120 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were treated with proteinase K. The transcripts were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol, and then electrophoresed in an 1.2% agarose gel after denaturation with glyoxal. In vitro plus leader RNA synthesis of Sendai virus was carried out with 10 μm[α-32P]GTP (40,000–50,000 cpm/pmol) and 6 μg of virus particles under the same conditions for mRNA synthesis except that UTP was omitted, as described elsewhere. 2M. Iwama and K. Mizumoto, manuscript in preparation. After incubation for 120 min at 30 °C, the RNA products were denatured with formamide, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Purified Sendai virus particles (300 μg) were solubilized by incubation in 500 μl of a solution containing 40 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.9 at 20 °C), 30 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged in a 2-ml tube in a Beckman TLS55 rotor containing 750 μl cushion A (30% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) layered on a 750-μl cushion B (50% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT), at 100,000 × g for 120 min at 4 °C. The RNP pellets were resuspended in 60% sucrose/TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), and then subjected to in vitro transcription. The amounts of the pelleted viral RNP used for transcription were determined by adjusting NP protein contents in each RNP to that of 6 μg (total protein) of virus particles using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The transcription initiation complex was isolated as described by Takagi et al. (19Takagi T. Muroya K. Iwama M. Shioda T. Tsukamoto T. Mizumoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purified Sendai virus particles (30 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with the host factor in a 125-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9 at 20 °C), 30 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged in a 0.8-ml ultraclear tube (Beckman), which contained two cushions, A and B (200 μl each), at 100,000 × g for 120 min at 4 °C in a Hitachi P55ST-2 rotor with adapters. The viral RNP pellets were resuspended in cushion B and were subjected to the elongation reaction without additional host factors. All operations were performed at 4 °C. Bovine brain extract (S100) (36 mg, 3.6 ml) was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite (Hypatite C) column (inner diameter, 1.6 × 16 cm) pre-equilibrated with 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (1 mmKH2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 6.9 at 20 °C), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) as described by Mizumoto et al. (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and proteins were step-eluted with 75, 150, 300, and 600 mm potassium phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 26 ml/h. Proteins in each fraction were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation) and then used for in vitro transcription assays. The 75, 150, 300, and 600 mm potassium phosphate eluates were referred to as HA75, HA150, HA300, and HA600, respectively. For further purification of host factors in HA75, hydroxylapatite column chromatography was done in four batches without ammonium sulfate precipitation. The HA75 fractions from four batches were combined and then dialyzed against TEMG (20 mm Tris-KCl (pH7.9 at 20 °C), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) containing 20 mm KCl. Approximately 172 ml (0.5 mg/ml) of the HA75 was obtained from 14.4 ml of S100 fraction. A portion (43 mg, 86 ml) of the HA75 fraction was loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose column (inner diameter, 1.6 × 18 cm) pre-equilibrated with TEMG/20 mm KCl, and proteins were step-eluted with TEMG containing 20, 150, and 300 mm KCl at a flow rate of 18 ml/h. The 20, 150, and 300 mm KCl eluates were referred to as BS20, BS150, and BS300, respectively. This column gave two active, complementary fractions, BS20 and BS150. The BS150 fractions from two batches were combined and dialyzed against TEMG/150 mm KCl. The dialysate of BS150 (50 ml, 0.26 mg/ml) was subjected to Heparin-Sepharose column chromatography. The BS20 fraction was kept at −80 °C. A batch (6.5 mg, 25 ml) of the BS150 fraction was loaded onto a Heparin-Sepharose column (inner diameter, 0.8 × 9.6 cm) pre-equilibrated with TEMG/150 mm KCl. After washing the column with 10 ml of the same buffer, proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 150–350 mm KCl in TEMG at a flow rate of 6 ml/h and fractions of 0.54 ml were collected. The active fractions (220 mm KCl eluate, referred to HS220) containing a single polypeptide with M r of 46,000 (p46) (0.035 mg/ml, 19.5 ml from two batches) were pooled and stored at −80 °C. Highly purified p46 (90 μg, ∼2 nmol) was digested with TPCK-treated trypsin (2 μg) at 1:45 ratio (enzyme/substrate, w/w) in 180 μl of a trypsin-digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm CaCl2) at 30 °C overnight. The tryptic peptides were fractionated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The individual peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer. The obtained amino acid sequences were compared with sequences in the protein data base (PIR) by using the BLAST program. PGK activity was assayed in a coupled reaction with GAPDH reaction as described by Lee (34Lee C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The assay was performed at room temperature (∼25 °C) in a total volume of 0.5 ml containing 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 6 mm3-phosphoglycerate, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μg of GAPDH, and 5–30 ng of PGK fraction. The consumption of NADH is monitored at 340 nm. One unit of PGK activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (= oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH) per minute, using a molar extinction coefficient for NADH of 6.3 × 103m−1cm−1. Rabbit muscle PGK (300 μg, obtained from Sigma) was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a New Zealand White rabbit (2 kg) four times at about 3-week intervals. After 11 weeks from the first immunization, polyclonal rabbit muscle PGK antibodies were affinity-purified using a rabbit muscle PGK-immobilized affinity column that had been prepared by coupling of PGK to 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium toluene-4-sulfonate-activated Cellulofine according to the manufacture's protocol. The coding sequence of human PGK-1 (GenBank accession nos.L00159 and L00160) was amplified from human leukocyte RNA (35Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Niikura Y. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commn. 1998; 251: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by RT-PCR using a sense primer, 5′-CCA GGATCC ATG TCG CTT TCT AAC AAG C-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and an antisense primer, 5′-GGT AGATCT AAT ATT GCT GAG AGC ATC CAC-3′ (BglII site underlined). The amplified PCR fragments of 1269 base pairs were digested with BamHI and BglII, inserted into BamHI andBglII sites of the pQE-16 plasmid (Qiagen), and sequenced to confirm their sequences and orientations. The resultant plasmid, pQE-hPGK, was transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. E. coli XL1-Blue harboring the plasmid pQE-hPGK were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.6. Expression of the recombinant human PGK with the hexahistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and cells grown for another 2 h before harvesting. The His-tagged human PGK was purified using a nickel- nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed with monoclonal β-tubulin antibody (1:500 dilution) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody for the detection of tubulin, or with affinity-purified polyclonal PGK antibody (1:100 dilution) and HRP-linked protein A for the detection of PGK. The immunocomplex was detected by ECL detection system. To detect the protein band(s) that interacts with tubulin by West-Western blotting, the blotted membrane was first blocked with 3% BSA in a binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with or without highly purified tubulin (50 μg/ml) in a binding buffer containing 0.1% BSA at room temperature for 3 h. After extensive washing of the membrane, tubulin on the membrane was detected by using anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody and 4-chloro-1-naphthol detection system. Protein concentrations were determined by the methods of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. Cellular proteins (host factors) have been considered to have essential roles in the in vitro mRNA synthesis of SeV. We have previously shown that the host factor activity in the bovine brain extract is separated into two complementary fractions by hydroxylapatite column chromatography (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These two fractions synergistically stimulated the in vitromRNA synthesis of SeV, and one could be replaced by highly purified tubulin (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In order to identify and characterize the host factor(s) that acts complementally to tubulin, we attempted to purify the active components from the bovine brain extract. In this study, hydroxylapatite column chromatography was performed as the first step essentially as described by Mizumoto et al. (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Bovine brain extract (S-100 fraction) was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite (Hypatite C) column, and proteins were step-eluted with 75, 150, 300, and 600 mm potassium phosphate buffer, as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. In these conditions, the host factor activity was separated as observed before (18Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) into two complementary fractions, the 75 and 300 mm potassium phosphate eluates (referred to HA75 and HA300, respectively). Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody revealed that tubulin was mainly detected in HA300, but almost not in HA75 (data not shown). Although the addition of HA75 alone (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) or HA300 alone (lane 8) to the in vitro transcription mixture containing SeV particles (lane 1) gave weak transcription-stimulatory activities, the combinatorial addition of HA75 and HA300 synergistically stimulated the reaction to give 18 S size transcript (lane 9). To purify the host factor(s) contained in HA75, the fraction was loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose column, and proteins were step-eluted with 20, 150, and 300 mm KCl (Fig. 1 A). The 20, 150, and 300 mm KCl eluates are referred to as BS20, BS150, and BS300, respectively. When BS fractions were added to the transcription reaction mixture without HA300, each BS fraction alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–5) or in combination (lanes 6 and 7) supported little, if any, stimulatory activity. However, the simultaneous addition of BS20 and BS150 (lane 13) or all Blue-Sepharose column fractions (lane 14) in the presence of a saturating amount of HA300 restored the transcription-stimulatory activity to levels comparable to that obtained with the combination of HA75 and HA300 (lane 9), while each Blue-Sepharose column fraction alone failed to stimulate transcription (lanes 10–12), even in the presence of HA300. These results indicate that the host factor activity in HA75 can be further separated into the BS20 and BS150 fractions. One of the two complementary fractions from Blue-Sepharose column, BS150, was further purified through a Heparin-Sepharose column. As shown in Fig. 2 A, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 150–350 mm KCl, and the transcription-stimulatory activity of each fraction was assayed in the presence of HA300 and BS20. The activity was eluted as a single peak at 220 mm KCl. As seen in Fig. 2 B, the active fractions (fractions 110–126) contained a single polypeptide with an apparent M r of 46,000 (p46), which was coeluted with the transcription-stimulatory activity (lanes 5–9). To investigate the complementarity of the host factors for the transcription stimulation in a more purified system, p46 and BS20 were subjected to an in vitro transcription system reconstituted with highly purified tubulin instead of HA300 using viral particles or viral RNP (Fig. 3). In the case of transcription with virions (Fig. 3 B), the addition of BS20 alone (lane 2), p46 alone (lane 3), or their combination (lane 4) caused a weak stimulation activity. In the presence of a saturating amount of highly purified tubulin, which by itself had some stimulatory activity (lane 5), neither BS20 (lane 6) nor p46 (lane 7) altered the reaction. However, the combination of three factors, BS20, p46, and tubulin, resulted in significant stimulation of mRNA synthesis (lane 8). In order to characterize the host factors using a more purified viral transcription machinery, the viral RNP complex was isola"

We now examine functional interactions between growth hormone (GH) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. Although EGF enhanced ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, GH, while causing retardation of its migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, decreased ErbB-2's tyrosine phosphorylation. GH-induced retardation was reversed by treatment of anti-ErbB-2 precipitates with both alkaline phosphatase and protein phosphatase 2A, suggesting that GH induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of ErbB-2. Both GH-induced shift in ErbB-2 migration and GH-induced MAP kinase activation were unaffected by a protein kinase C inhibitor but were blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor, PD98059. Notably, leukemia inhibitory factor, but not interferon-γ, also promoted ErbB-2 shift and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Cotreatment with EGF and GH versus EGF alone resulted in a 35% decline in acute ErbB-2 tyrosine 1248 autophosphorylation, a marked decline (approximately 50%) in DNA synthesis, and substantially decreased cyclin D1 expression. We conclude that in 3T3-F442A cells, 1) the GH-induced decrease in ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with MEK1/mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and 2) GH antagonizes EGF-induced DNA synthesis and cyclin D1 expression in a pattern consistent with its alteration in ErbB-2 phosphorylation status.

Following GH-induced GHR dimerization and JAK2 activation, several signaling pathways are engaged, including those involving signal transducers and activators of transcription, insulin receptor substrates/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and MAP kinases and their upstream activators in the Ras-Raf-MEK1 pathway (Refs. 12Frank S.J.

Prolonged treatment of 3T3-F442A cells with GH in a mixture of other growth factors results in their differentiation from fibroblasts (preadipocytes) to adipocytes (14Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). GH, unlike other growth factors found in serum, does not promote proliferation of the fibroblast form. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), however, is a potent mitogen for 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, which have EGF receptors (EGFRs) that are readily detectable immunologically (27Wiepz G.J. Houtman J.C.D. Cha D. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The EGFR (ErbB-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in its cytoplasmic domain and is a member of a receptor family that includes the structurally related ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4. Though no ligand is known for ErbB-2, it is activated upon binding of EGF or transforming growth factor-α to the EGFR or following the binding of neuregulins or heregulins to ErbB-3 and/or ErbB-4 (28Graus-Porta D.

It is believed that ErbB-2 participates in signaling by heterodimerizing with other ErbB family members upon binding of those receptors to their respective ligands (32Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Further, ErbB-2, when overexpressed (as it is in many cancer cells (33Berger M.S. Locher G.W. Saurer S. Gullick W.J. Waterfield M.D. Groner B. Hynes H.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1238-1243PubMed Google Scholar)) or when mutated (34Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. Cao H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3969-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), can homodimerize to confer ligand-independent signaling. ErbB-2 signaling can have various biological results, including cellular proliferation (35Segatto O. Lonordo F. Helin K. Wexler D. Fazioli R. Rhee S.G. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1339-1346PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent reports point to biologically relevant cross-talk between signaling via ErbB family members and signaling promoted by GH and other cytokines and non-EGF family growth factors (27Wiepz G.J.

For instance, the EGFR and ErbB-2 have been implicated as signaling components in pathways activated by GH and interleukin-6 (IL-6), respectively, in the absence of EGF or other ErbB family ligands (36Yamauchi T.

Other reports indicate that in various cell types EGF signaling via EGFR and/or ErbB-2 can be inhibited by GH, prolactin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, PMA (27Wiepz G.J. Houtman J.C.D. Cha D. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Epstein R.J. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. Stiles C.D. J. Biol.

In several instances, such inhibition has been speculated to be dependent on the activation of PKC, although the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. In this study, we use 3T3-F442A fibroblasts to explore biochemical and functional effects of GH on EGFR and ErbB-2. We observe that upon GH treatment, there is an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, whereas ErbB-2 undergoes a shift in electrophoretic mobility that can be reversed by alkaline phosphatase or protein phosphatase 2A (PP 2A) treatment and is accompanied by a decrease in basal and EGF-induced ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. This GH-induced mobility shift of ErbB-2 is not affected by the PKC antagonist GF109203X, but it is completely blocked by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059. Furthermore, although two other cytokines, namely leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), can activate JAK2 in these cells, only LIF (and not IFN-γ) can promote both MAP kinase activation and a shift in ErbB-2 migration. Finally, we demonstrate that GH and LIF can substantially inhibit EGF-induced DNA synthesis and cyclin D1 expression in these cells. Our results point to a potentially relevant modulation of ErbB-2 phosphorylation and EGF signaling by a GH-induced pathway. Recombinant human GH was kindly provided by Lilly (to S. J.

Serum starvation of 3T3-F442A cells was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for serum in the culture medium for 16–20 h prior to experiments, except as indicated below in the description of the [3H]thymidine incorporation and cyclin D1 protein expression experiments. Pretreatments and stimulations were carried out at 37 °C in binding buffer (consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dextrose). GF109203X (0.5 μm) or PD98059 (100 μm) (or Me2SO, as a vehicle control) were incubated with serum-starved cells for 15 or 60 min, respectively, prior to treatment with GH (500 ng/ml). The inhibitors were diluted from Me2SO-dissolved stock solutions (GF109203X (1 mm) and PD98059 (50 mm)); final Me2SO concentration was always 0.2% (v/v) or less. Details of the GH treatment protocol have been described (15Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.-S. Frank S.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, 3T3-F442A cells were stimulated in confluent 100 × 20-mm dishes (Falcon) in binding buffer, except as indicated. Stimulations were terminated by washing the cells once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate (PBS-vanadate) and then harvesting by scraping in PBS-vanadate; pelleted cells were collected by brief centrifugation. Pelleted cells were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in fusion lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), as indicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the detergent extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation or were directly electrophoresed, as indicated below. For immunoprecipitation, the rabbit antisera described above were used at the following volumes or amounts per precipitation: anti-JAK2AL33 (directed at residues 746–1129), 3 μl; anti-ErbB-2, 1 μg; anti-EGFR, 1 μg. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to adsorb immune complexes, and, after extensive washing with lysis buffer, Laemmli sample buffer eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated. For enzymatic dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase, anti-ErbB-2 precipitates were washed once with PBS and then incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs) in 60 μl of CIP reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of twice concentrated Laemmli sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and the eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as below. Dephosphorylation of immunoprecipitated ErbB-2 with the serine/threonine-specific phosphatase, PP 2A, was accomplished in a similar fashion by incubation with 0.5 units of PP 2A in 60 μl of PP 2A reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm MnCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 37 °C. As indicated, okadaic acid (50 μm) (or its vehicle, Me2SO) was added during the incubation. Resolution of proteins under reduced conditions by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer of proteins, and blocking of Hybond-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 2% bovine serum albumin was performed as described previously (15Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Yi W. Feng G.-S. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2344-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), except as described for the cyclin D1 protein expression experiments. Immunoblotting with antibodies 4G10 (1:2500), anti-ErbB-2 (1:1000), anti-EGFR (1:1000), anti-Tyr(P)-ErbB-2 (1:1000), anti-active MAPK (1:5000), anti-MAPK (1:4000–1:1000), anti-cyclin-D1 (1:500), or anti-JAK2 peptide antiserum (1:2500) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:1500) and ECL detection reagents (all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stripping and reprobing of blots were accomplished according to the manufacturer's suggestions. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were cultured in 24-well plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) and allowed to grow for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then serum-starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine calf serum under the same conditions. The cells were treated in triplicate with control buffer (40 μm HEPES, pH 7.4), EGF (10 nm), GH (220 ng/ml), or LIF (25 ng/ml) or combinations of GH or LIF and EGF, as indicated, for 18 h. [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/well) was added, and the cells were further incubated for 3.5 h. After removal of media, cells were treated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min and washed once with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were then solubilized with hot 0.5 n NaOH, 0.1% SDS solution. After neutralization with 1 n HCl, solutions were diluted with water, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture plates (Falcon) and serum-starved as described for [3H]thymidine incorporation experiments. The cells were treated with control buffer (40 μm HEPES, pH 7.4), EGF (10 nm), GH (220 ng/ml), or LIF (25 ng/ml) or with combinations of either GH or LIF and EGF, as indicated, for 18 h. After washing twice with ice-cold Hanks' buffered saline (containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate), cells were collected and lysed in twice-concentrated boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20% (v/v) glycerol) and further boiled for 5 min. Samples were sonicated for 10 s, and the total protein concentration of each sample was assessed by the Micro-BCA method (Pierce). Total cellular proteins (50 μg/sample) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma) at 0.5 mA for 90 min. The membrane was then blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk. Cyclin D1 protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin D1 antibody, as described above. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-MAP kinase, as above, to assess protein loading equivalence. The effects of GH and LIF on EGF-induced cyclin D1 expression were quantified by densitometry, as below. The percentage of EGF-induced cyclin D1 protein expression (Fig. 10) was calculated by subtracting the amount of cyclin D1 protein expression in the control-treated cells and dividing by the amount of cyclin D1 protein expressed in the presence of EGF alone (EGF-induced cyclin D1 expression was defined as 100%). Densitometry of ECL immunoblots was performed using a solid state video camera (Sony-77, Sony Corp.) and a 28-mm MicroNikkor lens over a light box of variable intensity (Northern Light Precision 890, Imaging Research Inc., Toronto, Canada). Quantification was performed using a Macintosh II-based image analysis program (Image 1.49 (or 1.62), developed by W. S. Rasband, Research Services Branch, NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Relative ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in detergent extracts of cells treated with EGF and GH or with EGF alone (as in the experiment in Fig. 8 B) was estimated in each instance by the ratio of densitometrically determined anti-Tyr(P)-ErbB-2 immunoblotting signal (tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB-2) to the densitometric signal of the same band after stripping and reprobing with anti-ErbB-2 (total ErbB-2). The relative ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, determined as such, was then compared for EGF/GH costimulation versus EGF stimulation alone. To further understand potential functional interactions between the GH and EGF signaling systems, we used the GH- and EGF-responsive 3T3-F442A murine preadipocyte cell line (14Green H. Kehinde O.

CHO-4E cells have 20–40-fold elevated RNR2 protein, reflecting an increased distribution of RNR2 mRNA to the heavy polysomes.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is assumed to be the least abundant of the initiation factors and is rate-limiting for translation of some mRNAs (2Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.B. J. Biol.

This function is critical during scanning for exposing and locating the translation start site (4Rhoads R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 3017-3020Google Scholar, 6Morley S.J. Mol. Biol.

The temperature sensitive mutant strain,cdc33–1, arrests in G1 (before Start) with small, unbudded cells at the restrictive temperature.Overexpression of eIF4E causes deregulated cell growth and malignant transformation of rodent and human cells (9Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 10De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hence, the mechanism of transformation by eIF4E presents an important and challenging biological phenomenon. Furthermore, eIF4E is elevated in common human neoplasms, such as carcinomas of the breast and the head and neck (12Kerekatte V. Smiley K. Hu B. Smith A. Gelder F. De Benedetti A. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,13Nathan CA Liu L. Li B. Nandy I. Abreo F. De Benedetti A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One explanation is that the translation of certain proto-oncogene or growth factor transcripts, which normally are translationally repressed, becomes preferentially increased by an excess eIF4E. Accordingly, a few of these have been identified, e.g. c-Myc and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (reviewed in Refs. 14Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar and 15De Benedetti A. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, a systematic identification of the transcripts of which the translation is increased by the excess eIF4E would represent a major step forward in understanding the role of dysregulation of protein synthesis in cancer etiology. We have addressed this task with the construction of a subtraction cDNA library from the heavy polysomes of CHO cells overexpressing eIF4E (CHO-4E). From an initial screening, we identified an abundantly represented product corresponding to the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR2).Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) into deoxyribonucleotides (dNDPs), one of the most specific and rate-limiting steps in DNA synthesis. The RNR holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two large subunits (RNR1) and two small subunits (RNR2). RNR2 maintains a stabilized tyrosyl radical essential for the reduction of ribose. RNR1 harbors redox-active cysteines and allosteric sites to maintain balanced pools of nucleotides. Given the huge energetic investment of generating the necessarily large pool of dNTPs for DNA replication and repair, it is not surprising that RNR expression is carefully regulated and restricted to the late G1 and S (and G2) phases of the cell cycle or to conditions of DNA damage (16Eriksson S. Groppi V. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1984; 165: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 17Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 18Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genet. Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In mammals, only the expression of RNR2 is regulated, reportedly at the transcriptional level (20Thelander L. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3433-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, RNR1 is constitutively expressed throughout the cycle. In S. cerevisiae, RNR1 is cell cycle-regulated at the transcriptional level (18Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genet. Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The level of dNTPs can be rate-limiting for DNA replication. This is evidenced from the fact that temperature sensitive mutants of RNR in yeast traverse the S phase very slowly and arrest in S phase at the restrictive temperature with large budded cells (19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Zhou B.S. Hsu N.Y. Pan B.C. Doroshow J.H. Yen Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1328-1333PubMed Google Scholar). Agents that inhibit dNTPs synthesis, such as methotrexate, are used to inhibit replication of cancer cells; conversely, elevated RNR may hasten the cell division. Accordingly,RNR2 was recently recognized as a powerful transforming agent in cooperation with a variety of oncogenes in mammalian cell lines (22Fan H. Villegas C. Wright J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14036-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Fan H. Villegas C. Huang A. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1650-1653PubMed Google Scholar). RNR2 was also identified as an overexpressed product in a panel of breast carcinomas (24Jensen R.A. Page D.L. Holt J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).We propose that increased expression of RNR2 in cells with elevated eIF4E represents an important avenue by which eIF4E can induce malignant transformation. Moreover, the evidence herein for translational regulation of RNR constitutes perhaps the most direct link between a central player in protein synthesis (eIF4E) and a key enzyme in DNA synthesis.DISCUSSIONeIF4E is a powerful oncogene/growth activator when overexpressed in model cell lines (9Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 10De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, eIF4E is elevated 3–30-fold in breast carcinomas but not in benign lesions, indicating that its overexpression may mark a critical transition in the genesis of breast cancer (12Kerekatte V. Smiley K. Hu B. Smith A. Gelder F. De Benedetti A. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38DeFatta R.J. Turbat-Herrera E.A. Li B.D.L. Anderson W. De Benedetti A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 518-522Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have proposed that eIF4E causes some of its effects by specifically increasing the translation of certain growth factors and important regulators of cell growth (reviewed in Ref. 15De Benedetti A. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The low abundance of eIF4E creates a situation of competition among different mRNA species, such that weak mRNAs are outcompeted for binding to ribosomes by the strong mRNAs (39Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An analysis of sequence data from 700 vertebrate mRNAs has shown that more than 90% contain 5′-UTRs that are less than 200 nucleotides long and devoid of upstream AUGs, which is characteristic ofstrong mRNAs (40Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 15: 8125-8147Crossref Scopus (4151) Google Scholar, 41Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). In contrast, weakmRNAs contain long G-C-rich 5′-UTRs, with potential for forming stable secondary structure, and/or upstream AUGs (42Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 150-164Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 43Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An excess of eIF4E results in a selective advantage for the translation ofweak mRNAs, for example FGF-2 and ODC.In an attempt to carry out a systematic analysis of the proteins that are strongly increased by eIF4E, we made a subtraction cDNA library from the polysomes of CHO-4E cells. Several independent clones (4% of the total pool of transformants) were identified as RNR2, and its identity as a major translationally up-regulated transcript was subsequently confirmed by Northern and Western blots. The expression ofRNR2 was not altered transcriptionally, because its mRNA level was the same in CHO-4E and CHO-BK cells; only its distribution in S100 and P100 fractions was altered.The increased expression of RNR2 (and consequently of RNR) provides one possible explanation for the observation that neither the duration of G1 nor that of G2+M was altered in CHO-4E (data not shown). This seemed in stark contrast with the fact that the generation time was reduced by 20% in CHO-4Eversus control cells. This apparent paradox was resolved with the finding that the S phase transit period was shortened (by 3–4 h) in CHO-4E, demonstrating that these cells can complete DNA replication faster than normal. At this point, we do not know precisely how an increase in RNR is translated into a corresponding increase in the rate of DNA replication in CHO-4E. However, cells selected for elevated expression of RNR2 by progressive selection in hydroxyurea (CHO-HU) also showed a shorter S phase. Because synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides is rate-limiting for DNA synthesis in most organisms, an excess of RNR2 may allow for a faster replication of the genome, especially considering that replication in eukaryotes proceeds simultaneously from multiple origins.Translational regulation of RNR2 is well known for clam and sea urchin eggs, in which fertilization triggers its synthesis as one of the most abundant products of maternal mRNAs (36Standart N. Hunt T. Ruderman J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Translational regulation of RNR has not been reported in other systems, except for the finding of an instability determinant in the 3′-UTR ofRNR2 mRNA (44Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, this is the first report of a specific translational enhancement by eIF4E, classifyingRNR2 as a weak mRNA and suggesting modulation by its 5′-UTR. The function of eIF4E is to nucleate the assembly of preinitiation complexes at the mRNA 5′-UTR, although the 3′-UTR can also participate in this process (45Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that translation of RNR2 is specifically facilitated by excess eIF4E. This was demonstrated by an analysis of polysomal profile ofRNR2 mRNA in cells overexpressing eIF4E. Interestingly, suc22+, the RNR2 homolog of S. pombe, is normally expressed as a 1.5-kb transcript, but upon treatment with hydroxyurea a 1.9-kb transcript with an extended 5′-UTR is induced (46Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. McInerny C. Harris P. Gordon C. Fantes P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be translationally regulated as well. The same phenomenon was observed for the RNR4 gene, aRNR2 homolog of S. cerevisiae (47Huang M. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 48Wang P.J. Chabes A. Casagrande R. Tian X.C. Thelander L. Huffaker T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6114-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We also showed that inducible overexpression of eIF4E rescued viability in a yeast strain harboring a ts mutation in the small subunit of RNR (rnr2–68) at the restrictive temperature. Overexpression of eIF4E also compensated growth defects of thernr2–68 mutant as evidenced by a 50% reduction in generation time. Our experiments do not rule out the possibility that excess eIF4E may also result in an increase in RNR1 in this strain. However, note that overexpression of RNR1 in thernr2–68 strain could not restore growth at 34 °C, 2M. R. Abid, Y. Li, C. Anthony, and A. De Benedetti, unpublished observation. demonstrating that the intracellular RNR1 level is not limiting in this strain (see also in Ref. 19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Previously, RNR1 was reported to be cell cycle-regulated at the transcriptional level, fluctuating 15–30-fold (18Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genet. Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), whereas the RNR2 transcript showed no more than a 2-fold change during the cell cycle. It would then follow thatRNR2 must be translationally regulated during the cell cycle, in order to be stoichiometric with RNR1. In this context, we should recall that eIF4E activity fluctuates during the cell cycle (25Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11134-11139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and conversely, eIF4E was originally cloned as a tsmutant controlling cell cycle progression in yeast (CDC33, Ref. 8Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M.G. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results described here, it is likely that transcriptional and translational regulation of the RNRgenes is an ancient, evolutionarily conserved mechanism. This is further supported by the fact that the double mutant ofcdc33–1 and rnr2–68 could not grow at temperatures above 28 °C, suggesting conditional synthetic lethality. We also reported that the double mutant presents with a cell cycle arrest that is different from either of the single mutants. The fact that cdc33–1 rnr2–68 double mutant did not arrest in early G1 obviates the possibility that the phenotype seen in the double mutant was solely due to a direct effect of loss of functional eIF4E. In contrast, the single mutant rnr2–68strain arrests in the middle of S phase with large buds at restrictive temperature, reflecting the fact that RNR first appears in late G1 and reaches its peak in S phase (18Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genet. Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The S phase arrest in the double mutant has a different phenotype from that ofrnr2–68, as evidenced by their differences in cell morphology (small buds), distribution pattern of nucleus, and sensitivities to HU and benomyl. These argue in favor of the hypothesis that the double mutant displays a phenotype that depends on bothcdc33–1 and rnr2–68 functions. The S phase arrest in the double mutant can then occur by the following models.cdc33–1 cells grow slowly and traverse G1 much slower than wild-type cells even at permissive temperature (8Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M.G. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The decreased translation of the rnr2–68 mRNA (and presumably some other G1 or G1 to S specific mRNAs) caused by a defective cdc33–1 in the double mutant may further slow down the cells in late G1. This may result in an increase in the cell size that allows the cells to bypass the size checkpoint in G1 and to proceed into S with a very low level of active RNR. Plausibly, this results in the early S phase arrest seen in this strain with small budded cells. The random distribution of the unduplicated nucleus, either in mother or in daughter, in this strain indicates that the coordination between chromosome replication and segregation of nuclear material is affected in these cells. This suggests that some cellular component(s) critical for spindle formation or microtubule assembly and/or attachment of chromosome to spindle pole may also be affected in this strain. Supersensitivity of this strain to microtubule depolymerizing agent, benomyl, also supports this notion. Alternatively, thernr2–68 in the double mutant, with a lengthened S/G2 phase, may enable the cell to end up with a larger size than usual after cytokinesis. Subsequent extension of the pre-G1 period may also contribute to a bigger size of the cells to begin with in the next cycle. Then, the cdc33–1mutation slows down G1, which may result in a delay at or around Start and a further increase in the cell size in G1(size checkpoint). One can imagine that this could suppress the pre-Start G1-arrest normally caused by cdc33–1at restrictive temperature.In retrospect, it is not surprising that synthesis of RNR, a key enzyme in DNA replication, should be placed under translational control. In a sense, the step at which synthesis of dNTPs commences is the most direct indication that the cell is metabolically prepared to undertake the expenses of replication. Such an endeavor cannot be limited to the presence of favorable mitogenic signals from the environment, but it also necessarily requires assessing of a replication-competent enzymatic milieu, of which fully active protein synthesis is perhaps the best indicator (49Moore S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9674-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, translational control ofRNR2 upon DNA damage would be very advantageous because of the rapidity of such a response, which does not require de novo gene expression. Very recently, it has been shown that in addition to transcriptional control of RNR1, a posttranslational component plays an important role in the regulation of RNR activity. Sml1p inhibits dNTP synthesis by binding directly to RNR1 subunit in yeast (50Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).Exogenous expression of RNR2 has been recently recognized as a powerful enhancer of transformation in cooperation with several oncogenes (22Fan H. Villegas C. Wright J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14036-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Fan H. Villegas C. Huang A. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1650-1653PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, many large DNA tumor viruses (herpeviridiae and Epstein-Barr virus) encode their own genomic complement of RNR2 (and RNR1 in some cases) rather than relying on the limiting cellular enzyme (51Ali M.A. McWeeney D. Milosavljevic A. Jurka J. Jariwalla R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8257-8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TheRNR2 gene is also frequently amplified in drug-resistant cancers, particularly following treatment with hydroxyurea or MDL101731, another specific inhibitor of RNR2 (52Huang A. Fan H. Taylor W.R. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4876-4881PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kulsh J. Med. Hypotheses. 1997; 49: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased expression of RNR2 is recognized as an early change in ductal carcinomas in situ (24Jensen R.A. Page D.L. Holt J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in atypical hyperplastic oral lesions (54Rozell B. Stenman G. Magnusson B. Lekholm U. Nagle R.B. Hansson H.A. J. Oral Pathol. 1986; 15: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, these are the same type of lesions that we have been studying as the earliest pathological abnormalities in which overexpression of eIF4E becomes apparent (38DeFatta R.J. Turbat-Herrera E.A. Li B.D.L. Anderson W. De Benedetti A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 518-522Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar,55Sorells D.L. Gahli E.G. Meschonat C. DeFatta R.J. Black D. Li L. De Benedetti A. Nathan C.A. Li B.D.L. Head Neck. 1998; 21: 60-65Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that, as the level of eIF4E increases during malignant progression, there is a corresponding increase inRNR2 translation and RNR assembly, leading to accelerated cell replication and increased tolerance to DNA damaging agents. As such, the identification of RNR2 as a major protein increased by excess eIF4E adds a new important player to the limited spectrum of translationally enhanced mRNAs that clearly play a key role in eIF4E-induced cell transformation. The fact that elevated eIF4E, with its corresponding effect on RNR2 expression, may naturally protect cells from common chemotherapeutic drugs adds another reason to design strategies to target eIF4E in cancer therapy. The translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)1 recognizes the 7-methylguanosine-containing cap of mRNA, in the first step of mRNA recruitment for translation (1Rhoads R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is assumed to be the least abundant of the initiation factors and is rate-limiting for translation of some mRNAs (2Duncan R. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3De Benedetti A. Joshi-Barve S. Rinker-Schaeffer C. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5435-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). eIF4E functions as the cap-binding subunit of eIF4F, the complex that unwinds secondary structure at the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of mRNAs in an ATP-dependent reaction. This function is critical during scanning for exposing and locating the translation start site (4Rhoads R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 3017-3020Google Scholar, 6Morley S.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF4E was cloned as a cell division cycle gene (CDC33), essential for cell viability (7Altmann M. Handschin C. Trachsel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Brenner C. Nakayama N. Goebl M.G. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3556-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CDC33 is involved in the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. The temperature sensitive mutant strain,cdc33–1, arrests in G1 (before Start) with small, unbudded cells at the restrictive temperature. Overexpression of eIF4E causes deregulated cell growth and malignant transformation of rodent and human cells (9Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 10De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11De Benedetti A. Joshi B. Graff J.R. Zimmer S.G. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1994; 2: 347-371Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanism of transformation by eIF4E presents an important and challenging biological phenomenon. Furthermore, eIF4E is elevated in common human neoplasms, such as carcinomas of the breast and the head and neck (12Kerekatte V. Smiley K. Hu B. Smith A. Gelder F. De Benedetti A. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,13Nathan CA Liu L. Li B. Nandy I. Abreo F. De Benedetti A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One explanation is that the translation of certain proto-oncogene or growth factor transcripts, which normally are translationally repressed, becomes preferentially increased by an excess eIF4E. Accordingly, a few of these have been identified, e.g. c-Myc and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (reviewed in Refs. 14Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar and 15De Benedetti A. Harris A.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, a systematic identification of the transcripts of which the translation is increased by the excess eIF4E would represent a major step forward in understanding the role of dysregulation of protein synthesis in cancer etiology. We have addressed this task with the construction of a subtraction cDNA library from the heavy polysomes of CHO cells overexpressing eIF4E (CHO-4E). From an initial screening, we identified an abundantly represented product corresponding to the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR2). Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) into deoxyribonucleotides (dNDPs), one of the most specific and rate-limiting steps in DNA synthesis. The RNR holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two large subunits (RNR1) and two small subunits (RNR2). RNR2 maintains a stabilized tyrosyl radical essential for the reduction of ribose. RNR1 harbors redox-active cysteines and allosteric sites to maintain balanced pools of nucleotides. Given the huge energetic investment of generating the necessarily large pool of dNTPs for DNA replication and repair, it is not surprising that RNR expression is carefully regulated and restricted to the late G1 and S (and G2) phases of the cell cycle or to conditions of DNA damage (16Eriksson S.

To better understand this checkpoint and its role in determining the efficacy of antitumor drugs that damage DNA, we examined the effects of adozelesin, a DNA-alkylating antitumor agent that has a profound inhibitory effect on initiation of DNA replication in mammals, on the replication of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. Adozelesin inhibited initiation of S. cerevisiae DNA replication by inducing an intra-S-phase DNA damage checkpoint. This inhibitory effect was abrogated in orc2–1 cells containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in a component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that also causes a defect in initiation. Theorc2–1 mutation also caused a defect in a checkpoint that regulates the activation of origins in late S phase in cells treated with hydroxyurea. Defects in both initiation and checkpoint regulation in the orc2–1 strain were suppressed by deletion of a gene encoding a putative acetyltransferase, SAS2. Adozelesin also induced a cellular response that requires a function of ORC in G1. A similar G1-specific response in mammals may contribute to the cytotoxic and antitumor properties of this and other DNA-damaging drugs.

Johnson D.S. Angew. Chem. 1996; 35: 1438-1474Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). CPI drugs have potent antitumor activity in mice and are extremely cytotoxic to cultured cells at concentrations that are orders of magnitude lower than the cytotoxic doses of most DNA-damaging antitumor drugs. The nature of the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of adozelesin and other CPI drugs is not clear. However, several members of this class of drugs, including adozelesin, have been shown to exert profound inhibitory effects on DNA replication in the absence of apparent effects on RNA or protein metabolism (1Boger D.L. Johnson D.S. Angew. Chem. 1996; 35: 1438-1474Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Like many other antitumor agents, the ability of CPI drugs to efficiently inhibit DNA replication may be responsible for their cytotoxic and antitumor effects.To better understand the nature of adozelesin's inhibitory effect on DNA replication, we recently analyzed the effects of this compound on the replication of viral genomes in cells infected with simian virus 40 (SV40) and determined that adozelesin inhibits SV40 viral DNA replication almost exclusively at the level of initiation, with little or no inhibitory effect on chain elongation (2Cobuzzi Jr., R.J.

The transnature of the initiation-inhibitory effect suggests it is caused by a cellular response to DNA damage, such as the intra-S-phase checkpoint, which predominantly inhibits initiation of DNA replication (4Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Relatively little is known about the mammalian intra-S phase DNA damage checkpoint compared with checkpoints in other phases of the cell cycle. The paucity of information about this checkpoint is due to a number of factors. These include the failure to identify compounds that specifically inhibit initiation of DNA replication, the difficulty with which trans-inhibitory effects on initiation can be distinguished from cis-inhibitory effects on the elongation of nascent DNA chains caused by lesions that block replication fork progression, and the relative difficulty of performing genetic experiments in mammalian cells compared with less complex organisms such as yeast. In contrast, a number of gene products are known to be required for the intra-S-phase checkpoint in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (reviewed in Refs. 5Foiani M.

Res. Commun. 257, 100–105). Cul-2 has also been reported to form a multiprotein complex, Cul-2·VBC, with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL) and elonginsB and C. In this study, using an in vivo coexpression system in COS cells, we show that NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 is promoted by coexpression with wild-type pVHL and elongins B and C. Interestingly, tumorigenic mutants and deletion mutants of pVHL, which are unable to form a Cul-2·VBC complex, do not have the activity to promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. These results suggest that the complex formation is required for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Furthermore, we used a pVHL-deficient cell line, 786-0, to show that Cul-2 is poorly but clearly conjugated by NEDD8, indicating that pVHL is not the only molecule that promotes NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Taken together, the VBC complex appears to have ligase activity in the conjugation of NEDD8 to Cul-2. We have previously shown that human cullin-2 (Cul-2) is covalently modified at Lys-689 by NEDD8 (Wada, H., Yeh, E. T. H., and Kamitani, T. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257, 100–105).

Recently, structural similarities have been shown to exist between the Cul-2·VBC complex and the SCF complex (17Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The similarities suggest the possibility that the Cul-2·VBC complex might function as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase. Indeed, pVHL has been shown to bind hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α and to target them for oxygen-dependent proteolysis by proteasome (18Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.-W.

These HIF α-subunits are transcription factors that regulate production of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor-1) and Glut-1 (glucose transporter-1) (19Kaelin W.G. Nature. 1999; 399: 203-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, pVHL might form a Cul-2·VBC complex to regulate hypoxia-inducible mRNAs by controlling the stability of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Recently, we showed that a ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, covalently conjugates to Cul-2 (20Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NEDD8 is a highly conserved 81-amino acid protein that is 60% identical and 80% homologous to ubiquitin. The message expression of NEDD8 is highly restricted to the heart and skeletal muscle in adult human tissues (21Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

These proteins share a common distinction in that the mature form of the proteins is always translated in precursor form, with one or more amino acids following a Gly-Gly dipeptide that forms the C terminus of the mature protein (30Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the NEDD8 conjugation process, the C-terminal tail of the precursor protein is cleaved off by C-terminal hydrolase such as UCH-L3 (31Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The mature form has been shown to conjugate to a large number of nuclear proteins (21Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The conjugation is thought to be catalyzed by NEDD8 activation enzyme (E1) and NEDD8 conjugation enzyme (E2) in the presence of ATP (32Osaka F. Kawasaki H. Aida N. Saeki M. Chiba T. Kawashima S.

Recently, we reported that all human cullins including Cul-2 are conjugated by a single molecule of NEDD8 (20Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of NEDD8 conjugation to cullins has not been elucidated. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 and the Cul-2·VBC complex. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, human osteosarcoma U-2OS cells, and human renal cell carcinoma 786-0 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 786-0 cells were transfected with pEC1214A containing a cDNA sequence for expression of HA-tagged wild-type human pVHL, followed by selection with G418 (1 mg/ml) for 3 weeks. The expression level of HA-pVHL in selected clones was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody 16B12. A stable clone with the highest expression was termed 786-0/VHL. This clone was maintained successfully in the absence of G418. Mouse mAb 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 16B12 (Covance, Richmond, CA), and rabbit polyclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance) are antibodies to the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA of influenza hemagglutinin. Mouse anti-RH mAb (specific for the amino acid sequence RGSHHHH) was purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Rabbit anti-human NEDD8 antiserum was generated by immunization with a peptide corresponding to amino acids 20–32 (TDKVERIKERVEE) of NEDD8 (21Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Mouse anti-Cul-2 mAb (IgG1) (specific for the amino terminus of human cullin-2) and mouse anti-Fas mAb (IgG1) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Cul-2 (catalog no. 51-2000; recognizing the carboxyl terminus of human cullin-2) and Cul-1 (catalog no. 71-8700; recognizing human cullin-1) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(South San Francisco, CA). To express proteins tagged with an epitope at the N terminus in mammalian cells, pcDNA3/3HA-N, pcDNA3/RH-N (21Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

The mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3/3HA-N and pcDNA3/3RH-N were constructed by inserting a thrice-repeated epitope of HA or RH, respectively, into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Using pcDNA3/3HA-N or pcDNA3/3RH-N, proteins can be tagged with a thrice-repeated epitope at their N terminus and expressed in mammalian cells. This system allowed us to detect proteins expressed at low levels. The human cDNA of pVHL, elongin B, elongin C, Cul-2 (20Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These cDNAs were inserted into the aforementioned plasmid vectors. The sequence of each cDNA was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into mammalian cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfected cells were harvested for Western blotting or immunoprecipitation 20 h after transfection. A Cys-to-Phe or Arg-to-Trp substitution was generated in pVHL at Cys-162 or Arg-167, respectively. The cDNA of wild-type pVHL was mutated by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (34Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mutated cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3/RH-N. The immunoprecipitation method described by Kamitani et al. (34Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was modified as follows. COS cells (5 × 106) were cotransfected for expression of 3HA-Cul-2, RH-pVHL, RH-elongin B, and RH-elongin C, followed by trypsinization 20 h after transfection (see Fig. 2). In addition to COS cell transfectants, 2 × 107 786-0 and 786-0/VHL cells were also used for immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 7). Cell pellets were transferred to liquid nitrogen and lysed in 1.25 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, ant 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Cell lysis was performed for 30 min on ice, and DNA in the sample was sheared with a 22-gauge needle. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were added to 10 μg of mouse mAb coupled to 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-HA mAb 12CA5 was used for samples from COS cell transfectants, and anti-Cul-2 or anti-Fas mAb was used for samples from 786-0 and 786-0/VHL cells. The bead suspensions were rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer. The immunoprecipitates were treated with 30 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 μl of solubilized samples were loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Then, Western blotting was performed. For samples from COS cell transfectants, rabbit anti-HA antibody HA.11 was used to detect 3HA-Cul-2 derivatives, and rabbit anti-NEDD8 antibody was used to detect 3HA-Cul-2 conjugated with NEDD8. For samples from 786-0 and 786-0/VHL cells, rabbit anti-NEDD8 antibody was used to detect endogenous Cul-2 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8, and rabbit anti-Cul-2 antibody was used to detect endogenous Cul-2 derivatives.FIG. 7NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 in 786-0 and 786-0/VHL cells.

After immunoprecipitation, Western blotting (WB) was performed using rabbit anti-NEDD8 antibody to detect endogenous NEDD8-conjugated Cul-2 (lanes 1–4) and rabbit anti-Cul-2 antibody to detect endogenous Cul-2 derivatives (lanes 5–8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein samples were treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 150 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol.

For this purpose, 3HA-Cul-2 was coexpressed with combinations of RH-tagged elongins B and C and pVHL in COS cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 3HA-Cul-2 was clearly detected as an 80-kDa protein band (lanes 2–5). In addition, an 85-kDa protein band was clearly detected only when pVHL and elongins B and C (VBC) were coexpressed with 3HA-Cul-2 (lane 5). Although this protein band was also detectable in the sample transfected with 3HA-Cul-2 and RH-pVHL, it was extremely faint (lane 4). In this sample, a low level of 85-kDa protein might be generated by transfected pVHL and endogenous elongins B and C. Taken together, the 85-kDa Cul-2 derivative is highly generated by coexpression with pVHL and elongins B and C.FIG. 3Overexpression of pVHL mutants does not enhance NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 in COS cells. 3HA-Cul-2, RH-elongin B, and RH-elongin C were coexpressed in COS cells with an empty vector as a negative control (lane 1), RH-pVHL (wild type (wt)) (lane 2), RH-pVHL(R167W) (lane 3), or RH-pVHL(C162F) (lane 4). Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody 16B12. The identity of each band is indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recently, we showed that Cul-2 is conjugated at Lys-689 by NEDD8 (20Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since NEDD8 monomer was detected as a 6-kDa band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the 85-kDa protein was Cul-2 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8. To prove this hypothesis, RH-tagged VBC proteins were coexpressed with 3HA-Cul-2(K689R), which has a Lys-to-Arg substitution at the NEDD8 conjugation site and cannot be conjugated by NEDD8. As shown in Fig. 1 B, overexpression of VBC led to the appearance of the 85-kDa derivative with wild-type Cul-2 (lane 2), but not with Cul-2(K689R) (lane 3). These results support the hypothesis that the 85-kDa protein is Cul-2 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8. Next, the 85-kDa derivative was directly identified. 3HA-Cul-2 was coexpressed with RH-tagged VBC proteins in COS cells. 3HA-Cul-2 derivatives consisting of 80- and 85-kDa proteins were purified from total cell lysate by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA mAb. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody to detect 3HA-Cul-2 derivatives and anti-NEDD8 antibody to examine the 85-kDa protein. As shown in Fig. 2, 80- and 85-kDa proteins were immunoprecipitated well (lane 2). The precipitated 85-kDa protein could be detected by anti-NEDD8 antibody, but the 80-kDa protein could not (lane 4). These results indicate that the 85-kDa protein is 3HA-Cul-2 conjugated with endogenous NEDD8 and that the 80-kDa protein is an unconjugated form of 3HA-Cul-2. By coexpression with elongins B and C, wild-type pVHL efficiently promoted NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 (Figs. 1 and 2). To examine the promoting activity of tumorigenic pVHL variants derived from VHL patients, we generated two pVHL mutants, pVHL(R167W) and pVHL(C162F). pVHL(R167W) has a single Arg-to-Trp substitution at Arg-167, which was found in VHL families with pheochromocytoma (4Zbar B. Kishida T. Chen F. Schmidt L. Maher E.R. Richards F.M. Crossey P.A. Webster A.R. Affara N.A. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Brauch H. Glavac D. Neumann H.P.H. Tisherman S. Mulvihill J.J. Gross D.J. Shuin T.

Mutat. 1996; 8: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). pVHL(C162F) has a single Cys-to-Phe substitution at Cys-162, which was found in a VHL family without pheochromocytoma (4Zbar B. Kishida T. Chen F. Schmidt L. Maher E.R. Richards F.M. Crossey P.A. Webster A.R. Affara N.A. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Brauch H. Glavac D. Neumann H.P.H. Tisherman S. Mulvihill J.J. Gross D.J. Shuin T.

RH-tagged wild-type pVHL, pVHL(R167W), or pVHL (C162F) was coexpressed with 3HA-Cul-2, RH-elongin B, and RH-elongin C in COS cells. Then, we examined the 85-kDa NEDD8-conjugated 3HA-Cul-2 protein in total cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type pVHL promoted the generation of the 85-kDa protein (lane 2), but pVHL(R167W) and pVHL(C162F) did not (lanes 3 and4). These results indicate that tumorigenic pVHL variants do not promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. To identify the necessary domain of pVHL for promoting NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2, we generated pVHL mutants with N- or C-terminal deletions. The mutants were tagged with the RH epitope and coexpressed with 3HA-Cul-2, RH-elongin B, and RH-elongin C in COS cells. The total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA mAb to detect Cul-2 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 4 A, overexpression of pVHL-(54–213) (lane 3) or pVHL-(1–197) (lane 7) resulted in generation of the 85-kDa protein to the same extent as that of wild-type pVHL (lane 2). In contrast, pVHL-(94–213) (lane 4) generated much less 85-kDa protein than did wild-type pVHL (lane 2). pVHL-(114–213) (lane 5) and pVHL-(1–189) (lane 8) hardly generated any 85-kDa protein, and the levels were not above the negative control (lane 1). The simplest interpretation of these data, summarized in Fig. 4 B, is that pVHL-(54–197) is required for promoting NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. pVHL-(54–197) is almost the same region that is involved in complex formation with elongins B and C and Cul-2 (8Lonergan K.M. Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kamura T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, pVHL mutants with a tumorigenic substitution or deletion, which are unable to form a VBC complex with elongins B and C, do not possess the promoting activity for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. These findings suggest that pVHL cannot promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 unless a Cul-2·VBC complex is assembled. pVHL has an ability to promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 as described above. Is pVHL essential for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 and/or other target proteins? To address this question, we employed a sporadic renal carcinoma cell line, 786-0, in which the VHL gene contains a 1-base pair deletion creating a frameshift from residue 104 in the remaining single allele (35Gnarra J.R. Tory K. Weng Y. Schmidt L. Wei M.H. Li H. Latif F. Liu S. Chen F. Duh F.M. Lubensky I. Duan D.R. Florence C. Pozzatti R. Walther M.M. Bander N.H. Grossman H.B. Brauch H. Pomer S. Brooks J.D. Isaacs W.B. Lerman M.I. Zbar B. Linehan W.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). The conserved pVHL-(1–103) in 786-0 cells is not sufficient for promoting NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 (see Fig. 4). Using 786-0 cells, we examined whether NEDD8 conjugation could be still detected or not. For this purpose, 3HA-NEDD8 was transiently expressed by transfection in 786-0 cells and in positive control cells such as 293 and U-2OS. NEDD8 conjugation was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA mAb. As shown in Fig. 5, the unconjugated form of 3HA-NEDD8 (open arrowhead) and 3HA-NEDD8 conjugation to target proteins were clearly observed in 293 cells (lane 2) and U-2OS cells (lane 4). An 85-kDa protein (closed arrowhead) was predominantly detected in these cells, as previously reported (21Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In 786-0 cells, an 85-kDa protein was also strongly detected (closed arrowhead), whereas the unconjugated form and other conjugated forms of 3HA-NEDD8 were hardly detected (lane 6). These results indicate that NEDD8 conjugation occurs in 786-0 cells and that an 85-kDa protein is predominantly generated. Thus, pVHL is not essential for NEDD8 conjugation in human cells. In Fig. 5, a prominent NEDD8-conjugated protein of 85 kDa was observed in 786-0 cells as well as in 293 and U-2OS cells. The size of this protein would be compatible with NEDD8-conjugated cullins (9Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To examine whether cullins can be modified by NEDD8 in 786-0 cells, we performed Western blotting using total cell lysates of 786-0 and 786-0/VHL cells expressing wild-type pVHL (Fig. 6, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel), endogenous Cul-2 could be detected as a doublet in both 786-0 (lane 1) and 786-0/VHL (lane 2) cells. The lower and upper bands most likely represent the unconjugated and NEDD8-conjugated forms of Cul-2, respectively. Interestingly, >90% of endogenous Cul-2 was detected as the lower band in 786-0 cells (upper panel, lane 1), whereas both the lower and upper bands of Cul-2 were detected almost equally in 786-0/VHL cells (upper panel, lane 2). In addition to Cul-2, the expression of endogenous Cul-1 was examined in both cell lines (middle panel). Cul-1 was also detected as a doublet in both cell lines. In contrast with Cul-2, the ratio of the upper band to the lower band was the same in 786-0 (lane 1) and 786-0/VHL (lane 2) cells. To characterize the doublet band of Cul-2 observed in Fig. 6 (upper panel), we immunoprecipitated endogenous Cul-2 in 786-0 or 786-0/VHL cells by mouse mAb against the N terminus of Cul-2 and performed Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibody against NEDD8 or the C terminus of Cul-2 to detect immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 7, two Cul-2 derivatives could be precipitated in both 786-0 (lane 5) and 786-0/VHL (lane 6) cells. Anti-NEDD8 antibody recognized the larger form of 85 kDa, but not the smaller form of 80 kDa (lanes 3and 4). These results indicate that endogenous Cul-2 is conjugated by endogenous NEDD8 in both 786-0 and 786-0/VHL cells. The NEDD8-conjugated form was detected more predominantly in 786-0/VHL cells (lane 6) than in 786-0 cells (lane 5), indicating that NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 occurs more efficiently in 786-0/VHL cells than in 786-0 cells. The differential expression ratio of the upper band to the lower band observed in Fig. 6 (upper panel) also suggested the inefficient NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 in 786-0 cells and the efficient NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 in 786-0/VHL cells. Thus, pVHL is a critical but not essential factor for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. In pVHL-deficient 786-0 cells, other proteins might compensate for pVHL deficiency. Interestingly, there is a discrepancy between Figs. 6 (upper panel) and 7 (lanes 5 and 6) regarding the Cul-2 expression pattern. The unconjugated form of Cul-2 was poorly immunoprecipitated by anti-Cul-2 N terminus antibody under nondenaturing conditions, suggesting the possibility that the unconjugated form of Cul-2 might be folded and that the antigen determinant at its N terminus might be hidden. NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 might lead to a conformational change in the Cul-2 molecule and disclose the antigen determinant at the N terminus of Cul-2. As shown in Figs. 6 (upper panel, lane 1) and 7 (lanes 3 and 5), endogenous Cul-2 in 786-0 cells was conjugated by endogenous NEDD8. In COS cells, however, transfected Cul-2 was not efficiently conjugated by endogenous NEDD8 in the presence of endogenous pVHL (Figs. 1 A (lane 2), 3 (lane 1), and 4A (lane 1)). pVHL might be a major player for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 in COS cells, but not in 786-0 cells. Alternatively, endogenous pVHL and elongins B and C (monkey origin) in COS cells might not be as functional against transfected human Cul-2 because of the species specificity of these molecules. During the preparation of this article, Liakopoulos et al.(36Liakopoulos D. Buesgen T. Brychzy A. Jentsch S. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 was stimulated by wild-type pVHL, but not by tumorigenic pVHL mutant. Using the in vitro translation method, they coexpressed Cul-2 with wild-type or mutant pVHL and showed that only wild-type pVHL stimulated NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. These in vitro findings support thein vivo results presented in this paper. In summary, we used mammalian cells such as COS and 786-0 cells to show that wild-type pVHL has the ability to promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. This ability was not shown by deletion mutants or tumorigenic point mutants of pVHL, which were unable to form a VBC complex with elongins B and C. In addition, the promoting activity of pVHL for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 was strongly detected only when the VBC proteins were coexpressed. These findings suggest that the complex formation of VBC is required for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Taken together, pVHL assembles a VBC complex and binds to Cul-2 to form Cul-2·VBC. Then, the VBC complex promotes NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Thus, the VBC complex might catalyze the conjugation reaction as one of the “NEDD8 ligases.” We thank Dr. Hong-Ji Xu (M. D.
