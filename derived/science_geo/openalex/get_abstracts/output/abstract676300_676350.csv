https://openalex.org/W3175735655,"The microbiota plays a fundamental role in regulating host immunity. However, the processes involved in the initiation and regulation of immunity to the microbiota remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the skin microbiota promotes the discrete expression of defined endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Keratinocyte-intrinsic responses to ERVs depended on cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) signaling and promoted the induction of commensal-specific T cells. Inhibition of ERV reverse transcription significantly impacted these responses, resulting in impaired immunity to the microbiota and its associated tissue repair function. Conversely, a lipid-enriched diet primed the skin for heightened ERV- expression in response to commensal colonization, leading to increased immune responses and tissue inflammation. Together, our results support the idea that the host may have co-opted its endogenous virome as a means to communicate with the exogenous microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialog that controls both tissue homeostasis and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3177379102,"Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (VIPP1) is essential for the biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes, which transform light into life. However, it is unknown how VIPP1 performs its vital membrane-remodeling functions. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of cyanobacterial VIPP1 rings, revealing how VIPP1 monomers flex and interweave to form basket-like assemblies of different symmetries. Three VIPP1 monomers together coordinate a non-canonical nucleotide binding pocket on one end of the ring. Inside the ring's lumen, amphipathic helices from each monomer align to form large hydrophobic columns, enabling VIPP1 to bind and curve membranes. In vivo mutations in these hydrophobic surfaces cause extreme thylakoid swelling under high light, indicating an essential role of VIPP1 lipid binding in resisting stress-induced damage. Using cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), we observe oligomeric VIPP1 coats encapsulating membrane tubules within the Chlamydomonas chloroplast. Our work provides a structural foundation for understanding how VIPP1 directs thylakoid biogenesis and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W3174859137,"Introduction In present days, the use of information technology (IT) in education is unquestionable. The mounting advancement of IT has changed the scenario of education. With the emergence of the current COVID-19 situation, it has undoubtedly provided a solution to most of our educational needs when all educational institutions remained closed due to the pandemic. This study aims to identify the nursing students’ attitude towards the practice of e-learning amidst COVID-19. Methods A descriptive web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing students with a sample size of 470. A self-administered validated questionnaire along with a standard tool to measure the attitude was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Results The mean ± SD age of the respondents was 20.91± 1.55 years. The majority (76.4%) of the respondents used mobile for their study and 90.4% used Wi-Fi for the internet source. The main advantage of e-learning was stated as the ability to stay at home (72.1%) followed by the reduced cost of accommodation and transport (51.3%) whereas the internet problem (81.7%) was the major disadvantage followed by technical issues (65.5%). Only about 34% of the students found e-learning as effective as traditional face-to-face learning. The mean scores for the domains: perceived usefulness, intention to adapt, distant use of e-learning, ease of learning, technical support, and learning stressors were 3.1, 3.1, 3.8, 2.9, 2.9, and 2.5 respectively. Overall, 58.9% had a favorable attitude regarding e-learning. There was no significant association of overall attitude regarding e-learning with selected socio-demographic variables whereas it was positively associated with all of its six domains. All the domains were positively correlated with each other except for ease of learning with technical support and distant use, and technical support with learning stressor and distant use. Learning stressor versus distant use was negatively correlated with each other. Conclusion Though e-learning was implemented as a substitute during the pandemic, almost half of the nursing students showed a positive attitude regarding e-learning. The majority of the students had internet problems and technological issues. If e-learning can be made user-friendly with reduced technical barriers supplemented with programs that can enhance practical learning abilities, e-learning can be the vital alternative teaching method and learning in the nursing field."
https://openalex.org/W3177302580,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed how healthcare is delivered to limit the transmission of the virus. This descriptive cross-sectional study explored the current use of virtual visits in providing care among primary care providers in southwestern Ontario during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated level of utilization post-pandemic. It also explored clinicians’ perceptions of the available support tools and resources and challenges to incorporating virtual visits within primary care practices. Methods Primary care physicians and nurse practitioners currently practicing in the southwestern part of Ontario were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey invite was distributed via email, different social media platforms, and newsletters. The survey questions gathered clinicians’ demographic information and assessed their experience with virtual visits, including the proportion of visits conducted virtually (before, during the pandemic, and expected volume post-pandemic), overall satisfaction and comfort level with offering virtual visits using modalities, challenges experienced, as well as useful resources and tools to support them in using virtual visits in their practice. Results We received 207 responses, with 96.6% of respondents offering virtual visits in their practice. Participants used different modalities to conduct virtual visits, with the vast majority offering visits via phone calls (99.5%). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians who offered virtual visits have conducted an average of 66.4% of their visits virtually, compared to an average of 6.5% pre-pandemic. Participants anticipated continuing use of virtual visits with an average of 43.9% post-pandemic. Overall, 74.5% of participants were satisfied with their experience using virtual visits, and 88% believed they could incorporate virtual visits well within the usual workflow. Participants highlighted some challenges in offering virtual care. For example, 58% were concerned about patients’ limited access to technology, 55% about patients’ knowledge of technology, and 41% about the lack of integration with their current EMR, the increase in demand over time, and the connectivity issues such as inconsistent Wi-Fi/Internet connection. There were significant differences in perception of some challenges between clinicians in urban vs, rural areas. Clinicians in rural areas were more likely to consider the inconsistent Wi-Fi and limited connectivity as barriers to incorporating virtual visits within the practice setting (58.8% vs. 40.2%, P = 0.030). In comparison, clinicians in urban areas were significantly more concerned about patients overusing virtual care services (39.4% vs. 21.6%, P = 0.024). As for support tools, 47% of clinicians advocated for virtual care standards outlined by their profession’s college. About 32% identified change management support and technical training as supportive tools. Moreover, 39% and 28% thought local colleagues and in-house organizational support are helpful resources, respectively. Conclusion Our study shows that the adoption of virtual visits has exponentially increased during the pandemic, with a significant interest in continuing to use virtual care options in the delivery of primary care post-pandemic. The study sheds light on tools and resources that could enhance operational efficiencies in adopting virtual visits in primary care settings and highlights challenges that, when addressed, can expand the health system capacity and sustained use of virtual care."
https://openalex.org/W3174218777,"Membrane remodeling and repair are essential for all cells. Proteins that perform these functions include Vipp1/IM30 in photosynthetic plastids, PspA in bacteria, and ESCRT-III in eukaryotes. Here, using a combination of evolutionary and structural analyses, we show that these protein families are homologous and share a common ancient evolutionary origin that likely predates the last universal common ancestor. This homology is evident in cryo-electron microscopy structures of Vipp1 rings from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme presented over a range of symmetries. Each ring is assembled from rungs that stack and progressively tilt to form dome-shaped curvature. Assembly is facilitated by hinges in the Vipp1 monomer, similar to those in ESCRT-III proteins, which allow the formation of flexible polymers. Rings have an inner lumen that is able to bind and deform membranes. Collectively, these data suggest conserved mechanistic principles that underlie Vipp1, PspA, and ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodeling across all domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W3174459050,"PspA is the main effector of the phage shock protein (Psp) system and preserves the bacterial inner membrane integrity and function. Here, we present the 3.6 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of PspA assembled in helical rods. PspA monomers adopt a canonical ESCRT-III fold in an extended open conformation. PspA rods are capable of enclosing lipids and generating positive membrane curvature. Using cryo-EM, we visualized how PspA remodels membrane vesicles into μm-sized structures and how it mediates the formation of internalized vesicular structures. Hotspots of these activities are zones derived from PspA assemblies, serving as lipid transfer platforms and linking previously separated lipid structures. These membrane fusion and fission activities are in line with the described functional properties of bacterial PspA/IM30/LiaH proteins. Our structural and functional analyses reveal that bacterial PspA belongs to the evolutionary ancestry of ESCRT-III proteins involved in membrane remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W3174481377,"<h2>Summary</h2> Animals must rapidly respond to threats to survive. In rodents, threat-related signals are processed through a subcortical pathway from the superior colliculus to the amygdala, a putative ""low road"" to affective behavior. This pathway has not been well characterized in humans. We developed a novel pathway identification framework that uses pattern recognition to identify connected neural populations and optimize measurement of inter-region connectivity. We first verified that the model identifies known thalamocortical pathways with high sensitivity and specificity in 7 T (n = 56) and 3 T (n = 48) fMRI experiments. Then we identified a human functional superior colliculus-pulvinar-amygdala pathway. Activity in this pathway encodes the intensity of normative emotional responses to negative images and sounds but not pleasant images or painful stimuli. These results provide a functional description of a human ""low road"" pathway selective for negative exteroceptive events and demonstrate a promising method for characterizing human functional brain pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3176405279,"There is little doubt that aerosols play a major role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The significance of the presence and infectivity of this virus on environmental surfaces, especially in a hospital setting, remains less clear.We aimed to analyze surface swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectivity, and to determine their suitability for sequence analysis.Samples were collected during two waves of COVID-19 at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, in COVID-19 patient serving and staff congregation areas. qRT-PCR positive samples were investigated in Vero cell cultures for cytopathic effects and phylogenetically assessed by whole genome sequencing.Improved cleaning and patient management practices between April and August 2020 were associated with a substantial reduction of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positivity (from 11% to 2%) in hospital surface samples. Even though we recovered near-complete genome sequences in some, none of the positive samples (11 of 224 total) caused cytopathic effects in cultured cells suggesting this nucleic acid was either not associated with intact virions, or they were present in insufficient numbers for infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the positive samples were derived from hospitalized patients. Genomic sequences isolated from qRT-PCR negative samples indicate a superior sensitivity of viral detection by sequencing.This study confirms the low likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on hospital surfaces contains infectious virus, disputing the importance of fomites in COVID-19 transmission. Ours is the first report on recovering near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences directly from environmental surface swabs."
https://openalex.org/W3174142416,"Endosomal signaling downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has emerged as a novel paradigm with important pharmacological and physiological implications. However, our knowledge of the functional consequences of intracellular signaling is incomplete. To begin to address this gap, we combined an optogenetic approach for site-specific generation of the prototypical second messenger generated by active GPCRs, cyclic AMP (cAMP), with unbiased mass-spectrometry-based analysis of the phosphoproteome. We identified 218 unique, high-confidence sites whose phosphorylation is either increased or decreased in response to cAMP elevation. We next determined that the same amount of cAMP produced from the endosomal membrane led to more robust changes in phosphorylation than the plasma membrane. Remarkably, this was true for the entire repertoire of 218 identified targets and irrespective of their annotated subcellular localizations (endosome, cell surface, nucleus, cytosol). Furthermore, we identified a particularly strong endosome bias for a subset of proteins that are dephosphorylated in response to cAMP. Through bioinformatics analysis, we established these targets as putative substrates for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and we propose compartmentalized activation of PP2A by cAMP-responsive kinases as the likely underlying mechanism. Altogether, our study extends the concept that endosomal signaling is a significant functional contributor to cellular responsiveness to cAMP by establishing a unique role for localized cAMP production in defining categorically distinct phosphoresponses."
https://openalex.org/W3175244561,"Background In these unpredictable times of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, parents worldwide are affected by the stress and strain caused by the physical distancing protocols that have been put in place. Objective In a two‐wave longitudinal survey, we investigated the levels of parental stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of parents at two time points; during the implementation of the strictest physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2,868) and three months after the discontinuation of the protocols (T2, N = 1,489). Further, we investigated the relationships between parental stress and anxiety and depression relative to relationship quality and anger toward their children at the two aforementioned time points, including subgroups based on age, parental role, cultural background, relationship status, education level, number of children, employment status and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Methods and findings Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement points. Parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stress that parents experienced during the implementation of the distancing protocols declined when the protocols were phased out. The decrease of perceived parental stress was accompanied by a significant decrease in the symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-offs for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% at T2, respectively. The reduction in depression and anger toward their child(ren) from T1 to T2 was associated with a reduction of parental stress. Relationship quality and anger toward their child(ren) at T1 further predicted a change in the level of parental stress from T1 to T2. Conclusions The study underlines the negative psychological impacts of the implementation of the distancing protocols on parents’ health and well-being. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated with parents and families facing a social crisis such as the ongoing pandemic may contribute to the design of relevant interventions to reduce parental distress and strengthen parental coping and resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3175514722,"This paper investigates how banking competition and capital level impact on the risk-taking behavior of banking institutions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The topic is perceived to be of significant importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use data for more than 225 banks in 18 countries in the MENA region to test whether increased competition causes banks to hold higher capital ratios. Employing panel data techniques, and distinguishing between Islamic and conventional banks, we show that banks tend to hold higher capital ratios when operating in a more competitive environment. We also provide evidence that banks in the MENA region increase their capitalization levels in response to a higher risk and vice versa. Further, banking concentration (measured by the HH-index) and credit risk have a significant and positive impact on capital ratios of IBs, whereas competition does play a restrictive role in determining the level of their capital. The results hold when controlling for ownership structure, regulatory and institutional environment, bank-specific and macroeconomic characteristics. Our findings inform regulatory authorities concerned with improving the financial stability of banking sector in the MENA region to strengthen their policies in order to force banks to better align with capital requirements and risk during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3176923142,"Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to the mental health and sleep quality of front-line medical staff (FMS). The aim of this study was to investigate the sleep quality of FMS during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and analyze the relationship between mental health and sleep quality of FMS. Methods From February 24, 2020 to March 22, 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed with 543 FMS from a medical center in Western China. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data anonymously. The following tests were used: The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for symptoms of anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for depressive symptoms, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality assessment. Results Of the 543 FMS, 216 (39.8%) were classified as subjects with poor sleep quality. Anxiety (P&lt;0.001), depression (P&lt;0.001), and the prevalence of those divorced or widowed (P&lt;0.05) were more common in FMS with poor sleep quality than in participants with good sleep quality. The FMS exhibiting co-occurrence of anxiety and depression were associated with worse scores on sleep quality than those medical staff in the other three groups/categories. The difference in sleep quality between the FMS with only depression and the FMS experiencing co-occurrence of anxiety and depression was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference in sleep quality between the FMS experiencing only anxiety and the FMS with co-occurrence of anxiety and depression (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a noteworthy increase in the prevalence of negative emotions and sentiments among the medical staff, along with poor overall sleep quality. We anticipate that this study can stimulate more research into the mental state of FMS during outbreaks and other public health emergencies. In addition, particular attention must be paid to enhance the sleep quality of FMS, along with better planning and support for FMS who are continuously exposed to the existing viral epidemic by virtue of the nature of their profession."
https://openalex.org/W3174168259,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( PEDV ), a leading cause of piglet diarrhea outbreaks, poses a significant danger to the swine industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemic characteristics of PEDV that was circulating in Guangdong province, one of China’s major pig producing provinces. Clinical samples were collected from eight pig farms in Guangdong province between 2018 and 2019 and tested for the major porcine enteric pathogens, including PEDV , transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV) , Swine enteric coronavirus ( SeCoV) , Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus ( SADS-CoV) , porcine deltacoronavirus ( PDCoV ), and porcine rotavirus ( RV ). As a result, only PEDV and RV were detected at a rate of 47.0% (16/34) and 18.6% (8/34), respectively. Coinfectoin with PEDV and RV occurred at a rate of PEDV 12.5% (2/16). Subsequently, the full-length S gene sequences of 13 PEDV strains were obtained, and phylogenetic analysis suggested the presence of GII-c group PEDV strains in this region (non-S-INDEL). Two novel common amino acid insertions ( 55 T/IG 56 and 551L) and one novel glycosylation site (1199 G+ ) were detected when the CV777 and ZJ08 vaccine strains were compared. Furthermore, intragroup recombination events in the S gene regions 51–548 and 2478–4208 were observed in the PEDV strains studied. In summary, the observations provide current information on the incidence of viral agents causing swine diarrhea in southern China and detailed the genetic characteristics and evolutionary history of the dominant PEDV field strains. Our findings will aid in the development of an updated vaccine for the prevention and control of PEDV variant strains."
https://openalex.org/W3174195114,"Purpose Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. During the pandemic, physicians in our hospital have had to respond both to the issue of treating the patients and the increasing domestic burden associated with social disruption. The purpose of this study was to assess how much the burden on our doctors, especially female doctors, was increasing. Material and methods The Physicians’ Career Support Committee in Sapporo Medical University conducted a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire inquired about a wide range of subjects with regard to working style and family life during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was sent to all medical/dental physicians working in Sapporo Medical University. Results A total of 266 (42.7%) physicians in our hospital responded to our questionnaire and the data for 264 data were analyzed. The total numbers of males, females, and others, including those who did not want to specify, were 178 (67.4%), 82 (31.0%), and 4 (1.5%), respectively. Among them, 62 (23.5%) and 23 (8.7%) answered that their domestic burden was slightly or markedly increased. The increase in the domestic burden showed a significant difference between genders (p = 0.04). Even after correction for background differences using multivariate analysis, being female (p&lt;0.001), having child dependents (p&lt;0.001), and treating COVID-19 patients (p = 0.03) were significantly related to an increased domestic burden. Regarding family style, 58.1% of the physician-fathers were from two-income families (i.e., families with both parents in employment), and they answered that their partner mainly cared for the children. In contrast, 97.3% of physician-mothers were from two-income families, and 94.6% of the physician-mothers had to take care of children by themselves. Conclusion Physician-mothers are caught in a dilemma between an increased home burden and clinical duties in the hospital, with a significantly higher ratio than physician-fathers during the pandemic. As we showed, female doctors could have not continued their careers and take responsible positions in the same way as male doctors. This is a social risk in the timing of a crisis, such as a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3173567997,"Objectives The timely diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is challenging. Although pathogen-derived circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been detected in humans, the significance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-cfDNA detection in patients with PTB remains unclear. Methods This study enrolled patients with PTB and persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) as the study and control groups, respectively, from 2018 to 2020. We measured interferon-γ levels and calculated blood monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). We conducted plasma cfDNA extraction, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and droplet digital PCR targeting the IS6110 gene of MTB. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of using MTB-cfDNA to identify PTB and analyzed the factors associated with PTB diagnosis and MTB-cfDNA positivity. Results We enrolled 24 patients with PTB and 57 LTBI controls. The sensitivity of using MTB-cfDNA to identify PTB was 54.2%(13/24) in total and 46.2%(6/13) in smear-negative cases. Two LTBI controls (3.5%) tested positive for MTB-cfDNA, indicating a specificity of 96.5%(55/57). By using MTB-cfDNA positivity and an MLR ≥0.42 to identify PTB, sensitivity increased to 79.2%(19/24). Among patients with PTB, MTB-specific interferon-γ levels were higher in MTB-cfDNA positive participants than in those who tested negative (7.0 ±2.7 vs 2.7±3.0 IU/mL, p &lt;0.001). MTB-cfDNA levels declined after 2 months of anti-tuberculosis therapy ( p &lt;0.001). Conclusion The sensitivity of using MTB-cfDNA to identify PTB in participants was 54.2%, which increased to 79.2% after incorporating an MLR ≥0.42 into the analysis. MTB-cfDNA positivity was associated with MTB-specific immune response, and MTB-cfDNA levels declined after treatment. The clinical value of MTB-cfDNA in PTB management necessitates further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3175575666,"Mudstone interlayer is a weak layer in rock engineering. When it is subjected to continuous stress higher than its damage threshold, due to the dislocation of particles in mudstone crystals and the expansion of cracks, mudstone strength is gradually damaged and deteriorated and the strain gradually increases, thus accelerating the phenomenon of creep damage. In order to describe the characteristics of the whole process of mudstone aging deformation, based on the damage evolution of strength parameters (cohesion and internal friction coefficient) with stress and time in mudstone creep tests, a novel damage nonlinear viscoelastoplastic body (D-NVPB) is proposed through improving traditional plastic element. D-NVPB describes the nonlinear characteristics of the accelerated creep stage of mudstone. With the element combination method, D-NVPB is connected with the Burgers model in series to form a new nonlinear damage creep model (D-NVEP model). The analysis results of creep characteristics theoretically verified the rationality of the model in describing the instantaneous elasticity, viscoelasticity, and nonlinear viscoplastic characteristics of the complete creep curve of mudstone. With the data obtained in the uniaxial compression creep test of mudstone under the action of a stress level of 14 MPa, based on the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares method, the fitting calculation was performed through piecewise fitting and overall fitting. The correlation coefficient was 0.9909, which verified the applicability of the model. The obtained model parameters by the identification were used to predict the mudstone creep curve under the stress levels of 13 MPa and 15 MPa. The good prediction results further verified the feasibility of the model. Compared with the traditional creep model, the D-NVEP model can better describe the nonlinear characteristics of the accelerated creep stage and quantitatively display the strength damage evolution process of rock in the creep failure process."
https://openalex.org/W3177101282,"Campylobacter species are one of the most common causative agents of gastroenteritis worldwide. Resistance against quinolone and macrolide antimicrobials, the most commonly used therapeutic options, poses a serious risk for campylobacteriosis treatment. Owing to whole genome sequencing advancements for rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, phenotypic and genotypic resistance trends along the ""farm-to-fork"" continuum can be determined. Here, we examined the resistance trends in 111 Campylobacter isolates (90 C. jejuni and 21 C. coli) recovered from clinical samples, commercial broiler carcasses and dairy products in Cairo, Egypt. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 10% of the isolates, mostly from C. coli. The prevalence of MDR was the highest in isolates collected from broiler carcasses (13.3%), followed by clinical isolates (10.5%), and finally isolates from dairy products (4%). The highest proportion of antimicrobial resistance in both species was against quinolones (ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid) (68.4%), followed by tetracycline (51.3%), then erythromycin (12.6%) and aminoglycosides (streptomycin and/or gentamicin) (5.4%). Similar resistance rates were observed for quinolones, tetracycline, and erythromycin among isolates recovered from broiler carcasses and clinical samples highlighting the contribution of food of animal sources to human illness. Significant associations between phenotypic resistance and putative gene mutations was observed, with a high prevalence of the gyrA T86I substitution among quinolone resistant isolates, tet(O), tet(W), and tet(32) among tetracycline resistant isolates, and 23S rRNA A2075G and A2074T mutations among erythromycin resistant isolates. Emergence of resistance was attributed to the dissemination of resistance genes among various lineages, with the dominance of distinctive clones. For example, sub-lineages of CC828 in C. coli and CC21 in C. jejuni and the genetically related clonal complexes 'CC206 and CC48' and 'CC464, CC353, CC354, CC574', respectively, propagated across different niches sharing semi-homogenous resistance patterns."

Moreover, this prediction largely outperforms human ability. Finally, we provide a simple python tool that can broadly be used to detect cell death."
https://openalex.org/W3175041438,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short and positively charged peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. AMPs have been investigated as potential antibiotic alternatives to improve growth performance and prevent pathogen infection in the poultry industry. The antimicrobial peptide tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4) was derived from Oreochromis niloticus, possesses antimicrobial activities and immunomodulatory properties, promotes intestinal health, and protects against pathogen infection. The codon-optimized sequence of TP4 was introduced into the pPICZαA vector and transformed into Pichia pastoris. Large-scale expression was induced following culture with methanol in a 500-liter fermenter. Freeze drying of fermented rTP4 broth and then rTP4 evaluation as a feed additive for Gallus gallus domesticus were performed. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of recombinant TP4 (rTP4) against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was evaluated. Evaluation of the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of rTP4 showed its high stability at high temperatures. rTP4 significantly enhanced the phagocytic activity of macrophage cells, indicating that rTP4 has a remarkable ability to stimulate macrophages. rTP4 was used as a dietary supplement at 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0 and 12% in G. g. domesticus for five weeks, and growth performance, gut microbiota composition, and histology were assessed. The 3.0% rTP4 supplement group showed a significant increase in weight gain ratio and feed efficiency compared to those of the basal broiler diet group. Crude rTP4 was expressed by yeast to significantly promote growth efficiency and resistance against pathogens in G. g. domesticus, which could indicate its use as a suitable alternative to antibiotics as feed additives in the poultry industry."
https://openalex.org/W3176873979,"Background Medical students are more prone to burnout than the general population and students of other faculties due to the demanding nature of medical education with limited time and resources.

Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students of a medical college in Kathmandu, Nepal from 14 January to 7 March, 2021. Stratified sampling followed by a simple random sampling technique was employed to select study participants. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire using the English version of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory adapted for students (OLBI-S) and analyzed in STATA version 15. Results The prevalence of burnout was found out to be 65.9% (n = 229). And of the remaining, 12.7% were exhausted, 11.4% were disengaged and 10.0% were neither exhausted nor disengaged. Burnout had no significant association with age in years, gender, and year of study. Conclusions This study shows an alarming prevalence of burnout in almost two-thirds of medical students. These results indicate the necessity of employing effective strategies by relevant authorities for the mental well-being of future physicians. Further multicenter prospective studies are required for a better understanding of the prevalence and associated factors of burnout."
https://openalex.org/W3120527482,"Background The knowledge of Pap smear and uptake of preventive behaviors to prevent cervical cancer are the most important contributors to the advanced stage of the disease. Knowledge is one of the most leading factors to predict the health behaviors and a helpful factor in performing screening procedures. This study aimed to investigate Saudi Arabian women knowledge of Pap testing in relation to their intention to undergo the test. Methods An online survey including demographic characteristics (3 questions), knowledge (13 questions), and intentions (3 questions) towards Pap smear was completed by 467 Saudi Arabian women. Data were analyzed through SPSS version 22, using descriptive statistics and correlation to measure the relationship between knowledge, demographic factors, and intention. Results The study found that average level of knowledge was 1.3 which is between high and moderate knowledge, and the average score for the intention was 2.88, to indicate that the intentions to uptake Pap smear among the participants were above the average.

The study was conducted on 150 28-day-old piglets divided into 5 groups. Piglets in the control group (C) received a standard diet with soybean meal. Animals in group FR (group receiving a diet with 8% FRSM) received a diet in which a portion of the soybean meal was replaced with 8% dried fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM). Animals in group FR/FS received a diet in which a portion of the soybean meal was replaced with 6% FRSM and 2% fermented dried soybean meal (FSBM). The piglets in group FS/FR received a diet with 6% FSBM and 2% FRSM. Group FS received a diet in which a portion of the soybean meal was replaced with an 8% share of FSBM. The inclusion of 8% or 6% fermented rapeseed meal (group FR or FR/FS) in the diet of piglets had a beneficial effect on their immune status, as evidenced by the increase in plasma levels of IgG and IgA and the decrease in IL-6 relative to the control group. It also significantly increased the concentrations of minerals, i.e. P, Ca and Zn, in the blood plasma and metacarpal bones of piglets and improved the availability of iron, a key bioelement involved in haemoglobin. The use of 8% or 6% fermented soybean meal in the diet (groups FS and FS/FR) of piglets had a positive effect on blood lipid parameters, reducing CHOL and LDL-cholesterol in the plasma. In conclusion, the fermentation process enables better utilization of rapeseed or soybean meal by pigs. Dried fermented rapeseed meal could partially replace protein components from GMO (genetically modified ogranism) crops (soybean meal) used in diets for pigs."
https://openalex.org/W3175005851,"The rheological properties parameters of paddy soil affect the interaction between the tillage tools and soil, thus influencing the operation quality and power consumption. In order to study the effects of tillage methods and moisture content on the rheological properties parameters of paddy soil in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, uniaxial compression creep tests of paddy soils with four moisture contents under no tillage (moisture contents: 26.71%, 24.52%, 23.26%, 21.28%) and plough tillage (moisture contents: 26.77%, 25.55%, 23.40%, 20.56%) were carried out using a TMS-PRO texture analyzer. The creep properties curves obtained from the tests, and the rheological constitutive equation of paddy soil under compression was established by Burgers viscoelastic model. Respectively, the quantitative change rules of creep properties of paddy soil with different moisture contents under different tillage methods and the correlation between these parameters were explored. The results showed that the moisture content under the three-year plough tillage and no tillage methods had significant influence on the rheological properties parameters of paddy soil (P < 0.05). The instantaneous elastic modulus, delay elastic modulus, and viscosity coefficient of the two paddy soils (no tillage and plough tillage soils) decreased with the increase of moisture content. However, the variation rules of relaxation time and delay viscosity coefficient with moisture content differed between these two paddy soils. Specifically, the strain rate of the two paddy soils decreased as moisture content decreased, where the total strain combines elastic strain, viscous strain, and viscoelastic strain. The initial strain rate and steady strain rate of the plough tillage paddy soils were lower than that of the no tillage paddy soils. The established creep model equation could be used to obtain viscoelastic rheological parameters of paddy soil in a wide range. The fitting equations between rheological parameters and moisture content were introduced into Burgers model, and the coupling equations between creep deformation and moisture content and time were derived, which could be used to predict the creep properties and deformation behavior of paddy soil in a certain range of no tillage and ploughed field. Overall, this study has a certain theoretical significance for the development and improvement of paddy soil rheology theory, and can also provide theoretical basis and technical support for the research of agricultural machinery design optimization, field water, soil conservation, soil tillage and compaction related simulation analysis in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River."

Despite the high burden of liver cirrhosis in Ghana, data on this disease is lacking.To determine the sociodemographic characteristics, reasons for admission, and in-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis of the liver seen at a district hospital in Ghana.A prospective study was conducted involving one hundred and eighty-six (186) patients admitted on the medical wards in St. Dominic hospital with liver cirrhosis from 1st January 2018 to 24th June 2020. The patient's demographic and clinical features were documented using a standardized questionnaire. Diagnostic biochemical and haematological tests as well as abdominal ultrasound scans were performed for all patients. They were followed up until death or discharge from hospital.One hundred and eighty-six patients (186) with a median age of 46 years were included in the study. HBV was the main etiology of liver cirrhosis (38.7%) followed closely by alcohol consumption (38.3%). In-hospital mortality was 41.3% and the most frequent cause of death was hepatic encephalopathy (68.4%). The following were associated with death; Jaundice, weight loss, elevated bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), Child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease sodium score (MELDNa), and low sodium. However, hepatic encephalopathy, MELDNa, INR and BUN were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality on logistic regression analysis.In-hospital mortality in cirrhotic patients was high with the leading cause of death being hepatic encephalopathy. Timely diagnosis and adequate management of hepatic encephalopathy are necessary to prevent death from liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W3173307814,"A high prevalence of suboptimal serum vitamin D has been reported among HIV infected children even in countries with high sunshine abundance throughout the year. Vitamin D is a potent immune modulator of innate and adaptive immune responses. Vitamin D regulates immune responses through the vitamin D receptor on CD4 cells. We aimed to determine the vitamin D status of HIV infected children and factors associated with suboptimal vitamin D.This was a cross sectional study. We enrolled children aged between 6 months and 12 years attending an outpatient paediatric HIV clinic. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured using the electrochemoluminisence method. Suboptimal vitamin D was defined as 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml, vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were 21-29 ng/ml and <20 ng/ml respectively. Anthropometry, physical exam and medical history were documented. Logistic regression was performed.We enrolled 376 children with mean age (sd) 8.05 years (3.03), a median (IQR) duration of ART of 5.9 years (3.2-8.4). Majority of the children (64%) had been exposed to non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). A third were severely immunosuppressed (CD4% ≤15%) at ART initiation. At the time of the study, the majority (89%) were virologically suppressed (VL <1000 copies/ml). Prevalence of 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml was 49 (13%) of 375 participants and 11 (3%) had 25(OH)D <20 ng/ml. Lopinavir/ritonavir regimen was independently associated with 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml; OR 0.27 CI (0.13-0.57), p value-0.002. Serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/ml was associated with CD4 count ≤15% at ART initiation OR 6.55(1.30-32.9), p value-0.023 and use of NNRTIs; OR 10.9(1.22-96.2), p value-0.03.We found a low prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D compared to earlier reports. Severe immunosuppression at ART initiation and use of NNRTIs increases odds of deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation should be considered in severely immunosuppressed children initiating ART."
https://openalex.org/W3175905114,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships of physical and perceptual-cognitive factors with agility performance in amateur soccer players. Fifteen male amateur soccer players (age, 24.5 ± 1.9 years) completed a linear-sprint test with splits at 5 m, 10 m, and 30 m, a change-of-direction test of 12 m with 2 pre-planned directional changes of 45° at 2 m and 7 m, and a soccer-specific agility test with same movement pattern as the change-of-direction test but with the inclusion of a human stimulus performing passing movements. Additionally, the perceptual-cognitive deficit (agility performance minus change-of-direction performance) was calculated. In relation to agility performance, linear-sprint performance showed large relationships, which were higher with increasing sprint distance (5 m, r = 0.57; 10 m, r = 0.59; 30 m, r = 0.69), change-of-direction performance a very large relationship (r = 0.77), and the perceptual-cognitive deficit a large relationship (r = 0.55). The findings of this study highlight the relatively high contribution of both physical (i.e., linear-sprint and change-of-direction performance) and perceptual-cognitive factors (i.e., perceptual-cognitive deficit) in relation to soccer-specific agility performance at an amateur level. Consequently, such elements might be recommended to be included in training programs aimed at improving agility performance at this playing level. Moreover, the here introduced perceptual-cognitive deficit allows for a convenient and likewise thorough analysis of agility performance. Future studies should investigate the effects of both physically and perceptual-cognitive oriented training interventions on agility performance, which is considered a key element for success in soccer."
https://openalex.org/W3177399551,"Ecological and environmental protection is essential to achieving sustainable and high-quality development, which highlights the important role of environmental governance. In terms of the practical actions of environmental governance, the central government in China has carried out continuous rating and praise campaigns, and local governments have actively promoted this effort. However, the related performance consequences have not been empirically investigated. We aimed to verify whether this incentive policy can improve the efficiency of environmental governance and whether this governance method has long-term effects. In addition, we sought to identify mechanisms through which the policy can improve environmental governance.We take the rating and praise campaign of the Establishment of National Sanitary Cities (EONSCs) as a quasi-natural experiment and use the panel data for 174 cities from 2004 to 2016 and the propensity score matching-difference in differences (PSM-DID) method to test the impact of rating and praise campaigns on environmental governance efficiency.EONSCs campaign can improve the efficiency of environmental governance by 0.7595 (p<0.01), which is significant at the 1% level; the effects are clearly significant during the evaluation process and the year in which cities are named National Sanitary Cities (NSCs) but decrease annually thereafter. The EONSCs campaign has a significant promoting effect on public services provision, such as public infrastructure investment, public transportation and education.(1) The rating and praise campaigns can effectively improve the efficiency of environmental governance; (2) the incentive effect is distorted and is not a long-term effect; (3) the impact of the rating and praise campaign of EONSCs on the efficiency of environmental governance is mainly realized through the provision of corresponding public services that are closely related to environmental protection. The findings of this paper provide empirical support for the effectiveness of the central government's rating and praise campaigns and could motivate local governments to actively participate in environmental governance. Moreover, the findings provide an important reference for further improving the rating and praise campaigns and the level of environmental governance."

https://openalex.org/W3174471086,"Desalination technology based on Reverse Osmosis (RO) membrane filtration has been resorted to provide high-quality drinking water. RO produced drinking water is characterized by a low bacterial cell concentration. Monitoring microbial quality and ensuring membrane-treated water safety has taken advantage of the rapid development of DNA-based techniques. However, the DNA extraction process from RO-based drinking water samples needs to be evaluated regarding the biomass amount (filtration volume) and residual disinfectant such as chlorine, as it can affect the DNA yield. We assessed the DNA recovery applied in drinking water microbiome studies as a function of (i) different filtration volumes, (ii) presence and absence of residual chlorine, and (iii) the addition of a known Escherichia coli concentration into the (sterile and non-sterile, chlorinated and dechlorinated) tap water prior filtration, and directly onto the (0.2 μm pore size, 47 mm diameter) mixed ester cellulose membrane filters without and after tap water filtration. Our findings demonstrated that the co-occurrence of residual chlorine and low biomass/cell density water samples (RO-treated water with a total cell concentration ranging between 2.47 × 102-1.5 × 103 cells/mL) failed to provide sufficient DNA quantity (below the threshold concentration required for sequencing-based procedures) irrespective of filtration volumes used (4, 20, 40, 60 L) and even after performing dechlorination. After exposure to tap water containing residual chlorine (0.2 mg/L), we observed a significant reduction of E. coli cell concentration and the degradation of its DNA (DNA yield was below detection limit) at a lower disinfectant level compared to what was previously reported, indicating that free-living bacteria and their DNA present in the drinking water are subject to the same conditions. The membrane spiking experiment confirmed no significant impact from any potential inhibitors (e.g. organic/inorganic components) present in the drinking water matrix on DNA extraction yield. We found that very low DNA content is likely to be the norm in chlorinated drinking water that gives hindsight to its limitation in providing robust results for any downstream molecular analyses for microbiome surveys. We advise that measurement of DNA yield is a necessary first step in chlorinated drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs) before conducting any downstream omics analyses such as amplicon sequencing to avoid inaccurate interpretations of results based on very low DNA content. This study expands a substantial source of bias in using DNA-based methods for low biomass samples typical in chlorinated DWDSs. Suggestions are provided for DNA-based research in drinking water with residual disinfectant."
https://openalex.org/W3174775404,"The emergence of blends of synthetic cannabinoids (SC) is an alarming public health concern in Jordan and worldwide. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perceptions of university students of SC. A cross-sectional study employing a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1,789 university students in Jordan. The questionnaire measured the knowledge and perceptions of students of SC. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to investigate the potential predictors of good knowledge of SC. Perceptions of students regarding SC use, prevalence and availability were investigated using principal component analysis. Self-reported familiarity with SC was high (92.5%), while good knowledge was only demonstrated by (33.6%) of students. Predictors of good knowledge included being a smoker (aOR = 1.369, 95% Cl = 11.041-1.871, p = .026), an alcohol user (aOR = 2.134, 95% CI = 1.362-3.346, p = .001), being informed by traditional media (aOR = 1.367, 95% CI = 11.113-1.679, p = .003), social media (aOR = 1.241, 95% CI = 1.161-1.403, p = .021) and self-familiarity with SC (aOR = 2.499, 95% CI = 1.518-4.114, p < .0001). Students perceived SC use to be prevalent and ethically unacceptable, for religious, social, and legal reasons. There were significant differences in the ethical perceptions against the use of SC detected by gender (p < .0001), smoking (p < .0001) or alcohol use (p = .001), and being informed by both traditional media (p-.001) and social media (p = .001), but there were no differences by the level of knowledge (p = .057). Those of good knowledge and those of low knowledge did not differ on their ethical perceptions of using SC. This study showed that there was a low level of knowledge regarding SC among university students in Jordan, which may play a role in the use of SC in the country. Herein, many opportunities exist for public health education to raise awareness against SC use."
https://openalex.org/W3174880925,"Recently, we reported that the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) heteromerize with α1A/B/D-adrenoceptors (ARs) and arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A) in recombinant systems and in rodent and human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs). In these studies, we observed that heteromerization between two receptor partners may depend on the presence and the expression levels of other partnering receptors. To test this hypothesis and to gain initial insight into the formation of these receptor heteromers in native cells, we utilized proximity ligation assays in hVSMCs to visualize receptor-receptor proximity and systematically studied how manipulation of the expression levels of individual protomers affect heteromerization patterns among other interacting receptor partners. We confirmed subtype-specific heteromerization between endogenously expressed α1A/B/D-ARs and detected that AVPR1A also heteromerizes with α1A/B/D-ARs. siRNA knockdown of CXCR4 and of ACKR3 resulted in a significant re-arrangement of the heteromerization patterns among α1-AR subtypes. Similarly, siRNA knockdown of AVPR1A significantly increased heteromerization signals for seven of the ten receptor pairs between CXCR4, ACKR3, and α1A/B/D-ARs. Our findings suggest plasticity of seven transmembrane helix (7TM) receptor heteromerization in native cells and could be explained by a supramolecular organization of these receptors within dynamic clusters in the plasma membrane. Because we previously observed that recombinant CXCR4, ACKR3, α1a-AR and AVPR1A form hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of 2-4 different protomers, which show signaling properties distinct from individual protomers, re-arrangements of receptor heteromerization patterns in native cells may contribute to the phenomenon of context-dependent GPCR signaling. Furthermore, these findings advise caution in the interpretation of functional consequences after 7TM receptor knockdown in experimental models. Alterations of the heteromerization patterns among other receptor partners may alter physiological and pathological responses, in particular in more complex systems, such as studies on the function of isolated organs or in in vivo experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3175392138,"Low performance of high school students and repeating a year are major problems in the education system. Low performance in the classroom generates negative emotions in young people and has been related to development of school burnout. The objective of this study was to analyze the repercussions of academic performance on burnout in high school students, and establish the role of emotional intelligence in this relationship. The sample was made up of 1287 high school students aged 14 to 18, who filled out questionnaires for evaluation of these variables. The results showed that youths who had failed a subject or had repeated a year showed more exhaustion and cynicism than their classmates with better performance and higher academic efficacy. A relationship was also found between school burnout and emotional intelligence in these adolescents, positive for self-efficacy and negative for cynicism and exhaustion. The model results showed that low academic performance affected burnout level, and that stress management and mood in emotional intelligence acted as a mediator in this relationship. In conclusion, development of emotional intelligence programs in the educational context is proposed as a measure for preventing burnout in the face of adverse high school academic events, such as failing or repeating a year."
https://openalex.org/W3176446395,"Human behavioral change around biosecurity in response to increased awareness of disease risks is a critical factor in modeling animal disease dynamics. Here, biosecurity is referred to as implementing control measures to decrease the chance of animal disease spreading. However, social dynamics are largely ignored in traditional livestock disease models. Not accounting for these dynamics may lead to substantial bias in the predicted epidemic trajectory. In this research, an agent-based model is developed by integrating the human decision-making process into epidemiological processes. We simulate human behavioral change on biosecurity practices following an increase in the regional disease incidence. We apply the model to beef cattle production systems in southwest Kansas, United States, to examine the impact of human behavior factors on a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The simulation results indicate that heterogeneity of individuals regarding risk attitudes significantly affects the epidemic dynamics, and human-behavior factors need to be considered for improved epidemic forecasting. With the same initial biosecurity status, increasing the percentage of risk-averse producers in the total population using a targeted strategy can more effectively reduce the number of infected producer locations and cattle losses compared to a random strategy. In addition, the reduction in epidemic size caused by the shifting of producers' risk attitudes towards risk-aversion is heavily dependent on the initial biosecurity level. A comprehensive investigation of the initial biosecurity status is recommended to inform risk communication strategy design."

This 2-year study employed RNA-sequencing technology to evaluate the pre- and post-vaccination muscle transcriptome of early-weaned Bos indicus-influenced beef calves born from dams offered different supplementation strategies from 57 ± 5 d prepartum until 17 ± 5 d postpartum. Seventy-two Brangus heifers (36 heifers/yr) were stratified by body weight and body condition score and assigned to bahiagrass pastures (3 heifers/pasture/yr). Treatments were randomly assigned to pastures and consisted of (i) no pre- or postpartum supplementation (NOSUP), (ii) pre- and postpartum supplementation of protein and energy using 7.2 kg of dry matter/heifer/wk of molasses + urea (MOL), or (iii) MOL fortified with 105 g/heifer/wk of methionine hydroxy analog (MOLMET). Calves were weaned on d 147 of the study. On d 154, 24 calves/yr (8 calves/treatment) were randomly selected and individually limit-fed a high-concentrate diet until d 201. Calves were vaccinated on d 160. Muscle biopsies were collected from the same calves (4 calves/treatment/day/yr) on d 154 (pre-vaccination) and 201 (post-vaccination) for gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing. Molasses maternal supplementation led to a downregulation of genes associated with muscle cell differentiation and development along with intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathway) compared to no maternal supplementation. Maternal fortification with methionine altered functional gene-sets involved in amino acid transport and metabolism and the one-carbon cycle. In addition, muscle transcriptome was impacted by vaccination with a total of 2,396 differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤ 0.05) on d 201 vs. d 154. Genes involved in cell cycle progression, extracellular matrix, and collagen formation were upregulated after vaccination. This study demonstrated that maternal supplementation of energy and protein, with or without, methionine has long-term implications on the muscle transcriptome of offspring and potentially influence postnatal muscle development."
https://openalex.org/W3177234486,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause of blindness. The pathophysiology involves activation of choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) to transmigrate the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) monolayer and form choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the neural retina. The multidomain GTPase binding protein, IQGAP1, binds active Rac1 and sustains activation of CECs, thereby enabling migration associated with vision-threatening CNV. IQGAP1 also binds the GTPase, Rap1, which when activated reduces Rac1 activation in CECs and CNV. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that active Rap1 binding to IQGAP1 is necessary and sufficient to reduce Rac1 activation in CECs, and CNV. We found that pharmacologic activation of Rap1 or adenoviral transduction of constitutively active Rap1a reduced VEGF-mediated Rac1 activation, migration, and tube formation in CECs. Following pharmacologic activation of Rap1, VEGF-mediated Rac1 activation was reduced in CECs transfected with an IQGAP1 construct that increased active Rap1-IQGAP1 binding but not in CECs transfected with an IQGAP1 construct lacking the Rap1 binding domain. Specific knockout of IQGAP1 in endothelial cells reduced laser-induced CNV and Rac1 activation in CNV lesions, but pharmacologic activation of Rap1 did not further reduce CNV compared to littermate controls. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that active Rap1 binding to the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is sufficient to interfere with active Rac1-mediated CEC activation and CNV formation."
https://openalex.org/W3173463914,"Factors such as increases in population, urbanization, growth in per capita income and changes in consumer taste and preferences are causing gradual increases in livestock product consumption and demand. South Africa is addressing this predicted increase in livestock products demand by commercializing smallholder livestock producers. The Limpopo Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) Nguni Cattle Development Project is an example of such effort. The economic performance of these efforts needs to be evaluated. We use gross margin analysis to evaluate the performance of the Limpopo IDC Nguni Cattle Development Project. Additionally, we use regression analysis to identify factors influencing gross margins. Our results indicate that although smallholders show potential to commercialize, they lack commercial farming experience and require that a strong extension support system be used as one of the strategies to improve profitability. We also noted that individual farmers were more profitable than group farmers. Multiple regression analysis shows that three variables could be used to stimulate gross margin among the Limpopo IDC Nguni Cattle Development Project farmers. These are herd size, distance to market and farm size. Since farm size is a given, policy should focus on assisting farmers to build their herds and to have better access to markets."

The Movement Oriented Games Based Assessment (MOGBA) is a delivery and assessment intervention designed to improve children’s complex movement skills, based on principles of motor development and assessment theories. MOGBA aims to improve children’s movement competence, physical fitness and self-perceptions (physical and game) and increase children’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). MOGBA is to be used in the ‘Made to Play’ initiative, involving 105 sports and activity programs across 21 countries, involving over 25 million children. A multi-site cluster randomized controlled trial will take place across three global sites (UK, Ireland and Australia). Each site will recruit eight primary schools (four experiment, four control) with each school providing two separate classes of children from age ranges 8–12 years (Site n = ~300, total n = 904). After baseline assessments, schools will be randomly allocated to an experimental or wait-list control group. Following two half-day workshops, trained facilitators will deliver the MOGBA intervention for 9 weeks. The main intervention components include delivery of 14 games-based activities with associated assessments of children’s movement and differentiation to meet children’s needs by manipulating space, effort and relationships. The primary outcome of the trial is to improve children’s’ movement competence (The Dragon Challenge), with secondary outcomes of improving children’s’ in-activity and leisure-time MVPA (5-day accelerometer), physical fitness (standing long jump and push ups) and self-perceptions (physical and game). Data will be analysed using multilevel modelling approaches. The MOGBA intervention has been designed to improve children’s movement competence and scalable interventions based on MOGBA could be applied across programs within the Made to Play initiative, globally.

In total, 88.1% of samples from Koreans with MM had clonal IGH and/or IGK rearrangement. Clonal rearrangement was not significantly associated with the bone marrow plasma cells as a proportion of all BM lymphoid cells. IGHV3-9 (11.63%) and IGHV4-31 (9.30%) were the most frequently reported IGHV genes and were more common in Koreans with MM than in Western counterparts. IGHD3-10 and IGHD3-3 (13.95% each) were the most frequent IGHD genes; IGHD3-3 was more common in Koreans with MM. No IGK rearrangement was particularly prevalent, but single IGKV-J rearrangements were less common in Koreans with kappa-restricted MM than in Western counterparts. IGKV4-1 was less frequent in Koreans regardless of light chain type. Otherwise, the usages of the IGH V, D, and J genes and of the IGK gene were like those observed in previous Western studies.NGS-based IGH/IGK clonality testing ought to be applicable to most Koreans with MM. The overrepresentation of IGHV3-9, IGHV4-31, and IGHD3-3 along with the underrepresentation of IGKV4-1 and the differences in IGK gene rearrangement types suggest the existence of ethnicity-specific variations in this disease."

Menarche (OR: 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14), if the participant was a prior patient at the GHESKIO clinics (OR: 2.17; 95% CI, 1.32-3.58), and participating in the school-based program (OR: 4.17; 95% CI, 2.14-8.12) were significantly associated with vaccination completion.Vaccination in school- and non-school-based settings was successful, suggesting that a nationwide HPV vaccination campaign using either approach would be successful using either approach."
https://openalex.org/W3176536392,"Lack of awareness about viral hepatitis (VH) potentially predisposes the healthcare workers (HCWs) to a higher risk of infection and may in turn increase the risk of transmission of the infection to their families and in the community. Thus, combating VH, requires adequate and updated training to the HCWs. With this objective, Project PRAKASH designed a meticulously planned training program, aimed to assess the effect of a one-day training on VH among in-service nurses.The content and schedule of scientific sessions of the training program were decided by subject experts to improve knowledge, attitude and practice(KAP) related to VH among in-service nurses. A 54-item questionnaire divided into four domains: Transmission and Risk Factors; Prevention; Treatment; Pathophysiology and Disease Progression were used to assess the KAP related to VH. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: demographic details, knowledge(30-items), attitude(12-items) and practice(12-itmes) with a total score of 30, 60 and 24 respectively in each section. The pre-post knowledge assessment was done and impact assessment survey was undertaken among the participants who completed six months post-training period. Paired-t-test was used to assess the effect of training on knowledge using SPSSv-22.A total of 5253 HCWs were trained through 32 one-day trainings, however data for 4474 HCWs was included in final pre-post knowledge analysis after removing the missing/incomplete data. Mean age of participants was 33.7±8.4 with median experience of 8(IQR: 3-13). Mean improvement in knowledge score was found to be significant (p<0.001) with mean knowledge score of 19.3±4.4 in pre-test and 25.7±3.9 in the post-test out of 30. Impact assessment survey suggested change in attitude and practice of HCWs.The one-day training programs helped the in-service nurses to enhance their knowledge related to viral hepatitis. The study provided a roadmap to combating viral hepatitis through health education among HCWs about viral hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W3177308118,"Twelve carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms catalyze carbon dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and acid protons and are responsible for many biological functions in human body. Despite their vital functions, they are also responsible for, or implicated in, numerous ailments and diseases such as glaucoma, high altitude sickness, and cancer. Because CA isoforms are highly homologous, clinical drugs designed to inhibit enzymatic activity of a particular isoform, can also bind to others with similar affinity causing toxic side effects. In this study, the affinities of twelve CA isoforms have been determined for nineteen clinically used drugs used to treat hypertension related diseases, i.e. thiazides, indapamide, and metolazone. Their affinities were determined using a fluorescent thermal shift assay. Stopped flow assay and isothermal titration calorimetry were also employed on a subset of compounds and proteins to confirm inhibition of CA enzymatic activity and verify the quantitative agreement between different assays. The findings of this study showed that pharmaceuticals could bind to human CA isoforms with variable affinities and inhibit their catalytic activity, even though the drug was intended to interact with a different (non-CA) protein target. Relatively minor structural changes of the compounds may cause significant changes in affinity and selectivity for a particular CA isoform."
https://openalex.org/W3177465428,"Supply chain integration plays an important role in the development of the vegetable industry in terms of vegetable quality, vegetable safety, and vegetable security in rural China. This paper explores how agricultural cooperatives integrate the vegetable supply chain by taking a trinity cooperative as an example in China. It explains the translation concatenation of supply chain integration for this cooperative by constructing actor networks in four development stages, including the seed stage, start-up stage, development stage, and mature stage. The findings show that supply chain integration in production cooperation, supply & sales cooperation, and credit cooperation is a useful trinity cooperative model of supply chain integration for investigating vegetable supply chain integration through internal integration and external integration. This paper suggests that cooperatives in the vegetable supply chain should facilitate close coordination among different shareholders and further improve the efficiency of supply chain integration. The government should provide training opportunities and funding to encourage cooperatives to participate in supply chain integration within the vegetable industry."
https://openalex.org/W3173785815,"Kinetic data obtained during gait can be used to clarify the biomechanical pathogenesis of osteoarthritis of the lower extremity. This study aimed to investigate the difference in ankle varus moment between the varus angulation and medial translation types of medial ankle osteoarthritis, and to identify the radiographic measurements associated with ankle varus moment.Twenty-four consecutive patients [mean age 65.8 (SD) 8.0 years; 9 men and 15 women] with medial ankle osteoarthritis were included. Fourteen and 10 patients had the varus angulation (tibiotalar tilt angle≥3 degrees) and medial translation (tibiotalar tilt angle<3 degrees) types, respectively. All patients underwent three-dimensional gait analysis, and the maximum varus moment of the ankle was recorded. Radiographic measurement included tibial plafond inclination, tibiotalar tilt angle, talar dome inclination, and lateral talo-first metatarsal angle. Comparison between the two types of medial ankle osteoarthritis and the relationship between the maximum ankle varus moment and radiographic measurements were analyzed.The mean tibial plafond inclination, tibiotalar tilt angle, talar dome inclination, lateral talo-first metatarsal angle, and maximum ankle varus moment were 6.4 degrees (SD 3.3 degrees), 5.0 degrees (SD 4.6 degrees), 11.4 degrees (SD 5.2 degrees), -6.5 degrees (SD 11.7 degrees), and 0.185 (SD 0.082) Nm/kg, respectively. The varus angulation type showed a greater maximum ankle varus moment than the medial translation type (p = .005). The lateral talo-first metatarsal angle was significantly associated with the maximum ankle varus moment (p = .041) in the multiple regression analysis.The varus angulation type of medial ankle osteoarthritis is considered to be more imbalanced biomechanically than the medial displacement type. The lateral talo-first metatarsal angle, being significantly associated with the ankle varus moment, should be considered for correction during motion-preserving surgeries for medial ankle osteoarthritis to restore the biomechanical balance of the ankle."
https://openalex.org/W3174127264,"A wide body of literature has demonstrated that the neural representation of healthy swallowing is mostly bilateral, with one hemisphere dominant over the other. While several studies have demonstrated the presence of laterality for swallowing related functions among young adults, the data on older adults are still growing. The purpose of this paper is to investigate potential changes in hemispheric dominance in healthy aging adults for swallowing related tasks using a behavioral dual-task paradigm. A modified dual-task paradigm was designed to investigate the potential reduction in hemispherical specialization for swallowing function. Eighty healthy right-handed participants in the study were divided into two groups [Group 1: young adults (18-40 years) and Group 2: older adults (65 and above)]. All the participants performed a timed water swallow test at baseline and with two interference conditions (silent word repetition, and facial recognition). The results of the study revealed the following 1) a statistically significant effect of age on swallow performance; 2) statistically significant effect of each of the interference tasks on two of the swallow measures (VPS and VPT) in younger adults; and 3) no significant effect of the interference tasks on the swallowing performance of older adults. These findings suggest that aging substantially affects swallowing in older individuals, and this potentially accompanies a reduction in the hemispheric specialization for swallowing related tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3174343339,"The emerald jewel wasp Ampulex compressa (Hymenoptera: Ampulicidae) is a solitary wasp that is widely known for its specialized hunting of cockroaches as larvae provision. Adult wasps mainly feed on pollen and nectar, while their larvae feed on the cockroachs’ body, first as ecto- and later as endoparsitoids. Little is known about the expression of digestive, detoxification and stress-response-related genes in the midgut of A . compressa , or about its transcriptional versatility between life stages. To identify gut-biased genes related to digestion, detoxification, and stress response, we explored the midgut transcriptome of lab-reared A . compressa , for both adults and larvae, by focusing on the top 100 significantly up- and down-regulated genes. From the top 100 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we identified 39 and 36 DEGs putatively related to digestion and detoxification in the adult wasps and larvae, respectively. The two carbohydrases alpha-glucosidase (containing an alpha-amylase domain) and glycosyl hydrolase family 31, as well as the two proteinases chymotrypsin and trypsin, revealed the highest gene diversity. We identified six significant DEGs related to detoxification, which comprise glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450s and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The gene expression levels that were significantly expressed in both life stages vary strongly between life stages, as found in genes encoding for chymotrypsin and trypsin or glycosyl hydrolases family 31. The number of genes related to alpha-glucosidase, glycosyl hydrolase family 31, and cytochrome P450s was found to be similar across nine reference hymenopteran species, except for the identified glycosyl hydrolase family 31 gene, which was absent in all reference bee species. Phylogenetic analyses of the latter candidate genes revealed that they cluster together with their homologous genes found in the reference hymenopteran species. These identified candidate genes provide a basis for future comparative genomic and proteomic studies on (ontogenetic) dietary transitions in Hymenoptera."
https://openalex.org/W3174431766,"Diagnostic imaging has significantly grown over the last thirty years as indispensable support for diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic and monitoring procedures of human diseases. This study explored the effects of low-dose X-ray medical diagnostics exposure on female fertility. To aim this, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) recovered from the ovaries of juvenile sheep and human ovaries were used as complementary models for in vitro studies. In the sheep model, the effects of low-dose X-rays on oocyte viability and developmental competence were evaluated. In human ovaries originated from two age group (21-25 and 33-36 years old) subjects with gender dysphoria, X-rays effects on tissue morphology, follicular density and expression of apoptosis-related (NOXA, PUMA, Bcl2, Bak, γH2AX) and cell cycle-related genes (p21 and ki67) were investigated. It was noted that in sheep, the minimum dose of 10 mGy did not influence most of examined parameters at oocyte and embryo levels, whereas 50 and 100 mGy X-ray exposure reduced oocyte bioenergetic/oxidative activity but without any visible effects on oocyte and embryo development. In addition, blastocyst bioenergetic/oxidative status was reduced with all used doses. Overall data on human ovaries showed that low-dose X-rays, similarly as in sheep, did not alter any of examined parameters. However, in women belonging to the 33-36 year group, significantly reduced follicular density was observed after exposure to 50 and 100 mGy, and increased NOXA and Bax expression after exposure at 50 mGy. In conclusion, used low-doses of X-ray exposure, which resemble doses used in medical diagnostics, produce weak damaging effects on female fertility with increased susceptibility in advanced age."
https://openalex.org/W3175116056,"Patients with haematologic malignancies are increasingly treated by oral anticancer medications, heightening the challenge of ensuring optimal adherence to treatment. However, except for chronic myelogenous leukaemia or acute lymphoid leukaemia, the extent of non-adherence has rarely been investigated in outpatient settings, particularly for migrant population. With growing numbers of migrants in Belgium, identifying potential differences in drug use is essential. Also, previous research regarding social determinants of health highlight important disparities for migrant population. Difficulties in communication between health caregivers and patients from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds has been underlined.Using a sequential mixed method design, the MADESIO protocol explores the adherence to oral anticancer medications in patients with haematological malignancies and among first and second generation migrants of varied origin. Conducted in the ambulatory setting, a first quantitative strand will measure adherence rates and associated risk factors in two sub-groups of patients with haematological malignancies (group A: first and second generation migrants and group B: non-migrants). The second qualitative strand of this study uses semi-structured interviews to address address the patients' subjective meanings and understand the statistical associations observed in the quantitative study (strand one). MADESIO aims to provide a first assessment of whether and why migrants constitute a population at risk concerning adherence to oral anticancer medications.Our protocol is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of adherence in a specific population. The methodological choices applied allow to explore adherence among patients from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. A particular emphasis has been paid to minimize the biases and increase the reliability of the data collected. Easily reproductible, the MADESIO design may help healthcare services to screen adherence to Oral anticancer medications and to guide providers in choosing the best strategies to address medication adherence of migrants or minority diverse population."
https://openalex.org/W3175288763,"Although current clinical guidelines recommend surgery or radiotherapy for non-bulky IB-IIA cervical cancer, clinical data supporting the curative role of radiotherapy in the early-stage disease are insufficient. We evaluated the prognostic implications of definitive radiotherapy and determined its optimal use in clinical practice.Patients with non-bulky (<4 cm) IB-IIA cervical cancer who underwent hysterectomy or primary radiotherapy between 1988 and 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Based on the use of brachytherapy and/or chemotherapy, the primary radiotherapy group was classified into three cohorts: hysterectomy vs. radiotherapy overall, with/without brachytherapy and/or chemotherapy (cohort A); radiotherapy and brachytherapy with/without chemotherapy (patients with external beam radiation alone were excluded, cohort B); radiotherapy with brachytherapy and chemotherapy (patients who did not receive chemotherapy were additionally excluded, cohort C). Disease-specific survival (DSS) after hysterectomy was compared to that after primary radiotherapy in each cohort.Among the 9,391 initially identified patients, 1,762, 1,244, and 750 patients were classified into cohorts A, B, and C, respectively, after propensity score matching. In cohort A, DSS after primary radiotherapy was inferior to that after hysterectomy (P = 0.001). In cohort B, a trend toward differential survival in favor of hysterectomy was observed with marginal significance (P = 0.061). However, in cohort C, DSS after primary radiotherapy was not significantly different to that after hysterectomy (P = 0.127). According to hazard rate function plots, patients receiving external beam radiation alone had an increased short-term risk of disease-specific mortality, whereas patients without evidence of chemotherapy had a distinct late risk surge at approximately 15 years of follow-up.Optimizing radiotherapy methods with brachytherapy and the use of chemotherapy should be considered for the long-term curative efficacy of primary radiotherapy for non-bulky IB-IIA cervical cancer. Further studies are warranted to corroborate our results."
https://openalex.org/W3175533985,"Background and aims The low-salt diet is considered important for control of ascites in cirrhotic patients. To validate whether the spot urine sodium (Na)/potassium (K) ratio could replace 24-h urine Na (uNa) excretion in assessing low-salt diet compliance. Methods We prospectively studied 175 patients. 24-h urine collection and spot urine collection were performed. Subsequently, 24-h uNa, urine creatinine (uCr), and spot urine Na and K were assessed. A complete urine collection was confirmed based on 24-h uCr excretion levels of 15mg/kg/day for men and 10mg/kg/day for women. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the feasibility of spot urine Na/K ratio in predicting 24-h uNa greater than 78mmol/day. Results Out of 175 patients, 24-h urine samples were completely collected in 57 patients only. Moreover, urine samples were not completely collected in 118 patients because their 24-h uCr excretion level was less than the established criteria. In complete urine collection group, AUROC curve for spot urine Na/K ratio in predicting 24-h uNa greater than 78mmol/day was 0.874±0.051 (P&lt;0.001). In the incomplete urine collection group, the AUROC was 0.832±0.039 (P&lt;0.001). In complete urine collection group, the classical cutoff value greater than 1.0 of spot urine Na/K ratio showed 90.9% sensitivity and 56.0% specificity. Conclusions The spot urine Na/K ratio reflects 24-h uNa, but the AUROC value obtained in this study is lower than that of a previous study. Considered the large number of patients with incomplete urine collection, validating 24-h complete urine collection criteria is necessary."
